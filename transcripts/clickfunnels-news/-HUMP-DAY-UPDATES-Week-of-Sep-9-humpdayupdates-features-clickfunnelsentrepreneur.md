ready to take your business to the next level? We got some new shiny features that are going to supercharge your follows and workflows, making them more efficient, customized, and let's be honest, way more profitable. And who doesn't like more cash in their pocket, right? Let's dive in. First up, sandbox test payments. You can now simulate payment processing in a sandbox environment. So like this, you don't have to worry about actual live transactions. Because who really wants to charge their grandma $50 for testing the checkout page? Normally, now you could test your payments setup stress-free, making sure everything is working perfectly before you go live. So like this, no surprises, only the good ones, like when you hear and you start making real-life sales. Next, we have question branching and the survey workflow builder. Because let's be honest, no one likes answering irrelevant questions like, what's your favorite color, bro? In the middle of a quiz. Come on. Now with question branching, your survey will adapt based on your respondents' answer. It's like choose your own adventure book, but instead of pirates, you get relevant data. So more relevant questions, more relevant answers. So get ready to watch those engagement rates soar higher than your uncle's story about the one who got away. Now let's talk affiliates, aka your secret agents for traffic and sales. Introducing the affiliate program for all workspaces. Every workspace now has the power to create its own affiliate program. That's right. Now your content can be promoted by others. When you sit back, have a latte, take a nap, take a shower, go on vacation, you got the point. So you're ready to boost your revenue? Let others do the heavy lifting for you. You'll be surprised how far your content can go when you unleash the power of affiliates. And last, but definitely not least, we have beta access to framework sharing, which is huge. It's like having a secret pass to a VIP launch, but instead of sharing dreams, you get to share your fancy frameworks. Whether it's themes, funnels, email templates, workflows, frameworks allow you to organize and share content like a pro. And now with beta access, you can publish these bad boys and get them in the hands of your customers and your team. So you're ready to be the hero of your workspace? Get that beta access and start sharing your genius with just a few clicks. So there you have it, four new features designed to streamline, customize, and supercharge your business. Whether you're playing around in the sandbox, crafting better surveys, unleashing affiliates, or simply organizing your frameworks, these tools are here to make your click-molds experience go from pretty good to wow, that's amazing. So what are you waiting for? Go ahead, try these new features and let us know what you think. In the meantime, happy finally. Oh, wait. And on a serious note, don't accidentally charge your grandma.
