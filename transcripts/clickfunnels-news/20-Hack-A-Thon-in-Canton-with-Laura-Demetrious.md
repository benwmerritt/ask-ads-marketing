## Transcript
Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We have an awesome episode for you guys today. We have a special guest and we have really awesome stuff to show you about ClickFunnels 2.0. We're going to give you the rundown of that. You might notice Ben is not in his usual spot. He drove three hours through Atlanta to get to the other ClickFunnels location to show you some really awesome stuff. We'll get into it right after we roll the intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey there everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We're so excited you guys are here. Here's the deal. If you guys are watching, what I need you to do is I need you to comment down below and tell us the one thing that you want ClickFunnels to do different than ever before. What is the one thing that you wanted? Do you want ClickFunnels 2.0 to have something from classic? Do you want? What do you want? What is it? If you had a wish list, what would that be? I'm going to tell you why here in just a minute. But first off, if you guys aren't getting the text messages, when we go live, if you guys aren't getting the email recaps, make sure to text FHTV to 208-231-3797 and go to funnelhacker.tv in order to sign up for all the emails. We only send one per week. It's just a recap of everything that happens for the week. So that way you are caught up every single Friday. So make sure that you are registered. Make sure you got all the details and let's get started. You ready Susan? Yes, let's do it. All right. So I woke up once again at the crack of dawn and drove all the way up to the Canton office. If you guys remember, there are two offices for ClickFunnels. The first one is in Boise and we get to see that one all the time. This is in Canton and I recorded all this today. So this is like beautiful film. Like this is where I'm at. And it's this is the office where Todd lives and all the devs come to do the work. So it says a very different vibe than the Boise office. You still get the excitement, but you have people who are creators and introverts at the same time. So it's a very interesting mix and it's really, really cool because of how much they are willing to change the world and how they want to be able to make that change and make your lives easier. And it's it's something that they live and breathe like that is a calling. And it's really cool to be able to see in person. They ClickFunnels flew out almost half of the dev team in order to be able to have a hackathon this week. So this week is hackathon week, which is why what I need you to do is make sure that you comment down below the one thing that you want. ClickFunnels 2.0 to do so that way we can support you better. I want to be able to hear your voice. This is your community and we absolutely love you guys. And there are some ridiculously cool updates that we just need to go over anyway. So Susan's got them all pulled up, so we're going to talk about them in a minute. Let me talk really quick about the devs. OK, so I brought all the devs in and it was really funny. I'm recording all the video for you guys and they're like shying away from the camera like what is he doing with his phone? Like it's very different than the voice office. You do that with voice. He never was like, oh, camera mode. Be stoic. Play on the computer. Like it's totally different and it's really cool to be around people who are like what the people who flew in are the dev leaders. So these are the product engineers. And there's different ways that software teams are built. Product engineers a little bit different than what we've even done in the past. And so we'll talk about that in a second. But we flew them all in and we talked about where we want to take click funnels. Like if there was a two year goal, three year goal, what would click funnels look like? What changes do we need to make and where do we need to go in order to make it look like that? And then other than that, it's just been fun. It's been all the leaders kind of coming together and saying, you know what? This is what we're trying to figure out in the editor. Well, this is where analytics is. And this is what we're building with our checkout processes. And this is where payment AI is. And it's all these different things smashed together where usually you're all slacking each other. Now they have the option to be able to come in and be able to work together. And it's just it's such a cool atmosphere. It's so cool to be here. Susan, we're going to have to fly you out for one of these. I would love to be there for one of those. I mean, I'm just watching the footage that you captured. I'm just like so excited for all of the ideas and things that are happening there right now. And I can't wait to see what comes of it. Well, they're playing with AI. They're playing with this whole bunch of stuff. So they actually I don't know if anybody knows this. Winter Jones has been hired on at ClickFunnels. He's helping with stuff. And so I got to hang out with Winter. We got to talk AI and have an absolutely great time. But he was like taking notes on the things that he wants to build. He's like, I'm trying to build this. I'm like, the team is building that right here. And so it's that's why hackathons exist. So number one, hackathons are for momentum. So if you're looking for momentum, you need that momentum. You want that momentum. Put together a hackathon, get a bunch of group of people together, open up a zoom and just work together, open up face time, whatever it is. Have that opportunity to work together to create that energy, to be able to create that mastermind effects that way you can all grow together. And those things that you are confused about, you can ask anyone in the group. Now, you don't have to wait for funnel hacking live to be in a hackathon. You can create these all yourself. So if you guys are looking for buddies in the comments might be a good place. So make sure that you guys are connecting. Make sure that we're doing that. The community, this is the place for that. ClickFunnels community is built to be able to have this place where entrepreneurs were trying to figure these things out. Help. And every we often like will highlight each of you. So if you guys are not in the group asking questions, make sure you do that, create those synergies and those opportunities. Create your hackathons because it is really cool. Now, I honestly, Susan, I can't tell you and I apologize. I can't tell you what was talked about in the meeting. Everyone was like, this is 100% confidential. And then they called me out. They're like, Ben, this is not to go on Facebook. I'm really sorry. 100% confidential. 100% confidential. I can't tell you, but what I can tell you is the future is looking ridiculously good. Everyone who's here loves ClickFunnels already. The path of where ClickFunnels is going, you're going to be so excited that you stuck on the boat. And that you were here when the waves came and you were here when the storms came and you were here on the peaceful times and the wonderful times and then the growth and you were here for what's coming. It's going to be the end. So awesome. It's so good. All right. So one of the people who is in charge of supporting the community, but is also here with the devs for an important team is somebody that you guys have seen. We've highlighted for multiple times. She does the user spotlights. If anybody knows her name, can you guys comment down below? If you go on YouTube, we have how many user spotlights? I want to say it's definitely over 10. I know there are 25 that are recorded. Like we have a whole bunch that's available for you. And these are people just like us. They're just funnel hackers. It's not somebody who is only people who wanted to come a club award. It's not people who've only done this or that. We have people going through the certification program. We have people who have agencies. We have people who are just getting started. These are stories from funnel hackers. And we've been capturing all of those and sharing them with you. And the person who's been doing that is here with us today. So I want to introduce her. Her name is Laura Demetrius. And she's right here. Hey guys, how's it going? Hi, Laura. I'm so glad you could join us today. Thanks for having me on this. I've been like excited about funnel hacker TV. And I've been doing a lot of things behind the scenes, but it's great to actually be here and be talking with both of you. So it's exciting. Susan, I don't think you guys have met yet. We need to have like a... Well, we did at Funnel Hacking Live. Actually, we have a story about that. That was last Funnel Hacking Live. Laura like interviewed me. I don't even know what ever happened. I know. Roll the tapes. No, I'm just kidding. No way. Yeah. That was pretty fun experience. Yeah. Well, I actually, I like saw out Susan and Andrea when I got to Funnel Hacking Live because we wanted to do some interviews with not just our deaf people to talk about 2.0, but the people that were actively using 2.0 to see success. And I was like, I need to talk to Susan. Andrea is amazing. She's awesome. Andrea and Susan do geek out, which if you haven't checked out, you should. There is so much. Yeah. That's really cool. Yes. I remember I saw you and Andrea, I think we were planning on going to the trip together and I got, I lost you guys. So I did not go and hang out with you guys. But this Funnel Hacking Live would be different. There's so much happening this Funnel Hacking Live, guys. And I'm not allowed to talk about anything because this is Russell's part again. I need to like put a zipper over your mouth. Almost leaking things. All right. So let's talk about Laura really quick. Laura, you've been doing the user spotlights. First off, why did that even come to mind? Like why is that something that wasn't important for you? Yeah. So I think a lot of what we had been doing with 2.0 is we were so focused on what was happening internally at 2.0 that it was almost getting too easy to just continually talk about ourselves and what we're doing. So we wanted to find a way to pivot that conversation and actually speak with our users and talk about how they're seeing success and what's working for them, what's not working for them. And part of that was when I spoke with Susan and Andrea and some other people at Funnel Hacking Live, that was kind of the turning point for me where I'm like, these conversations are so important with our users and we're getting so much insight about how they're feeling with their journeys. Like and why ClickFunnels is serving them and their communities in the best way. That I figured what better way than to have a series on YouTube that we could use to push out on multiple channels where we're highlighting some of our users who are just getting started or their affiliates of ClickFunnels and they're seeing a lot of success. They're running e-commerce businesses and they're, you know, they have physical products or they're coaches and experts. We have people all over, like in different industries that are in these user spotlights and highlighting them and talking about them and letting them kind of steal the spotlight is just really exciting because they have such amazing stories to tell. You know, it's cool watching some of them. Like some of them, I know some of them must have brought you almost to tears because they... Oh, they absolutely have. I'm horrible, right? I'll be that kid like so growing up, I was the kid that was watching movie and I would sit as close as possible to the movie screen because my siblings were all sitting around me and they were guessing when I was crying. Okay, I'm that guy. And so like, yeah, these are touching. They're powerful and they're motivating and it's just really, really cool. Yeah, if they're not making me cry, I definitely have gotten to many moments where I'm like, I can like show my goosebumps because the vulnerability that they're willing to share and their stories of just not even really realizing that they were entrepreneurs but maybe having a little bit of that entrepreneurial spirit inside of them and just going for it and following their dreams and within a year seeing so much wild success and being so open to talk about that journey. And a lot of what that is is being willing to talk about the failures. Like I think a lot of people go through a lot of failures to be where they are now. And like to me, like that's where the story is. That's so beautiful that they are willing to share that. That's what being an entrepreneur is. It's you. I think one of the... Go ahead, Susan. I was gonna say, I think one of the cool things about watching them is, yeah, they're really well done. They're like awesome job on them, Laura. Really great stories that are being told. But also like just as someone who watches them, if you guys haven't watched them, go watch them because it's like a lot of the times in this world you feel alone and like, the only one that's going through this thing. And if you go watch these videos and listen to their stories, you realize like, oh my gosh, there's so many people that are going through similar or identical or harder situations than I am. And it really helps put things in perspective. It also helps you not feel so alone in the journey of like, oh, there's somebody else like that, like me out there that's going through this too. And they did it. I can do it too, right? So I think it's really, really awesome to help with that too, that feeling of loneliness. Definitely. Yeah, thank you. And I feel so much of that. And I think them sharing those stories makes them feel a little bit more connected to the community in some way. And that's the goal. It's not like, we're not trying to choose like a very specific person. These are just funnel hikers. Yeah. They're just regular people. And it's not a crazy thing. All of us, I don't know how many, how much, that was in high school or I was in college. And there was a college who was trying to write a paper and he said, my teacher told me that I could find a story anywhere. Like I can find a story worth putting down on paper anywhere. And so he was going around campus and asking everyone stories. I don't think any of us realizes the stories that are available that we have, that we've lived through because it's just life. Yeah. But if you're paint that picture just right, and that's what you get to pull out of it. I feel incredibly blessed to be the one to yank those stories out of people and be the first to hear them and share them with everybody else. All right. So really quick, Laura's number one job is not user spotlights. Sorry guys. She does so much more. There's a reason she's in Canton. So correctly from wrong, it is the director of communications. Correct. Okay. That is the title. Okay. Yeah. So I am the communications director here at ClickFunnels. More than just doing the user spotlights, which I absolutely love to do. There's a few other things that I do. I manage a few different teams here at ClickFunnels, and we have a lot of fun doing it. But one of the big things that I get to do this week, if that's what you want me to talk about right now. Please, please. And the reason that I get to be here with the incredible, wildly intelligent product engineers that we have is to kind of hone in on the things that they're doing, get a better idea of the features that are going to be rolling out. So that I can help deliver those messages through multiple different channels. And although I can't say exactly what that is or when it will be, I can say that there are some really exciting things happening behind the scenes. And fortunately, I get to kind of play a role in how those messages get out. We're doing different things behind the scenes. We're doing, we've got Funnel Hacker TV. We've got user spotlights. We have pulse. We have all kinds of things happening. And what we're trying to do is find ways to better communicate with you guys in the community. We realized that kind of the missing piece there is we've got so many awesome things happening. How do we celebrate what's happening behind the scenes so that you guys can see that? And not only that you can see that and celebrate with us of the amazing things that are happening, each time there's a deploy or there's new things being pushed out in the product, but so that you can go back into your dashboard and start to access them and really start to make some magic happen. Yeah, so here's the deal. When we moved over from QuickFunnels Classic to 2.0, the naming convention of Classic and 2.0, Laura, when we started to do the pulse, getting the pulse, making sure it was working, making sure Russell had everything he needed, who was doing that all behind the scenes? Laura, Laura has been guiding this all the way through. And so her being here is almost a preview of what's to come. So what you're going to be hearing is in the past, Russell has been the voice in order to get out what is new with 2.0, how well it's working, why everything's spectacular. Now we have Funnel Hacker TV, where we get to talk about certain things every once in a while. Susan, if you guys missed it, she went and rebuilt the .com secrets funnel with you guys and showed you the basics how to do that. We want to do more of that. We want to give you more of what's new in 2.0 and show you how to use it a little bit better. So that way everyone feels like a funnel hacker. No one feels like they're stuck. If we can get you over that and get you feeling like you're part of the community, we've done our job. And so we're taking this step by step, and the next step is to literally... So the people that are here, there was a new position created just recently. Normally in software teams, you have all the software developers, we have a lead developer. And that person is the person who makes sure that all the code is right, that it's going through appropriately, kind of project management a little bit. But that was a project lead. We don't have project leads at ClickFalls. We got rid of that. And it is now the product engineers... Product engineers are leading their team... Yes, exactly. So it's a different title, and it comes with something different because they are meant to not only lead these areas almost as if they were the owners of that feature as if it was its own little mini company, but they also get to think about it from a marketing standpoint. Like why are we developing this feature? Why is it important? And there are liaisons to make sure that what they're developing actually gets to us, the users, and we actually know what's going on instead of trying to go into a forum and try to catch things and go, oh, that would be helpful. The connection point is Laura. And that's what's happening now. Yeah, get to have a lot of really cool conversations this week. So there's a lot that's happening. There's a lot of really cool stuff going on. And it's just going to be spectacular. Like, thank you. I'm so excited for all the updates. Everybody knows when we loved ClickFunnels Classic, ClickFunnels Classic was the bee's knees. When we moved to 2.0, we were so excited for the opportunity that 2.0 provided. And as we've moved through 2.0 in order and to use it and all these different things, we've needed education pieces. We need clarifying pieces, and then support all the way through in order to make sure that we understand all the transitions. This is about to take off. And it is going to be ridiculously cool. And I cannot wait to have you guys see what's happening. So number one, if you're not signed up for User Spotlights, get signed up for them. Go and make sure to check out the YouTube channel. Subscribe. Subscribe to the ClickFunnels YouTube channel. Make sure you get all of those. Put the notification bell on all that helps. So that way you make sure you get that notification when they come out. And look for good things to come. Yeah. Thank you for having me, guys. This was so much fun. Hopefully I'll get to do it again soon. Thanks, guys. Take care. Awesome. See you, Laura. All right. So really good. Let me go ahead and check out the comments really quick. Yeah, we've got Nathan and Andy and Sawa and Tyler. David. Yes. Tommy. Nice to see you. Wonderful family. Yes. What's up, Andy? You know. Danny Walsh. All right. So one thing that I want to talk about really quick is I really wanted to get Russell on a pulse this week, but Russell's kind of busy. I don't know if you recognize this. I actually want, if you guys are cool, you guys keep asking about Lynchpin stuff. And so Susan and I were thinking maybe next time we talk about how Russell is doing the Lynchpin with all of the launches that we've been able to see, she's been able to go into the office. I've been able to go into the office. For all the traveling we've done, all the things, maybe we just talk about what we've seen and maybe you can help apply that. So guys, if you can be down with that, let us know in the comments. Otherwise we can pivot. We can adjust the topics. Not a problem. If you don't want it, you won't get it. If you don't want it, that's okay. We'll get you. Yeah. So we want to do that next time. But this time, because Russell's busy, I figured we'd do something like a mini pulse because we're here with the engineers and I was going through everything that they've dropped and my jaw just hit the floor. There's so much cool stuff guys that are dropping and it's stuff that you have been asking for. And so if you've been asking for something in the comments, if you haven't yet, let us know what the number one thing is. I'm with the lead developers. They're looking for you to tell them what they want. So literally let us know. But why don't we go through that? That'd be cool. All right. Yeah. And you guys want some updates, some click funnels, 3.0 updates. There by the way, they're saying yes, yes, yes, for the linchpin thing. So I think we're going to have to actually do that now. It's going to be so much fun. Okay. All right. Where should we start? Should I share my screen or you have to share first? Go ahead and share your screen. The internet's been dropping here. It's been really weird. So why don't you do that? Let's talk first about click funnels 2.0. One of the powerhouse things that you can do is you can now create a blog. Well, does it actually work? Yes. Dan Kennedy has a blog. Russell has a blog on marketingsecrets.com. Blogs are working. They are full on spectacular. And we just upgraded it. And it's really cool. I'm totally not prepared to share the blog one. Okay. All right. Just a minute. Go ahead and try sharing yours. Because you want to have specific reasons why I've needed to share his screen. And I think it's well worth the try. Let me go to the marketing secrets. One of the things that is updated for the blog is, well, just all around just making it a lot easier to use. One of the things that they did was for the editing, editing of your theme pages. You don't have to do so many clicks to get to where you need to go and edit, which is really cool. I just love how they're streamlining things. So they're realizing, okay, we can make this a lot simpler, a lot more user friendly. And I see that happening throughout all of the account, not just the blog area, but everywhere. Like, oh, we can make this so much simpler. I'll work through. That was the discussion. I've improved recently. Yeah. Yeah. I was talking to everybody as we were going through this. And they were like, we built these powerhouse machines. Now it's simplifying it. So that way it's all easier to find. It's user friendly. Like, one of the things that they did is they just sat down and watched somebody try to build a funnel and a site from scratch. And we're like, oh my gosh, they like totally skipped this. Oh, they were looking for this. And it was extremely helpful. So you're seeing a lot of different changes happen. This is one that's really interesting. Once upon a time, when you wanted to edit a blog, a blog had settings. It had its own SEO. It's had all these other things. Everything was convoluted in its own little location. And it was complicated. But now this is the Marketing Secrets blog. So this is the VRE one. So let me go ahead and open this. If you'll notice, it opens a little bit different than it used to. So this is how it opens right now. Let's see. So this first way is the old way. This is the old way. So you see the UI here. It's all convoluted. Like, I can't see what the page looks like. I kind of can. I have to go to full context. And then I can see it living inside the page. So that's good. But where's all the pages' settings? Like, if I want to change the blog's name, if I want to change the SEO, if I want to do all that, it's gone. I have absolutely no control. Unless I come over here and I click on this little ipsy-bitsy icon that says Settings. Now I'm able to change all this. So what we've done is we've put all that into one single spot. So now all blogs, when you create one, is going to be in a pop-up module. So now when I click on New Blog Post, everything happens in a pop-up. It all happens visible. It's much easier. And it's just, it's so much simpler. All the settings are in the same spot. It's glorious. So super cool stuff with blog. Streamlining things, just making things easier. If you guys are blog-aholics, we went through the analytics and said, how are blogs working? Are they actually driving revenue? Are they SEO optimized? And the answer is yes. They're working spectacular for us. So you might want to think about doing it for yourself. But Funnel's 2.0 is working. And it is working very, very, very well. I really like the blog. Like, I've set up a few of them now. I'm like, oh, it's so much easier than other things that I've used. And it's fun because you can customize it so much and make it look any way that you want it to, which is like my favorite thing ever. But it's a blog using the ClickFunnels editor too. It's not a blog where you have this editor where you can't do anything in it and you have to understand CSS and all this fancy stuff. You can use it just as you. If you understand ClickFunnels editor, you understand the blog. Really easy. Really, really cool. Okay. All right. Go on to the next one. Yeah. What do you want to hit? All right. I have a few open here. And the first one is... I think a lot of people have been asking for this one. I just have... This is a template that I have opened, one of the many templates that you can find inside of ClickFunnels 2.0. I think this one's built up kind of like after the Funnel scripts. Yeah, seriously. It's like a funnel. So one of the things that is now available, and I'm going to go into the pop-up because that is where the form is at on this particular page, you can now add a checkbox input. And that is like, if you need somebody to agree to something before they hit submit, like terms of service or whatever, right? We now have that element in here. And there's a lot of cool settings that you can come change. A lot of different things that they've given us, like start it checked or not. And you can change the color of what it looks like when it's checked if you want to. A lot of awesome stuff in here. Is it required? Not required. So definitely come check this out. Look, we got icon style changes. Yeah. And then you just edit what it actually says right here as if it's just a text element, which is really awesome. You don't have to go into the settings to change it. So you just, I don't know what I'm typing. I can't see on my screen. There we go. I agree to terms. And then you can link it. Like if you're going to hyperlink your terms, you can do all of that in here too. So really, really easy to handle all of that. Really like how people- So for those of you in the euro zone, this is really, really important. This is how you make sure that you are GDPR compliant. Is allow, as you click, you have that checkbox that says, we will be emailing you to agree to those terms. Yes, no. That turns off the buttons. It is legally like holding like all those things that are important for just a checkbox. So it works and it's like viable. Like we can tell that they checked a box happens. It's not just, hey, we threw up a little element here. A lot of you saw it in ClickFunnels Classic. You wanted it in 2.0. It's here. Awesome. Okay. The next one are that there is now contact attributes. You want to talk through this one, Ben, and I'll click around? Yeah, I can show this one. Oh, okay. Awesome. So I was playing with it a little bit in one of my other accounts. And I was like, oh, cool. Like I haven't even like begun to think of all the ways I can use it. But I'm like, all right, I'm like typing in t-shirt size. And I'm like, okay, I'm going to start collecting all my customers t-shirt size. Just so I have it on hand. Right? Okay. So here's a way to do this. Let's imagine you have an agency or you have a business and you're trying to get leads. And you want to ask them more than just what's your name, your phone number, your email. You want to ask them questions. What is, when are you going to buy? What is your, or when are you looking to buy? What is your budget? What is the biggest question on your mind right now that if we could answer, would make you say, yes, this is the person that I need to work with. You can do all those different things. Now they are saved and you can find them easier. Okay. So let me give you an example. So this is, if you guys went and got funnels and templates, go funnelsandtemplates.com. For $1, you get a whole bunch of templates Russell bought the whole company. It's awesome. This is the agency funnel that's available there. And at the very bottom, if I remember right, no, oh, it's, where did they put it? It's a pop up. Oh yeah. So in the pop up. We may not be seeing the right screen here, Ben. Oh. Which might be a problem for you later, but you can decide that. We're seeing your contact stage. I wonder which one I was sharing. Okay, how about this? There we go. Perfect. Okay. So in your account, you have this. You can have this if you go to funnelsandtemplates.com. You can get this for just a dollar, including a whole bunch of other templates. New templates released every single month. Like multiple templates. It's crazy. So the way that this works is on your order form or on your form. Once again, this is in the pop up and your checkboxes and all this stuff don't have to be in a pop up, but they can be. Let me zoom in just a minute. Hide that. You see how I have your name and email. We save that information. You guys can see that in a profile. However, what if I wanted to know what their budget is? Well, then I create what's called the selection box. So let me show you really quick. I come over here. I say add element and we're going to scroll down and we get the select box. Okay. And when I click on the settings for the select box, I can state what I want it to be. Do I want it to be countries? Do I want it to be the States in the United States, the Canadian provinces, or do I want it to be something unique to me? I want it to be unique to me. And I give this a name. Now you have to give this a name in order for it to save. If you try to save the page without naming these, it won't work. If you already have a form available that you've built and it's not collecting data right now, go into it and just make sure that you have named all of your inputs. Okay. And so let's go ahead and name this. How many strawberries? There's cost strawberries. Okay. How many strawberries do you want? We're going to say one. Add another option. Two, I want three. I want five. And I want a gazillion. And spell. And I say, you know what? It is required. You have to tell me how many strawberries you want. Okay. Boom. That's available. Now when somebody actually comes in here and puts in their details, it is saved. I'll give you an example really quick. Let me go ahead and go to the link. There we go. Okay. So now when I say yes, I'm interested, I can answer all these questions. Let's do custom inputs as my name. I'm going to, I'm willing to spend $5,000 to $10,000 for a gazillion strawberries. And I can enter all my type because strawberries are awesome. And I can't spell. Okay. And I click on that. And it's going to save that to my account. So let me show you here really quick. This is really, really cool. This is where it becomes powerful. And I'm just going to share a different screen really quick because we just saw what happens when Ben uses multiple screens. All right. So I'm going to refresh my contacts. And there I am right there. And I'm going to say, you know, let's view all of the details. Let's just see all of it and boom, because strawberries are awesome and I can't spell $5,000 to $10,000 gazillion. Okay. You can see all the details now saved. And if you want to be able to control those, if you want to be able to not see them, if you want to see them, we've created a brand new menu spot in here. So you can come in here and say, you know what this field, I don't want to see this ever again. I don't want to see it in my customers profiles. I don't want to see it. We're just going to say it's old. I'm going to come in here and say, yes, I want to hide it and boom, I won't see that anymore. So if we go back to my contact details, it's gone. It hides it. So you can create custom inputs now. You can now see them in your account. So you don't have to put them inside of Zappier. You don't have to push them to a Google sheet. It acts like a CRM now. It's all saved inside of ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is not a fully functioning available CRM. We are in the process. However, we just made a really cool step and it's cool. You should be using it. So if you want those, you've been waiting on it, you need to use it. It's really, really cool. It's there. Very cool. Okay. The next one that I think we have up is there's some just improvements in reporting. I think specifically, I don't know if you guys have played around in the analytics and reporting area much, but that's where I'm at. So I'm in analytics reporting. And I think the update recently has to do with this monthly recurring revenue. Let me zoom in a bit so that's bigger to see. So down here, monthly recurring revenue. There's also those trials, by the way, but I think the update is around this one. And there's two options. And I was playing around with this this morning. Definitely check them both out because I think when you come into the date one, it's just kind of lumping all your products together across the board, across your account. What's the recurring revenue coming in? And you can search. There's different periods of time, custom range. You can even compare it to a different period, which is pretty cool. But the other option, let's see, we come back out here. The other option that lets you look at only like specific products. So if you come into the product one, I thought this was pretty awesome. You have it looks the same only you have the ability to select and deselect products. So if you want to know just about a specific product, how much revenue it's bringing in for you monthly, just choose the one, right? And then it'll just show you the one and then it will give you your total dollar amount in the period that you've selected. That's super awesome to see that we have that report in here. Because I actually honestly didn't even know about it until the update came out about it. It's really awesome to see as like if you guys have like a continuity program happening and you get more and more people into it, it's really cool to see like, oh, how much is coming in like last month. So I know what to expect this month. Very cool. Yeah. Anything else to say about that one? Really? Nope. Nothing to say on that one. Like there's we're just making things easier and easier and easier for you. Yeah. And that's that's just these two down here. Like go check out all the other reporting and analytics. Yeah. The other ones like there's so many guys we have. So we've simplified tagging. So if you want to tag your contact now, you can literally just click on that contact, scroll down and start typing in the tag and add it easy. We've created product variations easier so that way you can create variations inside of your products. We've made email deliverability for those of you who are in click almost click phones classic. Do you remember how it would say like only the people who are actually active the last 30 days, you can now do that in 2.0 and you can adjust it in order to make sure that it's the exact parameters you want. We've got a cancellation trigger. So now if people cancel, they like, do you have this one open? Keep talking. I'll click. Okay. All right. So now when somebody tries to cancel, you can instead message them and have a conversation. So they've canceled. That's fine. How do you continue to serve them? Can you offer them a different product? Can you make sure that their service was well? Can you make sure that all of their stuff is taken away? So all you do is you add in this little piece. And when you do that, it automatically will do it and you can add in your product. So it's product specific. You can add in your funnel. So it's funnel specific. Or you can keep it all empty and it will, no matter what, anytime anyone subscribes from anything, you can have written conversations that happen. What happens in email? What are the automations that should be fired? And are there opportunities to sell them or support them in other ways? There's so much money to be lost. And no is simply a no at this moment to this one thing. And it's not a statement that, you know what? I'm done with you. It's not one thing. It's just the one, which means you should definitely show them the rest and support them and do it in a way that is supportive of their journey. And you can do that. It works. We have a working in ClickFunnels and we have it in the, like we have it working for us. Now it's available for you. Well, are you muted? I am muted. Thank you. I get the wrong crazy over here. Okay. So do you guys see when you were setting this up, there's the subscription cancellation reason. And so you can have things, like this is the trigger. So you can have your trigger be specific to the reason that they are cancelling, the reason that they are telling you. So there's a bunch of different options in here, plus an other. So you could have a trigger set up for every single one of these that takes them to a, through a very specific sequence of emails and events. Which is awesome because it's going to be very catered to their specific need. Yeah, absolutely. All right. A couple of questions that people got. Warren Hales asked the question, when I hid that custom field, did it hide it in the actual funnel? It does not. All it did was hide the fields for me. So for example, if this is a business that you've been running for the last several years, it's working, and you're like, you know what, I want to pivot. I want to change. I don't want to offer this anymore. And you realize that funnels have been running for forever. You've been wanting to kill it for a while. Because you've got other ones that are working better. And you don't want to see every time somebody answered a question for one of those. That's when you would use that setting. It's not killing it in the funnel side. It's killing it on the background side. So that way, when you look at that customer's details, they're looking at what's relevant to your business today, not what was relevant five years ago. So that's the goal of that one. Cool. Awesome. Yeah, I'm looking through the comments too. Is there anything else? Yeah. I have a problem to activate payment AI. So payments that are activation, if there is a problem, reach out to their support. And if you don't get an answer, reach out one more time. Okay. It's okay. Let them know because there's a process there. I was actually just talking to them today about simplification and processes that are able to do that. So they're in the process of making it easier and easier and easier. Make sure to let them know. I mean, Susan, you were having this, like you were having a payments AI issue, you reached out to support. Yeah. And honestly, they were so good about letting me know what the issue was. And we got it fixed within a day, really easy. Usually it comes down to, if you're new, if you're just setting your payments AI account up, it usually comes down to they need a little bit more documentation to verify your business and your accounts and stuff. So that's usually what it is. And they're really quick. So reach out to them for sure. They're on it. All right. All right, my friends. There are so many more updates, by the way. If you were not looking at all the updates, you should. You still have QuickFunnels pulled up for chance, Susan. I do. All right. Can you pull that up really quick? If not, I can do it. What am I pulling up? Just the home screen. Oh, the home screen of ClickFunnels? No, sorry. Dashboard. Gotcha. Okay. I was preparing to pull up Pulse. Ready to pull it all up. You guys can go check out updates there. Yep. Absolutely. Everything is. So, okay. Yeah, we go to clickfunnels.com. Slash Pulse and you can get all the updates there. But an easier way in the top right hand corner, there are three icons and the one to the left right there. Yep. That one is all of the announcements. And so if you want to see the announcements, an easy way, log into ClickFunnels, have them forbid. As you're using it, just go and see all the updates there. We've started doing that as of last week. And so it's all available for you. Cool. And then you can click the see all changes down here to see even more. These are like the most recent three right here. There we go. Very cool. Awesome. All right. Anything else? Let's say guys. Yes. Let us know if you want to hear anything else. If you have specific things you want for ClickFunnels, let us know. Susan. Okay. There is a ton of people in the comments saying, yeah, they want to have us talk about Lynchpin, what Russell's been doing behind the scenes with his other businesses with Lynchpin. So we'll definitely bring that to you guys coming up. We also have really exciting things coming up regarding funnel hacking live. So make sure that you are subscribed to the notifications either via text, text FHTV to 208-231-3797, or go to funnelhacker.tv and get signed up for the email notifications there. One thing I've noticed about going to funnelhacker.tv is if it looks like it's not taking you to the new site, sometimes it takes me to the old site. You can just go to funnelhackertv.com, and you'll make sure that you'll get to the right spot there. So just a little perk I've noticed. All right, you guys. Thank you so much for joining us. If you jumped in late, make sure you watch this whole thing over again because we have Laura Demetria on with us talking about awesome things. And we'll see you guys next week. Bye. See ya. My name is Russell Brunson, and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started, and we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services, and things that we know change people's lives. But because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets, because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you that what we are doing is impossible to get us happy every single day. And it's happened through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you, who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers, and these are our stories.
