Thank you so much for being with me, Daniel. Welcome to the show. Thank you. I'm really excited to be here. So to get started, can you tell us a little bit about your background and how you got started in this? Yeah. Well, I've actually always been an entrepreneur. I'm one of those weird people that's never really actually had a real job. I worked at a cinema when I was a teenager, but I was already making and sending computers at the time and had other entrepreneurial things I was doing. The only time I had a job because I needed a job was in my mid-20s when I was kind of clawing my way back after my second big loss in building a business. I worked in a cool senator for a few months just to pay the bills while I built my business stuff and then I was off and away. So I've always been an entrepreneur, but this particular business that I'm in now with the personal development and sharing pretty much the journey that I went through to form people that in creating a abundant life off the back of those lessons, I've been doing since 2018 and it's more of a very much a mission and purpose-driven business with me. Very cool. I'm glad that you've been an entrepreneur forever. Did it run in your family? How did you get involved in it? To be honest, just the idea of somebody telling me what to do just never really sat well with me. I didn't even finish my degree because my parents said I was supposed to do it. I only did a year of my university degree. And also, I really always wanted to be rich. I was like, I always knew I was going to be a millionaire. I was going to be well-fitted and successful. And so I didn't really see that happening working at a job. And so I just went off into the dip by myself and I was doing little projects and stuff like that. I was the kid that had the car washing service and stuff like that. Whenever we go away for holidays, I look for things I could bring back and sell for profit. So I was always on it. I was always that kid. Yeah, creating your own path. So what led you to ClickFunnels? So ClickFunnels, I remember the first time I heard Russell do a presentation. It was, I want to say the first year that I was running this particular business. And I'd never heard his name before. And it's really funny how you can never hear somebody's name after that. You just hear the name all the time. And he was talking about offer stacking. And I remember in the podcast interview, he was speaking about how offer stacking made all of the difference. And he was talking about, I was like, well, this guy is able to touch all. And I love the fact that with every single time I heard him after that, it was never about how much money he's made. Even though we know he's very successful because ClickFunnels does really well. He's always talking about helping entrepreneurs. He's always talking about adding value. He's always talking about improving the world. He's always talking about making a difference. And these are key values that I hold as well. So I really, really resonated with that message and then started to fiddle around with the ClickFunnels platform, realized that I'm not really technical, found somebody to help me. And since then, we've really, really built most of our stock on that. We moved all of our online programs onto the ClickFunnels platform. Which is such a cool place. And then we've had the top package forever. And so even the educational materials available on Funnel Flicks have been really great. We still use them to this day with our team. So it just became this ecosystem that I came immersed in. I was doing the Funnel Fridays every week, even though I was never doing them myself. I was like, guys, look at this stuff that Russell was talking about this week. And we got it. And we found our vein over the last couple of years, really found the place where we're really able to serve and obviously got the two-comma-cobra award. We qualified for it at the beginning of last year, but you guys took like nine months to order our business and make sure that we weren't, you know, lying without making that much money or whatever. So, yeah, it really did make a difference having that really firm structure to support us in being able to serve people and go out there and focus on doing that. Really cool. And you talked about how you qualified for the two-comma-cobra award, which is incredible. Can you tell us a little bit more about the Funnels that you use in your business? So we use an application funnel. So one of the things, so one of the principles I teach is something called money DNA and how it's really important to understand where your flow exists. So a lot of people would look at the plethora of different funnel opportunities available and keep dipping and trying different ones and then think that funnels don't work when actually if you understand where your natural groove is and where your natural flow is, you can focus on that one. You can do your A-B split testing. You can make sure that you've got the right messaging, make sure you're in the right market and then focus on that one. And so for us, it was really the fact that I like to bother us on a small group of people that I can have big impact with for the main. And then I use the revenue from that in order to generate more content and stuff. So I love having my podcast. We don't really have many calls to action on the podcast. There's very gentle ones, but it's not really there to sell. It's there to serve. I blog very, very regularly. I write for entrepreneurs and other magazines really much at the moment. We've taken a bit of hiatus on the social media content because we're restructuring a few things. But that, again, it's not really for me to generate leads. It's just for me to be able to serve. And even the documentary has spent a lot of money putting together a documentary that's nearly ready to release. But focusing on the higher ticket items with an application funnel and then using other forms of the funnels to generate leads through the rest of the other content, which is really just about getting people on the email and so we can serve them, is what we've done. But the main thing that we use is the application funnel to get people into space where we can have the opportunity to serve them through a higher ticket offer. Very cool. I'm interested in more and learning a little bit more about how you got involved in the self development or the personal development and coaching. So what was it that put you on the trajectory of wanting to create impact for other people? Again, I was just one of those weird people. Like when I was like 16, I was ordering tapes from like Nightingale, Conant and like reading Think and Grow Rich. I read Psycho-Cybernetics when I was like 18 years old. Like Joe Carbo's Easy Way to Riches, Stuart Goldsmith's Midas Method, the master key system I started being at 19. So I was a teenager. Like I probably could have told too much about what I was going to say. Suffice to say, I wasn't talking to girls and drinking when I was a teenager. You were an anomaly. Yeah. I was, I was, I wasn't partying and talking to girls until early 20s. Before that time, I was really just focused on entrepreneurship. And so personal development was a big part of that because with personal development, that actually gave me the frameworks I was able to use to be, be an entrepreneur. And even when I went through rough times, which everyone who's been an entrepreneur will go through and just happen that I had the very young because I had my entrepreneurship very young, it was personal development that actually supported me being able to navigate those waters and to deal with the ebbs and flows of business, which all of us are going to have. Yeah. Well, what types of goals do you have now? I mean, you've, you've made the two common club award. You're seeing success in business. You're doing all the things that you love to do. Where do you see this 10, 15, 20 years from now? Well, personally, for my personal time and energy, I'm actually focused on becoming a full-time philanthropist over the next three to five years. That's my personal goal. In terms of the business and how we're serving, we want to serve enough people to have got to the 10X Award with one of the particular offers that we're working with right now. The numbers work as we're going right now. We're on the right track for it. And then I really want to focus on using film to communicate my message to people because I think that's a differentiator. Yeah, you can, you can get a book. You can sell 10,000 copies of the book or whatever and have a best-selling book. Everyone's got a podcast. Now, I started podcasting in 2018 before with Sexy and Fancy and now everybody's got a podcast. So I think for the differentiation, definitely film because it's not cheap. Yeah. Film projects are not cheap and they're paying you the butt as well to do. But I really enjoyed the process of doing that. So I want to do more with that. But yeah, full-time philanthropy and then sharing my work through film is what I really, really, really, really, really am excited about doing in the years to come. Yeah. I really do think that is such a huge key differentiator too because not many people go that route. You can have the same impact and last just as long and create your legacy. But with film, you're reaching, I think, a whole different segment of people that maybe don't read or do audiobooks or learn that way. They're visual learners and they like to actually see the story come to life. I find that really fascinating. I personally know people in my own family that feel that way. They're like, you know, I wish it was on film. I wish I could watch it. I wish I could feel immersed in the story and I think it's really, well, that route and of course it's expensive and there's a lot of production involved. But I think it's really beautiful when you can share so much visually. Yeah. And the cool thing is, like, so this first film that we've, so I spent a couple of years being mentored by a guy called Nick Nanton. He's got like 33 Emmy Awards. I invested in this film studio and get to like take part in that. I got part, was a part of producing Chris Voss's, the documentary they did about Chris Voss. I was an executive producer on that project. But like my own film that we've started off with, I've got like a tenured neuroscientist. I've got a medical biochemist. I've got one of the scientists that work on the MRI machine and we've scientifically interrogated the concept of manifestation. Now I could have written a book about it, but being able to have this real time interlaced dialogue going through this discussion and having experts on film that you can see what they say, you can feel the passion of what they say because they will ask these questions on the spot. I think it just adds a new dimension to being able to communicate a message also rather than just words on a page. Yeah, really cool. Awesome. While I look forward to seeing that when it comes out, I would love to check it out. Do you have any advice for people who are maybe they are that 18, 19 year old stage and they're kind of feeling maybe they're a little bit different. They want to be an entrepreneur. They want to be wealthy. They want to start their own thing. What would you tell them? One of the things, so I made a must-to-mortly winning powerful choose by the age of 23. And one of the key things for me that led to those bombs in the road, which were good for me because they've led me to be the person I am today. I'm not denouncing it. I'm grateful for the experience. However, it's very nice and you can learn from somebody else's experience rather than having to go through it yourself. And that's my key point that don't try and go it alone. Right now, we've got internet. You have the ability to connect with people all over the world. You've got so many thought leaders, leaders in business and titans in business that you can learn from through their podcasts, through their YouTube channels, through their book, through documentaries about them. And then you can form networks and groups to people on the same journey as you. And then you can get mentorship. You can get a coach. You can get someone to guide you on the journey. Trying to do it on your own is not the way. Get into community, get into collaboration, get into partnership and allow yourself to be helped and supported on the way. I think that's great advice. And so many entrepreneurs, I think, feel loneliness in so many different parts of the journey. Like they do feel like, so I think connecting, finding community and seeking help. People talk about who and how, making sure that you have the right people on your team. I think that's really, really powerful. So thank you for sharing that. Sorry, before I forget, I just want to tell you a dub tail on the back of that because in the process of collaborating and speaking to other people, sometimes we get into this thing where we want to pretend that everything's working all the time and that we're all on top of our game and that we're not having issues. And sometimes I think whether it's shame, guilt or embarrassment, we don't want to share the problems that we're going through. But I can tell you now from personal experience of being an entrepreneur for more than 20 years, nobody has it right all the time. Nobody's having a good time all the time. Everybody's having challenges at some point in the journey. And the more that you're honest with yourself and the people who can actually help you, the more help you can get. Sorry, I just wanted to add that. Oh, I love that. And I'm sure that's very helpful for people to understand and to be able to be vulnerable and sharing that story because everybody knows that everybody goes through failures, whether they're big or small. And to be honest about that, I don't think we would be able to be successful without getting through some pretty big failures. So I do think that that's very important.
