We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before we are funnel hackers And these are our stories My name is Ben moot and this is Susan Latterson We're so excited to have you guys this is the first time we're doing it in this kind of a race So what we're doing is we are creating funnel hacker TV now as a show And we're so excited to be able to be here and we're gonna we're actually in the inner circle So doing the inner circle event right now and we got to sit in So if you hear the clad the clanking and the clattering it's all right like it's just the way it's gonna go But we wanted to show you behind the scenes kind of give you kind of that feel so I don't know I've been in the funnel hacker community for years like it's 2016 2015 And so I've always wanted the behind the scenes look that's what this is So we're excited to have you so Yes, go ahead. Okay. Oh, what do we start? We're here at inner circle and Russell was teaching the room all this morning About lynchpin and I know there might be a lot of you that don't know what lynchpin is It's okay because you're gonna hear a lot about it Yeah This is the lynchpin is the way if you guys weren't at funnel hacking live like it is the process We're changing everything that's done at quick funnels in order to go towards that that that is the Process there's no other option. This is the only way and everything we're doing it's Steve Larson and wrote the intro for the Lynch pin book that Russell gave out you got it at mastermind and paradise did I got it So I was two weeks ago. I was at mastermind and paradise and we got handed these books They're like there might be errors in it because it's like not even like the final copy of it And I was like kicking out on it. I'm like, oh my gosh all the visuals all the things and it was awesome But actually the first time that I heard about lynchpin was last year at funnel hacking live And it like blew my mind. I like went on there onto my profile on my social media And I was like Russell just shared like the blueprint for every business ever and That's what we've been learning ever since then. It's just awesome. It really has and so in the book Steve Stephen Larson does this little intro where he talks about how this is like the framework for the value ladder This is how you structure your value ladder like this is the process step by step to make a perfect business This is what made quick funnels from a 10 million dollar year business to 100 million dollar year business. This is what exploded. So Because we're in her circle. What is Russell going to talk about? So he actually talks about it He talks about everywhere he goes now. It doesn't matter what room you're in Everyone needs a refresher like even even the super crazy ones need the refreshers like they don't understand Well, like I so I was at Nasser Ryan in Paradise like I said and the first thing that Russell said when he came out was Okay, it's been brought to my attention that like nobody knows what lynchpin is even though I've been talking about it for like a year or two years probably for that group and He's like, how many of you know lynchpin and like two people raised their hand and He's like, all right. Well, we're going back to basics It's good thing that this whole event is about lynchpin and then what's coming up for funnel hacking live this year Is also all about lynchpin like the thing that you need to know funnel hacking live is going to be great this year So so we're here. So we want to give you kind of some of the behind the scenes of what's happening here in in the room because this is the place where if you are and if you are in the inner circle inner circle for life for What are the other ones category and Atlas you're in the three categories? This is the home. This is where you come in order to meet in order to share what's working And so we wanted to give kind of behind the scenes look if you're cool with that like this is this is fun So first off everybody got thinking grow rich Subtitle on the book is for men and women who resent poverty Which is cool. They got a whole bunch of swag. It's absolutely fun But Russell started talking about a very specific part of the value ladder And that was the attractive character flyable something entirely new He has never taught this before he created the graphic and he sent it out He like boxed it to everybody beforehand before he went live everybody got a box I should like what is this and just teasing out that this could be really really cool. Yeah, um, so one of the things that That lynchpin that focuses on is it basically is creating a framework to place onto the value ladder, right? And um, there's this part on it that is like basically how do you get people into your lynchpin? How do you get people into it and that was the piece that he the attractive character fly? Well, that's what he talked about today and it's just awesome. Can't wait for everyone to learn more about it at fHL We took so many notes. Uh, she got at least three pages of notes. I have I have one page I went to I was a category kings previous. So we'll talk about that. There's so many different things going on And uh, why don't you go ahead and talk about uh, Russell came on he talked about how the framework works But then he brought on to the stage Eric so Eric yeah, Eric zane if you guys don't know who Eric zane is he just like He's a he's a filmographer. He's a videographer and he does amazing work But he he was at mastermind in paradise and then he again spoke uh here at inner circle And he talks about how to use shorts. So like like shorts form content. So not just shorts, but reels The other ones are escaping me but all the short were video content and he has this framework He basically figured out how to how to create a framework on content And I just love it. It's he says that short form content is the fastest way to be growing your audience It was it was ridiculously cool how amazing he weaved in what ross so he he went live for a year doing all this and found that The framework that works Was actually a framework that's topped by ross and he just condensed it down to a 60 second version and it kills And so he shares that he shared the framework he shared and all that like so mastermind in paradise he shared the same thing But then then this time he went through and like shared the exact systems Like this is the step you need to do and your team's going to do the following. We'll use these tools it was Mind-blowing how deep that was and so he came on and spoke and then rossel came and talked about three 100 for a bit And then branched it over to oh my gosh neo So this guy's named neo davis is spectacular He came on he was speaking at category kings this last week and i'm sitting down taking notes for you guys like all the cool crazy inside stuff and You have a time limit when you're in the circle you're only allowed to talk to a certain point of time Everybody wanted to keep hearing him talk the same thing happened here. This is uh, I wrote this down. This is really cool I want to grab my notes and bring it a little closer So this is how to create an entourage An entourage With three 100 espionage like this is people are grabbing real estate during times of recession This is how you grab virtual real estate today because as he said in today's presentation traffic is not going to get cheaper So now is the time to make the place and so it's really cool to be in the room with the hustlers We're making a place like these are the driven These are the people like rossel talked about a funnel hacking live. You may have watched the youtube video When rossel goes live at funnel hacking live, there's always the beginning part of the funnel hacking live presentation That's live for everybody to watch and uh, that's on youtube. You can go check that out, but it is It's the driven versus the drifter and it's all about those people who are driven who have the calling And uh, what they're willing to do and how they make it happen no matter what And that was so cool to be able to see the room stating Tell me the next play boss, you know, they're waiting for the coach to say the next play And they're all going to run it like this is the plays that are running We have the lynchpin which is the way you've got all these different parts of the attractive character flywheel That are becoming the way people are going to get traffic. So if you're not in the room Yeah, you're missing out. Hopefully we can give you something that helps out but more so it's This is watch what they're doing start funnel hacking what everybody's doing in the room because oh so good So, yeah, one of the one of the things that you mentioned neo One of the things that I love so this is kind of my big takeaway from the morning is That so the attractive character flywheel, right? It's focusing on traffic how to get people into your lynchpin how to get them in and The theme of today and even the theme for a mastermind of paradise has all been like How can you I don't know if this is like what Russell intends, but I think it is Uh Moving more towards like organic Russell even said today like let's cut out the middle man, right? And so Dream 100 is one of those traffic strategies that we know From Russell and we love it and neo puts his his stuff that he taught today Put a system to dream 100. It was and it was it was awesome. It was a killer system It went across podcasting and went across Uh facebook pages and groups it went across instagram everything This is how you become how did you put it this is how you become One of the top five leaders in your niche in the next 90 days It was the coolest presentation. It's just everyone was like keep talking keep talking anymore time. It's so good um and like There's so many things that stood out already and this is just the morning session So they're going to be doing an evening session with a speaker that they announced that i'm really excited. I'll talk to you about it Well, let's talk about it later. Um, we'll do another one of these if you guys like it And so what we're doing is uh, we're gonna have the speaker there and oh, what was that idea? I take copious notes. I got to try to remember. Oh In the world is changing right now. Um Eric said something really powerful. He said that Influence is the new currency And I love that idea a lot of us are like, well, I don't know and so Some of us as business owners want you to make sure that all the lights are green before you go That makes sense up here But it doesn't really make sense when you get the wheels on the ground where you're you're not moving your vehicle You're stuck And so how do you actually move forward even when you're not sure what's going to happen? Influence is the currency your influence and the amount of influence you're able to create the amount of attention You're able to create is the currency that you're going to be able to rely on in the future. That was Oh my gosh, and it's so true. I think I think we all know that uh one of the things that he said was um You know what happens if you went and shut your ads off like it on purpose So Dr. Bird doesn't shut you down, but you you just need to shut your ads off or he does shut you down. Um Like what's gonna happen then and It's just awesome. Yeah, the whole frame. I love the direction that everything is going right now and Like all the pieces that I've been learning personally over the last four years that I've been an official funnel hacker Um, all the pieces are are coming to place and it's so fun to watch Russell We're at like find them and he's putting them into his own businesses And he's learning like the attractive character flywheel that he presented today Like he just he said he was in his room at mastermind in paradise like Making all the details of it and just brainstorming it and like that was created Two weeks ago and he presented it here today. I was trying to ask I wanted to get like image assets and things like that So I was trying to talk to the staff and they're like we can't talk to you right now Like why like Russell said we have to watch this This is our training as much as it is for everyone else in the room So watch the moves that everybody's making because it's really really cool. What were your biggest? What were your biggest takeaways from today so far? I mean, we've got hours left So much. Yeah. Well, I kind of hit on it already My biggest takeaway is just this this move of of basically shoring up your business And I think that's kind of a theme ever since Lynch pin was presented for the first time for me anyway that like You don't have a business without continuity, right? That's part of the lynch pin and I think that we're moving in the direction of of this like Traffic focus too of like you don't have a business. I'm not this is not something Russell has said But it's almost like this theme of like you don't have a real business if you don't have like the ability to shut something off and have something Still continue running and it's like shoring everything up, right? We're preparing for whatever may come It's going to still last and succeed and be able to move forward That is a really cool way. It's everything Russell's discovering he shares So to be able to see that and be able to take that is absolutely cool. He ended the The presentation before everyone went into their breakout rooms We're not everyone's able to take the stage for a little while talk about what's amazing to them And what they're learning and give their asks He said one statement and I loved it so much. I wanted to talk about it because this is true for all of us People in the room were spectacular It is so cool to be here and he said this and it kind of hit me in a place And I wonder if it's going to be important for you too. He said we're all in business cycles Um, and if you're in a low point in your business cycle, there's no shame In being there. That's why we have the room So be open share allow everyone to be able to pull you up That's the power of a mastermind and it's so so so cool.

Bye My name is Russell brunson and i'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started and we don't even have goals to go public either In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite You see we have products and services and things that we know Changed people's lives because we're fighting against the big brands people with literally unlimited budgets We have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible if you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks? They will tell you to what we are doing is impossible to get us happy every single day And it's happened through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking It's not really something that I can explain to you It's something I have to show you these stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you So if a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories
