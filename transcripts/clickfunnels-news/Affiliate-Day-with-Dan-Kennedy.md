Welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We're gonna get started in three, two, one. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey there everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. My name is Ben Moots. Susan Lundersen is in here with us today. She'll be here on Thursday but we have an amazing special guest here with us. Do you know her name? If you guys know who she is, comment down below. You should know. Like if you guys have been through any of the One Funnel Away challenges or seen anything that Russell's been doing, Russell loves. And I love him too. Okay, so comment down below if you know who she is. We have a really cool topic. We're at ClickFunnels HQ. It is Affiliate Day with Dan today and Dan Kennedy is in the office. He got in yesterday. We got a lot of people in yesterday. We went out for dinner. It was fun. A whole bunch of affiliates and so we're gonna be talking about that plus there's a lot going on. Like HQ is constantly busy with events right now. I want to make sure that you're not missing anything because there's just there's so much. So much. Russell's crazy. Like he's always doing like a million different things. I don't know how he keeps it straight but he does. So we're gonna go ahead and give you a rundown on all that plus there's a couple people in the community we like to highlight. So let's get started. First off and foremost I'd like to introduce you to Rachel Miller. Hi. I appreciate you coming on. So Rachel Miller guys if you do not know she's been in the community for a long time. She's a long time funnel hacker. She's won a two comic club award and she has a community that absolutely adores her and adores the movement that she has created and there's so much cool stuff. So really quick how did you get into the community? Like what was the how did I get into funnel hacking? Yeah why funnel hacking? I remember I had built a blog and I'd had an audience and I wanted to begin selling to their audience and I didn't know how to make a sale. I didn't know how to ask for a sale and it was extremely painful extremely awkward and I think it was because I was focusing so much on myself and my worry about what would people think about me what if I sold and nobody liked it what if like all of these what ifs but my what ifs were all about me and using Russell's scripts allowed me to not think about myself and if I was going to fail or if I was going to botch it but instead think about my audience and how can I make a bigger impact in their lives because I know that if I can make a bigger impact in their lives then they can go out and make a bigger impact in the world and so what I loved about funnel hacking is it gave me the script that I could then follow so I got the attention off of me and brought people through a process and that process was just fail proof and I did not realize at the time I thought it was selling to like make some money I thought it was selling to like um to sell a program of course a gigit or whizmo gizmo right yeah you know what I mean um but what it actually ended up being was a chance for me to make make make an impact in their lives because the people who paid more paid attention more which meant I was able to make a bigger impact in their lives than I could have for all my millions of people who are watching my content and not like bringing out their wallets so once I realized that when they brought out their wallets they're an action taker if they're an action taker they're going to take action in my program but more than that they're now going to take action in the world and I can inspire them to to make a difference in the world then like the light bulb came on and I realized lifetime customer value and I realized like the importance of a funnel but most importantly I realized the importance of a ripple effect and how each and every one of us we're called to that ripple effect we're not called to make an impact just to our little circle we're made for more and um yeah it was really cool to experience that so when did you when your first two comic book award when was that oh I don't know it was a couple years ago yeah and her business has not stopped guys just because the they're not piling up does not mean she's business continues and you are you're playing with a whole bunch of things right oh yeah we're playing with so much fun if you're not following they're following is there's such a cool dynamic of what you're doing and it's all community-based so we're going to talk about that a little bit as we get going into this but thank you for being on thank you Ben I appreciate it and you're here because it's affiliate week yes or affiliate day with Dan yes and it was one of the bonuses yeah when you promoted was it your first funnel challenge is that what we were um do you remember what it was no I don't remember I don't remember the name of what it was that I promoted I think it was click funnels 2.0 it was what funnels 2.0 was being launched to the world okay and um we had built what we call the mother of all funnels so it's like the one funnel that when you turn that one funnel on you can like copy it and use it all the places so we use that same funnel format for like webinars for we do it for what we call SLOs um sexy little offers I got the name from Emily Jeffords um sexy little offers and I was like so we we sell sexy little offers that then lead into our membership program and that one funnel is like the mother of all funnels because you can switch out a SLO for one product for another product so basically it's like a lead machine that pays for itself and then also drives people into um your high ticket or higher ticket we don't have anything high ticket higher ticket product and so I told everybody they could have my mother of all funnels and um that's what sold our everybody came in I know it was really a blessing I mean I I did not expect to be in the top 10 to be completely honest I was just expecting to show up if you're not catching a couple of just affiliate tips here it's not about selling the product it's about what you throw into it so there's there's a whole bunch of things there I'm not I'm right here to coach on that but Dan Kennedy was yes and so guys if you missed it um Dan Kennedy was here in the office this morning and he went live with Russell uh if you let's go ahead and throw that first video up because it is so cool so they started talking about all these other things and Dan Kennedy gave a history of everything you know if you did not watch it it's in a Facebook group and you may not be in it but it's free for everybody if you want to be an affiliate for click funnels all you have to do is go to let's see I believe it's click funnels 2.0 affiliate and so that's the go to search bar in Facebook click funnels 2.0 affiliate community and you'll be able to join that it's a different group than the affiliate Avengers group this is only for people who are promoting click funnels 2.0 this is the kind of the cream of the crop best of the best and we went live there and it was Dan Kennedy they went live for like 90 minutes it was a long life long live I was shocked that they were they're like you know we're pushing it's community and that was like just the start of the gold he's been dropping gold all day all day yeah so he's been so uh so first off they talked yeah and then uh Russell actually brought out a book so Russell was in the back in the back office and he grabbed a book he's like I'm gonna hide this like he doesn't know I'm gonna show this and he went and found a it was a network marketing book that Dan Kennedy had wrote a long time ago he's like I found this and he shows it to Dan and Dan's like oh no where did you dig that up you can buy anything these days and so they highlighted the book and showed that is and they just kept talking back and forth on tons of topics oh it's it's been ridiculous and so far what you're able to watch is just a training between Russell and then we did a little bit of Q&A with Dan afterwards just a little bit and then it cut off and the rest of the day has just been Q&A it's been crazy been awesome oh it's been so good and it's cool because you've got people who have software who have questions people who are selling in webinars and Dan Kennedy's been selling webinars style since 1975 he wrote the script on how to do this the OG style and he was talking about ways that you can reuse that script afterwards it's oh my gosh so much good stuff so if you guys did not watch the video go to the community yeah okay and it's the once again it's the ClickFunnels 2.0 affiliate community go search for that it's 90 minutes and it's ridiculously good don't miss it yeah so um we did that and then just as a quick recap for you guys uh Rachel's here for affiliate day it's just one of the events that we're doing this like they're doing this entire time Russell's putting on a ridiculous amount of events we had Mastermind and Paradise down in Mexico after that we had uh we had Lady Boss come in Lady Boss was on the stage she's so fun oh my gosh and they recorded like multiple stuff it was crazy and for the Lady Boss they they recorded like at five o'clock in the afternoon because that's their time for their their character attractive character dream clients and so it was like a full day of prep and then it was an evening of explosions um it was ridiculously good after that we had the inner circle category king for the people who were in the second tier of inner circle um and that was a group Russell sat down he listened to everybody everybody came on stage and presented then after that we had the inner circle which was the introduction funnel hacking live tv funnel hacker tv and we did oh that was so cool so um and Russell spoke there and we began to see kind of the beginnings of what's going to be happening at funnel hacking live which is really cool but there are still events happening so we have this event here we're going to have an event over the next couple of days you're not going to be here for that are you are you headed out i am i've got a lot of kids at home so it can't be gone very long did you have a couple of kids it do just a few just a few i have six ah see i have seven dogs so i win no so um so you're gonna head home uh we're going to be doing the recap with Susan here on thursday so guys you're gonna want to watch the recap on thursday we're gonna be talking about everything that's happening with Dan Kennedy for the rest of the week because it's crazy and then there's another event that's happening so water cooler moment things that are happening if you guys have not seen this link yet for something that pager on rustler doing together there is a challenge of challenges going on and i would highly recommend looking out for it look out for email links in your email from rustle from affiliates if you're not an affiliate become an affiliate there's some crazy stuff pager is going to be sharing how he builds out his challenges and it is a it's happening in a couple of weeks you do not want to miss it you run challenges i do you do i do okay so everyone's got their different ideas about how to run a challenge what's the most important things to you with the challenge um get your audience a result almost as fast as you possibly can so for us whenever we run our challenge i've run our challenge it's 10 days long and it's called 100 perfect people and how to get 100 people into your audience um with no ad spend or anything um it was only 10 minutes a day and i have it where i say it's going to take the audience 10 days and i give them a task to do every single day however i know that if they did three days worth of the work they would get the results so for you what result can you get to for someone in like one third of the time and then extend that by three times the amount so like that's why we do 10 days and the reason for that is everyone's going to not be there the entire time so within one third if they just do one third of the effort they'll get the promise and make sure your promise is extremely specific so like it's got to be smart s s is specific m measurable a attainable r they say relatable by like like keeping it real like a real number have we gotten people 4 000 people in their audience in 10 days yes we have but that's not realistic realistic is 100 so you got to keep it real and then in timetable so 10 days with 10 minutes a day that's a timetable that they can say either i put in 10 minutes a day or i don't put in 10 minutes today but the secret sauce is i tell my audience it's 10 minutes for 10 days but i tell my team we have to be able to give them these results in one third of the time that we're asking them to be able to do it that's going to create such reciprocity um that's was my goal yes yes because they get they get that and then you're like you just keep delivering there's there gonna trust you when they can get the actual result that you promised they're gonna trust you and they can't not get the results if they just do one third of the work so for example in the in the your first funnel challenge russle has people build a funnel on day one yeah and day two you're fixing that funnel making sure all the things are set up and day three it's live it's out for everybody and he's like now it's time to make it live i didn't i hadn't thought of this and the reason being is they get the result within three days so especially um you so whatever it is you want to make sure you're giving as much results in three days and then it's everything else is just repeat until everyone that's participating has had three days of time with you now your main goal like you teach audience stuff i teach how to grow an audience and so on autopilot and so you do that that's the main piece that's working right now community is key to that entire yes and you have a different view on community than most people do most people like i just need to gather the people who are gonna follow me and enjoy this like you have a different angle and so we were talking about it last night yeah and it was i see my community not as okay if you see someone as a transaction then that's gonna come across in the way you interact with them in the way you you work with them if every single person's a transaction you're going to be putting them into different buckets and i think of myself whenever i started in the funnel hacking world i was a mom with six kids i barely made ends meet my husband's job was not like it was a struggle for us to to make it with the six kids i was homeschooling at the time um if i had put myself into the bucket i would not have put myself into the highly valuable bucket and if every person's a transaction you're going to naturally start putting them oh this person's this bucket this person's in this bucket if you're not transactional in your stead how much impact can i bring to this person's life well then you're going to be looking for everyone who's meets your criteria and you're also going to be open to the lowest common denominator the lowest person in the bunch because you know that if you can impact their life and bring them up you can impact everyone's life and so for me i care more about that person who i was and i was at the bottom of the barrel i was not the attractive customer i was not the one that everyone's like oh we got we got the mama six kids to give us a hundred bucks for our program however their program made a difference in my life and i kind of want to pay that forward in the world and so when you think of your community as how can i reach out to that person make an impact even if they never give me a dime because i know if they're my perfect person they probably know three other perfect people and they know three other perfect people and before you know it your reach grows and your perfect people do find you your perfect buyers do find you and your lifetime customer value does go up because you've brought them up are you guys catching all this like i did not expect Rachel to be like a shower and gold this entire thing this is spectacular yeah and i know that's opposite what i know most people teach which is like look for the highest paying customer go high ticket but for me i love love going to the masses i'm just stuck thinking now if you like i just go dump down i'm like wow huh but in the masses you still want to look for your perfect people yeah so like i'm not trying to attract every guy i tend to market just a woman i don't try to attract like all different types of products i tend to focus on one type of person so i can focus on one type of person and still keep it to everyone that's in that vertical so i'm going to look for moms who are working on a side hustle and growing their own businesses i can work on that vertical but i'm going to work on all levels of that vertical the beginner and the person who's more advanced so a couple of you guys have been posting the community we see you we just wanted to highlight you really quick uh yeah the first one that we want to highlight uh down here we've been seeing Rajiv we saw your come your post and the community saw it they upvoted it and wanted to be able to highlight you you got your car so you came across the country you were not native to Canada you couldn't get a loan in order to get a car you use your business to do that a lot of times the question is not as a business owner and a funnel hacker how do you i it's it's it's more about being resourceful yeah then it is about how to get a car yes and he did it using clickfunnels like how freaking awesome you are spectacular thank you we just everybody saw everyone upvoted i just wanted to be able to highlight because you are spectacular also we got a lot of people that are just dropping constant value and so one of you guys is Pratush Pratush thank you so much this is a split test that Pratush shared and in this split test you're able to see what's working for them really well on opt-in forms and so they took off all the required asterisks and they just put down which of these pieces are optional and it massively increased and they're like this is what we do all the time now so split test see what's going on the community thank everybody post things the more you guys post the more we're able to highlight you just wanted to say thank you guys so much for being a part of this giving tree yeah it's part of one of the reasons why we wanted to build out funnel hacker tv was to kind of shed light on the community again and be able to share the people that we absolutely love and have them maybe come back on uh to be able to be able to uh highlight you guys and be able to show you guys what's happening in the background because it is madness there's a lot of crazy stuff going on if you guys are not funnel hackers uh become one start to funnel hack start going through all the events start seeing what we're doing and start watching because these are mastermind events so before funnel hacker tv started i'm gonna have a confession i did not have facebook on my phone oh it was really nice for a couple years um i would work on facebook when i was on my computer and it was work related entirely now that it's on my phone i've seen so many ads uh that are just for me that i've clicked on probably 40 plus funnels and they're all saved and so if you guys are seeing your cost per lead go up or down you're welcome um i am having an absolute blast going through your guys's funnels funnel hack go through see what's working and uh be a part of the community share and we love having you guys here so everybody thanks for being on uh we got dan kennedy coming again for the rest of the day and then he's coming for the for the next couple days so we're gonna be sharing more of that on thursday thanks for being here let us know what questions you guys have if there's something you want us to talk about here let us know in the comments below rachel thanks for being here thank you ben have a great day guys see you guys my name is russell brunson and i'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before we don't rely on cash for venture capitalists to get started and we don't even have goals to go public either in fact our motivation is the exact opposite you see we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives because we're fighting against the big brands people with literally unlimited budgets we have to do things differently we have to do things smarter we don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money we have to be profitable from day number one so how do we do that how is that even possible if you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks they will tell you that what we are doing is impossible yet it's happening every single day and it's happened through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking it's not only something that i can explain to you it's something i have to show you these stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you they have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way i use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality yes we are funnel hackers and these are our stories
