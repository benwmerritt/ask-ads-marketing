Hey guys I'm back I'm good thanks Chris how are you today? I'm doing awesome hey I'm super excited today to introduce Rudy Moore and I'm gonna set this I'm gonna set the record straight okay because it's not Maurer everybody thinks it's Maurer MAWER but it's more it's pronounced more so Rudy Moore is a TV host he's an actor and a famous business influencer and celebrity marketer known for his eye-catching red brand the guys have seen this the red life

welcome it's good to be here and thanks for getting the name right it's funny because the whole play was more and then more capital right so it kind of more capital like more money you want more money when I tell people they go oh that makes so much sense now I'm like yeah and I'm actually I think I'm changing my name we're joking about it but kind of serious to this summer I think I'm gonna change it to Rudy red and like I was gonna guess that Rudy red which brings up my whole next point it's like I know for every holiday and especially like Christmas you will decorate the entire office and I was like okay is this kind of the Valentine's Day but I know you and so I know it's not you have this branding that is the red life and I lead into it this way like I don't remember the movie like man on the moon this was all about Andy Kaufman like and Jim Carrey played this character and you know what he did he made all the cast and everybody call him Andy all the time like this guy went into character and he stayed in character so like if you're working and you're doing your videos you are still this big red personality but if we go out like you and I we went to dinner with a bunch of guys after Grant Cardone sitting by the way if you go to dinner with Rudy ever he will order everything on the menu this guy ordered I think five boats of like well charcuterie boats or something like that but here's my point like I laugh about it no matter what he's doing where he's at this guy is on brand and this is such a big personal brand you call it the red life talk to us about the idea behind this whole like persona and branding yeah sure well a couple of things are important there firstly one of the biggest lessons I actually got working with some of the biggest celebrities in the world and characters you know some WWE wrestlers and some you know pro athletes and even a list is I kind of explain it like eventually the suit merges with the person like the Spider-Man suit right Spider-Man becomes Spider-Man eventually and that's what I've noticed with all these famous people and so I kind of took that and ran with it and you know I've always looked at as I was building my own personal brand because I used to be a little more behind the scenes with an agency and everything and then I grew my personal brand I always go how everyone has everyone that's really successful like tens of millions of dollars or 100 mil plus has a thing right so like grant has his 10x Tony has his massive events and walking on fire and Russell has his funnel hackers right so it's like what what is you know what is that thing and everyone used to love our red branding and like it's very polarizing stood out we made millions of dollars from like this literal backdrop to have one video that we spent millions on with this backdrop King's throne even before the throne it didn't even have the red but but like everyone was like our sales team would literally say oh someone just joined our 25k program they didn't know who you were they just loved your branding and could tell you knew what you you were doing right and luckily I think I do know what I'm doing but like you could be a total scam too right and just like break this hire an interior designer and start selling so it's kind of made me have this life will affect around the brand and going all in and everything I've ever done in my life I played to an extreme which is often healthy and then often unhealthy you win with that characteristic but that's who I am so I just went all in and here I am we have this red life and yeah every inch red and the offices are red and the cars are red and staff were red and the hair's red and I might change my name and yeah I love that you applied that to your business but I'm curious like in and I remember seeing you at funnel hacking live briefly I'm a lot of us on staff are running all over the place but I specifically remember the red and it was like people knew that that was Rudy give you wear in the red how would you like would you say that personal branding is important to all entrepreneurs or anyone's like trying to start a business like how important would you say that it is I think it's almost everything these days because even if you don't want to be an influencer your brand like your physical brand if you sell products or whatever right like everyone buys into brands these days and that's only gonna get more aggressive as influencers grow and the world of influencers like the Kardashians and people really kick that off 10 years ago and look at them they feel billion dollar brands behind it now so yeah I think I think and I teach this a lot I go five years ago if you had good copyright in a good funnel a good offer you could be a nobody sit behind a computer run ads get the CPA right the AOV LTB and make millions of dollars it's got harder every single year and less and less people can do that now and even though I would say I'm one of the best of the work in the world at that that's hard to do now just creating faceless offers with good products you know and good promises now people want to buy into brands they want to buy into people so yeah I don't think you have to go as extreme as me but you definitely need people want to buy into communities tribes your message your story and your values and what's the best way to get like get started with that because you mentioned people who like maybe they feel like they're a nobody or like they have a great funnel and great copy and they're actually starting to see success how should somebody start focusing on their personal brand if they've done if they haven't even thought about it before yeah a lot of people hire me for that well they join our programs and a big part of it is that now and I never you know used to consider myself like a branding expert but now people tag me all the time and say I'm like one of the best because I just do it for myself right and I you know never really thought about or position myself that way but true to me it's just like where we start with clients when we work with them and where I would recommend you start is like what do you stand for right because you don't have to like make stuff up it's I think people should just play into who they are right yeah unless they're a boring person then maybe they're a little bit up but yeah you got to feel like everyone wants to resonate with some people right so someone might want to resonate with yeah I make millions of dollars and I have no followers and I sit at home and I don't do any videos right because there's other people out there that want to make millions of dollars and not wear red and be crazy and outrageous like I am so I think it really just starts there's someone for everyone so figure out what do you stand for and then this is what separates the 1% that do this well and 99% that fail once you've figured it out you've got to play it to an extreme and go all in you look at anyone that's successful in branding and like creating that figure for themselves they've like gone all in right they've not just like dabbled with it here and there it's like I teach it's like the Donald Trump effect you have to say make America great like a million times and then it becomes a thing right so how can you just you know always play into it I think there's something to this though like when you go and you create this persona this is Russell Brunson 101 right this is dot com secrets is expert secrets this is creating that attractive character yeah but with a magnet what attracts also can polarize under it has to yeah it has to and this and how do you then say to somebody like alright because you're gonna be polarizing you will have people come to you and they'll be drawn to you stronger but then you're also gonna push away a lot of people how do you deal with somebody who's like hey you know I am so worried about being liked and they go create this persona and maybe somebody just hates red how do you handle that like how do you handle somebody who's drawn to you but then maybe other people are completely opposed how does somebody handle it well I think it's a little easier for people like me and Russell and everyone because you generally get that when you become successful anyway so it was right so it's like before I even created the red brand people wouldn't like when I would post my revenue or what I was doing or my life or my cars or out on the beach in Florida right like so you kind of you know and I came from the fitness industry where everyone it like you always get a bunch of trolls you know so even when I'm in great shape way better shape than I am now people say oh you're not you're not even that muscular right whereas in a spree I would look like a fitness model so I've been over time on the internet if you make anything big or successful you get those people so part of it is just accepting it getting used to it and then I think you reach a level right maybe a level of insanity that we have now but where I actually like it makes me laugh you know like so now it's like I actually you know I actually enjoy reading them it's just funny but part of that you know part of it you can't teach which is being confident in who you are and yourself and being fulfilled and true to like you know when I even like we have a hundred employees and you know a few times a couple of times you hear someone or quit and say you're a shitty leader you're a shitty person right but it doesn't get to you because eventually you become so like fulfilled and true to yourself and understanding of yourself and I think that's a key skill everyone should really work on in life that isn't that common these days so I think it starts with you becoming you know good with who you are and confident in your own body and yourself and then understanding it's also part of the game and maybe flipping it on its head so it's not a negative thing it's actually hey this is a part of success and it's a good now I actually have haters before I had nobody so it's better to date us too because it means I've got eight us because they ain't us yeah look yeah I mean part of it's being you know good with who you are and understanding the more successful you'll get that's gonna happen no matter what right and understanding that actually wait maybe I'm doing something right now because I'm creating you know look at Andrew Tate right look at Donald Trump look at Kardashians right every single one of all these people it is there's even very few celebrities that are loved by everyone right there are a few like which really don't have many haters like but this but even a lot of celebrities they are people that love them and people that hate them yeah and people are always gonna find something right I mean even if it's they don't actually hate you it's you have something that they don't have so they're gonna get something anyway yeah well on and I think it's super calculated too I think you know if somebody first off like at TNC or whatever right or you're at a funnel hacking live and they see this peacock walking around right which is Rudy like everybody's fall and you're doing this so intentional like people could be like oh who was this guy he thinks he saw it stuff but that's not what it is yeah imagine that for a normal place like the streets on my out in the air like God knows like you know like if you could see whatever you know there's like a movie where you can see everyone's thoughts right like this one has this like skill or whatever imagine if I could walk for an airport and see like a speech bubble with everyone's four as I walk through my bread you know my red stuff with like my camera guy and a couple of staff I mean half the people are probably being in this I mean half the people are like who's this celebrity or rapper that we don't know and they're trying to figure out who it is generally and half of them are like one idiot right it's like a hide of those two it's funny Chris always talks about how I'm gonna go tactical and I always plan to go tactical but then we have these conversations and it brings up all these other things that I want to ask and you mentioned confidence and like being true to yourself and that's like the best part of building your own personal brand how did you find that was it something that you had to work on was it over time was it working in fitness like because clearly you're very confident who you are and people can sense that and it's I don't think it's just a you know a peacocking thing like Chris had mentioned before it's actually this is who you are as a brand you're confident doing it I'm sure a lot of people are like some other people that don't hate on it are probably like man I wish I had that level of confidence yeah sadly I don't have like a bunch of like takeaway tits from that because I always I was an only child my parents were elite athletes and I always grew up being very different and I always I remember even getting into like a teenager and in college I was always kind of loud and different and I always I like literally liked being different and I always said that was a good thing and I said it I would hate like I hate to be normal and then as I got into my early 20s I said you know I would always still embrace that like of course I'm different who the hell wants to be normal and like everyone else most people I came from England in a small town where everyone's miserable so I'm like why the hell would I want to be like everyone else they're all miserable do that same job in the same house for 40 years in a relationship that suboptimal with the probably unfit going into the bars every weekend and that's their life like so I came from this like place where in my head because I was a little special and unique saying that's the exact opposite I don't want to like I definitely don't want to be normal right so I've kind of almost frived off being different and like so to me when someone says I'm weird or different it's like yeah thank you I am that's good that's good I'm glad you noticed right if you don't have that confidence intrinsically growing up like yeah I think that's just you know it takes time and work and I you know I wouldn't sound like this mindset guru that can teach you all the tricks that I though there's people out there that that's literally their fun alright and their job it's like you know doing teaching you all these things and I think I think my biggest tip is just like learning not to worry what other people think about you right I learned that as a young age and it's a true my whole life and that's one of the most empowering I mean personal development skills you can have if you call it that that will stay with you yeah oh for sure and a great thing to learn at a young age like stepping into your power of loving and knowing exactly who you are I think everybody would love that yeah this this branding that you have and this larger-than-life persona and this attractive character has that helped you land some of these celebrity deals because you know gosh I mean you and I text back and forth or whatever and I I've set you like a belt with these different celebrities names on and whatever like but how are you landing those deals like this is something where people are like oh my gosh I would love to work with some of these personalities that more capitals work with that Rudy's worked with how are you landing these deals and does that branding tie into it sure yeah I mean the branding helps for sure especially now because you've got to remember every celebrity or ultra successful person they're very much like me and they're very unique a character standout like you know Floyd Mayweather's a great example right like he walks around you know I spent time when you walks around with 20 people six cars yeah you know so you don't do that if you're not like this unique person that doesn't mind attention and stuff so I think when I walk in with the big red coat or red like he literally said first thing he ever said to me in like real life not on a phone or whatever a text was like Rudy red right that's literally what he said what's up whereas any normal person that was probably you know he does a business deal every week right and films every week for TV at whatever the rest of the people that he probably works with like these boring corporate execs or the social media team from a billion dollar brand and he probably never even talks them let alone remembers them and once you know so I think part of it actually helps because they're probably more like oh this guy's more like me who is this guy right we speak the same language versus being normal where you don't stand out and then you're instantly being qualified as he's just an you know he just a normal person right a normal business person whatever that's a real thing because I think one of the first times we talked to as like oh my gosh who is this guy right even in the marketing space then we get on the phone I think we're talking about one of the award just something like this guy is real he's down to earth and I think that might do something for these celebrities you catch the eye and then their people get on with you they're like oh Rudy's cool Rudy understands how this works and you can kind of give him this reassurance beyond this big branding it almost works really well yeah I mean I'm sure we've lost like deals in the corporate setting and stuff before because of it but we also had big companies like you know hard rock will like pulled me up in a boardroom and said we love this guy's brand and we need to you know get him into helpers with as and you know so I think it's like the world's even changing now well like 10 years ago it's probably like hey let's we need to send this guy to asylum right whereas now it's like one of those like social media like rappers or marketing right like the world's changed a lot too where an even smart marketers you know they know I'm playing the game a little too right you just playing the game like Grant plays the game of 10x and he plays into it and he creates you know you've got to learn to play the game a little and Floyd Mayweather plays the game a little does he need 20 body guards instead of free no probably not right like you know even he has more bodyguards sometimes in the president of America but he plays the game a little right so part of it's also just knowing the rules of the game and then playing playing to them you know yeah well maybe we can get a little tactical here Laura so I've been impressed with really like we had you up for the 2.0 launch and you know we kind of had a little bit of mastermind what's impressed me about you is in every part of your funnel in every part of that process if somebody asks you what's going on with it I noticed that you were not answering in generalities you were giving them numbers so as the head of the company and as the attractive character how is it that you still can dive in and know all these numbers and why is that so important yeah I think every successful big company is run by numbers right because that's the only way you can track and monitor stuff like KPIs so and I'm lucky too right so like I was top of my math class and I was a chess champion so I have and I was a sports scientist running data and I'm also extremely creative and influence really you know how do you get both sides that's not fair like I didn't get lucky with my gene pool and life and in the good luck come on man yeah but uh look I you know I did get lucky with those things so I can go head to head with any COO or any data scientist or marketing person on stats numbers and then I can turn on a video and I mean create content you know this tv show I just filmed we had people there filming it that filmed Wonder Woman and HBO Max films and my major films and they were like they knew it was my first tv show but they were like dude you've got this you're a natural right so I'm definitely very fortunate in this world of business to play both sides but I came from a more of a less of an influence more of a technical market and strategy background and I you know I've always studied billionaires and one thing they will say and have in common is they will know their numbers very well and they build great systems and teams so I've always taken those three things over with me so yeah I've always took those three things over with me and I'm super big on everyone in the company knowing their numbers because I believe if everyone in the company knows the numbers that they need to know for their department then it'll trickle up right so my every Wednesday and some of the ways we do this okay so every hour I get a report of all the key numbers in my business I've spent every hour every hour I've spent for the day revenue for the day how many sales how many registrations and leads I'm obsessive I told you that earlier right and then every hour in the slack channel there's a slack channel where that same report goes off and then there's about 25 slack channels for key data points and every hour they get zapped and updated and then there's an end of day summary so for every celebrity for every funnel I have for every cool booking every sales rep like everything is trapped like you can ask me a number on anything right now I don't think you can trump me on any number and then every Wednesday there's a kpi call for every department where the weekly averages for every number in every department is brought to this kpi call is Wednesday every Wednesday at 9 30 to 11 it's a 90 minute call with every team leader and exec on and they're all presenting on their numbers and then showing me gaps at areas weaknesses and how they're going to fix them because that that is the basics of how you run a business right like you don't run a business off guessing an emotion like that most entrepreneurs do that's not how you actually run a business you're in a business off data right what are the decisions I have to make here so my customer service guy head of customer service he knows that every customer service rep we have to have replied within 24 hours so this week they got on the average reply time was five hours across our all of our companies it took five hours and we had 270 messages in that department and so I know customer service is in a good place because I know the happiness level I know the reply time I know the average reply time is two minutes or one minute 48 seconds so I know that we're not inflating our support team we're not getting too much payroll because people are getting slow the kpi is less than two minutes per message so I can monitor and then that's repeated we know in our mastermind how many calls were taken how many calls did each coach take this week how many members we have how many new members we have how many how much is our real car ring how much like every number is tracked in every department that's how you you know you can monitor and run the companies and are you pro transparency across the organization like everybody every morning we have an iam call it shows revenue for the month revenue for yesterday we have every department gives a one minute update on a slideshow so we're going to see all the you know department heads wins challenges revenue for every celebrity revenue revenue for my company how many leads ad spend across all the fun or everything I like that I feel like it gives everybody a level of ownership too when they see the numbers and then when you know they come in for those wednesday kpi meetings they have full accountability of yeah I mean you don't have to be a department head coming in and your kpi's are off e but right so the company is it pushes you know we always say we have an extreme culture like a lot of people don't want to work here and it's not a lot of people make it past day 90 because you're held to the high stack like you're everything's public right so if your team or even you every staff member in every department doesn't end up they report and they have to write how many hours how much time they spend on every task and they have to grade themselves out of 10 on was I productive today and provided an ROI so you don't normal people are going to last very long when they're great self grading on their productivity ROI to the business everything they did with broken down by time and then every department heads presenting on that right like that weeds out weak people pretty quickly yeah it sounds like you run a pretty tight ship over there how do you keep like the a players is this something where everything is bonus structured there are people all family love it right it's actually the opposite way around it's how do you find enough of them because the c players you can't have average it's actually I find it's the opposite the the core team like we always add these great people and and you know I think our biggest challenge is the a players are so good and they take on more and they want to do more that I think the biggest way we lose some of them is they burn out and that's something that we learn in the last two or three years we've made the same mistake many times when a player pushes it in their role they want to earn more progress we say yeah yeah yeah you're christian and we promote them then six months later they're a total flop in that position because it's different being an a player that is managing leading building teams and systems and then we have to demo them have hard conversations or there's toxicity builds in those six months of them failing and us getting on at them then below and then they leave so one of our biggest or my biggest lessons in my c-suite team that we all admitted this year was we're going to stop promoting from within we've always said we promote from within we've come work from and it's actually like hey now we're at 100 staff that worked when we were less staff and a smaller company but now we're a bigger company you can't promote from within in a lot of these roles because if someone's great in a role it doesn't mean they magically can gain 10 years of leadership experience in a new overnight so that yeah so it's just lessons right that's business learning that's insightful for sure chris you look like you you're thinking about a lot of things with oh my gosh like this this is my mind because i think that there's such a balance here just got a promotion and he's like oh yeah well i think it's i think it's such a balance too because you know you've been in organizations you've seen exactly what that happens is you do have an a player that fits somewhere you promote them and then if you have to demo them it's really hard to keep that I've never i've maybe a couple of times i've managed to pull that off and you can't demote someone and actually have them stay long term maybe sometimes but i've lost i've lost like at least 10 a players in the last three years where i'm like god damn if i had just told them to stay in their role and told them we would just bonus them more or but everyone everyone wants to think they can do more right especially a place and then as good leaders we want to promote from within and say yeah you're crushing it let's give you more and it's like and that works when we were like zero to 10 million but then when you go like 10 to 50 and we're building companies over 100 staff it's just it's a different type of leadership management and operations and kpi's that not necessarily a great copywriter won't have those skills or a great media or a great designer or a great video guy or a great sales rep so yeah yeah that's so interesting you're the first person i've heard say that maybe not the first person who's actually had to do it but that's you know that has admitted like that that's how it's working in business and it's you had to learn the hard way like you had to lose some a-prime sure sure yeah just i mean you speak to any ceo that's run a company of over 100 mil i'm pretty sure that will tell you that the same yeah i i i where's this balance come in though okay because you'll have people who are coming up and they are the eight players and you see that they're doing really well how do you know where that sweet spot is where they're going to be happy with what they're doing maybe it is just compensation but sometimes they want more whether or not they're capable of doing more is is the question how do you find out where that ceiling is and how to keep them happy and producing at the highest level possible yeah the way we're going to tackle it now is that they want to be promoted and feel like they're progressing right and and you can still lose them if you go the opposite way and say sorry no promoting from within now you know so what we're doing now is they become like a senior blah blah blah but they're not managing people kpi's operations or systems so they're just like a senior head coach so we had like even title might matter to them its status may be formed yeah yeah it's just yeah it's i mean it's it's a mixture of everything pay uh appreciation showing this career progression in there in there in this company because that's what a player's long status title blah blah blah resume so we're going more just like hey you're going from a designer to senior designer video ads to senior video coach to senior coach marketing uh marketing manager senior marketing manager versus supervisor or head of department because these soft skills need to drastically twist and change and is that a conversation you're having with them saying hey we love what you're doing there's a promotion here and there's a compensation opportunity whether it's a bonus or whatever but we need you here crushing it is that just a conversation you're having with them yeah i mean they don't know the behind the scenes of it all right like unless they listen to podcasts then they will but it's more like uh they do now yeah they do but no i mean it's more like an honest conversation of well it's different now because we're so big i kind of told everyone at the this year hey i'm looking to build our c-suite now with people that have grown companies to a hundred million right because so i kind of set the layer of the land and you're kind of a sort of like hint of hey you know that we're not going to do too many heads of department promotions or c-suite at this point because i'm actually looking to bring in people from corporate that have took a company at 30 million to 100 for example so i did set expectations there and then yeah i think it's just and then like i can give you a real life example i had i won't say who it is or the role in case they do listen but they were one of the best in the department they asked for a big they wanted to take a management position they knew we were hiring for so it could have been a hard conversation but i said oh you don't i said look i think you should just become senior here because this is what your day would look like in that new role you're going to be managing people onboarding people just taking them to hr for disciplinary tracking all the data chasing them every day when they don't do their under-day reports presenting to me and then they go oh yeah i don't want that position so i love that though like maybe they're hard conversations but they end up being easier in the end because you have this one because i just told them the truth i said this is what that role would be like you know i wouldn't want i would have had so many i would have saved so much time if people were just upfront and honest about things like that because so many people say like yeah you know i think you're great at what you do i think you should go for it or try it i want to see you grow when in reality if they know it's best for the company and they think i'm crushing it in a certain role why not just tell them up front and say there's still room to grow here but you're doing the things that you want to do and the things that you want to do are the right things for us i mean i'll back up for a second so we talk about hiring from outside this creates and i know we're going a little longer than than normal but this is fascinating to me this creates sometimes within an organization something that's difficult but i think especially as the owner or as a c-suite or some somebody else that's an executive sometimes realizing like okay i may be the person that got us to x revenue but that doesn't mean what got us here we'll get us there we all hear that but that might mean going and getting somebody that all right that's taking you from somebody from 100 million to 500 million from the corporate world but i've also seen we're bringing somebody in like that especially in the small entrepreneurial led you know family kind of culture that that really shifts some things and maybe it has to get to that 500 million how do you control that culture we're like we're going to bring in maybe a different mindset of somebody who has grown that how do you keep that same small culture and maybe you don't i don't know it's a bit of both um so i mean it is going to change a little because it's the same saying if he gets you there won't he got you here won't get you there that applies for the way you run your business say it won't get you there right like you can't have one without the other right so it's like a diet hey you lost 20 pounds of fat great doing exercise blah blah blah and diet blah blah but now you want to go from 20% body fat to 8% and have chiseled abs and be on the cover of men's health that old diet plan workout plan helped you lose some excess belly fat when you were super overweight but now you want to get down to single digit body fat it's got to go way different right you have to do car block so there is an understanding of anything in life like one way you approach this won't translate over here so part of it is just changing the way you operate but i think you can still do it while keeping some of your nimbleness and your entrepreneurial traits and your core values and i always and look it's also it's not like it's going to be a home run you have to we hired a corporatey person a year ago um about 13 months 13 months to go and we and after three months we had to let it go because they were too corporatey and a bunch of people go but luckily we didn't necessarily i think we maybe lost one person because of that person but the rest of them you know i was just honest with them i was like look an interview is an interview we interviewed this person four times me and three of the c-suite all agreed they were good fear they had an amazing resume we tried it for 60 days it didn't work out and now we've had to move on and it took me until it took me eight more months to find that new person in my business but now i found that new person in that role eight months later they're amazing they're great fit for the company they're here in miami for me and they're one of the best hires i made in the last three years so part of it is trial and error still part of it is interview process part of it is expectations with your staff of hey when we were zero to 10 million scrappy blah blah blah small team 25 of us 40 of us whatever you know as we go to 100 somethings will change right and like you know everyone loves the idea of all the reports they do these days and they complain about 15 minutes at the end of the day doing their reports and i'm just honest i'm like guys i have 100 staff now we're gonna go to 200 300 we can't you know when it was only 10 of you i knew what you were doing every day and i knew what project yeah i i now so we have to have these systems in place so we can um and look at the end of the day it comes back to you being true to yourself because i'm always gonna build the business that i think's best right and if a couple of people leave along the way because they don't share that vision well that's okay right yeah well maybe maybe two more questions but to build on that you as the owner you as the face of the company is that hard for you to allow some of those new ideas to come in and maybe it's a balance maybe it's just like okay we are going to stick true to our principles but i'm willing to adapt has that been hard as you brought in more corporate no i'm it's no i want to be a billionaire so i'm like right but i'm always finding a balance right and like as long as i hide the right people from corporate they understand the blend between entrepreneur speed and this right um yeah yeah so no i'm excited about building out those systems because when should i mean when you're going from 10 to 100 mil and 100 mil plus it's not about the marketing and all that stuff so much anymore it's about the fulfillment the system the numbers the financials the team the people that's where i spend way less of my time on marketing now like most of my time now is on team people's like literally today it's like a kpi call followed by a department head call followed by this i don't know much about that's days right i probably do an hour of moccasin a day now it's crazy to lure because i think of an organization i think of kevin richards is that person right he's been in a lot of different kind of corporate roles or whatever but mesh is so well with russle right and so russle can still do all that marketing prowess and stuff and then kevin can hold other people accountable and move people around and do what he needs to do so which is i mean i think that's that's the best thing that you can do when you're running operations is like your job is to make sure you have the right people in the right seats doing the right things right and russle's superpower is being marketing so for for him for kevin to take on so much responsibility so that can so that russle can keep doing what he's doing that's everything yeah it's awesome well rudy you are you're amazing i'm constantly impressed tell us what you're most excited about right now and maybe that's the 60 day hustle this thing is coming out on major streaming platform super super soon is that what you're most excited about oh i certainly up there like i i made a goal to i made a goal a year ago to do an amazon and a netflix show over the next year or two and i am uh well on my way to making that success um that's the most i can say at this point um i think for me that's the next step i have this big personality everyone loves it um i've learned the content game and then to me i'm just aware about what how do i go to an extreme so it's like well yeah it's great going viral on social media but then in my head i'm like well why can't i go viral across america to 100 you know tens of millions of people sat on watching a tv show so for me that's just a way to amplify my brand and collapse time um and i enjoy it you know it's there's been a lot of fun this show so it comes out in three full months you'll see it all over my socials uh it's a business show where we're showing entrepreneurship from zero um from ground zero basically brand new product owners maybe making 10 grand a month for less and showing how to scale them through different phases of marketing so it's uh and i also film that show because i wanted to show the part of life of entrepreneurship i think there's this misconception in the world that oh millionaires are douchebags blah blah blah but it's like no they work 16 hours a day give up what most people want and pull out with family friends you know get irs lawsuits and all the jazz you get sued like it is yeah yeah like so yes i'm very excited about that and then the celebrity brands like i really pivoted back to that about 18 months ago um and i really you know i want to become a billionaire and i want to build brands and businesses and again so i reverse in my head how do i collapse time i can build brands from ground zero or i can partner with like a you know a super famous a-lister and build a brand with them and yes i might only own 50 percent of it but if they can collapse 10 years to five to me that's a better trade-off right so um building brands with a celebs is is definitely exciting too awesome and where can people follow you to learn more about what's coming for you yeah instagram's the best um probably like the daily content and stuff so our website's more capital ma we are capital dot com instagram's really more life that may change to really red if i change my name and you listen to this that's a great open loop yeah and i always say like once you click something just be careful because you'll never stop seeing the red we are good at ads that's how i started so you will get retargeted for the rest of your life but that's the that's awesome well thank you again i recognize you and i know a lot of other people do because of the red but i can say after this conversation i really appreciate most how transparent and honest you've been it's honestly been truly refreshing for somebody to just be completely honest about how they run business i think that's really admirable yeah i always say like with people when they were with me on my staff even my wife i'm like i'll always tell you how it is you want to always like that it's not always a good things probably things i shouldn't say but i am like 100 transparent at all times and yes that's uh you know i like everything in life when you play some extreme like i said it can be a great trade and sometimes a weakness but that's i embrace who i am yes love it well it's been great to have you on thanks for joining us today thanks really pleasure's all mine see you guys thank you see you
