Everybody, we are here with Funnel Hacker TV as kind of a surprise, not our normal time, but there's good reason for it. We have some things we need to tell you about. So let's go ahead and roll. Are we rolling an intro today? Let's roll an intro. Let's roll an intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey there everybody. My name is Ben Mouton. This is... Susan Munnardsen here. And we get to do a really cool impromptu Funnel Hacker TV with you guys. Fellow Funnel Hackers, we need to celebrate with you. There are people who have won a ticket to Funnel Hacking Live. There's one person specifically who has won a very specific ticket that is a VIP experience and we're giving away a whole bunch of other gifts. And so we need to do that. But more importantly, there's something happening at the top of the hour that we're just kind of doing a countdown to. So here's at the bottom of the hour. So right now it is one o'clock Eastern at 1.30. So at the bottom of the hour, Russell is going live with a very secret training. So this is going to go live for you guys. If you guys want to be in on it, you definitely need to stick around. You're going to want to stick to the end in order to watch this. We're not going to be watching it with you once it starts to go live. We're going to be like, okay, whatever we're doing, just go watch. We're just going to break to it if we go that long. We don't. It's fine. If you guys want to figure out where to find this, just go over to Russell Brunson's page and you will find it right here. Just below the bonus breakdown video that he did for Funnel Hacking Live and just above the inner circle breakdown that he did with everybody talking about Funnel Hacking Live. So there is a really cool training happening at 1.30. We're just going to keep calling this out guys because Susan and I are going to watch it like we're utter nerds. We're like, this is what we do. We're Funnel Hacker crazy mad geek. So this is what we do. So might as well have a countdown timer with you guys. And while we do it, we might as well give away that Funnel Hacking Live ticket. So if you guys want to win, let us know in the comments. Let us know if you guys put in your, your, your, what is that? You submitted your details for the giveaway. What if you guys did any of that? So we got almost 100 entries and I watched probably 60 videos going through everything. We had team members watching every single video. Your video was seen. If you submitted something, we saw you and I want you to make sure that you feel seen a lot of the videos that we saw. A lot of you guys feel like you're looking for that one thing. You're looking for that glimmer of hope, that ability to just grow, that take to the next level. This is that opportunity for you guys, but also I want you to recognize if you do not win today, it does not mean that the doors are still not available for you. What Russell shares in all of the books and what he's about to share at the here. Once we're done here, all of these things are meant for you to give you an edge. So you already have an edge. The question is what action will you take on it? Going to Funnel Hacking Live is going to be an amazing experience. If you guys don't have your tickets, you should get your tickets by going to funnelhackinglive.com. You should definitely do that. However, if you are in a place where you're not going to be getting your tickets, recognize and you don't want to take it, you need to recognize that you have so much already and you should be using it. You should be running with all you've got now. And if you want to take that experience and the next level Funnel Hacking Live is the place. Susan, you know this better than I do. Oh man. Okay. So definitely go get your tickets. But we have some exciting stuff to move into right now. We have not very much time to do it because we're also going to be going on. So let's get to it. All right. Let's get into it. Okay. Ben, stop talking. Yeah. And I was just going to say, like I watched a lot of you guys' videos too for this giveaway and they made me laugh. They made me cry. They were so good. And I was so glad to be able to watch so many of them. So thank you for sharing with the community. Yes. Absolutely. So for the first winner, so we're going to be giving away a couple of different things up to the Funnel Hacking Live ticket. If you guys, when you opted in in order to win, there were a couple of different things that you could win. And so we're going to be giving away things one step at a time. The first thing that we're going to be giving away is a free month of ClickFunnels. So one of the videos that did extremely well that we absolutely loved was this video. And so what we're going to do is we're going to share this video with you guys. We want you guys to enjoy it with us. And let's go ahead and jump in and let us know what you guys think and cheer them on for winning a ClickFunnels account for a month free, free ClickFunnels account for a month. Here we go. And boom, make sure we can all hear this. Oh, we can't hear it. Are we all able to hear? We're not able to hear. We're not able to hear. No. Okay. So the very first video, the very first video comes to us from James Mitchell. James Mitchell, this was a great video. Number one, it has a really cool hook. So James is whispering the entire time and James is talking about how he's been growing his business, how he's taking his business to the next level. And we'll see if that's something that can be fixed on your side, Susan, when you share or, you know, if you can share. Let's see if you can share the next one. I can toss the link over if you need. But James, he whispers the entire video and he says there's a reason why I whisper. Oh, we got to play this video really quick before. I totally forgot. I totally forgot. James, you have won a ClickFunnels account for a month. We've given you an extra month inside of your ClickFunnels account. So just want to say thank you so much. Congratulations. And really quick, we got so many submissions and they're really cool because the audio is not working. I want to make sure that we watch this. Can we play that video really quick where it's like, here's everybody who submitted their videos. We want to give a shout out to everybody. So let's go ahead and watch that video really quick. Macroo. So you've got a mission for me. Yes, your mission this year is to find out for me about the Winchman ads and traffic. This is my entry for the Funnel Hiking Log 2023 giveaway. I'd love to be considered. I built a few things in ClickFunnels 2.0, but currently one of the most things I'm excited about right now, I'm building a funnel for a nonprofit that helps save people who are in refugee status trying to get out of a dangerous situation in the country that they're in. I'm a cancer survivor. I'm a vending remission for seven years. After having cancer, there's a lot of challenges. There's a lot of limits that are put on you. And I want to create a network that allows people to access those resources. So being able to go to Funnel Hiking Live would be amazing. It would allow me to really grow this idea and to be able to change my life and change so many other people's lives as well. In 2019, I heard Garrett White at Funnel Hiking Live bring Russell and Todd and some others up on the stage, and then he brought their wives up there as well. And he has all-safe thank you for all of the sacrifice that they put in to make it possible for us to have ClickFunnels. And that really hit me because I've been through a situation and my wife and my kids had a sacrifice for that. And I made a decision at that time that if I forgot the opportunity to meet any of the wives that I would express my gratitude for all that they've been through. Imagine how it would feel to see someone step into the darkness to come into rescue you. Our clients are in pain and darkness, and they are begging for the way to get into the life. But there's one critical step that will help bridge the gap between my teaching in the world and that's Funnel Hiking Live. You may ask yourself why I'm whispering and that's to give everybody else a fair advantage because when I speak my voice is magic. I really need to be at Funnel Hiking Live because I know what was working before in the industry is not what's working now. I need to have the latest new ways to implement this. Going to Funnel Hiking Live 2023 would be super exciting for me because I would be around everyone that is ingrained in just lives and breath ClickFunnels. I've got my books. I am all set to go. I've got my Funnel Hiking shirt on. I am a Funnel Builder. I am trying to get a free ticket to Funnel Hiking Live. Last year I got the Black Friday deal for ClickFunnels 2.0. And then I quickly remembered that I'm in full-time industry. I'm married with two young kids and I'm in an accelerated master's program. So yeah, like nothing happened. But the good thing is I just graduated. But the thing of why I want to win really is because my wife and I, we are committed to traveling together. So with that, winning will give us a free ticket because we need to get two. I think I would benefit immensely from the IPXpress. There's my rooster. I'll show it to you in a minute. If I win a free ticket to Funnel Hiking Live, I will pay for someone else. I'm here to enter the contest for Funnel Hiking Live giveaway tickets because there's no better place to rub shoulders with the most brilliant minds in the industry. This is my entry to the Funnel Hiking Live 2023 giveaway. I would love to win this to get that kick in the pants and to get some extra strategies and tips so I can get myself paying up the 2.0 Club Award. This is my entry to the Funnel Hiking Live 2023 giveaway. Hello, good people. This ticket to average L would be the turning point I've been paying. This is by far the coolest thing I have ever built inside Quick Funnels. Yes, it is a Quick Funnels 2.0 course that's basically Netflix. Of course, they're bingeable, right? Go back and watch all the episodes. Yes, this is all built inside Quick Funnels 2.0. So I'm going to be at Funnel Hiking Live regardless if I win this competition. But I want to share all of this, the strategy, how I did it with you on Funnel Hacker TV so I cannot wait to win this competition. Oh, my gosh. We have so many people in the comments that are like, this is awesome. Great compilation, great shares. It was good. So we got to see James in there since the audio wasn't working earlier. We got to see his whisper to his normal, his deeper voice, which is hilarious. Okay, so we've already announced that James Mitchell is the winner of the one month Click Funnels access. Awesome. James, shout out to James. Okay, we have more stuff to give away though. Okay, so our next one is the winner of a Click Funnels cap. Okay, so we're going to hope the audio works. I'm going to go ahead and try sharing this one. See what we can do. Ready? Here we go. We got to actually share the screen. Here we go. You hear that? No. Oh, AV, I love it. All right. Okay, well, let's let it play while we talk. Yeah, so really cool thing that she does here is she does like a, so she created a video and then she did other things in order to make sure that she was able to submit other videos. But the cool thing Sarah did was like, she did like the blooper reel. Like this is all the times I tried to make this work and it was kind of weird. It just made us laugh. It was absolutely fun. It was just, you know, something that was kind of different than what everyone else was doing. And so we appreciated it. We wanted to give her a shout out and just thank you for being creative and having absolute blast. Yeah, absolutely. Awesome. Okay, but also we want to give another cap away to another person. Yes, we do. I got this. You got that one ready? I got it. Yeah, I got it. Audio doesn't work on my end. You can take care of the rest of them. Here we go. Okay.

You will not be able to hear this video, but oh my gosh, if you can go to, go to ClickFalls and search this one up because, oh my gosh, is it adorable?
