## Transcript
Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are so excited to be able to have you here. As you guys have been watching, we have been doing interviews with each of the Funnel Hacking Live speakers. Today, we might be able to geek out with you. Let's go ahead and run the intro. We'll talk about who's on today. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. I'm Susan Lennardsen. This over here is Ben Moodt. How are you? This is a special episode for me specifically and the guest that's coming on. This person is actually just so amazing, so genuine. I connected up with her three years ago, two years ago. We since then have grown to be really close in the sense that we actually became business partners. It was really, really awesome to have her actually speaking at Funnel Hacking Live and joining us. We're going to be bringing in the rest of the speakers too. Make sure you are signed up. Ben was pointing at it earlier. There it is. 208-231-3797. FHTV, text it to that number. Let me give her a proper introduction. Can you guess who it is, guys? If you understand Geek out, if you know Susan's background, can you guess who it is? This is actually blew my mind. I didn't even know this until a couple of months ago that she has a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction. She is always at product development, customer experience, customer journeys. She's come up with a journey crafting framework. She's going to be speaking on stage at Funnel Hacking Live, but it may not be for what you think. We're going to bring her on and we're going to get her story and we're going to learn about why she's speaking on the stage. Let's finally introduce Andrea Pierre. Hi, Ben. It's so good to be on here with you guys. Oh, my gosh. Okay. Let's start with how did you even get into ClickFunnels because you did not start like a lot of us did. No. Well, okay. I oftentimes joke that Russell came to me as I was making like mayonnaise and Russell go hand in hand, which is a funny story. I was actually on a graveyard shift working at a gourmet sandwich shop because I was desperately trying to figure out how to be an entrepreneur. I was making mayo. This gourmet shop has a very structured way of making sandwiches. You wrote memory. You're just doing it. Meanwhile, I'm listening to audio, just consuming everything I possibly can. That's when Russell came to me in this random other program that I was in. Thank goodness that he came to me because that program was a train wreck. He came to me and I was like, who is this guy? Then I just, you know how it goes. You dive in to Russell's world and you're hook, line, and sinker. That's how I got first oriented to ClickFunnels with the OFA challenge and then went on my way. The reason I was there is because I had spent 18 years in corporate doing user experience research and consulting some of the biggest companies in the world on how to do user experience product design and development using a really cool piece of software. That's how I started. Then I got myself fired because I ticked off one of the investors. It's interesting. I oftentimes joke that Russell, when he came out with his Bootstrap Award, I was like, you know that scene in Dumb and Dumber, and he's like, just when I couldn't love you anymore, you go and out do it yourself. It was that moment for me just because it was one more thread of avoiding corporate America, say no to big dollars and investors and just create a path and something that's meaningful for you. That is a short backstory and how I came into ClickFunnels. Yes, go ahead. Ben's got stuff to say. I was going to, okay, so that happened. You went down the path of, okay, well, I need to consume this. I need to learn what Russell's doing. You discovered a funnel building as a service. Then tell us a bit about the jump from when you discovered ClickFunnels and Russell to starting your business. The reason I was making sandwiches is because I had spent two years trying to start something and I had no idea what I was doing. All my severance had run out by that point. Right around that time, after I found Russell, it was like one month later that Funnel Hacking Live 2020 was going on. I used all of my airline points and all of my miles, 10 bucks a day, went down there, and I literally sat in the last possible row in the last possible seat. I just was like, I'm so intimidated, but I am here and I am just going to head down and learn this. That was 2020. Catherine Jones was also speaking at that time. She came and that's when as soon as I got back, I was like, design hacking. It helped me bring my user experience with Funnel Hacking. I was like, I can do this. I dove head first into Catherine's world because she had this weird fluke. I don't even know to this day how it happened, but it was she opened up design hacking for a day for free. I jumped in and consumed and I thought I was going to get caught and I was like, I have to just learn it all. I kept going and she was like, go make an offer. I went into the Quick Funnels official group. I think my first post was, I will make you a funnel for $400. I was like, anybody, anybody, anything, I'll do it. All I had was design hacking and what I had done, studied Russell. Then at this point, I think there was nothing short of divine intervention though because the first job that came to me and the second job that came to me who is still a client today and the third job and the fourth job, they were all membership sites, which was akin to what I had been doing in corporate America with these multi-touchpoint customers that had come back again and again and use the product and use the information. There was this really cool two seeds were planted in those initial projects. One was this membership concept and how do you help people on their journey and then the second one was an agency was born that day with those projects. That's how I started the agency stuff and then not too much longer, Susan, you came into my world. It was Susan and I met in design hacking and she had an agency. I had an agency and it was really just, I was just trying to get the agency to work and I was 100% word of mouth and I just knew that if I was a part of the ClickFills community and a part of the design hacking community and I was in it to win it, I wasn't going anywhere, I was committed to those, something had to happen. It did. 100% of my business has always come through word of mouth, which is really cool. I just started to do the agency and grew and grew and grew and grew and it's amazing and I started to land Big Fish and I got invited to inner circle with some clients and started to really grow as an agency and right around that time, this is where Susan and I and the Magic began. So it was 2021 Funnel Hacking Live when they first announced Click's Fun with 2.0 and what was so cool and because then you were in this conversation actually really early on with Susan and I, I went back and I looked at the date that the Facebook group, the Greek out 2.0 Facebook group was created, it was September 24th. So we had not left Funnel Hacking Live 2021 when we created the group and got it established and we bought the domain and were like, this is it. But at that time, we thought we really would only have super geeks like you Ben and Susan and me and Dan, you know, who wanted to just be like, what did they just do? And then yeah, so that was 2021 when it got started. And then it just started to, you know, Geek out was just kind of like bumbling along and then it was in really like towards Funnel Hacking 2022 when they announced 2.0 and it's amazing actually, Susan and I were talking the other day in that in that Russell didn't just give us a piece of software with 2.0, what no one is really talking about is that what he really gave us was Lynchpin and this brand new way that we could serve clients and this brand new way that we can structure services around clients, it was incredible. I mean, to me, 2.0 is awesome and in the platform is it will get there and I think there's no doubt in my mind it'll be the industry leader, but to me the true gift of 2.0 is Lynchpin. And so we started basing all of our services around it, Geek out created all of our services around Lynchpin and then we just ran our challenge last week and we have basically now a fully fleshed out done for you, done with you agency model that incorporates Lynchpin plus journey crafting and we get to teach people and work with people on that every day. So that's amazing. That's basically the short of the story and yeah, it's incredible. So I remember the first time that your name was dropped, I was talking to Dan Havy. I was trying to find a way to like tech hack the ClickFunnels classic membership area. I wanted to like, I had this whole idea of how it would unlock and how it would track and how it would take these different steps and how you could save data as you're going through it and like, I had this all worked out and I'm like, okay, Dan Havy would know how to do it. So I dropped some serious dough in front of Dan and said, look, help me out. And he goes, all right, here you go. I'm here to help you, but you should meet this gal. And that's when I heard your name dropped. That's when I met you. And that's when everything kind of started. So like, if you guys have not been a part of geek out yet and they're part of Andrea's world, it's because you haven't nerded out hard enough. And if you're ready to start like Andrea's got that whole world figured out, Susan's there, Dan Havy's there. That group just keeps growing and they bring in amazing people. There's so much to learn. But I remember when Russell was trying to figure out what your first funnel should be about. And he was thinking about the possibility of maybe teaching Lynch pin, but oh, maybe it's too complicated. Maybe we take it back to the first steps and he was trying to figure all these things out. And he came to me one day and he goes, did you know that there's like an agency that did all they do is Lynch pin now? I'm like, are you serious? It goes, yeah, it's crazy. And so tell us really quick. I remember we did the contest in order to for the speakers and you put in your video. When Russell reached out and said, yes, we want to have you speak. First, what was that like? And then number two, what are you speaking about? Yeah, it was a roller coaster for emotions because I submitted my video and I have to tell you, I wouldn't have submitted that video without some very dear friends helping me to be able to do that because they gave me a wonderful kick in the butt. So I so appreciate that. So yeah, so I submitted the video and the video was actually about the six experience models that we know are critical in order to create really great learning experiences inside membership areas and to help customers actually engage and do the thing. So that was what I actually submitted the video about. So when Russell sent me the video about what he wanted me to talk about, it wasn't that. And I was like, okay. And at first I was like, you know, at first I was like, whoa, but then immediately I was like, yes, that is more right. And so what he wanted me to talk about is, and when he asked me to talk about is this agency journey and how the people in the audience to that person who is sitting in the very last row in that very lessy who just, you know, they really want to geek out about something and they want to serve and they want to be able to sit right there next to the entrepreneur who's creating these amazing things and bringing them into the world. It's those people that I really want to talk to in the audience to say, it's not just that it's giving you a tool that you can sell a service, it's giving you an entire language that you can use to bridge between a customer who's already really excited about being in the ClickFunnels community and world and your understanding and knowledge about the frameworks. And so it just, it completely changes the conversation from this order taker, I want a funnel, let me build you a funnel too. Like, I want to create this thing in the world. Okay, I have a framework to be able to help you do that. You've heard about it from Russell. Now let's dive in and actually make it work for you. And it's just, it's, it's amazing what he's given us in that. And it's so much fun being that middle person where it's like, you just heard it, do you want support doing it? And to be able to be that and be able to number one, you learn deeper, you get to nerd out because you're doing all the stuff, the geek is on. But, but then you're also like helping them do it, you understand it better, you're able to like go in deeper and support them. And we don't realize the blind spots that we have when we sit down to do something. And having that other person there is so massively helpful. If you guys have ever hired somebody, you know that. And if you guys are in the process of trying to figure out how you could get into this a little bit more and help other people like this is the path. So, so excited for Funnel Hiking Live. What really quick, what has been your experience like, you were going to go this year, whether or not you were speaking like, I know for a fact that you guys had tickets, like you had a ticket Susan was like, I've gotten my ticket, I remember buying a ticket. So Funnel Hiking Live is always the quintessential thing that's there because it's that family that meets for me. I feel like it's that family that meets. What, what keeps bringing you back year after year, even though you get to be on stage this year? Oh my gosh, there are so many things. First of all, it is, it's like they are my people, right? It's the energy and it's the type of people that I want to be surrounded by. And a lot of times I think when people hear me say that or hear others say that, they might be thinking, you know, the people who have like got to this, you know, do you mean Atlas and Inner Circle? And that's not, I mean, while that is awesome and being exposed and being able to talk to those people is really critical in your own journey. It's not that it's that everybody who is in that arena and in that space and at that event, there is a like-minded and like-spirited concept of I just want to make something that's meaningful of my own creation and I want to do it in the community of people who are givers and who want to support one another and lift each other up and just the energy of it is amazing. And not only that, it's like, like I said, 100% of our business comes from word of mouth. And I would say that probably if I was a betting person, about 85% of all the clients who I now would consider friends and who I have worked with have come from some connection that I have made at Funnel Hacking Live. So through some chain of events, Funnel Hacking Live has been this instrumental thing to boost my momentum, to boost my network, to boost my connections with people, and just even to boost inspiration. I mean, Geek Out came from Funnel Hacking Live. This whole concept of Lynch Pin and Journey Crafting Connected came from Funnel Hacking Live. Like it is the genesis of so much. It's amazing and things you wouldn't even know until much, much later. So just as a note, if you guys are listening and you're like, yeah, I don't know if I'm going to be comfortable sitting in this room with a whole bunch of people that are all freaking out. If you're somebody like who drives like this, like it's you kind of want to sit in the back of the room. You're not quite sure if this is you. You want to go crazy on this stuff. And then you fall in love with the person who's painting their vision. I don't know about you guys, but like when you're sitting down next to a customer and they start to express their desire, like I feel like I'm called this direction and this is what I want to build. And this is that like instantly my gears start turning for them. Like I start falling in love with their dream, with their client as they're expressing it. If that's you, Funnel Hacking Live is a place for you. Like and it is a party meant just for you. Yeah. And so make sure that you guys get your tickets. Go to funnelhackinglive.com guys. This is this is the geek out of all geek outs you want to be here. It's the event of all events. And we sell it every single year and Russell is a master of putting together this event that connects you step by step, piece by piece. This year is different than every other year and how he has structured it and made sure that they're the right people in the right spots organized to help you grow and understand the frameworks are going to help you grow and help others grow. You're going to have those opportunities to be able to meet people to be able to reach out even if you're one of those that doesn't want to you will be called. You will have that moment or someone will just turn to you and say, Hi, what do you do? And you will express I'm trying to learn this and do this so that we can do it for other people. Like, Oh, I'm trying to do this for me. Can you help me out? These relationships are going to be built. These opportunities are going to be presented. And if you're not there, the opportunity cost is huge. Like I have tried every single time to stay at the hotel, because there's something so powerful about being there. Those rooms are going, they are going, going, going, going, going. So make sure that you are in there, make sure you get your tickets so that way you have access to it because it is an event that is worth being at. Susan, what have I missed? Yeah, okay. So when you guys do go get your ticket, there, you're not just getting access to the live event that's happening in September. You, you are getting that. You are also getting swag, like bring an extra suitcase. That's all we're saying. You get the marketing AI integration right into your 2.0 account. Inner Circle has been putting in all kinds of amazing bonuses. You get all of the FHL replays from all of the other years. So if you came into ClickFunnels just recently, and you're like, Hi, I wish I could have gone to those ones. I keep hearing stories. You can go watch three plays. You can go watch the replays of when Andrea and I were there and 2.0 was announced, and we have like all this inspiration you could watch last year when Russell first revealed Lynchpin, and you can get ahead of the game before you go this year. But not only that, all of our FHL speakers for this year have also been throwing in bonuses. They're not even listed on that that you just saw. Everyone's been putting in bonuses. They are amazing. If you haven't been watching Funnel Hacker TV and hearing about the bonuses that they've been putting in, you can need to go watch them because like, I'm still blowing away about the one that was from yesterday. So there's just so much value for just the payment to your ticket, but you're getting so much. And you can just go and learn what you need to learn right now, leading up to Funnel Hacking Live or beyond that. Like it's there for you whenever you need to access it. And then so Andrea is representing, she's representing agencies up on the stage. An interesting thing, and I didn't really realize this until we talked about it recently, is I became a Funnel Builder in 2019 when I joined CF Design School, and I never considered myself an agency. I'm like, oh yeah, I'm a Funnel Builder. I'm a Funnel Builder. I'm a Funnel Builder, right? And then at some point that switched, people would ask me, like, oh, do you have an agency? And I just started saying yes, because saying yes was easier than explaining. Like, I don't think I'm an agency. I'm like a solo Funnel Builder. But Andrea actually has helped me realize, like, I was an agency the entire time. And so if that is you, what Andrea is going to be speaking about on stage is for you. But also, I happen to know Andrea has been preparing some stuff. You want to talk about that? Yeah. Well, in true good journey crafting format, I have to speak through the journey. And so as I discussed and share with people the agency journey, I do think there's a pattern to it because I've interviewed and I've talked to a lot of people like yourself, Susan, of like, what was it like for you? And how did you step into this agency role? And so what I've done is I've basically, I've mapped out what a very classic pattern is in an agency journey. And then I've provided resources and key decision workbooks, because that's really what it is. It's a series of decisions on how you want to run your business and grow your agency. So I've created the agency decision workbook for every phase of the agency journey. And then I also have a ton of helpers and infrastructure, like, click up share funnels and proposal share funnels and all the things that no matter where you're at in your journey, you can just use those and plug and play them. And then a really fun one is I've come up with this huge idea bank that if you are at a loss for what type of service you want to provide, there are so many things that come into our arena now, where people are asking for the support. We've actually spun up a service or we've said no, but in that there's just this huge list of ideas that you can easily, if you are in this world, create a service around. And so I created a service model idea bank that you can go in and you can pull from and see if any of that resonates for you. So these are so good. I'm like, oh my gosh, I wish I had this when I was starting. It's so helpful. People in certification program now were thinking maybe I should go to funnel hiking life. Holy cow. Those resources need to be there because it's funnel hiking live. Oh my gosh, Andrew. Yes. And if you are in love with the agency thing because then mood is going to be there, you should also court him and ask him about his amazing Rainmaker stuff because if you are an agency, you should know about it because it's amazing. Yeah, put that together. That was a lot of fun. Yes. So now I'm blushing. Go to funnel hacking live.com. Go and get your tickets. My friends like there's there is this amazing synergy and like you'll see like you'll see Andrea walking around. You'll see me. You'll see Susan. You'll see the people. You'll see Laura Demetrius from ClickFunnels radio Chris Cameron. You'll see all these faces that you have seen throughout all this time and you'll be able to see old friends, new friends and there's just just energy and you'll recognize it the minute that you start to walk up to the event area. Like everybody who's there, there's just a pulse that you want to be a part of. And I highly recommend if you are thinking about it, just sitting on that fence and wondering, maybe I'll go. Maybe I'm not quite sure. The bonuses alone, including entry is amazing bonus, is going to change the game for you. And just being just getting that is if it was just a virtual repository of all these amazing bonuses and all these different things, it would be well worth the ticket. Coming is going to be just cream on top of that cupcake. So my friends come and get your ticket. Go to funnel hiking live.com, grab your ticket, get there. Andrea, did I miss anything? No, I agree. Come and be a part of the community. You will be received with welcome arms. Absolutely. We love you. Can't wait to see you guys. Have a wonderful day and we'll see you on stage. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We're racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life, and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating. It's pulsing. I made for something more. And then fear hits us. A little voice is in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking points and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia, and I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that made me all of my money. My best selling framework. Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust in the winner. This better blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this one precious life? You wouldn't be able to tell, but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. Wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People build a sense of belonging here. It feels like home. I'm still encouraging because if they can do it, so can I. It's all I'm saying. Hey, next year we're going to get that. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer ever. You'll find exactly what your business is missing. It's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you your life. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day they're telling people how they met you. Oh, I can live change my entire life because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be black. Your legacy's going to be black. Move it. They're about to be black. My story hopefully gave women permission. You do not have to be great to get started, but you have got to start if you ever want to be great.
