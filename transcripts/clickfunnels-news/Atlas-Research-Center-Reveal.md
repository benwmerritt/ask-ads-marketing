Hey everybody, we are back Funnel Hacker TV. We are going to be talking all about the Atlas Research Reveal that happened yesterday. It was so awesome. That's what we're going to be talking about. We're going to be nerding out on all of the parts of it. If you missed it, you're going to get a good recap from us and then we're going to tell you the parts that you need to go make sure you watch for yourself. Let's go ahead and roll the intro and we'll be back. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey there everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. My name is Ben Moot and this is... This is Leonard Sun. We are so excited to be able to be here guys. Normally we've been going live every Tuesday and Thursday for Funnel Hacker TV. It's Tuesday and Thursday. Usually it's 1pm Mountain Standard, 3pm Eastern for you guys. But yesterday was a day and we did not want to step on any toes. It was Russell's time and we want to talk about it because we've been keeping things secret from you guys. We now get to talk. First off, if you guys are here joining us for the first time, make sure that you text FHTV to 208-231-3797. Make sure you get the text automations. I know the one today went out a little bit early. No worries, happy to see you guys. If you guys want the email recaps, we send those out every single Friday so that you get everything that you may have missed. The whole ClickFunnels world at Funnel Hacker TV or FunnelHacker.TV. That will take care of everything. Make sure you sign up for all the notifications so you don't miss anything. Number one, number two, we had fun yesterday. Yeah, we did. I'm still out in Georgia and so I have not flown back into Boise. I need to get back in. Susan's just down the street. Yes. She went over to the office. Yeah. I was able to be there in the room in person and I'll tell you some experiences and things throughout this episode. It's so awesome being able to just jump in. Right? Okay, so really quick. A couple of days ago, Russell dropped a video on Instagram and on Facebook on his page. And if you guys missed it, make sure you're following Russell because he's also dropped like two podcasts in the last three days. And there's a third one coming into today or tomorrow. And he dropped this announcement video and he talks specifically about how all these things work. Let's go ahead and throw that up so everybody can see kind of a little preview behind it. And this is literally, this is us recording, us recording him so you guys feel like you kept behind the scenes. And Russell kind of announced, look, I'm going to be doing an event and it's going to be ridiculously cool. You're absolutely going to love it. And I'm going to share the madness. Like a lot of people have been wondering, I've been buying a lot of books lately. Like, where does this all go? What's the vision behind it? And so he reveals the books in this little teaser. He kind of talks about it. I won't kind of what the vision is, but it was all to push the event yesterday. And that event yesterday, if you actually go on, it's live in several different places. You can still see it. I believe on Facebook, if you know where to look, you believe you could find it on YouTube, but watch your emails or just go to secretsofsuccess.com. And you can opt in and I believe the replay should be there as well. So, so number one, make sure that you go and just check that out because it's really, really cool. But number two, the event yesterday. Oh my gosh. Oh man. Okay. So are we in time? Okay. We're going to tell our stories for a second. I don't bet you want to start first though. Yeah, I can do it first. Because this is not the first time that we've actually seen what you guys saw yesterday. So guys, if you, if you, if you missed yesterday, you definitely need to go watch it. This is just little recaps so that way you're like, Oh my gosh. At a year ago, Russell Vox me and was like, Hey, I've got projects that you would be perfect for. Are you able to like fly over? I'm like, I'm done. And so I flew on over and got to hang out. And the first thing that he was like, Oh, Hey, Ben and start talking about things. He goes, do you want to see the library stuff? Like, yes. And so he took me across the street and where they were housing everything for the time being now it's moved. It's in a secret location I cannot talk about. But he started showing all of the books. And this telling me the stories behind them and the things that he was getting like he was buying bookshelves like book company. Went out of business and boy scene. So he bought bookshelves and he was having his having like having them cleaned out so that way they could put all the books in there. And like he was showing me the magazines and telling me stories about Albert Hubbard and all these different people that you've never heard of that have changed the world that you and I live in today. We just don't recognize it. This is going back to the source and we went through, I think it was like four or five different rooms. And just to be able to see each piece step by step in the history he's collecting the things he's discovering. It just it blew my mind and be able to actually like you'll be for you to see it now. It's like, okay, we can talk about it. It's time we're able to actually have this discussion. So that was what I first saw stuff and I've seen the things he's been collecting since and where he's housing it and other pieces that he's buying. And we'll keep talking about that. But Susan, when is the first time like you got to actually see in touch. Okay, so for this entire event that happened yesterday. He actually presented it this in Mexico, a mastermind in paradise. And then again in the inner circle event that we both got to go to. And I'll just say like mastermind and paradise was the first time right. And it was also the first time that he had presented it to anyone and we if you watch yesterday's live about it, this the presentation he talks about how like he was actually so nervous about it that he almost didn't go and make the offer that he made during it which we'll talk about in a little bit. And he almost just didn't do it at all. And I'm so glad that he did. Because if you're someone who it like just you love education in the sense of like always having a desire to learn and grow as a human and gathering knowledge and preserving that for you know posterity to be able to access that anytime we want. Unfortunately, like sometimes we lose some of that history for various reasons. And so what has I was watching the same video that he showed yesterday in Mexico. I was getting like so emotional and it was just so awesome like he talked about yesterday how like that he came out on the stage when he was he wasn't going to make the offer and then he came out on the stage and he saw people in the audience like getting teary eyed and crying and like I was one of those people. Because it was just so moving and so if you have like you have to go watch the portion of the video that he showed yesterday I mean you really should watch the whole thing. But the video, just the way that they told the story and Russell story is just, it was so awesome. So that was my first experience of seeing what he's working on. Yeah, cool. It's like catching the vision. Right. So, Russell talked about like the phases he's built this in. And if you guys are like into Russell like if you are trying to learn all these things from Russell, he's following the expert secrets playbook perfectly. He is being a reporter. First, he is grabbing all the stories and talking about all these things and why they're important step by step. He is becoming the ultimate reporter. And he knows for whom. And it's for the entrepreneur so he had these these statues built and they're being built but he had like the little pre ones built, which are really small. They'll be the big ones that are in the event center will show you like a little preview of that video that he showed, but they are these massive statues of Atlas holding the weight of the world is like a lot of the times you as business owners are holding the weight of the world. And I want this to be a place he kept he keeps saying like I want to be a place where it inspires you to keep holding that weight and not shrug it off. But it almost felt like this became the place where it was okay to shrug it off for a moment. And so he's able to get that breath of fresher what he is building what he's creating is that place where the business owner becomes refreshed. So that way they can go back pick up the globe and walk out the door and go keep changing the world and so it's, it's such a really cool like preview into the vision of what he's doing. What is the pieces. This is it. He's showing it to you. And you can model it step by step like this where funnel hacking becomes funnel hacking. So, with that said, talk about books. He, yeah, so he kicked off the event yesterday. He had the sage stage set with just a handful of his collection of the book's collection and he was showing it off to us yesterday right. And there is definitely some really awesome and special pieces that Ben and I wanted to kind of highlight and bring to your attention so that you want to go watch that video. Yeah, you want to talk about like the first one that he kicked off with. Yep. So the first one and this is him kind of previewing a couple of them. The ones that he kicked off with the first one he kicked off with was the first old book that he bought was an old book of Mormon which is important to people who are our Mormons or Latter-day Saints. And so he talks about like why this is so valuable and why it was important to him and what it meant. And his experience buying it for the first time and having to tell his wife that he spent this much money on a book. And then he talked about, so he shared that book as like the beginning of the adventure. You don't know where you're calling to adventure begins. You just go, right? And then the next piece that he does is he talked about the next book he got, which is the possibly the rarest book in America. And he showed it to us and it's like one of the most expensive single books he's bought. Now we're talking about, he was talking about how much he spent on like the Napoleon Hill stuff. Just the collection was like two million. Yeah. I think that's what he said yesterday. I had a lot of books in it. Like that's the story he tells of like when he flew out on a private jet to fly them back and it was just boxes and boxes and boxes and stuff. There's a lot. Right? Yeah. So he talks about the most expensive book that he like just singular, just the book. It's the one book. And so, yeah. And so he started buying this book and he started buying other books and he's like, I need a place to put these and they have this plot of land that they weren't using. He's like, what if so he started talking to his architecture friend now you're going to have to go there for the full story. I want to highlight the books. The first groups of books that he started to get was Napoleon Hill books. And like he got laws of success. And if you guys have read laws of success or even heard of it, you've heard of it. Go listen to it. Go buy it. Go through it. But there's two versions. It was published in 1925 as an individual booklets. And then it was massively edited. Like by publishers and Andrew Carnegie and all these groups. And so that's how the story goes anyways. And because of that the book that he published in 1925 is not the book that you have available to you. Russell has the original 1925 edition signed in 1926. And so he showed that he showed thinking grow rich and was able to walk through that and be able to show us like the different. Oh my gosh. He showed us the book. And then he's like, Oh, and by the way, I'm publishing the book myself. And it's, oh my gosh, it's all going to be housed in this beautiful amazing place. Oh my gosh. So yeah. Yeah, the the one that he's read the thinking grow rich. He's like, look, I wrote the forward thought that was that one right. Then the new version of it. The rep print. So that was pretty cool. Okay, but then he started talking about his favorite Napoleon Hill book and you have a story to tell about that right then. Yes, I do. Okay, so you first you first. It is type it down below. Yeah, so if you know what his favorite Napoleon Hill book is put in the comments, but there's a sequel to this book. And it never was published. It was like, never like it was hidden like you didn't even know it existed until very recently, when he acquired the manuscript for it. That's going to be really awesome. So he has a Napoleon Hill book manuscript that never got published. And it happens to be the sequel to his favorite book. And out in the devil. Yeah, and then the sequel is outwitting the beast. Yep, and outwitting the beast the beast refers to you're going to have to watch in order to find out but it was it's brilliant. And then you're going to have to take all this all the, all the frameworks from from the laws of success and from thinking grow rich and apply them for evil. How would you take that person down. Like it's outwitting the beast is ridiculously cool outwitting the devil is available you guys can get it in an audible and all that stuff. I would highly recommend it. It's such a cool book. But there's a story behind it and I was, I was reading about it. And I'm like, I was listening to this audio version and Russell goes, you know, in that audio version there's a part that's taken out about Mormons about people who are LDS and like say what he's like yeah, he was taken out and so I went on Google and searched it come to find out it was taken out. I'm like, why would he, why would he do that so I googled outwitting the beast, or outwitting outwitting the devil Mormon, just to see come to find out one of the very first pieces of LDS fiction was a conversation about the devil. And this is founder Joseph Smith, and the devil. And it's written in the same verbiage in the same flow, all that. And Napoleon Hill talks about that right before he goes into his discussion with the devil. He talks about how this all works and we're like, why in the world would you bring it up like unless he saw that as a template first. So that's my theory. So my theory is that it was his template first, and he went and took it to the next level and were outwitting the devil which is an amazing masterpiece Russell actually owns now the original pamphlets of that discussion with Joseph Smith and the devil. Now he now he's got outwitting the devil. He's got outwitting the beast. He's got other manuscripts that you've never seen like hand of destiny. Yeah, crazy. And he has like a king of naming stuff. And so like, as we're going through this, let us know like, if you watched yesterday, what were your ahas what were your ideas like what are the things that kind of came up for you. Because I kind of want to talk about, you think it's okay to talk about the event center real quick. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, so let's go ahead and talk about the event center itself. So, do you want to take this on for me. Yeah, well so we've spent a lot of time talking about the books. Russell spent a lot of time yesterday showing the books but they all kind of culminated into this like, okay, but why have I been collecting all these books and what am I going to do with all of these. And he actually made a comment that just cracked me up of like, there's a difference between a hoarder and a collector and it's where you're keeping the stuff. So he is putting his books into the library slash museum, which is called the Atlas Research Center. And that is you're seeing like some CGI rendering of what it's going to look like here on the screen. It's going to be built right here in Boise literally behind ClickFunnels headquarters, and it's going to be library, museum, and also like an event center, if you will, for people to come and and speak, share their own expertise, their knowledge, share their presentation on stage in a room that fits about 100 people, and then have their knowledge and information archived into the Atlas Research Research Center so really cool and you're seeing like the statues the Atlas statues are going to be huge and they're going to be in the center they're going to be like, they're just going to be massive is going to be so cool to walk into. What else you want to say about the library then. So, what's fascinating is not all cool things like nobody has access to this the only way you have access to it is become a founding member on one level or another. At this point, like this is not open to the public library, because it's more like a museum and event center. And because of that, like there's things that are built into this that speak just to you. That are special just for you. And it's a it's something you need to watch in order to catch the vision like it doesn't matter how much Susan and I kind of talk about this and try to give this to you. This is something you need to watch the video, or if you guys are on the podcast, either today or tomorrow he's dropping the audio of that video so if you're unable to watch and you don't want to see all the really cool things and like see what it's going to look like and have him give you a tour of it before it's built. If you don't want that for whatever crazy reason listen to the podcast. Because it will move you. There's very few videos that Russell has put out that move me the way this did. Funnel hiking live videos can do that for me. Couple of other ones do this moved the whole audience. Every time he's put it anywhere it has changed the perspective of today is where I stand. This is what's brought me to today and this is where I choose to go. Like there was even that person who who made that comment while they watch the video. Yeah, there is an he he mentions it in the video too so there is someone that was hanging on on zoom and they were like it's now my life goal to write a book that is now that will be worthy to be in the Atlas Research Center. I was like, yeah, like, what an amazing goal. Because you'd like that would improve you beyond what you could imagine right like, if that was your goal. So cool. It's crazy like this is if you're looking for that moment where you're able to switch gears and you're able to move at a higher level. This is the best motivation I have seen yet. And it is beautiful and it is spectacular. And of course it wouldn't be Russell if you didn't get a hook a story and then an offer. There is an offer. Oh my gosh, and we wasn't just an offer. It was a million dollar offer. The million dollar offer and the first time we did it was at Mastermind in Paradise and I missed it. Susan got to hear it live. Yeah, it was crazy. And so kind of the piece of it is on the event side there are certain chairs there are certain seats that you're able to get and you have access to that seat before anybody else. You also have access to virtual seats and you have all these different things, like the full breakdown, we're going to show you where it's at and kind of walk through the page because the page itself is really cool. It's like a Kickstarter. It's cool. But Russell walked through what the offer is piece by piece. And at Mastermind in Paradise, it was a million dollar offer. And then there was like an offer worth $100,000 plus or so. Like it was crazy. Now he split it up even to an additional offer. So there's a million dollar, a $500,000, a $200,000, a $25,000 and so on and so on. He's broke it down so that way if this is part of your dream, you can take action and move forward into it. And it was really, really cool. And why is the offer important? Because there's a groundbreaking. And it's happening at the end of that month. Yes, it's happening this month. It's happening the 23rd. Like that's just a few weeks. Yeah, so groundbreaking, like I said, it's in Boise. It's right by the ClickFunnels headquarters. And Ben and I get to be there, which is going to be so cool. And it's not just a groundbreaking though. It is. There's going to be, he's bringing in speakers. He's going to give a tour of some of the collection. And then there will be the actual groundbreaking and like just a fun time and just with the people, the only people that get to come to this are the people that have purchased the seat licenses in the room. And then there's another way that you can also attend. So it's so exclusive. And the people that are going to be there are like the highest caliber people in Brussels world, right? And it's not something that's like streamable. Like there's there's processes to this. So he's moved the library. He set it up somewhere else. He's got PT Barnum stuff. He's got Napoleon Hill stuff. He's got, and it's all organized and collected and beautiful. They've been like perfecting it. And it's, even when it's at right now, it's worth seeing like, I've been able to see several people go and see this have early access. And then Eileen Wilder, Annie Grace, and to see Annie, Eileen Wilder is just an awe, she's going through it. But Annie Grace, it was so cool. She, Russell showed her everything like this is this room in this room. And then she just kind of had her opportunity to walk around. And she stood in front of this book. And she just utter reverence just looking through the pages of these books. And it's the coolest experience like, in the podcasting room where Russell does all of his podcasting, that's his Napoleon Hill stuff. And you will go into that room, you shut the door and there's this special feeling. Like you're surrounded by all this history. And all these different, it's just, there's something special about all of this. And if you want to feel it, you need to go experience it. It's cool. Like, I think there's something that's touching everybody, it's unique to each of us. But it's something that endures in all of us. And so this is the keys to secrets of success. And it is so, so, so cool. Yeah. I'm really excited for the groundbreaking day because I've only so in person, I've only been able to really look at a couple of his books. And that was yesterday. I had, we were, we were done with the stream. And I was like, okay, I'm going to run up on the stage and the stage like, you know, in the room where they stream, right? Russell just kind of putting some stuff away a little bit. I'm like, I got to go ask. Okay. So I went up there. I was like, Russell, can you show me? Because I'm also Mormon. I was like, can you show me the Book of Mormon and the Book of Commandments? And he's like, oh yeah, he's like flip. I'm like, I'm not touching them. Like, you have to show them to me. I was like afraid. But he was just flipping through them, some of the pages very delicately, right? And it was just so cool. And I mentioned to him, I was like, you just imagine the hands that have touched this. And that's true for any of the books in the entire collection that he has, right? Like just imagine being able to come out here and get the tour of some of the books and being able to be close to them. You can smell them and just imagine like the hands that touched the books. So awesome. So I'm really excited for that day. I'm like, all of these are going to be under glass once the building is built. Yeah, like this is your opportunity to be able to see them before they are encased forever and preserved. And so it's, it's going to be worth it. So please go and watch. Can we walk him through the page real quick? I think that'd be really fun. Yeah, let's do it. All right, so I think so the coolest thing about this, like so we have come look at the page look at the offer, like buy the stuff right, but like the page itself is just the way that it's set up like Kickstarter style is really cool. And it's beautiful and it really does a great job of showing the the the center and like it just like is classic looking like how awesome. But yeah, the side scroll thing with the with the offers over there are the different options. So, so awesome. So anyway, what else do you want to say about this page Ben? No, it's number one, this is built in 2.0. a.k.a. Yes 2.0 works. Yes, we're taking payments of $25,000 and deposits and all that stuff right now it is working like there's so much that's cool here. It's beautifully designed, it's sleek, it's clean. And a lot of you guys, if you guys have questions, this is the place to go for it. And this is, it's interesting, like a lot of us look for that opportunity, I don't know why a lot of us have always looked for that opportunity that really calls us, or we feel like we're part of that. This is part of our, our next step. And I've never looked at a page, an offer page, more fondly like I've had that moment where I'm like I need to buy this because it's 997 and it can change my life. Oh, it is 997. I've had that experience before. I've had that experience when it's $10,000 and when it's more. But to be able to, this is a unique offer. And Russell explains why it's genuinely a ridiculous offer. He's like rethinking the price points as he's on the stage, oh my gosh, this is a bad idea. This is way too cheap. By the way, they've already gone, like these are different offers and different packages than what he presented in Mexico. So like, the urgency is real and the scarcity is real. And you've got, I mean, obviously you get to choose your seats. And so that's it. But like the price went up from stuff from from Mastermind and Paradise. And there's so many cool things. One of my favorite parts of this offer, by the way, let's choose the million dollar offer. Number one, you get to do, if you do the million dollars, you get to do a live event from the center. You get to have three implementation events. This is you going through with the ClickFunnels team and building out your business. And so it follows the process that Russell is building all of it, restructuring everything under. If it doesn't fall under that way. So you're going to get those implementation events in order to be able to help you do that. And that's just ridiculous. But one of the most powerful things here for me is the virtual seat licenses. You have the ability to be able to have first dibs on a seat when he has Oprah come and speak or Tony Robbins or Dean or, you know, name all the all the people that you would want to speak at this event. You have the first dibs. But you also have 40 seats and you get to sell the tickets for them. You do. And that's crazy. One of the coolest things ever. And so if you pay a million dollars, you get 40 virtual seats. If you're, if you've got the founding member, which is FAPRNRK, you get 30. And the number just keeps dropping piece after piece. I think that's the lowest you get yet. So if you do the $200,000, you get 20 virtual seat licenses. And that's, it's just, it's beyond crazy, my friends. It is beyond crazy and extremely well worth it. But the best place to go is to go and actually jump in on this is going to be secrets of success.com slash Atlas. Go register and watch the replay. Because Russell said like if there was something that he was doing for the next several decades, this is it. And it's going to be such an interesting ride. And I am so stoked to be able to watch, to be able to support, to be able to freak out with you guys. Go and watch the replay. It is, it's moving. I don't know if there's any other way to put it. You will look at your life differently. What's brought you up to this point and where you want to go. It really does. I agree. I think he said it all. I think that's what I was going to talk about. So awesome. Yeah. Go ahead. I was going to say, I think that that's, I think that's all that we had today. Again, that's secrets of success.com slash Atlas to be able to go and register and watch the whole thing is well worth it. I think it was about 90 minutes long. It's worth every moment of it. And, and there's some other like if there, we just talked about the offers for securing like a seat license and getting virtual tickets, virtual seats, but there's some other offers on that page. You can go check out that if you're just like, oh, I just want to be at the groundbreaking. Like it would be so cool to be at the groundbreaking. Like there's some options for that too. Like any level that you want to participate in this project, there's probably something that'll work for you. So yeah. Okay. Change the world. It's so cool. So everybody, thank you for being here today. We love seeing a funnel hacker TV if you guys want to be able to skip notification, let me go live again on Tuesday, we're going live with a special guest who's going to talk about how to be able to find a funnel builder or if you are a funnel builder, how to get in on the inside lane to be able to find work. So it's for both of you. If you guys want to hear how that process goes, you're going to want to be there on Tuesday, 1pm. Mountain 3pm Eastern. And if you guys want notifications text FHT FH TV to 208 23137 97 or go to funnel hacker TV and get the get the recaps there. So everybody, thank you for being there. Once again, my name is Susan. My name is Ben. We'll see you guys next time. My name is Russell Brunson, and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash for venture capitalists to get started, and we don't even have gold to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you. It's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you, who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers, and these are our stories. We are funnel hackers.
