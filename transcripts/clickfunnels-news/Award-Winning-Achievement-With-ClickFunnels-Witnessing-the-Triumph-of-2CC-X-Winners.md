Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels, and today I'm joined by Carl Parnell. Carl started as a rock star touring the world for almost 20 years, playing with bands like Metallica. He also worked at Microsoft and marketing agencies, honing his course creation and sales crafts for a decade. Now he's been on a mission for the last four years to help experts turn their brilliance into courses of their own. He's received the 2, Club Award and is well on his way to the 2, Club X Award. And more importantly, he has helped over 900 clients turn what they know into an online course that sells. He uses a very simple and straightforward book of call funnel with ClickFunnels to build his business. Welcome Carl, thanks for joining me today. Hello, big fan, long time listener, first time viewer. Yeah, so you have a very fascinating background story, and I'd love to hear a little bit more about life as a musician and how you basically decided to leave the road and become a full-time marketer. Yeah, it's been an interesting couple of decades, actually. So yeah, life started out when I was in my teens, like listening to Metallica and my little Walkman doing my paper round. And I was like, ah, this is awesome. And then a few friends got together, we started a little band, did the whole local scene thing, ended up getting signed, ended up touring the world for almost 20 years. Pretty intense, very fun. I can't remember most of it, which is a sign of good time, I guess. But obviously, being in a band for that long, in a metal band, it's at least difficult to earn any money. We didn't do it for the money, obviously. I was able to quit probably about 10 years sooner. So alongside that, I got a job at Microsoft. Initially, I was testing Xbox games. I used to work on the Xbox console testing and certifying games on the console. I was doing some internal courses there. And then alongside that, I used to start working at some market agencies as well. And that kind of sparked my interest in terms of, well, quitting, learning the ropes, learning the absolute basics. And I did that alongside the band for about 10 years. And it just got to the point where I was in the band for 20 years, body was like, you can't do this much longer. Like, I had my fun, let's put it that way. But it wasn't viable enough to keep playing as much as I'd like. And I was like, maybe I should actually get some sort of career now after. Because I had no proper job really. I did like Microsoft on the side whilst being in the band. Never had a proper job. So I was like, okay, focused on the marketing agencies, working for those. And then, yeah, from there I ended up actually, before I did marketing for other people, I was doing like e-commerce. So I built a few e-commerce stores. They weren't really well. Then I had people asking me like, how are you doing so well with these e-commerce stores? And I was like, maybe I could teach them one to one. And then I like Baldwin office. Like maybe I just record the process and just give it to them. And then off the back of that, that went really well. I actually ended up creating a course, teaching that stuff. And that went great. And then I had more and more people being like, Carl, what's going on? How are you selling this course so well? I focused on just organic to sell it. Had loads of people asking me like, how are you selling it so well? I was like, I can just show you. Based off my decade of experience in marketing, and then my experience building the courses and stuff. I was like, let me just show you. And that's kind of brought me to where I am today. It's, yeah, it's been a very odd journey, but looking back, it's a classic case of, when you look back, it all makes sense to the point you're at right now, but when you're looking forward, it doesn't always make sense. Like the logical next step is always a bit weird and misty, but I wouldn't have had it any other way. Like it's, yeah, it's been a fun journey, an interesting journey up and down, as it should be. It sounds very fun. And you had a pretty long road, a long run with being in the band. So did you always have this like innate characteristic of or passion for marketing, or did you just kind of discover it as you were looking for a different career? Yeah, it really was that. I mean, I had no interest in marketing or anything at all whilst I was doing the band. The band consisted of me just waking up in a random country or town every day. And I was like, okay, what am I gonna do for all day until I play? If I wasn't drinking, I was just on the internet. And then I grew up, stopped drinking, and I was like, okay, maybe I should actually start to look into something more substantial. And I found out about things like affiliate marketing and drop shipping. And I was like, okay, these seems like viable things I could potentially do on the road. And that's what led me down this path of marketing in general. And did you have any prior education or experience in it? None. I did terrible at school. Like I couldn't focus or concentrate on anything. All my grades were just terrible. I attempted college for like half a year and just dropped out. I was like, I thought I was stupid at the time. I just, looking back now, it's just, I just didn't learn in the same capacity that they taught. Right. I thought I was just really, really stupid and I just couldn't absorb any information. But when I found like marketing or just learning self-paced on the internet, I was like, actually I can start to find and figure out how I can actually absorb this information and apply it in my own way. And then that was it. I just exploded from there. Yeah. It's interesting how it all kind of boils down to the method in which you choose to learn because standardized education isn't necessarily for everybody, but you can learn things, especially if you find the joy in it based on your own personality and the things that you like to do. And clearly you, it escalated rather quickly for you. I mean, you started, you know, dabbling in different online businesses. And I mean, I can see the award on your wall right now. I mean, that's no small feat that you went from dabbling into e-commerce and playing with online digital marketing and working with agencies to building a business that has made over a million dollars in sales. Like that's a pretty big deal. Is, yeah, I do need to remind myself how far I've come. Like it's easy to take for granted, you know, having that all important award. Where is it? There we go. Yeah, it's not easy. It shouldn't be easy. I mean, there is often a clear path that people can take, but it does take a lot of hard work, a lot of consistency. Like this is all I've done for the last few years now. So it's something that people can dabble with in and around like the full-time jobs and stuff, but they get stuck at tip and point where like, okay, let's go, let's take it seriously. And when that happens, like it's, I see it as like the world's most annoying like puzzle, like jigsaw puzzle or like task. Because there's always things that I like working and not working and I just can't sleep. I sleep, but I can't stop thinking about these micro things that I wanna test and change all the time. It drives me mad, but in a good way. And that's what always makes me wanna grow the business and get better and learn. And like that feeling never goes away. Like I guarantee anyone that gets the same awards, you get to that award and then like, let's keep going. Like. Yeah, you've definitely found your groove. Like if you're thinking about those things and they're keeping you up at night and you're thinking about testing and optimizing and changing things in your business to help it grow, you're probably doing the right thing. It's just, I've just hardwired my brain now into this track and I'm not believing it now. Like I can't. So it's fun. It's fun to me like having to figure these things out. And obviously the flip side of that is the more I learn, like my clients learn from me and helping them, you know, grow their businesses. It's just constant. It's a good exercise for the brain that's put it that way. Yeah. And I'd love to get into that. You mentioned your clients and you've had quite a few of them now. What specifically led you to using ClickFunnels for your book of call sales funnel? Just seeing the word ClickFunnels forever on the internet. Obviously Russell being awesome and seeing all the other marketers in this same industry using ClickFunnels. It was a no brainer for me to use it. Cause obviously I've been through funnels before and saw webinars and all the different pages and stuff. I was like, why wouldn't I use it myself? And you know, the barrier to entry to use it relatively low cost or very low cost. So I was like, why not just give it a go, put a funnel together and here we are. It's, and I've barely changed the funnels since I used it. I mean, there's a lot of features to ClickFunnels. I don't even know exists. I don't use them. I don't need to use them. I'm sure there's loads of stuff. If I used it, it probably would benefit my business. So you keep it simple. That's it for me. It really has been a case of, said it and forget it. Like I set up this initial core funnel three plus years ago now. And it's not, it's the same funnel, exact same funnel. I just obviously update a few words and headlines and put it in the webinar video if I do any webinar. Other than that, it's the exact same funnel. And it's- Wow. Has it always been Book of Call funnel or did you experiment with others and you found success with Book of Call and that just seemed to be the best method for you? I did have an initial run where my first program was webinar to sales page because it was lower cost and that still worked great. But then when I wanted to then go to the high ticket realm, I knew I had to kind of switch to Book of Call. But the process was the same, the same basically. I just had to change a few elements of my webinar from here's what's in my program, buy now to if you wanna learn more about my program and work with me, here's a link to Book of Call. And that was it. And then the sales page turned into a calendar page and application page and that was it. So very easy to change and update. Very cool. What kind of goals do you have for your business going forward now that you've reached the two comma club award? So monetary, I've often like everyone wants to make money obviously, like it's not the beyond and end all. But what I've thankfully found is the more I wanna aspire to in terms of revenue, that actually has a knock on effect on obviously the more money I make, it means the more clients I enroll, the more clients I enroll, the more people I can help. Also I've gotten to the point where thankfully I've got a team cause for the first like almost two years, I didn't have anyone, it was literally just me. I mean, I got to like the first million almost on my own. Wow. I wouldn't recommend it. It sounds like a lot. Yeah, I did it, but in hindsight, having a great team would have made it a lot smoother. But yeah, the more I grow the business, it just has a direct impact on my team. You know, they have families and goals and aspirations. The more I wanna grow it, the more it impacts their lives. And then obviously my clients, the more we enroll, the more we can help and it changes their lives as well. So yeah, I just, I also want to have that to come a club X award next to it. So why not? That's all kind of gels together into a worthwhile goal. Yeah, it's a great goal to have. And I hope just the next time we have this conversation, I imagine it already being on your wall right next to that other one. So do you have any, like what's your most impactful piece of advice for people who are maybe starting this? And maybe they are on their own because they're just getting started and they don't have a team yet, but they have big aspirations for creating a business and building something similar to what you've built. What would you tell them? A couple of things, one would be don't lose sight on the big picture of why you're doing it. Obviously a lot of people get into this space, depending on what you're doing to obviously make money, like initial money and stuff. It's money's fun and it's nice and it relieves a lot of pressure that people have for bills and work and all that kind of stuff. But there's always a bigger goal. Like you can always make more money, that's fine. But having a big end goal in your personal life is paramount. So you'll obviously look around at current situation, friends, family, like who would you want to support if you're in this advantageous position and really take stock of that, make a list of all the people you'd love to support and help. You know, the big picture stuff if you'd like to move somewhere. What is that for you, if you don't mind me asking? To be honest, I actually, I'm already there. Like I can always get a bigger house and I've had all the fancy cars. I've already sold them, cause I already got bored. All that hassle had a boat. Like this time last year I had three cars and a boat. I thought, what the hell am I doing? Got rid of it. I already live like where I lived. Like it's on the cliff edge here in South UK. There's a place called Devon in the UK. It's like route right down the corner by Cornwall. I'm on a cliff edge with a CVU, the private beach down at the bottom of the cliff. Oh wow. That's, I can, I ruled higher here in like five years probably. Yeah. And it didn't, yeah, it's crazy. So I've kind of already reached that goal in terms of I don't want to, I don't need a massive fancy mansion and all these cars and stuff. Like I've kind of got over that necessity to look at the friction important on the internet. I don't care anymore. I mean, obviously looking at me, I don't care anyway, but it's not important for me, but. Now do you feel like you pass that onto the clients that you work with? Like you want them to achieve that level of, you know, I've made it? Definitely, yeah. Cause they all come to me at different points in their life. Some already up and running, they have a business, they just want me to help them grow it. Other people, they have a full-time job and they know it's not for them. Like they know they're worth more than the nine to five working for other people thing. So yeah, that's why really, that's the thing I enjoy the most is when I do my coaching calls with my clients or they send me messages by like, hey, I just made my first 10 grand or six figures or seven figures even. I know that that's having a direct impact on their life, their family, giving them just opportunity to do what they truly want to do in life. And that's worth its weight in gold to me. It really is. That's beautiful. Especially coming from someone like you, who you know, you're an artist, you have a background of music. Like people obviously can relate to you because you've had these other passions in your artistic and it's not just about making money, but truly finding what it is that you love and pursuing that because you've been there, you've done that and now you're pursuing something else that you didn't even know you had a passion for. You started doing it, you started working with clients and you saw the impact that it had on others. So I imagine that that resonates with your clients really well, knowing that you're doing it because you love it. Yeah, if you can combine enjoyment and creativity with a way to make a great living that helps other people, then that's it to me. Like I couldn't be, I've done the jobs and stuff, like in the office, working for other people, like very kind of one track thing. And it wasn't fulfilling. I kind of enjoyed the learning aspect of it, but the fulfillment aspect wasn't fulfilling at all. I always knew I was just wasting my time essentially. So if I can help other people turn what they're already amazing at into something that really, changing to their life, changing their clients' lives, then that's what keeps me motivated. I love that. So where can people go to learn more about you and your business? They can check out my book a call funnel because that's the only thing I have on the internet. I don't have a traditional website. I don't have anything really. I've got my social media channels, like Instagram and Facebook, that's it. Okay. And where can they go to find your funnel? Just www.callparnel.co. That's it. That's it. And they can check out my free training, I've got a free webinar, they can check it out, they can see what I do, check out my story, see if I can help, if applicable. Awesome. Anything else you wanna share today, Carl? No, other than I need to get over there for one of the fun outing live events. Yes, please do that.
