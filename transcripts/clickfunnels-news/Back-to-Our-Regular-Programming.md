Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We're back with our regular programming. We are all swagged out with our stuff from Funnel Hacking Live. And we got some stuff to talk about today. So we'll get into it as well as with Trivia and Treasures coming up right after we roll the intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers, and these are our stories. MUSIC What is up, Funnel Hackers? Welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. My name is Ben Moot, and this is... Susan Lenardson. And we get to join you guys every couple of... a Funnel Hacker sweatshirt you don't want to miss. So we're going to be doing Trivia and Treasures. It's probably the first time we're going to go easy on you. Then next, we're going to do the water cooler. After that, we're going to talk a little bit about what's going on with some of you. We want to highlight you, and I'm getting a lot of questions right now about what's going on with 2.0. We need to answer all of that and more. We're so excited to have you guys on. So just have a great conversation. How are you doing, Susan? I'm doing amazing, especially this week versus last week. I think we all kind of caught something. Now we're back to normal, and it's like, all right, let's do this. Absolutely. I've been talking to so many people who are at FHL, and they're just getting into all their plans that they created so I can feel that buzz within the community of just go time. Let's get it done. Yes. That's really cool. So here's the deal, guys. If you're not on the texting list, that way you know every time we go live, text FHTV to 2082313797. That way you get notified. Those of you guys who are new, say hello. This is live. Like, this is legit. It is 3.27 PM Eastern Standard Time. We are so excited. Yep. Susan's watching. We're watching comments. Say hello. We're watching the comments. We want to say hello to you guys. We want to know what's going on. And so say hello. We're watching. We're paying attention to you guys. This show is meant for you. The whole goal of Funnel Hacker TV is to help the community feel connected. That's the entire point of this. And so because of that, we figured why not do a trivia and treasures this time? Why don't we give something away so that way a Funnel Hacker gets a mixture swag? That's how cool. We're not. We gave a lot of stuff away last couple of weeks when you were with us in person, but it's time to do something on Funnel Hacker TV again. So and I switched Ben submitted as an idea for a question. I totally switched it up on him. So not even Ben's seen this one yet. And mine was complicated. OK, this, if you guys have been paying attention, this should be an easy one for you. OK, so complete this, David. Is it fray or fry? I never get it right. Statement that Russell Brunson quotes, if you don't have blank, then you don't have a business. Is it you don't have customers? You don't have an email list? You don't have continuity? Or you don't have a SaaS product? Which thing is it? If you don't have it, you don't have a business, according to David Fry. Fry, somebody correct me on that one. And David Fry. Fry. All right, awesome. And so put your answer down in the comments. You could put A, B, C, or D. You don't have to type out the whole answer. And we are going to give one of you who gets the right answer a awesome ClickFunnels sweatshirt. Because we are going to. This is a nice one, too. Like, I like this sweatshirt. Yeah. We're making quality swag. I like it. Amazing. OK, oh my gosh, we got Timothy. We got Mike. We've got Terry watching. You don't know. Just guess. Like, literally, there's no reason not to guess. Just throw it in there. Yeah, amazing. We want to give you guys stuff. Awesome. OK, we'll revisit this. We'll reveal the answer at the end, and we'll revisit it maybe once before the end as well. Yeah, absolutely. So I got a message from my little sister this morning. So she is going to school. She's in college. And she was talking about how she's learning like this stuff in school. And I'm like, she worked for Russell during the summer. And I'm like, well, you know, Russell has this idea. And I started talking to her about this idea. And she messaged me this morning. She's like, Russell said exactly what you said. But you said Russell said it. It's right here. And so why don't we play that really quick? Because I think it's good for all of us to have a refresher. He talks about it in Expert Secrets. Let's roll that video. Now, as a con artist, you probably saw a little about him in the movie Catch Me If You Can. But if you read the book Catch Me If You Can, it's even better because in there he shares a story that can help you as an entrepreneur to make way more money as you are leading your audience. Frank actually taught a semester at Brigham Young University. It was actually an advanced sociology class, but he didn't know anything about it. He showed it the very first day, sat down. There was no teacher. So he decided to stand up and start teaching. He taught an entire semester. And years later, when he got caught and got captured, the FBI was asking him, how in the world were you able to teach this advanced sociology class? He said something so profound and so simple. He said, all I had to do is, the night before, I'd read the book and I'd stay one chapter ahead. Now, this is a powerful lesson for any of you guys who are trying to become influencers, leaders, experts, who are trying to change lives with somebody you feel like you've been called to serve. A lot of times, we have so much fear, because I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. I don't know how to do all this kind of stuff. You have to understand you don't have to be the perfect person. You just have to be one step ahead of where the audience you're trying to serve is. For me, if I would have waited until I was ready to teach people about funnels and marketing and business, I'd still be waiting to this day. If you want to build a thriving expert business and help your audience, all you have to do is remember, you got to stay one chapter ahead. Word's so good. OK. Yes. That's such amazing permission. If you ever needed that permission, that advice is amazing. But none of us are the know-all, be-all, of anything. Really, there's always somebody that's going to know more than us, always. And so it's awesome to, if that's something that's been holding you up, of like, I need to go learn more. There's always somebody that also doesn't know as much as you do. Just go and do the thing. Go and help those people. Yeah, it's a question that I got at Funnel Hiking Live a lot, too. Like, I don't know where to start. Like, who should my audience be? And I'm like, the easiest way for you to find your audience is go one step below what you know and talk to them. So reverse engineer, just slip it on its head. You do that suddenly like you're talking to your perfect customer. You're not trying to talk five levels below and trying to get them to that basic part of, this is how you buy a domain. Like, you should start close to where you are. Number one, makes the customer a much better buyer. But number two, it also increases your ability to realize that you're also running. Like, it's your job to go and continue learning. Like, you've got to state the next chapter ahead and the next chapters continue to grow. So it helps influence your growth as well. So. Awesome. Thanks, Russell, for sharing that with us. Thank you, Russell. Also, they shared this really cool video. It's like a point of view video. So like, what is it like one day when you get your two Comical Award? I wanted to throw that up real quick. That's a really fun idea. Yeah, it's cool. It's like, I want you to imagine that this is you receiving your two Comical Award at Funnel Hiking Live 2025. This is the next Funnel Hiking Live. This is you. How cool is that? Like, I would take this video and I would like play it every single day. If you guys are like, if this is you, this is what you're doing, like, this is the vision board. This is what you do. It's so cool. Very cool. I didn't realize that we even did that. Oh, my gosh. OK, yeah, definitely have that one playing on repeat. Make it your vision board. Amazing. OK. All right, we've got a hacker hero that we want to actually a few because we've kind of been preoccupied. And while we've been busy, there's still been user spotlights that are being published every week. So we've got Joel Vasquez. Is he the latest one? Yeah, let's go ahead and share my screen first. Or really quick? Yeah, that's OK. Yeah, let's go ahead and share my screen and then we'll share his with the audio. But if you guys aren't on the YouTube channel and you're not following the ClickFunnels official, you should subscribe and ring the bell for all the notifications. Joel Vasquez just came out with his quite recently. You guys can see it on the playlist right here. But who we haven't covered yet. We haven't covered Carl Parnell. We haven't covered Sherry Ronning. Like, these just keep building it. Each of them are stories from people just like you. And they are really powerful, really moving. The last one that we highlighted was Gary Guerrero. And he had like this section right in the middle that was super powerful. You know what's really cool about watching these is that, yes, they're telling their story. And usually there's always a level of success for them to be chosen for user spotlight. Sometimes it's like a smaller success. Sometimes it's a huge success, like depending on your perspective of it. But what's really, really awesome is that in every single one, there's like a golden nugget to take from it. Like, oh, they totally gave me an idea just from them telling their story what they did. I hope Ben totally is frozen. I thought he had something amazing to share with us. So yeah, Sherry Ronning, a lot of these got posted very recently. So I haven't even had the chance to go watch them yet. Ben, what were you going to say? And Sherry's is great. One of the things that we've been doing too is, because these are so powerful, we've been taking snippets out of them. And like saving those snippets for later. Dude, quick. So if you haven't watched Jules yet, get the snippet. And you can go catch up because it's really, really good. Amazing. Oh my gosh. OK, Sherry, I actually met her at Funnel Hacking Live. She's a chef. She's running a chef of business using ClickFunnels. Really, really awesome to meet her. And so it's just so cool to see what everybody's doing. There's so many different kinds of businesses that are being. We're out there. Super, super cool. Hey, there's somebody using ClickFunnels. All right. And then we've got, we also have Carl Parnell. And Carl is a musician. And it's actually really cool because Carl is now an ambassador, if memory serves appropriately. And so you guys get to hear from somebody who is an ambassador. And you get a really cool view into his business, what it is that he does. And I love that when he got his two comic awards, we actually highlighted him because he did a video with his dog in getting his award. So if you guys have not checked it out, go check it out. It's really cool. He talks about what it's like being a musician inside of this space as well. So we're grabbing all these highlights and just trying to prepare them for everybody. Let's go ahead and watch the highlight from Joel really quick because that video was really, really cool. Cheers. As a teen, a young adult was a lot of getting in the crime, doing hard drugs, and drinking a lot. If you had mentioned to me something about starting a business, it just went in one ear and out the other. When I took that long-term prison sentence, another inmate presented me with a book, and it was called Rich Dad Poor Dad. I did read the book. It definitely did change my life. It changed my perspective. It changed my way of thinking. It gave me self-confidence. I could be more like Rich Dad. If I start thinking success, if I start thinking, you know, I'm better than this. One of the biggest roadblocks for me was I have to do something at home because being on parole, I'm not able to just freely go around. There's going to be a lot of roadblocks and barriers to opening my own physical store or storefront. So I started reading about online businesses, and I read this book called Get Rich Click. And it talked about a system called affiliate marketing. I just drowned myself in affiliate marketing information. I started off selling other people's courses, other people's products, and services, and I made six figures doing that. So initially, I just helped people for free. And eventually, too many people asked me to help them out. So I said, maybe I should start charging. And that slowly became this idea of like, maybe I can coach people and make this my full-time business. I really, truly believe that the nine to five is another form of prison. Like, you go to work, you take orders from a boss, you come home, you barely spend time with your kids. That's a prison. ClickFunnels is showing you how do you build a million-dollar business. So take every word to heart. Make it your Bible. Yeah, I'm liking these highlights. I think they're really, really cool. Let us know if that's helpful for you guys that we're like, you know what? I actually do care about that one. I actually want to watch it. Yes, awesome. So it's so cool to see there's people from all different walks of life, all different places in their life for at the moment, all different types of businesses. It's very inspiring to watch those. All right, let's pull up the trivia question one more time before we go into our last segment. Because there's a lot of you that are jumping in. I want to give everybody a chance to win a sweatshirt that we will choose a lucky winner. All you have to do is answer this question down in the comments. So complete this David Frey. Frey? Frey. David Frey. He's a little bit of a lot of Frey. OK, that rest of the friends end quote. If you don't have the link and you don't have a business, is it A, customers, B, and enamelists, community continuity, or D, a SaaS product? So I didn't answer that. Yeah. Oh, I got some music playing. It's trivia time. Answer this. I couldn't find a tick, tick, tick sound. So I was like, you know what? Let's play something really quick. Go ahead. David Frey's statement. Put your answer down in the comments, and then we will choose a winner. Reveal the answer and choose a winner at the end of the year. OK. All right. Oh, my gosh. Have you guys been keeping up with all of the things 2.0 related? Because there's been a lot. So we have another update for you that you may have missed. Yes. And Ben can tell us about it. You bet. Now, we've been getting a lot of questions from you guys about funnel hiking live. When are you guys going to get access to everything? So we wanted to make sure that we were giving you the best information that's available. So very first thing, let's go ahead and pull up what happened on social really quick. We dropped a couple of different notes on what's just released. So if you guys look at what's happening right now with Click Funnels 2.0, right now, Clavio was just released. So we have a new integration with Clavio. You guys can use that now. If you use Clavio right now for your automations or your email sequences, you can now integrate that in. And all the beta features that were shown at FNL Hiking Live are going to be rolled out in the next couple of weeks. If you want to be on the news for that, you need to text FHTV to 208. I'm sorry. FHTV works great. You can also do pulse. You can do FHTV to 208, 231, 3797. But you can also do pulse. And pulse is where Russell actually goes live and shares the newest feature. So you guys can actually see all of that. So if you want to stay up to date when those launch out and how we do it, there's actually a really cool strategy behind it. Russell was just like, I have to say give up. Oh my gosh. So if you guys have not checked it out, go ahead and text pulse to 208, 231, 3797. So you get those updates. And Tim, I don't know if you guys know, Tim is always making these movies, these little video clips on all the news. Maybe we should just play that. And that's probably going to give us the best recap possible. Is that so cool? And if we play it, let's definitely not go to Outdoor like we planned before. Yes. Yeah, we can't do that. So let's go ahead and do that first. And then we'll do trivia and treasures right afterwards. So we'll just cut it off. That's what we talked about, Christian. The Funnel Hackers, Tim Pitztenbarger here with the ClickFunnels Community Outreach Team finally made it back home from Funnel Hacking Live. Which by the way, if I had the opportunity to meet you over there, thank you so much for that privilege. It was absolutely awesome. If you are coming back from Funnel Hacking Live, I'm sure you are still in the recovery process, just like I am the rest of the team are. Because there was just so much going on, right? Between laughing, crying, jumping, dancing, and then all of a sudden Todd and Russell get on stage and they just drop this bomb of all these incredible features that I don't even know where to start with all these updates. During Funnel Hacking Live, we did release an update regarding an integration with Klaviyu. What this means is that if you were already using Klaviyu for your email marketing, you'll be able to go ahead and create a contact and send out or trigger an email directly from ClickFunnels 2.0. So for example, if you have an opt-in page, that page will talk to Klaviyu and send them over any email address that was entered on the page. Then when ClickFunnels 2.0 sends over the information, an email can't be sent directly from Klaviyu. Now I'm sure you've seen all the pictures and videos that everyone's been uploading from their experience at Funnel Hacking Live. It's been actually dubbed as the rock concert of the marketing world. And if you do not want to miss this, make sure you go to funnelhackinglive.com and buy your tickets for our next one. I promise you, you will not regret it. So although Funnel Hacking Live is technically over, this week has already been going crazy. Todd and Russell released a ton of new beta features that absolutely blew people's minds. I told you, over the next few weeks and months, we'll be actually releasing all these features to the general public because we did give them to everyone who attended Funnel Hacking Live. So they could kind of go in and beta test and let us know if there are any hiccups or any bugs we could squash. And once that's all done, we'll go and release it to you as well if you weren't at Funnel Hacking Live. I told you to go. And as you can imagine, we are very busy recording tutorials and really cool videos to show you step by step how to use all these cool new tools so you can hit the ground running. That's it for now. Stay tuned for some really cool updates coming up very soon. And of course, here's one. Yep. He goes, remember that video that we showed the last time Funnel Hacking Live? He's like, oh my gosh, it's all over. If you guys missed that, it's actually over on YouTube. You can watch that over there. But we wanted to make sure that we got the update from Tim because it was awesome. And then last but not least, we want to make sure we give out some swag. Oh yeah, let's do it. Okay, let's pull up that question one more time. Give you guys one more chance to get your answers down in the comments. And then we're gonna quickly look through and see who's been answering. And Ben, if you could start doing that. Okay, so complete this David Fry statement that Russell Brunson quotes. If you don't have blank, then you don't have a business. Is it A, customers, B, an email list, C, continuity, or D, a SaaS product? I feel like this could be easy or hard depending on if you've been paying attention or not. Because all the answers could potentially could be argued to be true in that statement, but there's only one that is actually the quote from David Fry. Exactly. So where would they find that statement really quick? Oh my gosh, okay. If you guys have not, it's literally always right here within reach. If you have not gotten your Lynchpin book, you can go get one at Lynchpinbook.com. Super easy. And if you happen to already have it and you don't know the answer to this trivia question, you can find the answer in a big blue quote box on page wherever continuity starts. Because that is the answer. Let's go ahead and reveal the answer. Yeah, all right. So the answer is almost there. Continuity. Okay, there it is. Everybody who answered continuity, you got it right. And only one of you is going to be able to win. So let's go ahead and do this really quick. I am writing everybody's names here down really quick. Really quick. Let's see, the last one is... Oh my gosh, we have so many of you joining us right now. I'm gonna go through. Okay, we've got... I've got some of your names over here. We're gonna spin and see who this gets closest to. I got this at Funnel Hacking Live. We got a wheel. We have an official wheel. Yes, I did. All right, so... Is that everybody? Did you get everybody on there? We've got several people. Did I miss anybody? We got Mrs. Denise, Timothy, Talia, Shelley. Yep. I think that's it. Okay, Mike. Okay, and Mike? Yep, there's a Mike. Oh, Mike. So sorry, Mike. Okay, now we can do wheels. All right, here we go. And we'll see who wins. All right, so this is for the sweatshirt. So we're gonna see who wins the sweatshirt. The sweatshirt is going to be won by Shelley G. Shelley G, congratulations. All right, we'll reach out to you, Shelley, and get all the information that we need from you to send you off a really awesome sweatshirt, cozy, just in time for, I don't know where you live, but I hope you're in the States just in time for a fall. Yep, it might take a little bit to get there. Okay, oh my gosh. All right, let us know what you guys liked in this episode. Leave us feedback in the comments, because we're in this planning mode right now, of like, okay, what do we wanna bring to the Funnel Hacker TV audience? And you guys watching right now, you are the Funnel Hacker TV audience. So tell us what you want us to bring to you. What updates do you want us to keep you in the know about? If there's something we want us to show off, as far as ClickFunnels 2.0 goes, let us know that. And Timothy is firing me out a T-shirt. Okay, we need a T-shirt gun, a virtual T-shirt gun. I don't know how that would work. No. Okay, and then lastly, make sure you guys are actually subscribed to our text messages, because when we do go live, you don't wanna miss that. So text FHTV to 208231 3797. You can also go get email notifications over at funnelhacker.tv, if the texting doesn't seem to work for you. You live outside of the US. Anything else, Ben? No, that's it guys. We have so much coming. We have guests coming for the next couple of Funnel Hacker TVs. You wanna make sure that you are not away because there are some really juicy details about things that are coming up, that you do not want to have FOMO over. So Thursday is gonna be very, very important. Make sure that you are here and make sure you're getting notifications. If you're not, it's once again, Thursday, same time, same place, we'll see you guys there. I'm sorry. My name is Russell Brunson and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started and we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
