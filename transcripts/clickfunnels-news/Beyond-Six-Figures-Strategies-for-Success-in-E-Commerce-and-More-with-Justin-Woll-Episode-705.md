## Transcript
Ever since I was like really, really young, I always had an eye for marketing. I would always kind of pick apart and always be very critical of thinking that I could do it better. We're dealing with 20, 30 day shipping times, shady suppliers, the whole thing was the Wild West. It's not instantly 100K a month overnight, right? You have to build up foundations and real systems and structure and do things consistently and have a system for product research, have a system for targeting, have a system for ad creation, landing page creation, ad copy, launch it. I told two of my best friends when I was really young, I'm like, hey guys, I'm doing this and I'm committing to this, I'm going to make it work. Right? They're like, oh, that's cool. We're just all young guys and I wouldn't really care, right? But that was like the switch in my head right new. Hey, this is what I'm doing and this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. And I'm going to force it and I'm going to make it work.

And we've got an incredible guest here with us today that's been in the ClickFunnels community for quite some time and has done incredible work over probably the last near decade, not only for himself, but for tons of students as well. But before we get to him, I can't help but to introduce the best co-host in the game, Chris Cameron. What's up, man? Hey, what's up, Ben? Good to see you, man. Excited to be here. Excited for this conversation, too. Like this guy's multiple two-comic club award winner, like two comic club acts, like legit. Oh, yeah. And this gentleman has really, I don't want to say cracked the code, but really mastered the fundamentals and the education side, because you really don't know something in my opinion, unless you can teach it to others. And something that's been able to be replicated so many times. Again, multiple two-comic club award winner, eight-figure award winner. Please welcome Justin Wall to ClickFunnels Radio. Justin, what's up, man? Not much. Not much. Thank you so much, Ben, Chris, for being here today. Very excited to get rocking our own. And really just, really sad to have a conversation with you guys, going back and forth, talking about what we were able to make happen, how we did it all. And it's just absolute pleasure to be here today. Thank you guys so much. I'm so excited. Before we get into like a lot of the technical stuff, I want to hit this because we said we're going to bring this up. You're in Boca now, like you're in kind of nice area. You've seen some success. But, you know, some people have a flex where they drive cars, you know, they tell out the two comic club awards, you know, awards and stuff like that. But you have one of the coolest flexes I've ever heard. So like you just had who move in next to you. You got to tell us the story. Yeah. So I mean, first of all, it was this hilarious way to put it, Chris. And I think that's definitely super funny. And it's so random because I'm just walking down the street one day, walking, you know, on a Zoom call and my neighbor pulls out to me. He says, Hey, Justin, jump in the car. I want to show you something. And, you know, my mom always told me not to get in the car with strangers, but he's my neighbor. He's not that much of a stranger. So I hopped in, right. And he took me to my neighbor's house and he's like, you see who's moving in there? I'm like, yeah, I guess that's Mike Tyson. So Mike Tyson moved in. So we have Mike Tyson as our neighbor now, which is cool. Luckily we still have our ears intact, which is good, but no rocket. Yeah. Well, here's the bokeh. Go ahead, Ben. Let's say the Boca police department's useless now. Just call Mike Tyson to come over and speed up anybody. Oh yeah. I told him we don't, no more HOA. We don't need any gate guard. Just we got Mike Tyson as neighbor. We're good. Oh my gosh. Yeah. So like, listen, if you want to make a lot of money, that's cool. But listen, not many people live next to Mike Tyson. Like you've made it, man. Does it get better than that? It's like the pinnacle. It's definitely a cool flex, right? And it's kind of like the party trick. Like something gets quieter, awkward. I'm like, hey, by the way, Mike Tyson's my neighbor. That's right. Everybody wants to know, does he have a tiger? Does he have a tiger? So unfortunately, I haven't seen a tiger yet, right? He does have a fenced in backyard, which is good. So not too nervous, but so far no tiger. You can't confirm or deny. There may be a tiger. It might be in the basement. Who knows what's going on, but so far so good. But I hear he keeps great care of his tiger, which is awesome. So the tiger's doing well. You're not from Boca originally though. So you said you grew up in New Jersey? Tell us a little bit about your upbringing and how you actually became an entrepreneur. Like what's that story? Yeah. Yeah. So I've actually been building business online since I was like 13, 14 years old. Holy cow. I'm 28 now, where I became a millionaire at 23. So I got started super early because I was just really invested in just learning in business and systems at the time. I was just super, super infatuated with it. Due to a lot of things that was going on in my life that kind of pushed me into that direction. I got involved with YouTube and team building. I was doing a particular YouTube channel that I would have for a specific video game, like Call of Duty, which is cool. Built a really notable team in Call of Duty when I was super young. A lot of my people, my staff were like, you know, double my age and whatnot. So I didn't tell anyone like my name or my actual age. I just had my eyeliner on Elias. I ran a staff like 60, 70 people at like 14 to 15, which is really cool. And I ended up selling out. Well, you're 60 to 70 at 14. Yeah. Yeah. My kids might still have been playing T-ball, dude. At 14. It definitely kept me busy, right? And I would say that's definitely what got my entrepreneurial excitement going, which is really cool. And if anyone's familiar with like Phase Clan or any of that cool stuff, Phase Clan's huge, right? Really respectable team in the gaming industry. We were young and I was building out another notable team that was kind of rubbing the shoulders at Phase Clan. And I ended up selling that kind of portion of my company off to other people in the marketplace and my staff and a lot of my co-leaders, et cetera, that I recruited from scratch got recruited by Phase, which then became like a billionaire company on the stock market, which is really cool. Shout out to Phase, great people. And yeah, like overall, that's how I got started, kind of building online, super, super young. I wasn't, I was good at the game, but I was really good at the business, at the marketing, right? And really just piecing things together to make the team become elevated, which is really cool. So that was kind of the start of things. And then I transitioned into, you know, e-commerce and marketing systems thereafter, as that was my entry to just understanding that e-commerce and overall just online business was an incredible, incredible movement forward. And I couldn't have asked for a better kind of way to dip my toes in. Wow, that's insane. And from that point, I guess, you know, really got you ingrained into the, you know, the online world. What's got you interested in just selling products on the internet? So the biggest thing for me is like, I liked to not be always seen, right? I like to do my business from behind the scenes, like build the company and the company would move forward and do its thing and I don't have to be the face of it, right? Which is, which is cool. So that was my initial kind of jump into the field. I started building, you know, a lot of different physical product e-commerce brands in my early days, all the way up to me going to Rutgers University in which I ended up winning the Entrepreneurship Award there. I had like all 60,000 people. I had like four companies, like three subscription box companies, one other physical product brand, and also my consulting company at the time that I had built up over the years prior. And I ended up dropping out of Rutgers, right? And just going full force with everything that I had going on. So I guess you could say the most important thing for me kind of getting into the mix and the flow of e-commerce was the fact that I was exposed to it my whole life, right? I knew what the opportunity was. I knew, I knew that it wasn't easy, right? It wasn't overnight. You have to like compound your progress and compound your success each and every day. And I love that I could do that from my house, right? I didn't have to go out and be on camera, etc. And it's funny now because I'm on camera a lot now at this point, but when I was super young, I told myself, hey, I know I'm going to be successful. I know it from deep down, but I'm never going to show my face. I don't ever want to be public, right? I just want to be the guy who builds companies from behind the scenes. And it's funny how things turned out now, right? I made all that happen and I kind of transitioned to more like the public camera type ideology, but you know, kind of. I'd love to dive into that too, because I mean, you hear Steve Larson even he tells this story about, you know, I will do everything Russell Brunson says, but I'm not going to publish, right? And I think along the way, when people have this entrepreneurial journey, they struggle with that, right? It's sometimes it seems disingenuous or, you know, people don't want to be braggadocious or they don't want to be front and center. And it fills icky to them. But do you think, I mean, this happened to you, there's a transition. Is that necessary for every entrepreneur? If they want to scale like at some point, you have to own the fact that you're the attractive character or can you stay behind the scene? Oh yeah. Well, I think there's maybe two different prompts though, right? You could definitely stay behind the scenes and do extremely extremely phenomenal and well and scale to heights that you never imagined, right? But I feel like if you're trying to get the most juice out of life, right? And you're trying to really make the most out of what you're doing and your efforts and your energy, it's never going to hurt, right? Unless, you know, you're someone who, you know, is not able to hold themself or carry themself well, right? You're able to obviously elevate your move but elevate your opportunity by doing so, by being on camera, by pushing yourself out there. And ultimately it becomes a certain point where you know these skills that we've done, these certain things, we know how to do these things. It's almost a disservice to not go out there and openly proclaim it and help other individuals do the same exact thing, right? So I think there comes a time where, you know, you love what you do to the point where you just want to help other people do the same dang thing that you did, you know? So I guess maybe multi-pronged. Was that the transition for you? What was it like when you're like, okay, it's time for me to kind of like step out from behind the shadows and actually come into the spotlight? What was the transition like? That's a phenomenal, phenomenal question, Chris. Initially, so when I first started to do very, very well with e-commerce, overall like physical product brands and scaling them heavily, like hitting 30, 40, 50K plus days, we would, or I would, post my, all my screenshots and all my cool numbers in all these Facebook groups, right? Like e-com empires, which is the biggest, one of the biggest Facebook groups in the early days. I actually ended up acquiring e-com empires a few, few months ago, which is really cool. That's great. So the first group that we were posting, we acquired and the founder of Nick Troney, one of my brothers, absolute shout out to him. He's CMO of B.S.F. now, which is really, which is really great. So when I first got involved at the e-commerce and started to do really, really awesome numbers, we just posted in Facebook groups, just kind of showcasing our results in the systems that I would use. And I didn't even have any idea that anything would come of it, right? I was just showcasing the success that we had on our physical product brands and the systems that I created myself to really scale to those numbers, like Micro Big Bang, Algorithmic Targeting, Macro Big Bang, obviously CBO, all these different types of ad strategies. And I would walk through it. I would be very in depth in the way that I would portray and talk about what I did. Because I thought, hey, I could post these numbers. That's cool. But how would I go ahead and show people how I actually did it? And that ended up putting me on the map a little bit in e-com empires, which is like the biggest group. And then it started spreading like wildfire, right? And then birth BSF, which is pretty cool. I always had my consulting kind of thing going, but we never had a full-on infrastructure like we do today being beyond six figures. And that's ultimately how we saw the first sparks of it being born, which is super cool. Dang. And even so, your personal brand was built up through, I mean, essentially, it's simple to sound giving value into Facebook groups. Would you agree with that? Yes, literally, yeah. And that is how my personal brand was birthed. Because I'm not the guy with millions of followers on TikTok or YouTube. I'm the guy that could make millions of dollars with my business behind the scenes, right? But at that point, it was really just absolutely organic wildfire, right? It really wasn't like anything went viral on TikTok or YouTube. It was just in the industry. It was getting a lot of attention because of the consistency and the momentum that I was getting, right? And then I was showcasing so many people that I would work with using the same systems that I had. And they would scale consecutively and consistently as well. And the industry hasn't seen anything as consistent as that ever. So it just became like an instant, like what is going on here? And that's how it really got birthed. So that's a really great way to put it. And even this question might take half a step back, but you've really hit the nail on the head with your start and getting started through e-commerce. And a lot of people define that differently, but selling physical products on the internet, right? I'm holding a microphone. You sold physical products, something maybe like this at some point in time or even currently. And a lot of people in our community, they get their start through affiliate marketing or selling info products, maybe going an agency route. Why'd you pick selling physical consumer package products? Yeah. Well, it's always been, because ever since I was like really, really young, I always had an eye for marketing. I would always kind of pick apart physical product brand commercials and always be very critical of thinking that I could do it better. So I would just see all these people selling physical products. And I was super young at the time. And one of my buddies, Amit, was one of the first people who kind of showed me everything that was going on. And he was crushing free plus shipping at the time, right? Slamming free plus shipping back in the OG days, right? I'm like, huh, that makes sense. If you could cover the cost here, but it's free shipping, it's almost like a bargain. So I understood exactly what they were doing. I'm like, there's potential here. But then I started to say, hey, free plus shipping, okay, I want a bit higher margin. And I also love the fact that I could just stay behind my computer and do this all day in my house. And if I'm going to force the consistency and the progress that I know is needed to be successful, I can just see here and do this all day long. No one's going to bother me. I could keep my door shut. And I could just see here and do this all day long. So I guess it was the initial ideology that I had a lot of opinions about physical product brand marketing before I even started as a young guy. And then I saw what my buddy at MIT was doing, ultimately, as well as free plus shipping. And I kind of put two into it together. I said, this is an opportunity here, physical product. I don't love the margins of free plus shipping, but I love marketing. And I think I could definitely lay a phenomenal foundation for a few brands. And that's what we ended up doing, which is super cool. At first, we were selling a bunch of like animal gear, glass blown sculptures that were handmade. We had different suppliers from Etsy, AliExpress. This is before real supply chain was the thing where you couldn't just get any manufacturer, getting you three to five, seven days shipping, whatever it is. This is before really any of that occurred. We were dealing with 20, 30 days shipping times, shady suppliers. The whole thing was the Wild West. But we found a way to make it work. We built several companies. And it was one of the most incredible entries into any business that I've ever had because it was just like instantly, I knew it was something that I loved and I fell in love with it. And I remember maybe months before I really committed, I told two of my best friends when I was really young, I'm like, hey guys, I'm doing this and I'm committing to this. I'm going to make it work. And you guys want to deal with me. Like you guys want to come for the ride. You could consider it already done. It's already worked in my head. It's already done. You guys could come with me and I'll make it work. But I was just so confident. I was so sure. Right? Like, oh, that's cool. We're just all young guys. And I wouldn't really care. Right? But that was like the switch in my head right now. Hey, this is what I'm doing. And this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. And I'm going to force it and I'm going to make it work. Justin, was it something where, I mean, when people start doing e-com, all right, a lot of times they say, okay, I'm just going to go find a supplier. And they've got a catalog of things that I can drop ship. Or the other option is create a product. Have it manufactured, you know, all this stuff. Stock it in a warehouse somewhere, ship it yourself. Did you always do drop shipping or did you create certain products? Well, what's that like? That's a phenomenal question. So when we first started, I was doing both. Right? I built my first subscription box company. We built from scratch. Right? We sourced all the products from different warehousing in United States, which is really cool. We got the box custom made. Everything was custom. Right? And I noticed that was a bit more difficult than anything else we built. That's a lot of work. Yeah, a ton of work. Exactly. And on the other hand, I had drop shipping stores as well that I first started. Right? That were a lot less time investment, a lot less work that ended up doing a lot better, quicker than my subscription box brand at the time. And I'm like, huh, that's interesting. So maybe working smart is the way to do it. Right? And one of the things that I would say is most people who want to dive into e-commerce or do drop shipping realize that it's not instantly 100k a month overnight. Right? You have to build up foundations and real systems and structure and do things consistently and have a system for product research, have a system for targeting, have a system for ad creation, landing page creation, ad copy, launching. Everything should be a system. And you want to have a multi-platform validation approach that helps you see what products are actually doing well. You don't want to just sell random products and throw random stuff at the wall, hoping it sticks. A lot of people, because of how low the barrier to entry and drop shipping is, believe it, they can just get started and scale immediately. You could do very well. Right? But the money's made in the preparation and the time invested before you launch the ads. Right? So when I see people who just run to ads and rush to ads, I'm like saying, hey, that's great. That's awesome. You're going to learn a lot when you run those ads, but the money's made in the product research, the money is made in all the assets that you create beforehand. So if anyone's listening right now and you want to do drop shipping, don't just rush to the ads. Don't just rush and throw random stuff at the wall. You find a product research system. You should join the Facebook group. You type in beyond six figures on Facebook. First group, about 50,000 people. You go into the guides section. You see all the free product research training I have in there. That's how we determine what products that we actually sell, what products that are going to have great margins for us to actually stay profitable with CPMs and cost per acquisition. Right? It's all about having higher margin product these days as well. 30, 40, 50, $60 profit per unit is what you want to go for. Right? Back in the free plus shipping days, you could go ahead and get a profit of five to eight bucks and be okay. But now you want to go ahead and focus on higher margin goods and also make sure there's higher margin goods actually have real demand now. Don't go based off of, excuse me, don't go back based off of last year's numbers. Go based off of the last 90 days, last three months. What's hot now? Make sure that's an evergreen trend because you don't want to run a two week bump into them. You want to have a business and a brand for two, three, four plus years. You want to have an actual asset that's around forever. Right? Or as long as you're in business. Right? And that's what we're going for here. Not two week pump. It dumps real actual assets, real brands, real companies. So this is all based on the numbers and trends. Is this based off of like personal preference you like to sell health stuff or you like to sell automotive stuff or whatever? Do you ever get biased that way or are you just, you know, looking at the numbers and say, all right, we're going to move this because of the trends and the numbers? Chris, that is such a good question. First and foremost, and I would say that's one. Hey, while you're enjoying this, I want you to check out something else we've been working on real quick. Why don't you let me invest? No, 5%. Nope. 6%. And that's my final offer. No. Oh, you want to play possum on me? How about 8%? What? Take one marker. Start out for the first final way challenge today and learn how to launch your business without any investors. You're supposed to go down in equity, not up. Whatever. 9%. The biggest mistakes that people can make is getting in already having a bias saying, hey, I like this. I like this. I, I, I, I, I, it's not what consumers want. So one of our students, Luke Tall, he just hit 5 million, but he's been doing it for about two years now. You don't just hit 5 million by starting. Absolutely not. You struggle, struggle, struggle, find consistency, stay in the game, and then you could hit those numbers. Anyone who says like, oh, 5 million overnight, you could do that if you're someone who's like a huge athlete or a huge list, but you got to, if you're starting from scratch, you got to build a foundation, right? You got to have systems and structure and you got to focus on what the market wants, right? What the market wants. Look at the data, right? That's why having a product research system that has back checking different sites like Amazon, eBay, you know, watch count, all these different, all these different resources will help you see if a product has demand now because you don't want to just throw something that you like at the wall and hope it sticks because oftentimes we're wrong and we want to go based off the numbers and the data. So the market tells us what to sell. And that's definitely the way to put it. That's a phenomenal question, Chris. Yeah, Russell always says people vote with their wallets, right? It doesn't matter what you do. 100%. I love what you said too. It's like, it's so funny. Like, I like this. Well, it doesn't matter what you like. It's what do they want? What do they like? Data will tell you. It's so true. Would you say, yeah, would you say that the aspect that most people overlook or if not, is it something else? I would say this is definitely the piece that people overlook the most, right? I would also say overall, just believing that because they like the product that it's going to sell well, as well as like them being able to read KPIs in the first or second day, right? You need to let the spend run for a little bit. So you have to give your ad strategy a few days to spend. If you spend $4 or $2, you're not going to have a very accurate CPM or CTR. So I feel like people are also making a lot of predetermined or pre-mature decisions that they need to wait a little bit longer on, right? But not too long. And like the happy medium is letting your ad sit for a longer period of time to where you can see the KPIs, but not too long. What we call the three-day rule, right? Is day one, no view content, we kill it. Day two, no ad to cart, we kill it. Day three, no purchase, we kill it. And if it gets a purchase within those three days, we then start looking at the advanced KPI metrics like CTR, CPM, CPC, et cetera. We don't look too early. So if we look at CPC too early and we start killing within the first $2 of spend, that CPC is not even accurate there yet. We need to give it a bit more spend. So I would say exactly the point that Chris made before, as well as ultimately just moving forward in killing or not killing early enough in their ad strategy. It's being able to have true KPIs and benchmarks. Yeah. You're talking a lot about ads. And I find, and maybe this is different in e-com, right? I've done a little bit of e-com, but I also see a lot of people in ClickFunnels too. It's courses, it's creators, it's experts. Would you say that you mostly dive into ads versus organic? When we talk about you as the attractive character, what is in e-com, maybe that's a little bit harder. Maybe you do stay behind the scene a little longer and the product is what's forward facing. Is that mostly ads or is it by email lists, et cetera? I love that. That's such a good question. So physical product e-commerce is mostly ads, right? Obviously you can add organic, right? You could do influencer marketing. You could list your products on Amazon and eBay, et cetera. Do email marketing as well. Affiliates. Yeah. But physical product e-commerce is driven by paid media, by paid traffic. Obviously you can do TikTok organic, but that's usually pump and dump mentality. Anyone who's doing real or big numbers is focusing on Facebook and Instagram and using Google ads, TikTok, Pinterest, et cetera, as icing on the cake. Right? On the contrary, we have service-based marketing where we've done eight figures plus as well. Right? And what's cool about it is like info products and funnel style actual build outs, that is a phenomenal place to start with organic, right? And a lot of the time I'll tell my service-based clients, hey, I'm sort of doing 50 to 100K plus a month organically, and then we'll turn on the paid traffic because you actually have an infrastructure that's built correctly now. Right? So a lot of the time, and with BSF as well, and our info brands and our service brands, we've started all organically, right? And what's really cool about it is once you get to that 100K month mark, you know, 150K month mark, you can really afford to dump some crazy ad spend in because the business is so cash flow positive. And that's when you have the ability to really scale because your infrastructure is built already because you've proven it through organic consistency. Right? And that's the most pure form of marketing. Right? If you can nail 100K a month organically, you know, you're doing something right. People are talking about you. People are liking your product if you're still in business. Right? And that's the most important piece, right? Just focus on organic consistency on the service-based side to prove the offer. And then as you get deeper into things, then you add a little bit of paid media as well. Right? So people should save their resources, drive harder with their consistency, and their work ethic, get the result organically on the service-based side, then transition to paid media. We're on physical product e-commerce. A lot of people will start off with paid media from scratch because you're more behind the scenes and not as front to like you mentioned. That's like a mic drop, Ben. I know, seriously. Good. Yeah, that was awesome. So do you see maybe the reverse trend on the e-com side? You mentioned paid traffic powers it. Now, once they do have profitable campaigns to incorporate influencer marketing, other things to spread organically for their brands? 100%. 100%. So once you kind of get the momentum going with your paid traffic, paid media, you know, hey, this is a winning offer. You're not going to be throwing your or paying all these influencers all this money. You don't even know if the thing works yet. Right? Prove it yourself with paid media. See if you get some momentum and consistency, then you can start to get fancy. Right? And also there's more than one way to skin a cow. Right? So like this is the way I like to do things. But ultimately, it's led to some of the most consistent success in the marketplace. And that's why I would like to do it because everything that I've done has been based off of how I've came up in the industry in the market since I was 13, 14. I've seen all the market regime changes and everything in between. Right? And we adapt. I like to, you know, look at people's systems and see, you know, focused on those who are keeping that same system, keeping the same flow and just adapting because you know it's proven you know it works. Right? Just like Russell, that's why Russell is so successful. He has the same kind of flow and the same kind of templated ideology because it works and has proven and he just adds in new material, new incredible value. That's why ClickFunnels has got to where they are today because of a proven concept. Right? When you find that proven concept, it's just about ultimately, you know, making it fresh and keeping things at the top of the game and elite. That's such a good point. Ben and I have traveled to a ton of different events. And one of the questions we get asked like all the time, especially like starting with ClickFunnels or whatever, people want to know like what their upfront investment is going to be. And a lot of time that includes ads. So if somebody's starting out an e-com, they're like, okay, I'm going to do drop shipping. Maybe I have a net 30 or something like that where I don't have to pay. I can actually sell it, ship it first and then I pay later. But if they don't have a lot of resources to start and you're saying you're starting with ads, what type of investment can somebody then anticipate to start with? Like for ads, for example. For sure. So I would say for a physical product, minimum, at minimum, like 3000 bucks minimum, like three K just to have for ad spend because you don't want to be back against the wall. I got $400. This has to work. You got to have at least some depth. And when I say three K, that's minimum. Right. In a perfect world, start with five to 10 K, right. And make sure you're actually just using real systems and structure and doing things correctly. And there's not some random TikTok Johnny, right. You want to have a real system. Can they get started though, if they don't have three, five, 10 K, how would you do that in e-commerce? Or would you go the expert route or something in that case? Well, here's the thing. You could do, you could do organic marketing like TikTok marketing from the start to save funds. And that's a really hot topic right now. But a lot of the time that's two week pump and dump ideology with TikTok organic. You're not going to see much long term linear growth, right. So you could start that way. You could do organic influencer marketing to get started and just kind of play it by ear. Or you could save up, right. And actually get some ad spend going because Facebook and Instagram are the phenomenal places to be. Right. But on the contrary, let's say you're someone who has a skill set, someone who actually wants to, you know, coach someone because you're really good at fitness, whatever it may be. You don't have to start with any ad spend at all on the service-based side, right. Because you could start off organically. You could start off just using communities, Facebook groups, right. Instagram, your actual TikTok to drive people toward an ink toward a inner incubator. So many people on the service-based side, right. They'll try to use all their different channels like TikTok, YouTube, all these different things. And they'll use them singularly. One of the great ways that I found success is by taking all those assets and all those resources, all those platforms, driving them to an inner circle incubator, right. Inner circle incubators where you can control the actual content output and create a 30-day content cadence to speak to those people specifically who are interested in what you're saying. So you have physical product, right. You could start off with TikTok organic influencer marketing, etc. Or save up a few thousand bucks to start really going hard with paid traffic and paid media. Or you could go to the service-based side, right. Start off with little to no ad spend, right. Because you have a particular skill. What's the catch there though? You got to have a skill, right. You got to have something that you're phenomenal at that you're confident at and being able to go ahead and push forward. And usually if you're something, if you're really that good at it, right. You're already making money with it. You made money before. So maybe, you know, that's not your interest, but it really depends what the person's focus is, what they're trying to do. If they want to be the person on camera, they want to be the behind the scenes person as well. And kind of just see what makes that individual tick. But if you're low with cost or low for ads, you don't have any dollars at all. Service-based could be a phenomenal place for you to begin. And when I say service-based, I mean consultant, coach, course creator, something in that area where you have experience that you know is absolute elite movement, right. You know you can help people out. Because that's the most important thing is if your offer is going to be able to get the desired result, right. That's how you're going to be able to really scale and build something incredible is by building that insane reputation and track record of this is the guy that just gets dang results. Yeah. We've talked a lot about, you know, you're familiar with the linchpin, right. This has been Russell just has really been hitting this hard. If we talk about one of the biggest parts of linchpin is continuity. So when you go pick and we've looked, we talked about data, when we go look at the data and everything else, are you trying to find anything that specifically gets you some recurring revenue? Something that's some continuity. How do you do that with Ecom? 100%. So one of the biggest things that anyone could do is just get some recurring revenue going in any business just to have some predictability going, right. One of the PDCs that I actually saw extremely heavily over the last several years is continuity being incorporated on the backend of checkout where people are having a unchecked tick tick box, right. Where they have the option to subscribe to a club to get specific discounts and all these extra products, right. I didn't see this on Amazon where they go, hey, you know, subscribe and save or right. You know, you get the toothpaste or something and you want it to get in three months. Exactly. So you could, you could absolutely sell if it's, if it's like a disposable product or a usable product that they need refills on, you could obviously get them in advance to, you know, buy at discount the, the items that they're going to obviously refill later. And you could also create little membership discount clubs as well. Now here's where I've seen people go wrong. You never have that pre-checked. That's not the right way to do it. It needs to be always unchecked, right. Unchecked. If it's, if it's pre-checked, that's called forced continuity and that's not good, right. Never check it pre. It's always unchecked box because the user hacks to check it. You can't have it checked and rely on the user to then uncheck it, right. That is that a compliance thing or is that something like psychological where it's like, no, I'm opting in for this. It's a compliance thing because as, as this started to get hot over like the last five to seven years, I've seen where people have it pre-checked, right. And that's completely against compliance. It's not the right way to do things. Always unchecked, right. Membership club, right. And then they have to particularly go in and choose that they, that they want it, right. And that's the difference maker. And that's how you could do really well with getting continuity built into your business, but you got to make sure you do it 100% the correct way because you want to just have a phenomenal business. And guess what? If people start seeing a bunch of charges that they didn't make, that's going to ruin your entire business, make you look like a, like a not great guy, right. And ultimately put you out of business forever. So continuity could be phenomenal, but you got to do it the right way. I've got a question kind of switching gears. So as we look at your business right now, Justin, beyond six figures, it's, I mean, it's big, right. You've got your own COO, a CMO, you have an entire executive team built out, probably advisors that, you know, you seek mentorship from. And I've been studying a lot about, you know, leading companies and being a CEO and stuff like that. And a lot of people, they have, or at least something they do that completely removes them from their craft, like a new hobby or skill they're trying to develop. What are you doing outside of work right now? More work. No, but that's a phenomenal question because I'm the type of person like I'm very odd in the fact that like all day, every day, like I usually am always working, other than like I will go to the gym, right? Cause usually when I'm outside, I'm working on my phone, right? And as of late, I've been really, really in the trenches just trying to really kind of push that next level. But yeah, like I like to just, I'm into fitness or I like to go outside, just kind of keep care of my mental health. In that perspective, I'll go to the gym in the morning because I need to, I need to sweat before I start getting into it because it calms me down. I'm very like, you know, up, up, you know, up moving type in person. So I need something that like relaxes me in the morning and that's the gym for me, right? Just sweating, doing what I have to do, getting, getting it out of the system and then getting into my work. And then I always look good to like look forward to like a great meal toward the end of the day. And like I've really just gotten my days and cause I've been doing this since I was like 14 to where every day is almost the same for me, right? I'm just changing out the material and the things that I do in the meat potatoes, where I've pretty much built myself to being a muscle memory. I've wake up, get to like go, sometimes I won't go to the gym. I'll just start working and skip it because I want to work. But like I've just created kind of a muscle memory consistency in my head to where it is almost the same every day, right? Which might be crazy to some people, right? But it's what keeps me building compounding momentum and compounding progress. So outside of work, I like to go to the gym. I like to eat good food. Those are my favorite things. I want to dive into this a little bit too more. Ben, like when you reach a certain level of income, okay, you continue to work, but I noticed one thing that you put you're like, okay, two comic book board winner, business owner, all this. And then there's one phrase or one word in here that you wrote, you said investor. So tell me some of the things now you've heard at a certain level of income, you're doing your own businesses. What are you looking for? And what are your favorite things to invest in right now for like ROI and like big growth opportunity that may be passive? Oh yeah. So and that's a phenomenal kind of way to bridge off of what you said as well, Ben. So I guess this also would be one of my other hobbies, real estate. I love real estate. I've gotten involved in it at a really smart time when a lot of people were like scared. Like for example, this house that I got maybe about a year and a half, two years ago, Mike Tyson just moved in his neighbor. This was at a time where no one was ready to buy everyone was scared because rates were high. And I knew a bunch of my really, really, really, really, really rich friends are stopping and holding off right now. That means there ain't going to be bid wars. I'm jumping in. I jumped in in less than a year. This place is up about a million dollars and just straight worth on a bad day. And literally, Mike Tyson's a neighbor. All these houses are getting all built extensions for like 12,000 square feet homes. So like picked up at least a million off 12 months off of this, just living here. And I'll do real estate as well. And like Fort Lauderdale, we'll get some like multi-family duplexes, et cetera. So I have a pretty good real estate portfolio and I enjoy it because it's back to my roots where I don't have to be like on camera, like whatever it is, I can just be behind the scenes, like telling me, real estate, I want that, give them this offer, this deal, this price. I can be the guy just commander behind the scenes, which is kind of like what I, my real, like when I first started, that's kind of like my person. So real estate has been huge for me. And I've been fortunate up to buy some really great properties over the last three to four or five years, which is really cool. And it's taught me a lot. And I would say real estate, 100% number one thing I would say for anyone right now who's looking to put money into something, not financial advice, right? Really don't know what I'm talking about. It's going based off my own experiences. It's real estate, right? Like real estate, real estate, real estate. And I only buy when I know my net worth is going to be higher. This, the second I signed the contract, right? Only buying deals that literally when you sign, you are richer, right? You have more, you are worth more now. That is my only rule, right? And people were saying, Oh, do you can't look at a prime area as an investment? This, this, and that. I challenged that. I'm like, I can know if I buy it for extremely low and then know it's going to skyrocket and I found the perfect place. And I made that happen. So I proved that point wrong. And I would say like my first real estate property that I acquired years ago was a place for about 985K. And people told me, Hey, don't buy properties in cash. Obviously, for, you know, you could use that money to leverage elsewhere. I ended up buying, I send over a million dollars. I bought that in cash. And it was one of the greatest things that I did because guess what? Now that, that, that income, it pays me seven to 10 K a month. I'm not going to do anything for other than upkeep the house. It's went up 400 K in value on a bad day. And I use that to go ahead and fund other properties as well that I have mortgages on, right? Where the renter is paying them the mortgage, right? But if, for whatever reason, I need to cover more money or expenses, that money directly that's from the paid off house goes directly into my other real estate funds to where it gives awesome comfort. Just having a few properties or a lot of properties owned outright in cash gives you like straight up great income every month without having to worry about a loan or anything. I know it's a weird way to think about it because obviously you want to leverage your money. But for me, I'm someone who like when I started to really get make money, I wanted to safeguard myself. Like I'm not looking for the million X's. I'm looking to safeguard myself and to protect myself, right? So by doing something like that, buying smartly, I'm able to build that income, not have any loan on it and then use it to fund my other real estate projects. And maybe I have, in which I have leverage on, right? So I would say a hundred percent real estate for me has been the best thing. I'm also into like stocks and crypto, but like real estate is where I prefer to have most of my movement, which is really good. So I would say absolutely real estate if you're someone who's looking to get involved in something, like make the money with your business, focus on making the money with all your different companies, whatever you're doing, and then pushing a big portion of it over to smart real estate place. Are you worried about another crash? You were 12. I just did the math. You were 12 in 2008. I was your age in 2008 and dude, it was painful. I was trading options and futures professionally and lost a ton of money. And I saw a lot of people go big time belly up in 2008. Oh yeah. So recency bias for me doesn't seem that long ago. It's been a long time. It seems a long time for you. It's a lifetime ago. So not going through a big correction like that, what type of plans are you concerned about that type of correction in the real estate market? Hundred percent because there will be a correction, right? There will always be corrections in all markets. So the best thing that I'm doing to protect myself from it is buying in the areas where I know there's an insane, insane inflow that's going to absolutely beat any type of pricing downfall. If anything, in a down market, it's going to skyrocket more because more people are kind of coming here to acquire. So I'm only buying in South Florida, right? Buying in high class A communities of South Florida real estate, right? I'm not buying like lower end right now. No section eight for me right now, right? Even though it's great play, right? I'm more focused on higher class A1 types of properties where the people that are moving here in droves from New York, New Jersey, all these other places, they're flooding Florida and they're coming here from New York and saying, oh, this is cheap. This is cheap. This is cheap. So what's happening here is like an almost natural price readjustment over here in Florida. And that's what we've been able to see. Even when rates were higher, right? Prices were still going up and still climbing. And now that rates are slowly, slowly kind of tinkering down. And we saw from the Fed meeting that they're trying to be hawkish, right? But in reality, they're going to slowly but surely probably lower rates throughout the rest of the year. And that's just going to send these properties higher, right? In Florida, in South Florida where I am. So my advice would be, and also there's a lot more people who know a lot more about real estate than I do, but do research on the place that you're buying, like in your specific local market, there is different movements that definitely could be a correction and there will be, right? So you want to make sure that you're prepared. And then if you are real estate investing, buying in the right areas in which you know you're protected on your downside, that's why I'm trying to only get properties where I'm getting it at an extremely low amount where I'm offering cash or something like that. So I could get them to go low to where even in like a 20, 30% correction, I'm still where I paid. Love it, man. Well, we've talked about service base. We've talked about e-com. We've talked about a lot of different things. Yeah, we really have. And real estate, my gosh, I didn't think we were going to go there. But the on-sets figures is your company. And coming into this, I actually thought that that was mostly e-com, but you guys are doing service base. You also have a creative agency. Is that kind of, I mean, what are you diving into most with beyond six figures right now? Oh yeah. So we do physical product, right? We do service-based e-commerce as well as well as the creative agency, like you said. So it's a mixture between all three. And what's cool about it is I've done all three of them extremely successfully, right? Physical product, e-commerce, service-based marketing, as well as creating all the assets and materials to be successful with both those types of brands. Right? And what's cool about it is not only the versatility that we have here at BSF, but the fact that we have systems and structures for everything that we do, nothing's thrown against the wall, random theory or crap. It's all systems, structure and foundational infrastructure that allows us to say, Hey, product research, then targeting, then video creation, everything is very layered and concise. It's all cohesive. So if anyone's looking for a particular real system, the proven system that actually works and is not just randomly put together and giving you four random products in a $20 pre-built store, like that's the type of kind of push that we have is that we have proven systems that have done incredible numbers and we know how to template things out for certain individuals in a custom way in a custom fashion. So whether it's physical product, e-commerce or on the service-based side where we've serviced NFL quarterbacks, et cetera, things like that. And one of my fitness companies, we've actually built out the Panda Express back-end pronunciation program that they use across America, which is cool with my buddy Paul Gruber, right? He actually has the whole Panda Express account and we optimize the entire offering and everything about it. And they went ahead and after we optimized it, they proceeded to purchase it for every Panda Express in America. It's like a pronunciation program for some of the staff, which is cool. We've done tons of work with Shark 10 companies and the service-based and physical products side as well. But yeah, I would say it's a mixture of physical product and service-based because that's where my knowledge is. That's what I've built in my life and that's what I've focused my entirety of my life and growth at this point on is physical product e-commerce, service-based marketing and service-based e-commerce as well, and then creating the assets, targeting the marketing for those types of companies. And that's where the creative agency comes in as well, which is cool because you can have my figure team build out your funnels, your assets, your ad launches, your product research, kind of commission my team who's built all my companies with me to do just that for you. Love, is that the best place then for people to go if they want to get in touch with you and learn more about you? Yeah, I would say Instagram at Justin Wall. So J-U-S-T-I-N-W-O-L-L, just at Justin Wall. One word, just my name. That's on Instagram. Check it out. Give me a follow, guys. You can shoot me a message as well. So you're from the podcast.
