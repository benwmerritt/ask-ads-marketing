## Transcript
Music Alright, we're here! Hey everybody! So we are back for the Build a Business series. Today's the last day, I'm kind of sad, but we've had a lot of fun. So my name is Andy Ortega and I'm also joined by my good buddy and co-worker and super ambassador, Danny Walsh. How's it going? Hey, I'm doing good. Let's make sure we're live in the group. I'll be checking this, Andy. I know you've got a way of going about. They wrap this up for folks because it's been an amazing week, right? Sure, sure, sure. So yeah, we had a wonderful week. What is the Build a Business series? What we've been doing this week is we took a fictitious entrepreneur, Susan, okay, made up the name. And we kind of came up with a business for Susan. See, our fake entrepreneur, Susan, is someone that has been kind of getting into ClickFunnels 2, learning how to use it, actually built their own site. And they're getting so good that they wanted to offer their own services to other people. Okay, so on Monday, what we did is we told Susan that it's probably a good idea for her to start in a niche, right? We went on Monday, we talked about problem and solution and how she could start in a small niche. And what she decided to do was offer services to her photography group. Okay, she's in a group. She loves photography as well as ClickFunnels 2. And so what she's going to do is she wanted to teach photographers, macro photographers, how to sell their prints, how to sell their images online. Cool. So that's what we did. We actually built a funnel on Tuesday. And then on Wednesday, we had one of our other ambassadors, James Curran, and he built a course and a membership for us. And kind of taught us a little bit about the LingePin strategy, which is a huge, awesome new concept that is going to be addressed at FHL this year. So I'm really excited about that. And I hear the book is going to be launched very soon as well. All right, anyway, on Thursday, yesterday, we had Ritty, one of our ambassadors jump on, and she taught us the elements of a sales page. So what we did is we covered pretty much from A to Z. We didn't do things like, you know, graphic design or anything like that. We did have Tim Kahn, and he showed us how to use Canva a little bit. But that's what we've been doing. So Susan now has an entire site. She has a funnel. She has a membership. She has a sales page. She's ready to go. Yeah, that's what we did. Yeah, it's been a great week. And I think Susan's now at a point where she's rocking, right? She's out there and she's got, she's been running a webinar. And then she's been, you know, building out a membership site. She's been doing a bunch of content that kind of links photography and graphic design and stuff like that. And now she's transitioned to a point where she could start selling her services at a much wider spectrum of things that she's offering, right? And now she's at a point where she's maybe starting to build some funnels and where she's starting to offer more marketing type services, helping people with the Facebook ads and things like that as well. And Susan's gone from quite quickly just being the expert in a niche group to somebody who's now the marketing expert within that group. And all of these guys are coming to her like, hey, Susan, I need help with the website. I need help with this, you know, marketing of this book. I need help with this marketing of this photograph. I need help, you know, figuring out how to do Facebook ads. I need all this stuff. And Susan's kind of like, well, so now she's in a point where she's actually taking on clients. But she is also finding that some of these clients are wasting a little bit of time. And some of these guys are asking her some questions that she's like, hey, yes, I'll give you the answers. But they're a little bit reluctant to pay. And I think one of the one of the things that you find when you come on board, they want everything for free, and they're not like willing to maybe sign up to a higher value package. Maybe they're kicking the tires. And I think that that might be a nice way to kind of bring this naturally to conclusions. So you've covered all of the spectrum of, hey, you've got the idea. Hey, I found the niche. Hey, I've done something small. I've added the people along the value ladder and bringing people into my membership. That's all good. And now I'm starting to offer more expensive services through sales pages like really short to us. These people are coming on board and I'm getting people contact me on Facebook and they want to do like a call to find out, you know, how much things cost. I'm finding that it's a bit difficult to sort of work with the client. She's not quite getting that bit. So maybe we could talk a little bit about how you would work with the client. And I know that in the coming weeks, we're going to kind of look at, well, if that all works, maybe Susan would be the next agency for photography businesses. Right. So it's like, you can start the process again, and like, how would you kind of build that agency? So Susan's going on this marketing journey real quick. And I know Riddie and James are going to come back on and start talking to us a little bit about, yeah, we've got to this point. But the more you move forward in your journey, the more kind of like issues and obstacles and things will come to light. And I guess working with people is probably one of the hardest things in any business, right? Serving your customers, making sure things are delivered on time, making sure things are fulfilled. And if we could talk a little bit about that, Andy, I guess that would be great. But also any other questions that folks might have from the previous sessions, I guess we could answer those as well. And all these guys are waiting in the wings and we can bring them on. But is there anything else just before we do that, Andy, that you just might want to add around that? Yeah, so I love Danny how this has just evolved naturally. So we talked a little bit about what we were going to do in the basic structure last week, right? But we came up with Susan and the whole idea behind Susan and what we're going to do with Susan on Monday. We did it on purpose. We kind of just had a natural discussion and I just love the way this has happened. So it's really exciting that we've decided that in a couple of weeks, we don't have the official date yet, but we are planning on continuing this journey with Susan. And just like you mentioned, maybe she'll start her own agency. So we'll see. Very exciting. Yep. So let's bring on our awesome ambassadors. Riddie's here and James is here. We could do a little bit of Q&A. Hey, how's everybody doing today? Hey, guys. James is outside. I don't know if you guys kind of picked that up, but now thanks to your help, Susan has gone from the expert in the group to somebody who's doing a little bit of photography, graphic type training. Now she's got a membership site where she's kind of switching from that kind of stuff, delivering content to her members. And she's at a point like Riddie did some sales pages and things just today, offering more and more expensive services. And now she's actually doing what she wanted to do in the beginning. She started building a few funnels. She's going out there helping people put their Facebook ads together. Maybe she's building landing pages. All of that stuff you guys have showed her over the week. She's kind of implementing, but she's starting to get to this point where she's getting people coming to her and they're asking for advice. And she's at that stage in that kind of business where she's thinking, well, do I need to start an agency for that? Maybe I'm not quite there. How does Susan handle the clients and how does she make sure that she's talking to the right people, that she's going to get paid, all of that kind of stuff? Because that's a thing in itself, right? And whenever you're delivering any kind of service or you're building a website, you're building a funnel, you're doing ads or whatever it is, you've kind of got to balance a lot of things. And I guess automation comes into this a little bit. What are the kind of things that Susan might be facing right now? Because she's come a long way in a few short months. And also any other comments that we're getting questions related to the previous stuff. Does that kind of make sense? Does that sound like a plan? Is this something you guys are able to help us with a little bit? Absolutely. That was a lot of topics. So we can take that in series. But I feel like we could definitely tackle all of them. Yeah, and already how are you doing? Hi, I'm doing good. How are you guys? We're doing great. Michael's in the chat saying something cool about you guys as opposed to other entrepreneur groups is that you respond with actual help when people ask questions instead of just being cheerleaders. You've got this only goes so far. And he loves the CF folks, loves everything about us. Thanks for the great content you guys. Which is awesome. Navneet's here, Gabriel's here, Riddie's here, James is here. Divya's here as well. Michael's here as we know you guys are awesome. Quite a few people on the show today. So any questions drop them in the comments. But let's just take it slow then, James. So we're not all the Lord everybody. You've got to the point where you start to build out funnels for clients. And you guys, you've got to remember that first client, right? And it doesn't just go smoothly. Maybe it did. I don't know what's what's your experience of now you've started to help more and more people and you're starting to help them with the businesses rather than just give them a little bit of help with a certain topic. What's the sort of like do's and don'ts or advice that that kind of comes from that? I think my initial recommendation is so much of what we talk about is niching down and finding your dream client and doing all this stuff. And honestly, in the beginning for for a funnel builder, I kind of suggest the opposite, which is like just try a bunch of stuff and kind of say yes to a lot of the different jobs. A, because getting something is better than nothing, especially if you're committed to it. But also you'll see there's like a variety of different clients in different levels of maturity within the experience of the clients. And you're just going to experience a lot of different things and you can't buy that experience really you have to kind of go through it. So my initial recommendation is to try to take a bunch of different size and style of jobs and then, you know, get your feet wet and then get some confidence. Yeah, it's very important. So my experience lies alongside with James. So when we start, we started like bunch of different things and then we try fail, try again and then decide if this is something that I want to do or you want to do. And then niche down like, okay, this is a service I want to provide. And then you don't niche down in the audience as well. Try bunch of people have been job bunch of people and then you'll find one to clients in your clientele, which you love to work with right. And then your next step is to find those kind of clients only. So I started with Facebook ads. I learned all the general marketing, all the general marketing skills, Facebook ads, content marketing, the social media marketing, this that sales funnel website building WordPress, almost everything. And then I niche down to the sales funnels. My first client wasn't not a sales funnel client, it was a Facebook ads client. But then I was like, I can do that. So that's how you get your first client and work with them. And while you're working with them, you mentioned like how the work goes. So business is all kind of experiments. You start, you know, you are going to drown and you still start. So you face few problems. A good thing is to be in some kind of community like click finance, there are a few other communities as well. But you can have the support, you can ask questions like, Hey, I'm stuck here, what to do. And just like click finance, there are few communities, people are really there to help you out. So this is the best way to go about it because you will make mistakes. I made we all have made that and we have to learn correct and repeat. It's important that that folks get that and Divya's in the chat right now saying working with different clients and gain experiences valuable as well. And you've kind of got to get a feel for this right because six months ago Susan was in a photography group thinking, Oh, I wish I could help these people with the logos, but she kind of had that long term plan that she wanted to start actually building funnels. And I remember I once bought this like video software and it was like this cool little software was like, I don't know, cost me like $90. And you could go on there and you can make a little cartoon characters animate and do like an explainer video. And I managed to get a job selling these things to like the local council, like the environment department of the council. And we had like the little refuse collector guy going along in this little video. And these guys were paying an insane amount of money to some other company. And I managed to kind of work my way in there a little bit. And I charged $2,000 or 2000 pounds, $2,000 more than that for one of these videos. And it was like the best thing ever. And what I realized is the more I did these things, I was running out of actual animated characters. And I kind of got to a point where they were saying, well, now can you do a bird that flies out of the tree? And can you do this car that pulls up? And I was like, oh, man, I've reached the limit of the software for these guys. And I was thinking, I don't want to get into this position again, where I then need to go and learn some other software or spend a big bunch of money. And sometimes you can find yourself going down a route that isn't right for you. I think that's what we're hearing. So you've tried something, sometimes you've got to put the brakes on. Sometimes you've got to go all in on that. What do you guys think of that? Is that something that you've experienced? Because I know James, you're very focused, really you're very focused. What's the thinking around that kind of thing, James? If you find something that you can do, but it might not be the best. Yeah, absolutely. Well, I guess one of the things I started off with was lead funnels, like lead squeeze funnels. And they're really good because they're like a try before you buy, in a sense, for building funnels because they're pretty inexpensive. But I found myself getting a lot of them. And I noticed that my earnings per hour was really low because you actually have to do a lot of stuff for a lead funnel. There's not a ton of difference between, say, like a three-page BSL and a lead funnel. The automation is the same. A lot of the marketing messaging is the same. You have to understand the avatar in the same way. You still have to come up with a domain. All this stuff is continuous, but I wasn't getting nearly enough. So I find that pretty early on, like, okay, I can't be sustainable doing just this. So that was definitely something where I had a lot of success with it. And then I sort of switched gears into some different tactics and eventually landed on Linchpin. So the Linchpin, I've just seen a few emails flying around. That's something that's winging its way. There might be a link in the URL out there right now, maybe? They could very well be. Thoughts are going to rush and check their email. But you've gone through a bunch of stuff and then you've really focused on one thing because you've mentioned something important there, that the earnings per hour. And when you first start, it's like you said, it's just go out there and get something, right? But as you progress in your business, you shouldn't just be taking any project on for the sake of it. And that's super important. Super important. What do you think about that, really? You know, folks who start moving and they start figuring out where they are and what they should be doing. Should they just take any work for the sake of it or do they need to be very disciplined? So, like, this is what I have done. I don't know how to suggest people, but I can share my experiences. So, for six months, I got a course which was like general marketing teaching course. I got that course, started learning for six months. I had four to five people. I was doing free stuff for them. So, I don't have any kind of those pressure. What if I don't get them result? Because I am learning and they also knew it very well that this could fail. So, that helped me get the confidence, show some results, not like hyper-fueling results, but some results that build my confidence. And then I started selling at a very low price. And I had two clients for Facebook ads and then I realized, ah, no, I don't like numbers. Then I knew I like writing and designing is my forte. So, that was the time I learned about the entire ClickFunnels and Russell Princeton. And that was the time I started diving in and it made all the same sense and it cleared all the doubts that was in my head around all the business and all the things. So, from that again, I got three clients for free for a sales funnels. And then I started selling. So, when you're learning, give it away as a free and of course, let them know that I am doing this for free because I want to gain experience. I have knowledge. I know the theory. I'm going to do it a practical. Would you be willing for that? Most beginner business owners are willing to and a small amount of result is a lot more for them because they are getting nothing. So, that's how I started and this is in my case, the good way to start. It certainly makes sense. What's your thoughts, Andy, listening to this? Right, right, exactly. So, I love how you mentioned that sometimes, Riddie, it's good to offer something for free, right? Even offer an entire project. I know many people that have started that way and there's a lot of controversy. Some people say you shouldn't do that. You should charge something, which yeah, you could. But, you know, since I was 13, I've been doing things for free for family and friends, the neighbors and things like that, you know. Something's wrong with my computer or how do you set up this social media thing? And this is a wonderful way to establish yourself as an expert. And as you get the practice, as you get some experience, you'll be able to branch out and get and also focus on the things that you like. Because just like James said, you know, in the beginning, maybe you don't know what you want to focus on and you're not sure which clients you want to bring. But once you get some experience and you've done a few projects for people, you'll have a much clearer picture. So I love how you said that. And one thing to add also is like when you do something for free like that, your result as the sort of donate of your time should be the client results. And then you get a case study out from that. When you have a case study, you can say like, you know, we took them from 2% conversion rate on the sales page to 2.5 or 3. That's a win, right? If you create a lead funnel and it's over 20% opt-in rate, you know, maybe 40%, that's another win. And then that's what gets you the next paid gig. So I think doing a free gig or a series of them initially until you get an actual hard evidence case study is a really good idea. Absolutely, because there are so many courses that teaches you like how to get high paying clients, but you need a confidence to charge and to deliver. And confidence is not something any course can give you until you work for free or anything. So this is a great way to build your confidence, your portfolio, your experience and have some kind of practice that you can show off, right? Certainly is, certainly is. And listening to this, it kind of takes me back because, you know, everybody talks about high paying clients and closing the next deal and all of this sort of stuff. But if you're new to this, you can't just take this magic course that just gives you this magic wand that makes people come and give you, you know, thousands of dollars. You've got to kind of build up to that. And one thing that I would always kind of advise the Susans of the world who, you know, you've started off in a little group, you've sold a little bit of stuff to kind of bridge people over into the world of funnels and ads and all the things that you really know that they need is every time you get a client, you put your price up a little bit, a little increment. So if you're selling something, if you're doing something for free, next time you say, well, look, a great line that I've always used is you need to help me kind of grease the wheels on this and we can get the thing turning a little bit faster. Or you could say something like, look, you know, you invested my dream and I can invest in your dream and determined to get you the results. And if we do that, you know, you're going to see some success. That's going to be kind of cool. And people will be like, well, yeah, of course they can't do it for free. And you start to see your confidence grow, but you're not asking for $10,000 because if you get it wrong at the $10,000 price point, that's a big old refund. Right. That's that's like, if you've gone and taken that money and thought, yes, we're rich, you know, Susan's rich overnight. She's done it. And then you kind of screw this thing up and these guys are like, whoa, I won't, you know, we want money back. That's a hard pill to swallow. Right. So it's easy to give back a few hundred books and it is to give back a few thousand. But as you move every single client, you notch that up, you notch that up. And at some point you'll find yourself commanding the revenue that you deserve, but equally having the confidence to do that and all of this kind of resonance. And I don't know what you guys think about that approach and that strategy and what I've been doing out there. Like, how would you advise Susan? Would it be similar? Would it be different? How do you go from like free to, you know, what is the price for a funnel these days? It depends on what you what kind of results that you're after. But I do think that leaning on that case study is a great way to bridge the gap between free and paid. Because once you've got the actual results, then, you know, you can show like, like one of my very first funnels, I was able to get a really great case study and it is, you know, honestly, due to the fact of the client that touched a great job, building up pressure before the launch started, they had an amazing group with a bunch of people and then I ended up crushing it with the funnel like the sales percentage were really high. But I was able to leverage that and then get the next job because, you know, I could I was able to take a screenshot of a two week period with a high number of sales, a high conversion rate and it's like, boom, we did this. What's next, you know, so I think that the proof I really want to leave on the proof more than copy or fancy stuff like hard evidence proof is I think the best way to go from to not to ratchet up in any sort of price in the future. Yeah. Price increase scenario, whether that's free to to page or level one to level two. Yeah. And I guess one size doesn't fit all in the funnel world, right, because somebody wants an all singing all dancing thing with an app and you know 200 downloads and a suite of videos and a membership site and somebody just wants four pages and everybody's viewer that is different and everybody's business is different and you will find folks out there who want more than others. So you can't just say hey, the going rate of a full we see this all the time in the group how much do you charge for a funnel. Right. It depends. I mean, especially if you want to consider like any ongoing support after the funnels build because it's a it's a really it's kind of a downer when like I deliver a funnel and I give it to someone and they haven't really figured out their their social media strategy or their paid traffic and it's like, you know, I try to like now I'm experiencing up to try to head that off the past. You were talking earlier about what kind of clients do not like working with and honestly, I find that I don't have great success with people who haven't gotten over the, their unwillingness to get in front of the camera, you know, if they haven't figured out their their social media strategy or to be consistent, it means it's not going to be consistent traffic coming to the site which means like kind of building this thing in a vacuum for nothing. So, you know, that's a selection criteria for when I'm doing funnels now but also, if they do want that continued support going forward then that's that's a totally different thing and we're talking about, you know, a sort of monthly retainer or contract where we're continuing to support. I just did an offer this morning to someone where I'm like, okay, this is the offer, but I'm going to stay with you until you get your money back and that's my new sort of way of looking at things, you know, some gold. Yeah, actually that that brings up a question for me, James. There's probably a couple of different types of clients that you have there's there's the ones that are still still figuring stuff out. You know they still don't have their social media again. And there's probably other clients that know their stuff. They just want you, they need your help right they know everything they know what to do. And actually, maybe they've done it before they're already successful but they just want to be more successful right. How much of your role how much of your services can are going to include things like coaching where you're actually getting on calls and teaching them stuff. It really depends. I before for that very reason I have a sort of a tiered system where if you just need me to do the thing for you. That's one flat fee, but then I have some extra options like if you want me to help with ads I can, you know, we can we can do that. If you want me to help with coaching. I had the benefit of my wife is a former Tony Robbins Platinum level coach so she is like world class at getting people unstuck and getting people to reach their goals. She's a business partner of mine so if there's someone who really wants some mindset work and or wants to help you know with consistency or wants help like realizing that they can be in front of the camera they don't have to look some some idea away that I'm able to deliver chair and bring her in to help it out but yeah it depends on what people want. I'm at 2ccx and I have a lot of my clients that are also in 2ccx and a lot of those people, they get it they're already successful they just don't want to do the work themselves they don't want to do the training videos and learn how to do this stuff so like right James I know that you know this stuff just do it for me and those are usually not requiring coaching that's more cut and dry. I love working with those types of clients because we're already speaking the same language we know the deliverable are going to be and it's pretty easy. And can you see Riddie is not in a way in that this must be resonating with your good self because you two working with a bunch of clients and I know you've seen the good the bad and the ugly along this journey that you've taken what's your thoughts on this stuff Riddie? So I have built sales for us from all the way from people who didn't have any offer any business to people who are really successful making almost eight nine figures in the business and building funnels for them. So as a funnel builder my goal is to build the funnel put the offers on that and they the business owner wants to leverage my expertise they don't want to spend or waste their time because they have a lot more other things to do in their business and they want somebody to take over because how how much how many things one person can do in a day right? So working from like people who didn't have business or offer it was it was pretty hard because sometimes I have to become their business coach and which is a big thing. I'm 25 year old. I have I know my business. I don't know business in all general forms. So I can do that. I know sales for us. I can do that only the second type of people as teams say like they do not have any kind of traffic strategy figured out they don't have list. So from the last year I have started not to take up those kind of points because before that I was kind of me I was like thinking I'll do that. But now no do you have a list and there are certain criteria for a revenue as well like if you're making this much then we can work together because if you don't have your offers tested if you don't have any traffic. My work is I feel like going to waste no matter if you're paying me money I don't want your money. If I'm working for you I want to see you succeed. I want you to get some results with my work. And if that's not happening I am not happy because that that keeps my confidence down like oh man I did the amazing work but it didn't bring any results. I totally agree with that already. I just want to say I had that same experience and I do so good. I'm like no sales. God maybe I suck. Yes. And we all take it up like maybe I suck and then it slows down the client hunting process because because I'm not motivated. I feel like I am not being good enough. And that brings my moral and my confidence so down that I'm like kind of so low level. And from that I have moved now and now I'm so motivated to work to open the click for us because the kind of clients I'm working they have the traffic already they can start sending a portion of the traffic to the funnel and see how the funnel is converting. So I can see my work working in a days of time and that is something gives me a motivation like oh that is rating. Let's do it more. Let's get. Let's give some more people a help. So as a sales funnel builder I am just a sales funnel builder. I cannot take over the traffic thing. I cannot take over the offer thing. If you don't have both of these things this my work won't help you. And if you don't have I won't take them. So this this were my experiences. This is these are the lessons I learned over the time. Well I do have to say that you've been a pretty good coach this week ready and also being a ClickFunnels ambassador at the age of 25. That's pretty impressive. That's right. Yeah. I also want to say like one thing that I've done to sort of help out with this first problem where like because you know ideally I want to help people at all levels. So one thing that I've done is just create material and content and programs for people who are at that starting point. Get them to do to sort of get up to speed on their own with through an automated fashion. And then if they do want some additional help later on that I've already served them and help them get results without doing it trading time for that. You know I've got a course or a membership or something where I help them get up to speed. So I get to help but indirectly let less directly than if we're working one on one. It sounds to me that Susan's facing some of these problems and now she's come to our business clinic on the Friday afternoon. She's been given some insight from folks who were a little bit further or indeed a lot further down the line. And now she's like man yeah you guys are right. I need a criteria. I need to make sure that when these guys come in my inbox going please help me with this thing. I've got to kind of filter out and make sure that I can only work with the people I can work with because if they don't get the result that's no good for anybody. And if they've not at the right stage maybe I can read just redirect them back to a course. But look we built a course around the photography and the AI and the graphics and stuff. Maybe it's time for Susan to be building out some content that is actually based around. Hey here's some funnel advice. Hey here's some ads advice. Hey here's some stuff that you can go and do to get you to this point. And when you're at that point you can come back to me and maybe there's a special onboarding she can do then. That's what I'm hearing from this stuff you guys. And James is like yes. Yes. And you don't want to work with people who want you to fix their tire but they don't have a car. It really starting to make sense because look folks are watching I know Alex has got a question in the comments and I'm not sure if you guys can pick it up he's tried a link and I've tried to re-approve the link it does have some technicality with a membership site. I don't know if you guys would spend just a couple of minutes out of the busy schedule that you've got just see if you can pick that up I can't see the link coming back in I've re-approved it I'm not sure exactly what the question is Alex if you want to re-post that we will do a best to pick it up we'll decide if we can answer it on the call if not we'll directly to open a support to kit and then you can get our attention and we'll try our best on that but you guys try and have a look see if there's any advice you can offer because that is just not showing the filters picked it up right so if you can help Alex we will. But just thinking about this now from a Susan perspective. She's gone from like just helping a few folks in a photography group so now she's at a point where she's getting some clients. She's figuring out a structure she's figuring out what she likes doing she's figuring out her policies and how she gets people on board. She's taking some amazing advice and actually she started to be able to charge quite a decent amount of money now for services and I think she's getting to a point where she's looking to the future. But sometimes you can only see the mist right and you guys might be able to see the mountain that's behind the mist and you know where she's going and what she's got to do and what she's got to climb. But Susan's like whoa it's working and building funnels and it's super exciting. What are some of the kind of like next steps where Susan might need to trod or might need to go or you know best on your experience of just seeing the mist because there's a long path to trod right. That is EJM's thinking. Yeah I'd say like from that point and you're you're sort of like dialing in who your dream client is. So then your next step is to craft your marketing messages your marketing messages to hook your dream clients. So you're talking you're understanding your dream client and a deeper level crafting marketing messages putting out talking about pain points talking about dreams. You know in my case it'd be something like you know you know what to do but you don't have the time to do it so here's what your ways you can speed things up if you want to help you can talk to me and I can you know that kind of thing where you're you're putting out hooks to get your dream client and not putting out hooks to get just anybody so holding that in. So we're kind of pushing away the wrong people and getting the right people. Yes. That's what that's what we're saying. What's your thoughts really. My thoughts are like don't talk numbers in your content. Don't talk numbers because numbers attracts a wrong kind of people in the first year of my career. It was 2021. I was I was like inspired by all those coaches who coaches coaches how to coach coaches on how to coach coaches rely on. Yeah who talks like I made this amount. This is how you make it and that attracted very very wrong kind of clients. So that's that's one thing. Don't talk numbers talk ways talk concepts talk how how you can help them like just blatantly just on numbers. If you have if you have the results for example last client having increased 20% opt in rate just with the headline change. Talk about those numbers like how to make 100,000 six because don't talk them. It attracts really wrong people. What's your thoughts on the. Yeah there's definitely there's definitely going to be people that you want to that you don't want to attract because that can be very frustrating right. You might you know you might start getting a bunch of calls or emails or messages from just the wrong type of person and and so yeah I guess the question is what did you do really like what did you do to change so that you're not getting those those type of people anymore and you said that you kind of give a hint you said that instead of talking numbers you're talking concepts and things like that. Can you tell us a little bit more about that. Yes, I am not the best person to talk about content because I have been laid back on the content but here's what I have done and that have got me clients. So I mostly talk about the experience of working with previous clients. The concepts that being implemented on the clients for the results I got and the epiphanies we when we are working on the sales for like each and every process you get some kind of epiphany you learn some new things. Talk about those things and then as James said like hooks because people want people want somebody who talks their language I'm still learning this but here's something that have worked for me. People who do not business owners who do not have time to do things they understand sales for us of course they're in business they are making good money they understand everything. They don't have time they don't want to do all those things that I can do and I want to do. For example, last last week Danny knows this thing like for nine days I was facing the same problem and my client didn't want to face those problems and solve that but I did for them and they were very grateful. So these are things that you can talk about experiences about reasons about concepts that that does three things your readers know like you know what you're talking about they understand you are at some level of expertise maybe not the best but at second third fourth level and the step. And third thing people will reach out to you like hey I need for those two very healthy things like that. So kind of coming together in in my mind and I know Alex I've just said just put this together in one piece of text because you're trying to put links and stuff and it's not quite clear to me in the comments figure that out send it over to us and we'll get you an answer and the yeah. Right and Alex we're thank you so much for sending in the question where we actually take questions in any of our live videos so anybody that's out there that that has a question, even if it's not related. What we'll do is at the end or you know once we get to a convenient point in our discussion we can always address that. I think what happened with Alex is he's having some type of issue inside his membership site so for us to take a look we'd have to log in. And I'm not sure if we can do that right now but Alex don't worry what you know there's a bunch of people that are that are taking a look at your messages and will help you so just give it some time I'm not sure we'll be able to do it right now but but it will get addressed. Yeah just just put it in a message and we'll make sure all the guys see it and then if you have to go to support it or go to support and we do that for the folks on the live and all you've got links and I think the admin assist is picking up the links and it's like I just want to I just want help with this this thing and I think that really actually illustrates what we're trying to say here right because there's some folks out there who just need the help right now and as a service provider look if we we were ever one then we've Alex's problem in the next 15 minutes after the show. For free right only slight dude. You can go and do this thing now over the weekend and go and run your business. If Susan was doing that for folks and then she's getting the response and now I've got a testimonial now I can start to think about who I'm working with what I'm doing if Alex obviously if it comes to us and it's like six months work and it's this slight major thing then we'd be like well now we need to look at it what's the best way to go in that direction it might be. That we say it's got to go there because they are the right people to do the job and until sometimes you see it you'll never know right and I guess that comes back to what we're saying earlier is try different things so yeah I know we've not answered your question right now but that is also a helpful part of this discussion because it kind of illustrates that folks are out there right now needing help with membership sites and funnels and more and Susan seeing all this stuff thinking well which bit can I help with and which bit can I not. Help with and sometimes I guess it's important to actually say this is what I do but this is what I don't do and that can be so powerful in your journey but Susan's clearly gone from like no nothing going on online now she's got little funnels of her own and that's membership site and now she's getting people coming in knocking on the door saying please I've seen that you're doing this amazing work for folks can you help me she's kind of figuring out who her ideal customer is and she's hooking the right folks. She's signed posting the folks you can't work with she's sending them to her and sort of like basic how to content and we literally have built a business in a week in on paper right in concept. How many folks could take this learning and the things that we've showed you and bolt on their own ideas and go out there and actually get started on this path based on what we've done in five short days. I can see it. Anyone that's doing something in the input product space can take exactly the blueprint that we've laid out and just change the context. I think if you're doing cart funnels or something in the physical like product space there'll be a little bit of an adjustment but for the most part it's pretty pretty similar and that's one of the things that I like about linchpin too is like. It works whether you're doing digital stuff or physical stuff or whatever you know it's not that much of a tweak in order to get to work for pretty much any context so I think definitely with what we laid out this week. You able to you know find the people get them some free value with the webinar and get them signed up for the course and then the course can can be the thing that takes them from one part to another and then from that point you know they're just off the races. Off to the races and we hope that it's successful for Susan and just in typical ambassador style and here as always down here be to the rescue is like dude shoot me a video and we'll get it sorted so you've got. I mentioned Dan's name and I'm like I don't know if he's here now but like there's a membership question that's who I'm going to. Like swooped and managed to help Alex out and if there's an answer will find the answer right it will always work to try and find the answer and if we're doing this on the fly on the live I wish you know when I first discovered click funnels that I could go into some group and be like help with this thing on a Friday afternoon or whatever it is Friday evening and be like. Next week I can kick this thing into gear because this is what you know Susan's doing right she's helping people to kick the business into gear and get it going this is what nobody wants to sit there I think Steve Larson said she caught Steve a parked car. This thing's not moving right you just like. Trying to move the thing so look we've covered so much this week and if you just joining us there's a whole series of this that we've literally put together in five short days and Andy we're going to put this stuff on to a page. And we've got the room Lee account and we're going to have all the videos and make sure that this is put onto a page on our ambassadors workspace and we're going to share this with as many people as possible right so if you missed the previous episodes they are in the featured section. But we've got plans for this and we're hoping that James and and really in down and everybody else can join us in the future where are we going with this and. Yeah totally so this is just we just got started we just got started a few months ago. Really trying to focus on on putting really good content in the Facebook group we want to make sure that people can come even if they're brand new even if they you know maybe just just heard about the secrets trilogy books. They're brand new but they they need funnels and they're using click funnels 2.0 or or click funnels classic. And they can come into the group and they can get help they can get answers and they can also watch live videos watch replays. So yeah we're just getting started and and we just like I mentioned the beginning we kind of went naturally we didn't really have we had a plan for what we wanted to teach but we let the plan evolve live. In front of you guys with your help to because there's a lot of people that sent in comments and and had suggestions and things like that. And I think what we're going to do now is in a couple of weeks let's get Susan to start her own agency that would be awesome ready. Yep a little small amazing shout out to Dan heavy is the man anytime you need something is the man always ready to help you. Thank you so much Dan if you're watching this thank you so much for being in the click funnels because I have been reach out to him like so many times hey Dan I'm facing this issue and the and the next thing what I get is a loan video. And if you're doing this run this is not working and this is how it will be absolutely amazing. You also build different types of business showcase building affiliate groups traffic. So I'm stabbing that but there's so many ways to go about affiliate stuff. We are doing some things in the actual click funnels affiliate group and that's going to be starting very soon as well that ambassadors don't quite know about yet but we've got some stuff that's kind of crossing over because we do have an affiliate community. We will be touching on affiliate stuff and we are going to kind of go down this agency route but there is a logical crossover from hey now you're doing funnels now you're building stuff that you could also sell your clients other people's products that they can bolt on for affiliates will come up and agency stuff will come up ecom I'm sure Andy there's there's all sorts of types of business right. Yeah that's right and you know for anybody that's that just heard the word affiliates and you're like what are they talking about OK so you can be an affiliate for click funnels and what does that mean that means that you'll be able to get a link right and I know that we all know this but there I'm just making sure that maybe there might be somebody out there that doesn't know this but you can actually get a link. And then let's say that you talk to somebody and you say hey you need a funnel for your business that would be awesome and actually guess what I'm getting pretty good at doing funnels but you need to have click funnels so you'll give them the link and then click funnels will give you a percentage of what they pay every month and that's a really good way for you to make additional income especially if you're offering services or if you have an agency so just want to throw that out there affiliate marketing Michael that was a really really good way to make additional income especially if you're offering services or if you have an agency so just want to throw that out there affiliate marketing. Marketing Michael that was a really really good idea in fact we do want to incorporate that into the next next build the business series. Yeah and from a click pull clip from us point of view the guys you need to be speaking to is Turner Leslie and Tyler Wicks who are in the group and we can get those guys to help you out sort of figure some of this stuff if you're not in their group you need to join their group there's kind of two sides of what we're doing a click for us but affiliate marketing is. Very important in any entrepreneurs journey and I think that's where a lot of folks kind of starts when it comes to the online stuff and we're happy to help Michael and if you do want to shoot over any additional questions if we can answer them we will but I think we are getting towards. The hour Andy and you guys James really you've given everything this week and show people a big bunch of stuff. You know just from where we started to where we are now we literally have gone on a journey and you know I've learned stuff I know Andy you were talking earlier I will have learned other stuff. I'm not thank you enough for your input. Everybody's giving down the the big shout outs roles are saying down will never let you down he's the man helped me a lot. Dan's just in there just. You know we talk a lot about giving value and how do you get started and all that and then is obviously pretty far from getting started but that's why so successful because he's continuously giving value for free and through all the crap like no let me help you with this thing right now people respect that. I always will. Yeah yeah yeah and you know that's that's why we picked these ambassadors so games you to ready you to Danny you to you know our our team over here at ClickFunnels the community outreach team what we wanted to do is we wanted him to give the best experience as possible in this Facebook group and and what we did is we reached out to some of the coolest people in the group that are just like Dan. They're out there answering people's questions helping people with nothing expecting nothing in return just there because they like to and and of course you know they do offer services we all know that and and this is this is the reason why they're they're so successful in their business as well because they answer people's questions without expecting anything in return so thank you so much to all of our ambassadors. And indeed and it's a pleasure to be to be doing this right because often we see and I put a post up the other day and I'll continue to say it you see somebody come in and somebody asked a really useful question in the group and somebody goes DM me and I will answer it's like nobody can see your expertise in a DM. Nobody knows what gets said in that DM message right so if you come out there you just go there's the answer there's a loop video this is how you do it there's a screenshot fix the problem there and then everything that James really and the everything we've said on this live will start to happen for you and I think some folks might be going about this actually making things more difficult for the selves by not helping in the public and helping in the group so that's just that's just my humble view. But certainly when you do it, you know, you get in the shoutouts you get in the recognition how many people are in that chat right now saying big shout out to Dan heavy is the one who's helping. I don't see people mentioning that dude who was asking for a DM. I don't see it. It's crazy right. It's crazy. But there's definitely if you take nothing else from this training is like help openly and and you will start to see things changing your business. Michael saying you ask a question you get 50 dms. And that's not what we want to be fostering in the group. And it's hopefully things like this that will kind of move everyone away come and ask a question on the live and you'll get the help here and now. That's the big difference right and. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so we've been. Yeah, thank thank you Danny for you know stressing that there's there's a way to do it if you are one of those people that offer services there's a way to do it and there's ways that that kind of get annoying for some people in the clip knows group and so that's why we ask you not to ask for dms or send the DMs but hey guess what we're we're live all the time in the clip knows group. In fact, usually we're live Monday Wednesday and Friday. And that's what that's the plan for next week. And I think in a couple of weeks we'll we'll make sure that we decide soon and we put some announcements but really soon we are going to be having another build a business series. So I'm really excited about about getting started with that but anyways I know that we're coming up to the end of the hour and this has been awesome. We've had a wonderful week. You know like you said Danny I learned so so much just listening to some of the ideas and getting different people's perspectives. So I hope that everybody else really got some benefits out of this we'd love to see your your comments in in the comments section so let us know how we did and hopefully you'll join us next week as well. Yeah, 100% and Michael saying usually saves his questions for lives or for support because we're great which goes down real real well with us right we want to come up here and we do want to give that value and any suggestions any ideas which great about the affiliate stuff and how can we take this we've really kind of designed this and molded this based on comments and questions as we moved along and there was a comment from loris the other day I think that you know why are they not 10,000 people watching this at some point there might be because there's a lot of folks in this group and now we're seeing the numbers increase we're seeing people getting results. This is only going to get bigger and better and we'll keep giving you the replays and keep pointing in the right direction. You can go out there and crush it with with click funnels in your business. Awesome. Yep. And few months back until Danny on boarded with the click funnels and making the group great again. I am a part of a lot more communities as well. And I was seeing the comments and posts like click funnels group is like kind of DM spammer and that was making me so bad like I know that's not true. But that is, there was the one reason that people went away, but now I can see because we can see so many questions getting asked in the group. So people are coming back and definitely in future there will be 10,000 people watching this kind of lives, of course. Yep. And we can only improve right so for me certainly big thanks to you guys James ready team everybody else that's joined us this week as well and the pleasure as always. And we are right up to time. Unless there's anything else from you guys I'm all good this has been amazing and we've taken some notes and built some funnels. I don't know how this ours are like. Time flies when you're building funnels right. That's right. Hello everybody. And if you're happy and everybody's happy in the chat know the questions we will see everybody on the next live. Cool. All right. Take everybody have a wonderful weekend. Thanks everyone. Bye bye.
