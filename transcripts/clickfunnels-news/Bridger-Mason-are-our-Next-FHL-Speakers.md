Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We have a guest joining us who is going to be speaking on the stage at Funnel Hacking Live in September. Him and his partner, they've used dramatic demonstrations to do crazy things, so he's going to come and talk to us about that and why they're going on to the stage. So we'll hear from him right after we roll the intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey there everybody, my name is Ben Moot. This is... I'm Susan Leonard Finn. And we are here with Funnel Hacker TV. We're so excited to have you guys as we announce the Funnel Hacking Live speakers. We are getting down to like the last few months. That's so nice by the way, I'm in Boise so I get to look at Susan. We're in person. So nice. Everything just flows so much better over together. So this is awesome. But there's all this stuff going on.

Everything's taken care of with how much you guys are getting. So make sure that you are paying attention as we do those announcements. Talk about funnel hiking live. Okay. It's time. It's worried. We're countdown. We're in that mode, but we are going to speak to another guest today. Yes. So let's introduce them. All right. So this, yeah. So this, this, this guy is a friend of mine. Okay. So we met. Oh my gosh. I think it was 2018. So we met 2018. We were both sitting at the same event and we both took action at the same time. So we were able to like be in the same mastermind for a little while and being able to see like somebody go from idea to idea to idea to finding that thing and it taking off and just exploding. And now like a couple of months ago, we were sitting in this room at ClickFunnels headquarters and he was presenting on stage in front of Russell and Russell starts leaning in and you know, it's good when Russell starts leaning into your presentation and he's like all in like sometimes he's listening. He's like, okay, this makes sense. This is not for me. And other times he's like, wait, I need more. I need more. And so he went up and talked to this guy afterwards. They had conversations like I cannot wait to bring him on. Let's go ahead and welcome my friend and an amazing funnel hacking live speaker this year, Bridger Pennington. Bridger, what is up bro? What's up? Pennington is good to be on y'all. This is fun. Thanks for having me. Oh, so excited to have you. All right. So really quick. Your business now is hedge funds. You teach people how to build a fund and to be able to grow it. And that's not something that is sexy. I'm going to say it early out. Like it's almost as unsexy as learning how to budget your funds. Like this is not something that everyone just wants to learn. You don't have an event like funnel hacking live around this kind of stuff, right? That's the exact opposite, Ben. This is the, this is the sexy industry actually. So yeah, our company's called fund launch. We help people launch investment funds. So private equity hedge funds, venture capital, real estate funds, like this kind of world traditionally like Wall Street, big, huge funds that manage billions and trillions of dollars. We help regular people like me and you launch funds like this. So I run a hedge fund as well. We launched 130 funds last year out of our group of community. We have, I think 10 student funds over a hundred million dollars, one student fund over a billion, 50 students, 54 student funds over $10 million, which is, it's pretty cool. It's a pretty fun group. Yeah. Holy cow. Okay. So you took this idea that only, only select few groups were able to do, make it grow. And like, I remember when that was just an idea and you were doing other things like you were a funnel building agency for a while with Mason. You were doing all these other things. So like give us really quick. That wasn't too long ago either. So if you could like tell us where it all got started, where did you join the ClickFunnels roads that would people are like, Oh my gosh, well, Bridger's just on the top of that mountain. Yeah. No, it's not. Yeah. Not that way at all. I, I grew up in Utah, went on a church mission to Taiwan, got home and I was super ambitious. So I started six different businesses. My first two years of college, I started every business on YouTube. You could imagine I did real estate, wholesaling. I started, I did a Chinese tutoring business. We hired like seven tutors. They were tutoring kids. That was pretty fun. Um, we then started building websites for people. So I started to build, I, I did an internship at the time. I met a guy that was doing funnels. I didn't know what that was at the time and he's, he was the CMO and he kind of, I was his intern. And so he started to teach me about what a funnel was and who this guy, Russell Brunson was. This is only, I mean, four, maybe four years ago, something like that. And I, I got really just interested on how like you could change the color of a button, it would change conversion rates and how headlines affected things. And just how cool it was to A.B. test this whole world. And so I read dot com secrets and that stuff. This is during that time period. And I was testing out business. So I was dating kind of businesses while I was dating girls to try to get married. But, um, and so during that time period, kind of two stories at once, I started an investment fund. Um, I come to find out my dad was running these, I didn't, I'm, I grew up in a very normal house, you know, just nothing bad, but just normal. My dad drove an old crappy car and I remember I, my dad finally grabbed me and he's like, Bridget, you're kind of like a chicken with your head cut off. I want you to go talk to my business partner. This guy can really help you out. And I was like, okay, I'll go talk to whoever, you know, like I'll go talk to anybody. So I met with, I drove this guy's house. It's in this beautiful neighborhood gated community. I pulled this guy's house, beautiful white home. I knock on his door and I'm kind of nervous like, dang, this is a beautiful house. The guy answers the door. I walk in, it's gorgeous. He's got the basketball court in the basement, cars, pool, just beautiful entrance, like amazing house. Long story short, I go in, I sit down, I go, how did you do this? Like how did you create all this? And he goes, we started an investment fund and we currently manage a real estate fund. It's $8 billion. To put it into perspective, a lot of people follow like Grant Cardone. Cardone capital is about $4 billion at the $8 billion. So twice as big as Cardone capital. So I'm blown away. I'm like, holy crap. And now that was years ago today. They're over $48 billion. They are literally 10 times bigger than Cardone capital. 10X uncle G and nothing against uncle G. I like uncle G, but I'm just saying to give you magnitude. So I was blown away. I was like, holy crap. And I thought, can I learn from you? Can be my mentor. He said, go talk to your dad. He's like, your dad knows way more about it. I said, no, no, my dad's kind of broke. We live in a small house. You live in a big house. Like I want to learn from you. And he goes, Bridger, sorry to break it to you, but me and your dad make about the same amount of money. And my chin dropped to the floor. I was like, huh? Like come again, you know, like what? He's like, yeah, we're pretty much equal business partners. I left the dude's house. I drove straight to my dad's house. Like, what the heck? Like what's going on? Like, why haven't I been able to order a soda at Chipotle for the past 10 years? Cause it's too expensive and yet you're managing billions of dollars. And anyways, I digress. Long story short. My dad, we started, he started to teach me about funds, how funds are built, how they're working. I started to figure out this game of private equity hedge funds, real estate funds. And so at 22 years old in college, I launched an investment fund out of school. I pitched my dad for money. My dad said, no, I went out and raised some money. I built this little TV fund and it actually did pretty well. We got a 64% return to our investors. It very well. We then launched a second fund. I ran that for about three and a half, four years and we did very well. We then had a competitor coming by us out, which was pretty cool. So I sold that fund and now I run a, I run my third fund right now. We run a hedge fund, which is pretty cool during that process though, that timeline. Um, Mason, who's my business partner in me, we had started getting in this click funnel community. So I remember back to my days when I was with the CMO guy about funnels and we had built websites and we thought, Hey, I wonder if people would want to learn about funds about this space. And so that's when I knew you, Ben, we had this idea and we kind of just floated around with like Steve Larson, a couple of these guys and we started to test this idea and actually Steve Larson and Russell were phenomenally helpful. We, instead of just building, we tried to build a course prior as a real estate course, it totally flopped. And I think that's good to know, by the way, we tried to build a real estate course and it was actually pretty impressive. We hired, um, videographers to come in and film this. We were like, let's be like expert secrets. Let's be course creators. So we built a real estate course and we launched it and it totally flopped like bad and we did the weekly webinar. I did the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I followed the thing and we length and we did it and I did webinars and it did not work and I was so frustrated. And then I looked, I was like, huh, well, there's about a hundred other people that also sell real estate courses like Dean grass. You can name them. There's like a 50 people that run and I was like, why would they pick me? I picked a red ocean. We went right into a red ocean, but I just, some people don't think about that with like online stuff. And I have a friends right now. I have a friend that just last week is like, dude, I want to be a fitness influencer. I was like, dude, you and 20,000 other people, like what's your niche? You're like, what are you going after? And so actually thankful to Ben and the ClickFunner's really helped me realize you need to pick a blue ocean. So we thought we had an idea for a blue ocean with funds, investment funds. And so we had this, you know, cool idea. We actually, we were working with Steve Larson pretty closely and he's like, test your market. So we started doing podcasts and shows and we did ads and test it. We actually launched the course before we built it. That's a whole different story for another day, but we built we, we literally gave ourselves a timeline in the budget. So we said, we got five. So, so I'll back up a little bit. I'm talking too fast. You're great. Well, I had this problem for a while as an entrepreneur. I, you get so much noise in your head. You know what I'm talking about? Like you have all these ideas like I can make money doing this or this or this and you get shiny object syndrome, whatever you call it. And I would lay up at night and my brain was like bouncing around like crazy. And finally had a great mentor tell me Bridger, when you have business ideas, write them all down, pick your favorite one and go after it a hundred percent with a timeline in the budget. So give yourself three weeks and 500 bucks and fully test out that idea. And either in three weeks, you'll be able to check that like that was good. Let's keep going or you'll cross off the list and go to the next one, but it'll get the noise out of your head onto paper. And if you do this test of three weeks and 500 bucks and enough, you'll eventually, you know, find one that hits and then you'll go after it. And so I was like, okay, that'll help me get this noise out of my head on the paper. So we had this idea for an investment fund course. We did three weeks, 500 bucks. We put 500 bucks pretty much into ads. We made like 15 ads, two landing pages. We A, B tested. And then we sold. We had a, like we said, people would opt in for a webinar. We didn't have a webinar built. So they just would opt in and we'd say, oops, sorry, the webinar's, you know, broken or something, but hey, we have a course that's $47 about investment funds. Here's all the details of it. You guys want it. Do and we had a little checkout page and guess what? The course wasn't built either. So people would buy this is straight from Steve Larson. So shout out to Steve Larson. So people would buy in the next page would say, Hey, sorry, the course isn't done yet. We just wanted to see if you would buy. We will refund your money right now. However, if you want to stay, we're going to build this course over the next three or four weeks. And if you want to help us build it, like we'll do it together. And so like we, the first week we had about 50 people buy, I think three or four refunded the other 47 stayed, which is pretty cool. And we're like, Hey, people want this and they helped us build this course out anyways, I'm going too long here, but we then, um, uh, we started to do this and I'll talk about funnel hacking live was like monumental in this process and we'll talk about that in a minute, but, um, we started to build this course. Our first month and a half. We spent about $80,000 in ads and we made back about $81,000. It was the perfect break. Even funnel, like every day we just check. Like we just want to break even just break even just breaking because we were building a list. Right. And then we went, we did a launch, like a total Jeff Walker PLF style launched me to follow the Russell thing. We launched, we did $144,000. Um, and that's, that was one week after funnel hacking live. We waited and we said, let's wait till funnel hacking live. We want to get all the strategy, which funnel hacking live was phenomenal. This is, this is a February of 2020, right before COVID. We go to funnel hacking live. We got all like hyped up. We got all these cool strategies. Everything was amazing. We, because we did that on purpose. Like we need to go to funnel hacking live to make sure we're doing everything correctly, literally seven days later, we launched our, our business on a webinar. The webinar broke by the way, we're using webinar jam. It broke three times. We redirected everyone to a zoom call. Mason was like hyperventilating the floor. He still launched it and a couple of college kids are selling a course on private equity, which is usually a gray hair business. And we, yeah, we did 144,000. We were like, holy crap. And then we, um, we kept doing webinars. So we said, let's do a week. We're going to follow Russell went on stage at funnel hacking live. And he's like, I only know of like one or two people that have done this. If you do a webinar a week for a year, you'll never be poor again. He's like, take me up on the offer. And we're like, okay, we'll actually do it. Cause most people do a couple of webinars. They automate. He's like, no, do a live webinar every Thursday for a year. We said done. And so we started doing webinars in, uh, and we set these goals and we kept doing and we kept iterating tests and we hit a million. We hit our two comic club award in about five and a half months, um, which was phenomenal. We hit 2.5 million in our first 12 months, which is crazy. And then from there we've now we did, uh, we did, I think next, the next year we did like five million to this last year we just did right about right around 10 million in one year, which is crazy. So two comic club X in one year, which is just crazy. And now we've built out our whole value ladder and we've run different funds and it's just, we have about 50 people in our company. It's just crazy. And we're still a couple of young, just kind of bucks that are doing this space. And we have actually like real people that are having real results. And like it's not like it's some fake thing. Like it's, it's massive. And, uh, sorry, there's a lot of offshoot to this. I'm sure you guys want to chime in and stuff, but there's a ton of little mini stories in that story, but now we're to this point. It's, it's now we, we threw an event just a few months ago. We had 2,000 people live in Miami. We had Ed, my let show up Jim Rogers. Um, that was our second big event next year. We're planning a 3000 person event in Orlando. It's just going to be phenomenal. Um, and that's pretty cool. That's so cool. So you brought up funnel hacking live. So 2020 was the one right before you did your launch. Yeah. Is that your first funnel hacking live or have you been to ones in the past before that? Can you tell us about your experience? Yeah, we went to 2019 actually. So we Mason drug me to 29 funnel hacking live. Like, I didn't want to go. I'm a finance guy. I was like, dude, I'm good. Like, I don't need to go to learn this online. He's like, no, Bridget, you need to come. You need to see the vision of what we're going to build. I was like, okay, I'm all in. If I go to seven, I'm all in. So I, and I go to a lot of events. I'll send you guys this for, I, I actually, I like events. I like the, I like studying events. By the way, I go to events. Like I studied the lights and the like where the cameras are positioned, how do they do security? I love just your fire. Oh yeah. I'm always happy. And then I like the stage. Like what kind of, how do speakers present? How do they come on stage? How do they like move the audience? I love studying. It's funny. If you look at my notes of events, half the notes are what the speakers say. The other half of the notes are how they presented. Like, why did they do that hook at the beginning? Why did they come into the audience? Like, I think it's, and I, that there's like even people, even do virtual, like it's not even worth it. You have to be there in person to get that kind of experience. And so I went to Funnel Hacking Live 2019 was blown away. I had been to, I've been to a lot of seminars and conferences and stuff. It was unreal. Unlike any event I've ever seen. And me and Mason, we looked at each other at that event and we're like, dude, we're going to, we're going to hit the two comic club. We had no idea what we're going to do. And the next 12 months, we kind of hit our heads against the wall. That's when we were trying to build websites for people. We were doing agents. It just like, we made some money, but nothing crazy. And then we said, let's do this fun thing. And then we started to test that for about six months. We built like I did that story. I just shared. And then we said, okay, we're going to launch this thing for big, but we need to go to a fun. I can live again. It was so impactful that we, we made sure we went again that next year to make sure everything was perfect. We since 2019, I've been to every Funnel Hacking Live since then. And we, uh, uh, two years ago, we flew out. I think four of our team members, five of our team members. And we just said, you guys, cause it was funny. We would, me and Mason would go and then we'd come back and we'd like have whiteboards with our teams. Like we need to do this, this, this, and they just didn't quite catch the vision. And we would just drag them along and just do this stuff. We're like, we were like, you know, you need to catch like what we're building. And so we paid, we paid, I don't know, thousands of dollars to fly people out and do this. Cause we thought the ROI is going to be so immense. If our, we flew, I flew up my video guy. Wasn't to video me. It was to just, I want you to watch how they do production. I want you to watch their video. I just want you to see where we could become and back to what we're talking about. We're on stage. We're going to talk about dramatic demonstrations and what our video guy was there and they talked on stage about dramatic demonstrations at the event he was at. And then two months later, he came, he's like, guys, I got this great idea. We should do like this thing. We like jumped over a sports car. We were doing these crazy stunts on like, and he was like, I could video edit it cause he had caught the vision of what we were trying to build. And the next board meeting we have the ideas and stuff. It was just phenomenal. So last year we flew out, I think 10 team, it was eight to 10 team members flew out, paid for them in full to be at Final Hacking Live cause they need to catch the vision this year. We're already planning and we're speaking this year, which is really cool. We're still like, we're still flying people out on our own dime to just be there, not to like watch us, but I'm like, you guys need to be there all four days to see what's going on at this. And so again, I've been to events. I've been to Tony Robbins events. I've been to, I mean, I've been to pretty much, I like events. I like going to events and I mean, I've been thoroughly impressed by Final Hacking Live because it's the production quality, but they also the content. That's why we take our team is this is going to give us the ideas for the next 12 months, which is, which is pretty phenomenal thing. I can't say, I can't say not enough good things about fun. I'm not just spitting. I'm not just doing this cause you guys speaking at the event like, and sometimes you do that. People like, I just feel like, yeah, this event's cool. I'm thoroughly saying this like as a true testimonial, like I've never seen a better event than Final Hacking Live that I would pay 10 times more going again. I've gone again and again and again to go to it. Well, I mean, last year you, you paid for like five to eight different people to come last year and you didn't know you're speaking and then you paid Russell to be able to be like in the room and master mining with him inside of his. It's a cat kings now category King. Yeah. And like you were on stage and you started talking about what it is that's important here. So as you guys know, Russell, this entire Final Hacking Live is talking about the strategy called the Linchpin. This is how you get a business that's able to survive and it's able to give you that breathing room as an entrepreneur to be able to continue to be crazy and grow while having the backing that you need to know that you're going to be supported in as you do it. And as you were presenting like he just started clicking these things in his head. You could just watch. He's like, oh my gosh. So what was that like? What are you talking about? What when he, yeah. So yeah, we're the category Kings group and you get a present to Russell and again, we thought the same way. Like I always, I'm a finance guy. I think about things in an ROI sense. I'm going to pay a dollar to get $2 back and we joined category Kings and and they said, Final Hacking Live, whatever the event is, I always think about it that way and we always think about it as an ROI. And I'll just say this before I dive in. I thought this whole click funnel thing was like a total hoax for the first that first year. I was like, this is a, I remember thinking like this is a scam. I tried a bunch of funnels. I try it. We tried with our agency. I don't know seven to 10 funnels that totally failed. Right. And I was like, this is a, this is just, these are fake testimonials. There's no one actually doing this. This is such a whatever. Just one of those hype things. Everyone's hyped up because about whatever. And then I was like, huh, it actually worked, you know, and it's like, it's keeps working and compounding. And then like it just, it was just incredible. So I digress, but anyways, we're back to your question. So we're in category Kings and we did a presentation at the last, one of the last meetings on dramatic demonstrations, which if you don't know what that means, it's just how to create some kind of an event or message around a product or a product launch, how to create a lot of noise. Steve Larson talks about that. You got to create a ton of buzz around your product and Steve and Russell can teach it way better than I can. What a dramatic demonstration is, but what we did on stage was let me show you what it is in action. Like we took what you guys did. I'm a great student. I'll just, I just like to follow the process. I don't like being a trailblazer. I'll you trail, you blaze the trail and I'll just follow along because I'm just, I like doing that. And so I said, let's, let's just, we did a presentation. Let, let me show you on stage how we did dramatic demonstrations. So this kid takes you back to, I think 2021. We did, um, uh, we try to like dovetail things with events. So the Olympics were going on in Tokyo. So we were, this whole Olympics was getting hyped up and we thought, let's do something for our community around the Olympics. So we call it the fund games. Apparently we were going to call it the fund Olympic games, but Olympic is a trademark word anyways. We had to do fun games. So the fund games launched and we had, we built these and we'll show you on stage when we get up there, all these funny videos. They're like funny, but creative that really spread our message. We did a, we dovetailed this with giveaways and give away funnels with upfire. We'll talk about how we do that, but we were re-incentivized incredible people to come and share our product cause they wanted to share a product to give away something to our community that they wanted to share. It wasn't like we were obligating like, please share my message. It was like, no, I want to share this. And we had, uh, I think we added 8,000 to 10,000 leads to our sales team and database, which is pretty big. If you calculate cost per lead, that's a pretty big ROI on this presentation. We then said, okay, let's double down. So the next one we did, we actually said, let's give away, uh, we see these guys like Logan Paul or, uh, these people on David Dobbert giving away Teslas online. So we went and bought a Tesla and we actually gave away a Tesla on Instagram and, uh, which is kind of a, we went for the bigger one. We got, I don't know, 15,000 people to share that thing and it blew up on social media. Did very well. We got a, it was a huge dramatic demonstration days before black Friday, which black Friday, historically for us, we do a big sale. I think we made, I don't know, one, the 1.3 million on that promotion, which was crazy. Um, however we learned a few things from that one, we'll share it on stage, but how like sometimes if you give away a Tesla, you attract the wrong people versus the right people for your product. And anyways, we'll talk about that in a minute. We then did this last year. Um, one, uh, the world cup was happening. And so we let's, let's do that. What's something called the fund world cup. So we did this whole dramatic demonstrations around the world cup. We made all these soccer theme videos that were funny and goofy. We like spoof stuff online. We got a ton of views just for free. People are resharing our content for free. And then it dovetailed into a fun webinar we did. And then we, ta-da, we like made a ton of money from it. Like we just, it was really cool. And so we shared without giving away too much stuff. We actually on stage, I'm going to walk you guys through like how we did it with a very low budget. Like these aren't high budget videos we created. It's like a video guy with a camera and or an iPhone. Like it's not that crazy of stuff. We do these fun stunts we did and, and just stuff taking trending videos, plugging into a theme of something that's going on right now. Kind of this, this formula of what we've built out to create a lot of noise around your product, which makes people laugh and smile, but also say, Oh, like I'm actually going to look into that thing. Um, and it was phenomenal for us. So me and Mason, Mason's not here today, but Mason will be on stage with me. He's my chief marketing officer. I'm kind of the face of the brand. He's kind of the behind the scenes funnel guy and we're 50, 50 partners. So we'll both be on stage presenting this and it's going to be pretty fun. That is awesome. Dude. Um, okay. So look, here's the deal guys. You just heard like a little snippet of a story of what's possible. You've heard Bridger going through all this. You need to get your tickets to funnel hiking live. Let's go ahead and pull up the funnel hiking life sales page. When you go to funnel hacking live.com, this is what you're going to see. And you need to grab your tickets, go through here, realize the experience, see who Russell is bringing on and why he's bringing. We have summaries on every single speaker and every single speaker is there to give value in a very specific strategic sort of way. They're not there in order to sell you. They're not there in order to say, well, here's my program. Well, here's this. This is 100% value. Why are they giving? Because Russell gate to them. These frameworks have inspired and lifted them and they're like, please, I would love to be able to give back. This is an experience you will not find anywhere else. It is the quintessential thing of click funnels. You become a part of the tribe when you go to funnel hiking life because it becomes so much more you realize you're not alone.

Do you have something that you want to throw into that as well as your as your bonus? Yeah, I will. I love the ClickFunnels community. I'm a member myself. I'm a funnel hacker. I love the diehard shirts and everything. So for my fellow funnel hackers, if you're interested in the space of funds and I know Russell is like, we're not VC and that's okay. But it's also good to be on the VCs. The reason Russell hates VCs because VCs make a ton of money. They make a lot of money. And if it's like, okay, you can hate the man or you can become the man or woman, right? Like be the person like that runs the world. So we help people to launch funds. They build real estate funds and build out. They go buy huge portfolios. Russell right now, I've been joking around with Russell. He's been a silently acquiring a lot of businesses under his brand. He's doing this right now. And if you want to grow, yes, you can grow in boot shop. But another way you can do is build a fund and go buy out your competitors. Go buy an existing business or an existing funnel that's doing really well. Not every single person has to come up with a brand new idea tomorrow. You can go actually make a lot of money buying businesses. Anyways, if you want to learn about this game, we've got a totally, an amazing course on funds that we're giving to you guys totally for free. So this course is, it's a robust course thing. It's 25 videos. We walk through what funds are, how they're built, how to actually structure one, how to raise capital, how to incentivize investors. We have PDF downloads. We have an Excel template that you guys can use. We have full live calls you guys get access to. I mean, we actually do a lot of, and our goal is to help decentralize Wall Street. Wall Street is kind of taking over industries right now. They're rolling up industries like crazy. I think last year, one in five homes were purchased by Wall Street. I think more people should understand this game. We can't just let all of our real estate, all of our homes be purchased by Wall Street. People like us need to be buying homes and grouping it together. That's one example. But anyways, if you guys want to learn about funds, how funds are built. We have a totally free course. I don't know, Ben or Susan, the best way to give that. I have a link I can give you guys, whatever you guys want to do are on stage, whatever it is, we'll give that to you guys. But yeah, that's my bonus for all my fellow funnel hackers out there. I think you guys should start thinking about this game of funds. It's a really cool option. And even if you don't start a fund, learning what a fund is, your company might sell to a fund one day. Hopefully, you're going to have private equity firms coming and talking to you, giving you offers. You need to understand how private equity works. How are they incentivized? How do they trade deals? What do they do? And or if you're even not even, maybe you don't even run a company, but you're at a, you're just an employee, your company might one day sell to a fund. And if you understand how funds work, you're probably going to get promoted or do well in that company during the merger or acquisition of that business as well. If you understand this game, so I'll leave with that. It's a pretty cool bonus. You guys will get access to this full course. We built that for you guys. So this is what we'll do. Um, we'll reach out to Bridger after the call guys. So we're going to grab that link. We're going to toss it into the, into the, into the members area. So when you, if you already have your ticket, we'll go ahead and toss it into the membership area. You guys will have access to it.

Um, and it is one of those things that doesn't matter how broke. Doesn't matter how successful I will always be at funnel hacking live. Uh, because it is the event where it doesn't matter where you're at. There's a message specifically for you. And, uh, and there is somebody that you need to meet there. There is, there is something that you need to discover. There is something that is given to you that helps you make it through the next couple of months. My wife always tells me like, you need to go back to funnel hacking live. Like I can tell you're a little low on the juice. Like you need to hurry up. So don't get your tickets. Ben, I'll share a story about that. My wife said the same thing to me last year. Actually it was so funny. I went and I just, I felt like my batteries are a little low and I went to funnel hacking live. And the last day I listened to those speakers and usually the last days, like a lot of impact and everything. And, and I remember I was full like crying, like just tears of like sadness and joy and like, I can't believe how blessed I am. And like, I remember I got on the plane ride and I, I, I didn't, I didn't watch a movie. I wrote, I was at a four hour plane ride home. I wrote for about two and a half hours. And then I think I slept, but I wrote for about two hours about my vision, what I was going to become the changes I was going to make as a, as a family man, as a dad, as a brother, as a business owner, as a, you know, a business partner. And it was, it was a phenomenal just shifts. And I feel like it's back to what, sorry, I keep cutting in. You guys, you guys want to like close this out and I keep cutting you off because I just can't say enough good things about how this event is structured and built. And it's actually literally changed my life. Well, it's, it's, it's so well done that you've modeled it and how you do your business now. So like, if anybody's seen any of your events or even gotten a peak, you model the same pieces and it's Russell is like super proud of that fact, by the way, he's like, it works so good hedge fund people are using it. Great. So dude, I thank you so much for being on. It's absolutely awesome. If you have not gotten your tickets, go to funnel hacking live.com, grab your ticket. You will not regret it. Get your ticket, go through the bonuses, commit to being there. We cannot wait to see you. And the amount of value that everyone is trying to give to you to try to get you there should tell you alone. You're called to be there. We can't wait to see. Bye everybody. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We're racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating. It's pulsing. I'm made for something more. We get scared. And then fear hits us. There's little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven, are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that made me all of my money. The quite best selling framework. What? Start out closing, and you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust in influencers. This better blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning again. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this one precious life? Life. You wouldn't be able to tell, but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People feel a sense of belonging here. It feels like home. I'm still encouraging because if they can do it, so can I. It's all I just want to say, hey, next year we're going to get there. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer in Everland. We find exactly what the business is missing. It's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you your life. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. But then one day they're telling people how they met you. I can live change my entire life. Because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be black. Your legacy's going to be black. Movements are about to be burned. My story hopefully gave women permission. And you're believing in your peace. You do not have to be great to get started. But you have got to start if you ever want to be great.
