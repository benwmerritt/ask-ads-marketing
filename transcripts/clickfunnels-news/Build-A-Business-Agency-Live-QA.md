## Transcript
Alright, hello. I think we're live. The show has begun now. Hi, everybody. This is the Build a Business series, and I'm really excited because today we're going to do a Q&A and kind of do a recap of everything that we talked about during this week. So the Build a Business series is where we actually start a business pretty much from scratch. Now there's lots of things that go into a business, so we don't do everything that's required, for example, creating thumbnail images, but what we do is we talk about how to start a particular business on ClickFunnels 2.0, and this week we've been talking about how to set up a marketing agency. So we had an avatar, a fake entrepreneur we called her Susan, and we were pretending that Susan was coming to us and asking us what she should do to get her marketing agency started. And this week has been amazing. We had so many of our of our ClickFunnels ambassadors join us. People that actually have an agency and they've been sharing their tips and wisdom with us all week, so it's been really, really exciting. Now, my name is Andy Ortega. I'm also here with Danny Walsh, our super ambassador, and I'm also here with Tim, who's on my team, on our team. And Tim is one of the experts. You'll see him in the Facebook group. You also probably recognize him from some of the update videos that we have. So every time there's a new product release, you'll see Tim announcing some of the cool releases that have happened in ClickFunnels 2.0. All right, now we have a special guest, right, Tim? Why don't you go ahead and let us know who our special guest is today? Yeah, definitely. I mean, as you know, we've been talking about a lot about like, if you're going to create funnels and everything that you could actually just do that as a business, right? And we kind of just wanted to show you that we're not just kind of making this stuff up. And we actually have here with us kind of like the face of what's the funnel marketplace, right, where people go and look to get funnels made and everything. His name is Lee Chapman. You want to bring him on? He's hiding behind the scenes. Yes. Yeah, what's up, Lee? So yeah, I mean, Lee, I'm sure you could explain way better than I can. What it is that you do. So you feel free to go ahead. Officially, I'm the community manager of the Funnel Builder marketplace. So that's basically means that I'm the go between between customers and our experts, the whole community. So connecting people, marketing the services and stuff like that. So I just try and reach out to as many people as possible, customer wise, say, Hey, look, we've got some fantastic funnel builders. We've got people that can help you with marketing. Come over to the marketplace, check them out, read their reviews. And if you like them, drive forward. Also do they call me like the funnel concierge as well. So if someone comes to me like, Oh, I'm in X industry, I'm looking for a VSL funnel. Who would you recommend? I need it done in the next two weeks. And this is my budget. I'll say, right, you need to speak to this person or this person. So really just trying to make those connections between people that are looking for experts and the experts themselves. That's really cool, because like we always preach about like one of the main reasons to create a funnel is kind of to give that handheld experience virtually. And going into here, you kind of have that same experience experience as well. Like you don't go in and be like, Okay, I'm just gonna, well, that looks okay. I guess I'll buy that one or contact this person. You're kind of like that bridge. You're like that professional that based on the needs they say they have or the desires they have, you know, where to point them. It's not just like, Oh, we just want to get you in here real quick and just buy something. No, like you're like, you want their experience to be as amazing as it could be, right? Yeah. When you buy anything, especially if you're hiring a freelancer, trust is huge because I think we've all been to market places where someone has said, Oh, I'm gonna, I can do this and I can do that. And you're like, Oh, this is going to be brilliant. And it's only costing you $10. And it comes back. And you just think that was not what you advertised. And it is worrying, especially if you're going to have someone help you build a funnel, which is a big project, right? This is your, your work, your art is the projects you're offering. So you want someone who's going to take it as seriously as you who actually has the skills going to see the project through communicate really well, and has past experience. So I am kind of that go between. So I the recommendations I give aren't just I don't go research people. I know everyone on the marketplace. So I will say, I know you need to speak to such and such and almost sort of take it on my shoulders. And if anything goes wrong, you come back to me, I gave you that recommendation. So you know, right? If you go forward with this, you're in safe hands. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend them. And I think it just, that trust aspect is huge with everything, isn't it? So that's what we're trying to give here is, you know, you come to the marketplace, you see a whole bunch of really good people who's perfect for me. So you go down that little funnel, get a recommendation. And I basically give people one. No, that's awesome. So, so Lee, yeah, I like I like the way you described that, that you help match people together with the person that that might be best for their business, right? So how do you go through that process? How do you decide who would be best for, you know, a Susan or some other person that's looking to get some help? Typically, so we've got recommendation request form that people fill out. So it depends the industry that you're in. So if you're in health and fitness, and you're trying to sell a body building coach, that I will send you to particular people that have either worked in that industry, I know have an interest in it, stuff like that. And it again, it comes down to budget, the sort of person that you're looking for, you might just say, you know, I just need someone who's going to put up any funnel really quick, I just want to get it done, I want to get it done now, I'm gonna get it done cheap. I say, okay, right, I know this person, absolutely perfect, still going to do a really good job. But they're going to have it out for you within a few days. Some of people like, you know what, I need someone who's going to be there through thick and thin, they need to know YouTube ads as well, because I'm interested in that. And I've got all these crazy integrations that I want to throw together. And then I want them to support me for six months afterwards. And I'm like, okay, right, you need a different person, I know who to put you in touch with. So it's really, people come to me with their needs, their requirements, and that's what I base it off of. And as I say, I know all the funnel builders, I speak to them all the time to understand who they are, also what they've got going on, right? If someone's busy for the next month and you want it done now, they're, I'm obviously not going to send you in their direction. So it's all about just working out those finer points, those different attributes and connecting people as best we can. So the funnel concierge, right? So if you're an agency, this is like an ideal service, because if you can offer a big bunch of stuff like you said, YouTube ads, or you've got all different elements of funnels, maybe you're a certified partner, but you don't have to be certified to use the marketplace, right? That agencies can register, I'm sure you've got your fair share of agencies on there, but you've also got the freelancers as well. How does somebody like position yourself in that marketplace? Can you just turn up filling a form and then you're selling, or is there a bit more of a rigorous process? How does that work? So you don't, it's a thin line, it's a fine line, because we want very, we want, obviously want people like and trust on the marketplace, but then at the same time, we don't want to enforce criteria. We don't want it to be that case where you need to have experience to join us, but you can't get experience without joining us and, you know, the first getting your first job syndrome. So people will typically come to us and what we tend to say to people, if you're new, is try and start your own fire. If you're brand new, so people on this now, they're thinking of starting this agency, right, I'm going to be a funnel builder, I've built some really good funnels, they can join the marketplace. And typically what I'll say to people is just do a week, a month, 10 people, you know, find a set number of people or time and just give this crazy offer. Just say, right, I'm going to build funnels for $50, you know, you're breaking your back, it's not worth your money whatsoever, but you get those reviews. And we see that. And as soon as I see someone, you know, someone says, I was just sent this really nice review about this person. Instantly, they're in like in our line of sight. And then we can throw gasoline on it, we can invite you to events, add you to the newsletter, just do webinars with you, absolutely anything. So it's really prove yourself in the beginning, see what you can do, just hustle, as they say. And once you get sort of three or four reviews, it's very difficult to escape our attention. And we want people to succeed, right? If you're a fantastic funnel builder, or a marketer, whatever you do, and you come to us and you provide a good service to our customers, we want to put you front and center. We want you because we all benefit. Then people talk about you, they talk about us, more customers come, we get you more customers. And it's just this really nice little spin wheel effect. So yeah, we're always looking to help people in any way we can. And generally, the best way is to start your own fire, get your first few leads, see what you can do. Now, I've seen some really cool stuff in the marketplace. And by the way, it's, I think it's marketplace.funnelbuilder.com. Is that the address? That's correct. Okay, awesome. So I just want to let everybody know in case you want to go visit right now. So in the marketplace, there's, it's not just funnel builders, I think it's the majority in there have funnel building experience, but there's all kinds of different things that people offer. There's copywriting. I saw, the other day, I was trying to create one of those like course covers, where, you know, it looks like a like a book or like a software package, because remember when software used to come in boxes. And yeah, and so I was trying to trying to do one of those on Photoshop, and I'm not an expert on Photoshop by any means. And it just was frustrating me. And I went into the marketplace and I saw that there's people that offer even that kind of service. So you can get so many different things. Can you tell us a little bit more about some of the things that you've seen people offer? Yeah, so graphic design is probably one of the biggest ones from from the old one funnel away days. That was everyone came there because you want these, if you've got an opt-in funnel, or any funnel really, but if you say think of an opt-in funnel, you want that image is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. And you want it to look good. You want it to like you think of some of Russell's opt-in images of some of these books like the Black Secrets book things that you think, oh my God, that looks fantastic. I can't create that myself. I've done a lot of playing around in Photoshop and it would take me maybe three weeks, four weeks or something to create that. I would enjoy the process, but you just think the amount of time if I if I put evaluation on my time, I basically spend in thousands just to come up with something that's okay. But you can get we got graphic designers that have been with us for five or six years who can create that stuff in 15 minutes. They knock it out. They're experts at it. That's their art. So they're brilliant. Graphic design is fantastic. But again, banners for Facebook and as for YouTube, all those little things that you don't think about logos, icons, just graphics for your page, just all these different things. Because I think when you go online, you see different funnels. You see they've all got these little cool works of art that aren't, they're not necessarily native to click funnels, but someone's designed this really cool shape or, you know, I mean, there's a picture and there's a background with the person's out of it and in it and it, you know, they just look really good. So people can do all that. But then on top of that, we've got people that do marketing. So SEO stuff, which hardly anyone in the click funnels world talks about, I think, but we've got people that can help rank you in Google. We've also got people that can help you with Google ads, Facebook ads, with YouTube ads, TikTok ads, people that can help you find your dream 100 as well. We basically, we are called funnel, but marketplace. But we basically anything that you've heard Russell talk about anything you've read in his books, anything you see click funnels doing or another click funnels user doing, we have people that can do that for you, no matter what it is. So people can create webinar scripts for you, it VSL scripts help you with video editing. Absolutely anything. So whatever you see, if you think, Oh, I need someone to do this for me, you can come my way, send me messages and say, Hey, this is what I'm looking for. Can someone help? And I'll point you in the right direction. So that's really where we're looking to go. And if we haven't got the person, we'll go and find someone and connect you with them just so that you get that level of success, that thing that you're looking for. This is all about you helping, you know, funnel builders at large agencies, whoever these guys are who can show the quality, who can deliver the goods. And obviously, if they get in a big bunch of bad reviews, right, that's not what we want to be seeing. So we get the people who are delivering the quality, the turning up, they're doing the job, you can give them this opportunity. Like you said, you can pour, pour the gas on this, right? And you can get these guys moving, get them in front of potentially their dream customer. And I guess, I guess, you know, and Tim and Andy, you guys all sort of agree with this, I guess, in the Facebook communities right now, you often see a bunch of folks who are like, DM and doing a bunch of crazy stuff to go out there and try and get work. When we've actually got this mechanism that gives folks that ability as long as they're delivering the goods, what would you say to anybody that's sort of like the good at doing what they do, but they're just like, are they even on the fence about getting involved with marketplace? Because it just sounds like you're giving something for everybody, the customer and the provider. Is it just, do you need more people? Have you got room for more people? Can you, you know, to see where I'm going with this? Yeah, I mean, we're always looking for anyone good. We get people, I get messages every single day asking for recommendations. This is who I am. This is what I've got. This is what I'm looking for. And yet we just want the best people to keep coming through. We're a business at the end of the day, and our business grows by having high quality people. And you get the quality through effort. And I'm just saying, I'm sure there's a lot of people watching this now think, I can build a pretty good funnel. Maybe your speciality is design, you know, I can build some very attractive funnels. If you feel that way, you should really be signing up because we are the only click funnels approved marketplace. If you hire someone from anywhere else, click funnels have an approved them. They're not involved with them in any way, shape or form. Obviously, Russell sends people to us. We want to be known as that hub for everyone. So if you are using click funnels, you think, I need someone to do anything, build a funnel. Oh, my integration with XYZ isn't working. I need someone to fix it. You instantly think, Oh, I need to go to the marketplace. I need to go to the marketplace. If you are someone who builds click funnels funnels, or you just know click funnels, we're really the place to be. And as I say, if you can turn up, show that you actually, you are about it, you know, you know what you're doing, you're willing to put in the effort, you do a good job for people, we'll just get as many people for you as we possibly can. And we've got a newsletter that goes out to about 8,000 people every week. And I'm always looking for people to give me content for that. And like to tell me something, give me some tips, whatever it is, and I will send everyone back to you. So if someone gives me a tip and people like it, they typically get sort of 100, 200 leads come through to them just off the back of a tip. Now, obviously, they don't all turn into sales or anything like that. People just come to check them out. But you're on the radar then, right? And it's just simply from saying, Hey, Lee, I'm good at Facebook ads and I do this one tweak and it seems to work really well. Bam, I put that in the newsletter, people love it. And they say, Oh, I need to hire this person, I need to talk to this person, let me see how they can help me. So we've got lots of different options and opportunities for people to come through. It's just about sort of putting yourself out there. And I do think I always wonder if people think, Oh, you know, they must get loads of messages all the time, I'm not going to reach out, I'm not going to submit my stuff. But it's you'd be surprised how few people will actually submit information to me to put themselves forward to me. It's crazy. I say to people, I need your content, I need your quality, send it to me. I want it. So it's, there's space available. You know, I'm always on the lookout. And again, it's if you give me gold, I'm always going to send that to our audience who's going to love it. Then they're going to love you. And it's just that whole thing. Your business takes off, we win, they win, you win. It's just all about looking after each other. So yeah, if you're a good person, you're on the way up, you're trying to improve, you want to take part by all means, come to the marketplace. Awesome Lee. So yeah, there's really no reason if you are, you know, selling something or offering some type of service to other that you think other ClickFunner users would like to, would like to take advantage of, then there's no reason for for you not to join the funnel builder marketplace. Now, Lee, there is, I know that we mentioned something about certification. And there are certified funnel builders, right, that go through some type of training. Can you tell us a little bit about, because originally I thought that the marketplace was only for certified funnel builders. But I think that's not the case. But can you tell us a little bit about the difference between a certified funnel builder and maybe someone that's not certified and, and, and obviously, both are allowed. You don't have to be certified to join the marketplace. No, not at all. So the marketplace existed before the certification. So we obviously had a lot of people that had applied their trade building funnels elsewhere. We have people that would sell their services on Fiverr or upwork or something like that, had a load of good reviews, knew what they were doing. So they come to us and just took off running. The certification, I love the certification because it makes it so much easier for me to sell someone because you can say, oh, Russell and the ClickFunner team have literally shown them all their tools, all their tricks, all their techniques, all their strategies, you know, these, this person, if they are certified, you know, they've gone through the, they've gone through the training, they've gone through the skills, they've been tested, they've been pushed to get outside the comfort zone, build something great, build something that works really well. So obviously I, I love those people. They're very, very easy for me to, to market. So here, look, this person was trained by Russell and the ClickFunnels team. So naturally anyone that comes to me is, all right, they're bound to be good at what they do. But then at the flip side, if you're not, if you haven't been in the certification, if you've been building funnels for a few years, to me, it's all the same. If you think it's, it's almost like Amazon in a way. If you get those reviews, if people like you and you create good work, I don't care what your history is, like, what difference does it make to me? I'm not going to stop you from joining us and put you forward just because you haven't got a degree in marketing. If you're the best marketer in the world without a degree, I mean, that's all fine by me. So it's really based on how you show up, the results you get for people and the effort that you put into it. Beyond that, we don't, you know, if you're making our customers happy, we're happy. And we're happily just pushing forward, shine a light on you. We've talked a lot about this throughout the week as well. And Dan Havy was saying, you know, that it's important for people to go out there and help some folks for free and just get started and real inexpensive, get some customers, figure out what you like, figure out what you potentially don't like about what you might be offering going forward. Well, this just sounds like it's... Now, they start from the bottom, build the way up, they get in front of the right customers, and ultimately, they can grow the business on marketplace. If anybody's watching right now and I know James is saying he's about to launch ads to his online business reports and generate leads and do a big bunch of stuff, should also consider joining the marketplace, right? And positioning your offer on there, your building funnels and your helping, you know, other folks who need this service. And you can always, can they reach out to you, Lee, and just have a conversation and say, look, is this a good fit? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, people, so it's Lee at funnelbuilder.com, really easy. Or you can go on to the marketplace, we've got a little sort of chat bubble that goes through to support, you can send a message there, that will come through to me. Typically the easiest ways to get hold of me. But yeah, as I say, if you're sort of somewhere in between, you're not sure, sometimes it's a confidence thing, right? You know, it's very easy for you to do it in your own ClickFunnels account, build your own funnels, and then the jump between being an artist in your own world versus doing it for someone else, it can be scary, it's a different game altogether. So if you feel like you're somewhere in between, send me a message and we can talk through it, we can have a chat, do whatever you like. Sounds like a plan to me. And our Susan, our avatar customer is like jumping for joy, right? Because we've spent all week showing her the way and she's aware of some of the pitfalls and things not to do. And she's really confident that she can launch her agency. This is like the icing on the cake, right guys? This is like, come speak to Lee. But you're not guaranteeing that everybody is going to get this stream of traffic because it does depend on the quality and the consistency and actually do the work, right? You've got to do the work. But if you do that and you put the time in, like you said, you can help folks to move quite quickly and maybe not have to go and get a, you know, spend a bunch of money on ads or time building up, you know, complicated processes to get in front of some customers. So it sounds totally amazing. Lee, do you want to like do a quick run through, just show your screen and kind of show us what it actually looks like when people land on there, just a quick two minutes and for, you know, conscious of your time. And there's one or two questions that might be coming in as well. But it might be cool just to see what it looks like. We're more than happy to show folks. Laura's on as well. Good to see you. James Mitchell's here. Yes, for sure. So you might be speaking to James Mitchell very soon. You should be able to see the share screen thing at the bottom if you want to give people a little guided tour of what this might look like. Can you say that? Has that come up around? Should have it on the screen right now, buddy. Perfect, perfect. So this is the home page. This is where you'll come. And obviously, this is the get a recommendation thing I keep talking about. So if people are looking for a funnel builder, they click on this, fill out some information. And if you match that request, then, and you know, we've had a chat, I've seen that you've done some good work, then I'm sending people. So how are you, you need to speak to this person. I typically do like these introductions. So if someone approaches me and say, hey, this is the person, this is their profile, have a look, see what you think, I can connect you if you want. A lot of people come back to how are you, can you introduce me to them? So that's, that's what I do in a safe. If you're good at what you do, you will be on the other end of that recommendation. This is where you can contact me. This little speech bubble, send a message to say, hey, I saw you on the, on the live looking for X, Y, Z, can you help me with this? And I'll help you, no problem at all. But as you say, we are the only click funders improved marketplace. Real simple page. Again, these, the first two here, certified funnel builders, they've not been with us for long, but they, their listings are the most popular this month. So they're on the homepage, obviously get a ton of clicks, a lot of interested people. There's one of our graphic design guys, absolutely brilliant, knocks things out very, very well. James, not a certified person, but has consistently been our top seller for probably four years, maybe five years, absolute superstar. So there's, there's opportunities for everyone. And I say it is all about just grafting and seeing what you could do. This is the rest of the pages, just a typical landing page, different services that we offer. So again, it's not that difficult to get to the top of these services. If you just get a few reviews and you'll quickly see your listing start to rise, but then in the marketplace, very simple. Again, just like a typical marketplace that you'd find. And if you think to get to the second row, if you get eight reviews, you're in the second row of the funnel building listing. And this gets a lot of views, a lot of clicks, so that the opportunities are there. These are a lot of real expert people on here. And I say, if you turn up, do a good job, light your own fire. As you were saying, like Dan was saying, you could turn up, get a listing, and you could just say to people, I'm going to do five dollar funnel builds and you can reach out to people on the Facebook group that are asking for help, say, no, I'll do it for five dollars. All I would, all I need is a review. You get yourself five or six reviews and you're instantly starting to rise up the rankings. People will start seeing you. I'll start talking about you. And away you go. So there's a whole different, whole group of different categories. A lot of the time people will come in and they'll look for their own, the specific funnel they're looking for. So they might want to VSL funnel say, and again, quite easy for you to get to the top of these listings if people are looking for the direct ones, but people can come here, have a look around, see where they fit, see what opportunities they have. And if they're an agency, obviously try and have a person in your business that ticks all these boxes, right? A person for the copyrighting, another one who understands click funnels inside and out, marketing person, Facebook ads, funnel builder, funnel strategist, and you'll be a one stop shop, basically. People absolutely love you because that's what they want a lot of the time. It's a confusing world. So if they can get one person that can do everything for them, they, people love that. Right? So you're going to take care of my emails, you're going to do my funnel as well. You're going to do some images for me. Awesome. Sign me up. When can we get started? So is there anything else particular on here you'd like to see? Anything you'd like me to uncover? I think Andy's like, sign me up. Sign me up. Lee, I have a question for you. So this is very different from like Fiverr or Upwork or something like that. I've used some other platforms where, you know, you described it perfectly where you go and you hire somebody and you're like, you're excited because, oh my goodness, $10 for, you know, this graphic design, it would have taken me a week. And suddenly you get it back and it's, it's just not so good. It's, you know, even if you ask for a couple of adjustments, they don't, a lot of times what their goal is is just to deliver very quickly and it's almost like a factory, right? And, you know, there's a place for that, but, but the funnel build, the funnel builder marketplace is much more than that. You actually, you know, you actually know all of the people on the platform that are selling their services and then you, you actually help people match up. So it's almost like you're a dating coach. And in fact, you have an, like an event or something that's called the speed dating event, I think, right? Yeah, unofficially called the speed dating event. I always wanted to market it as that, but I often wonder how many people are going to want to come to a speed dating event. That's not for me. But it is exactly like speed dating, the way it works. Yeah, we typically have funnel builders, one side guests, people looking for a funnel build the other side and you just get matched up. So you, best way to explain it is like a funnel hacking live online. So you come to the event and you're in reception, you go to the stage very quickly and I tell people about the event, then you go to this networking area and then the software does the rest. You basically get paired up. So it's like a zoom call one on one and people turn up and you can ask the funnel builders anything. These are all expert funnel builders, people that you can find on the marketplace, people that are helped, hundreds of people build really successful funnels and you can chat to them for five minutes, ask any question you've got and, you know, potentially find someone who's going to be your future funnel builder, arrange another time to chat and obviously if you are an agency owner, this is just another one of those opportunities that we present to people. Obviously this one is a bit guarded because this is not a high level event, but we want our best people there. We want people that we know, know what they're doing so they're not just going to come on and say, how are you going to make you a million dollars next week and, you know, make all these promises that professionals, the real people know that they can't make. But yeah, as soon as someone comes, shows that they can do the stuff, they can build funnels, they can market, we put those events up, you go on this. So the last one we had had a hundred people register. So there's just an opportunity to get in touch with so many leads. And I think in the beginning, it's always about trust, is it's very hard to trust someone. You can have the best profile in the world, really nice picture, great little blurb about yourself listings. It's still difficult for someone to trust you if they've never met you. So the speed dating is you literally go on and you chat for five minutes, you get to tell them about you, they tell you what they're looking for, and you can match that person, right? You get to talk to them, show them what you're talking about, give them some ideas, maybe blow them away with some real cool strategy or something nice and quick. And you've got a real good opportunity to start finding yourself leads and clients in those events. And it's like a speed dating where you can connect with them, and then you match up afterwards. And yeah, you date in a funnel builder sense. Awesome. So if people are interested in doing that, I think it's every couple of weeks, right? How can people do it? We do at least one a month. So I try it, we've gone for a period of time, we've done them once a week, we've done them once every couple of weeks. It really depends what else we've got going on behind the scenes. But yeah, I've tried to do them. We've got another one. Next one might be next week or the week after. So try and get them in because people love them. If you're looking for a funnel builder and you are a busy executive, the idea of rooting around, looking on the marketplace, you know, reading all these profiles, deciding who's best and looking at reviews, it's a little daunting. Whereas if you can come to this event, the event's 30 minutes, they get to chat to five or six people and they're like, no, I need to work with that person. That person knows what they're talking about. We have it a lot of the time, people turn up, chat to one person, they say, oh, I really like you. I know you know what you're doing. Let's talk offline. I'm going to go and then they leave the event. You know, they've spoken to you. They think you're great. They don't need to see your back history. They don't need to read your reviews. They just say, I'm confident you know what you're doing. Let's move forward. So it's a fantastic opportunity. Sounds amazing. And we've got a few folks, I think, in the chat who are probably going to be signing up and James is saying yes for sure. And if anybody's watching on the replay and you missed this, feel free. Lee's already given the contact details. You can see it there. The URL will share again in the comments as well. I think you've covered a lot there, Lee. And it is an amazing opportunity for agencies, freelancers, funnel builders at large. And it cuts out all of that needing to go out into Facebook groups and trying to do this crazy stuff that ultimately, Tim, we're just like removing these things. So this is an ethical way of getting yourself in front of people who need your services and knowing that if you are in the market for some of these services in the marketplace, I'll speak that there is an element of quality control with the reviews. I guess, Lee, that if folks do go in there making crazy claims and they are going in there and not doing it correct, they're not going to be around for long. So we try and give that assurance. Yeah. So when people first create, so every listing needs to be approved. Yes. Anyway, so it has to meet certain standards. Obviously, we don't want... We know what works and what doesn't work. And we know when someone's making very false claims, especially if it's someone that we've never met before and they say, oh, I built 10,002 CCX funnels. Okay, right. We need a little bit of proof to back this up. So I mean, great if you have. But yeah, we, everyone gets vetted as they create listings. And we keep a close eye on people because obviously we don't want to put bad apples in there, ruining it for our customers. So we're very close to it. And that's pretty much why it's good to start your own fire because it shows us, it gives us that we need to trust people in the beginning. We don't know who these people are. So if you build that fire, you build that trust. And then as soon as we trust, you're like, right, this person out into the world, let's drive leads to them. Let's get them on the newsletter. Let's do a webinar with them. Let's give them every opportunity to get more sales and to ultimately just help our customers improve their businesses. And I think that's kind of like a model for anybody starting an agency, whether they join the workplace or the marketplace or the dorm, right? It's like, go out there, light your fire, help people be legitimate about what you're doing in your offer. And I think this is just like an extra string to the ball that people need to be taking a serious look at, right, especially with all the points that we've covered here. If you're just joining us live, make sure you go back and watch the replay because we have covered a lot. And all, if we do have any questions that come back on the replay later down the line, we'll make sure that we sort of direct them back to you, Lee, as well. Is there anything else that we need from Lee? And we can continue because we understand that time is precious in the ClickFunnels world. Lee, that was great. Thank you so much for informing us about the marketplace. It's a great place for anybody that is a ClickFunnels user and needs to get a little bit of extra help or a lot of bit of extra help. And it's also a wonderful place for people that are offering services like our own avatar, Susan, that we've been talking about throughout the week. She might want to get on the marketplace if she was real. Yeah, if she was real. But this is wonderful. It's been great having you with us, Lee. So yeah, thank you very much. No problem at all. Thanks for having me. If anyone needs any more help from me, just you know where to get me. Yeah, thanks so much for joining us, buddy. Welcome to Stick Around. Are you welcome to move it up to you? No problem at all. If a little bit longer. I'm happy to Stick Around. This seems like you've got a good thing going here. So ideally, we will pick up a few questions throughout the program, but we've also been working each week really just building businesses in different niches. So we've looked at everything from just starting out, where would you kind of what you start getting a few clients and now we're into agency. And next week, Andy, we're going into like taking Susan on another journey. So a little bit about what's coming up next week, any questions we get. And then man, that's another week done. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we're really excited about next week because what we're going to do is we're going to take it to another level. Susan has now built her ClickFunnels site and she's selling her services through ClickFunnels 2.0. And then this week, she actually started a marketing agency. So super, super excited about that. And what we're going to be doing next week, we're really happy to have some more guests and more ambassadors next week as well. We're going to talk about the affiliate, how to use the affiliate option in ClickFunnels 2.0. You can make another source of income through the affiliate program with ClickFunnels 2.0. And what we're going to do next week is we're going to have some of the affiliate experts come on and we're going to have our ambassadors come in. And we're going to walk through the process of what Susan would need to do to actually offer the affiliate program. Or I guess, how would we describe it? She wants to offer her link, encourage people to join ClickFunnels 2.0. And what happens is she is going to get a percentage of the sale when they join ClickFunnels 2.0. So it is an amazing program that everybody should be doing once they get off the ground. And yeah, we're really excited about next week. It's going to be super cool. I'm not in. Hopefully you'll be joining us as well and helping us out with some affiliate stuff. What's everybody's take on the affiliate marketing thing? Because I think some people might think that this is just like maybe where you start or maybe it doesn't produce a great deal of revenue. Or just generally, Susan's got a regency. She's busy signing up. And into this thing about affiliate marketing. I know what my view is. Just I don't know, Tim, what's your view on affiliate marketing? Because it's not open. Oh, it's amazing. I personally love it. There's nothing cooler than when you're not even thinking about expecting you get an email. It's like, hey, we're sending you a payout. Like, oh, who is this? I'll click Funnels. Cool. And if you're just getting started, right? Say if you're just like, okay, I know how to build funnels and stuff, you could easily find, and I'm speaking from experience, you could find, I guess you could call it a niche or industry or something and show them how they could use ClickFunnels to get leads for their business. And guess what? In order to do that, they need ClickFunnels. Why not give them your affiliate link? They join ClickFunnels. And that's it. They join through you and you get credit for that as an affiliate. And all you did was just help them and show them how they could use ClickFunnels to generate more leads for their business. It's just, to me, it's fun money. And it could be life changing. It's not like, oh, I made $10. It could become something like a whole other income for you. It's really cool. Yeah, there's people making six figures on the affiliate program. So, and also, I don't want to get into it too much right now, but there's people that offer help together with their affiliate link. So it's not like you don't get anything. Most of the time, this is how it works. In fact, if you go to YouTube and you just do ClickFunnels expert search, and you find somebody that has videos about ClickFunnels, usually what you'll see is if you click on the description, you'll see a link. And the link will go to one of their pages on maybe their ClickFunnels site. And then it'll say something, hey, join ClickFunnels 2.0 through my link. And what I'll do is I'll give you a free 30-minute call and help you set it up. Okay, so there's some benefits. And really, if you want to be a good affiliate, that's what you want to do. You want to make sure that you offer people something so that they'll join through your affiliate link. And it's a win-win situation for everybody. It certainly is. What's your take on it, Lee, have you done any affiliate marketing of your own? I've not done any of my own, but thinking about Susan, so I live in Nashville. Nashville, full of restaurants, full of bars, real cool place to be. But not many of them implement funnels. So they'll have the typical website. Some of them just send you to a Facebook page. Susan could join the marketplace, go to these places, build them a template funnel and say, here, look, I can give this to you. You need a ClickFunnels account to have it. They sign up through her. And she's rocking and rolling. Not only does she get the client to build the funnel, she also has someone on ClickFunnels that has earned her this affiliate money. And you see, if you're part of the affiliate group, you see the cars people have got through being ClickFunnels affiliates, that's pretty cool. As, like Tim said, there's people just making real money off of it. And it's a completely different stream of income. And you don't even have to do anything. You set people up, get them on to ClickFunnels, and that's it. You're off to the races. You're part and it's done. And you just get that residual income. We're actually looking to implement an affiliate thing on the marketplace. So again, if you have a load of people and you're doing a challenge and you know they need graphic design or something, you can send them to us and then we'll give you an affiliate fee or a commission. So we haven't implemented it yet, but it's on the radar for the next few months. And we're going to get into all of this stuff kind of next week and Lee, if you're around and you want to join us for Q&A again, maybe towards the end of the week or maybe you want to bring that back. If there's any progress, let it down the line on that. That sounds amazing. More than happy to have you back and discuss that, but that does sound pretty cool. And I love the affiliate marketing stuff so close to the dream car. And then I went off and did some other stuff and then things have lapsed a little bit. But working on some stuff with 2.0 myself, because ClickFunnels is one of the best things you could ever promote. And I can't wait to get into this stuff next week, because it really is potentially a game changer. And if you do have an agency or you do build funnels, obviously you're building a funnel for ClickFunnels and it makes sense to sign folks up to the software that they need through your link. And you do get that double, you get the commission and you get the payment for your work. And if you're building that longevity and that continuity in your business, one customer could potentially create you a bunch of revenue for your business. As long as, obviously, like we say, you deliver the quality and you support them, you've got to offer something a little bit unique. But I can't wait to get into this next week. It's going to be super exciting, right? Oh, for sure. And I'm sorry, I went to the interrupt, but like if I could say, because he just mentioned Nashville and there's like a lot of cool restaurants and everything, it's like one of the easiest ways to kind of speaking from a business standpoint, like creating your own business as an agency is kind of what like Susan's been doing. And also just as an affiliate and restaurants, it kind of all just hits someone like my, like one of my best friends actually owns a restaurant. And just to help him out and just for the fun of it, I literally created like the day he was opening. And it was so cool. I actually posted it like in our private conversations over here and ClickFunnels and Slack and everything. I just went really quick, he didn't even know I was doing it. I created a funnel for his restaurant. And I offered for the first day of opening a free drink with their food, right? Created a quick landing page, looked really cool. When they put in their email, they would just get an email with a coupon code. Coupon code was always the same. I just went into Canva designed it really quick and it's like, make sure you show this as proof so you could get your drink. So I basically, after I did, I told my friend, listen, every time somebody gets there with it, take a picture of them showing the actual code. And it was crazy. Like he does, this was like, he lives overseas. This wasn't even here in the States. And so see something happen so fast because of ClickFunnels. It was just the coolest thing ever. The next day, he got 54 customers from that. And every single one, he's, he had him take a picture. And this was doing during the peak of COVID when they were just starting to let restaurants kind of open and this and this and everyone had their mask on and everything. You see everyone taking the picture during this chaos while businesses were closing. He opened and have 54 customers just from that. And all he had to do is just give them a free Coke or lemonade with their purchase of food, but they needed to show that coupon. So if you go and do that, and you have all these pictures, oh yeah, look, we just did it for this one restaurant. Look how many people showed up with this coupon. We could actually do that for you. We'll like set you up with your own funnel account. Like you'd even have to mention ClickFunnels so they don't go and start doing research. Yeah, we'll create what's called a funnel account for you. We'll do this and this and boom, you have an affiliate sale by just showing evidence of something that you did for free once. It's a fun journey, man. If you just get creative with it, it's just really fun. You've got to get a little bit of a thing like that though, because you could literally go and build an agency that just does that. It just creates that one thing for restaurants at large. There's loads of these, they have it in Nashville, right? There's some amazing restaurants out there. Went to a place where they were like, they have loads of peanuts and then they just throw like throw the shells all over the place. It was like, whoa, this is like crunchy on the floor. It's pretty cool. Great steak and everything. And everybody's in a really good mood, lovely music, all the rest of it. And these guys are busy cooking, right? They're busy engaging with the guests. They don't know much about this marketing funnel business and it's a lot of its traditional marketing. So if you configure your agency, you can go and have some, at the very worst, you can go off some lovely food and meet some great people and deliver this as a little side hustle, knowing that they're going to sign up to ClickFunnels and you got that recurring commission because who's going to turn that off? If you're getting 50, 60 new customers every week or whatever it is and it's like, whoa, I ain't going to touch that because it just works and get back in the kitchen and do what they do best, right? That's why the agency does what they do best, customer does what they do best. It's a great relationship and let ClickFunnels handle the tech and the emails and the complicated stuff. So I think Susan's now got another bright idea and she's like, whoa, I can't wait till next week. This is going to be amazing. Yeah, this is, I mean, one of the things that just kind of hit me right now is that there's so many different opportunities in the ClickFunnels universe, right? You can start your business on ClickFunnels and start making an income, start your business. You can also become an affiliate for ClickFunnels. So if somebody else sees your business and you're starting to do really well and they ask you about, hey, how did you do this? You can give them your ClickFunnels affiliate link and make a residual income from that as well. We also have the marketplace coming soon that's going to have an affiliate program. So there's so many different ways and I just feel like, you know, you mentioned Danny and Lee also mentioned that a lot of people don't know about Funnels. They don't know about this universe. And I really feel like it's our mission to tell people about these Funnels. When I run into a friend that's starting a business and maybe they're selling stuff on Instagram or TikTok or something like that. And sometimes I want to shake them and say, you need to get ClickFunnels. You need to start creating Funnels because this is working pretty good for you. But guess what? You can take it to a whole other level. Don't you guys think that that's our mission? Absolutely. I could give another short example because kind of like the conversation, like what you were saying, like you want to shake them like unique ClickFunnels. In my personal experience, like my wife has a business that she actually does from home. And when she first started out, you know, she got like three or five customers or something. And I kind of let her do her own thing. And then I approached her. I go, are you ready to build a funnel? And she's like, yeah, let's, you know, let's, let's just do it. I'm like, are you sure? Because once we turn this on, it's like an open faucet. And she goes, okay, okay. Again, and do this like clockwork. We just build a simple lead funnel with this little offer like $20 off your first appointment or something like that overnight, boom, boom, boom. And like, we never turned it off. Like her funnel still is like, it's just so you have an idea what she does. She does eyelash extensions, right? Small business from home, technically unknown. And there's actual salons all over the place. Because there's like a new hype of eyelash extensions. Big, big salons everywhere. And we basically created a funnel that's a bridge funnel into another software called Booksy, which a lot of Barb is using for booking, for bookings and everything. And last year in our city, her lashing business actually won most booked for the year. Overnight, dude. And it's like, it's, it was, it's so cool to see in all it was because the simple little funnel that we, that we built that other people aren't doing, everyone else is relying on them putting a big enough sign outside and hoping to God a car passes by. That's all, wait, I want to do my lashes or something. Or they're like in one of these salons where they have to rent with multiple people and like it's all mixed with different businesses and everything. Nope, us from our house, we literally beat all the giant brands and names that are out there that are paying thousands of dollars just in rent and like a strip mall or something, you know, to be there. And we all owe it to click funnels 100%. Literally all one funnel away, right? That's the, yeah. That's the thing. Man. Yep. I think Susan's now like, whoa, ready to go, right? Ready to start some affiliate marketing next week. Well, I've any other questions or anything that's coming in, in the chat, but you guys, a pleasure as always. And some of the little things that we've just dropped in the, even in these last five minutes, there's a business in that for someone watching this could be like, I could do that. Right. So even if you're not building funnels and you're not setting up your agency just yet, you can watch our other series that we've just done a few weeks ago. You can go out there, you can plug into the marketplace. You can get some help setting some of this stuff up. You can go out there and you can build your own little weird niche business and make yourself some money, even if it's just a little bit on the, on extra on the side. And next week, we're going to show you how you can plug into affiliate marketing. And this could be potentially be a game changer for you and your family. So it's definitely something that everybody should look at, especially with all of the things that we've got going on right now inside of ClickFunnels 2.0. Yeah, definitely. If anybody's watching the replay or watching us, for those of you that are watching us live, what we're going to do next week is we're going to talk about how to get into the affiliate program in ClickFunnels 2.0 and also how, how most people bring in clients, bring in people to join through their affiliate link, because there's lots of common strategies and it's really easy. I mean, if you have a ClickFunnels account, you definitely need to be an affiliate as well. It doesn't take a, you know, but you could put a lot more work into it, but to get started, take a lot of work. It's super, super easy. And we're going to go over some of the steps, start basic, and then get into a little bit more advanced strategies next week. So really excited, hope to see you there. Yep, yep, yep. And I think we're on time, bringing this to a conclusion. Just want to say a big thanks to Lee for making sure you contact Lee and look at your opportunities in the marketplace and have that discussion, have that conversation. Hopefully we'll see you ranking at the top of the marketplace with your agency, offering your services. A big thanks so much for joining us and we look forward to seeing you on the next adventure. Tim, pleasure as always. Yeah, thanks, Lee. Tim, and I think we can go ahead and wrap things up, right, Danny? Yeah, happy days. Thank you so much, everybody. You're amazing. Thank you, everybody. We'll see you next week for the affiliate marketing stuff. And Tyler and a big bunch of really cool ambassadors. Bye-bye, everybody. See ya.
