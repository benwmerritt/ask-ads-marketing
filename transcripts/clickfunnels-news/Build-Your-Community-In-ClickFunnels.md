Here's a stat to think about. Over 85% of people say they're more loyal to a brand when they feel connected to a community around it. And it's no wonder we've all seen it, right? Those brands that have followers who don't just use the product, they live it. They're part of a tribe, a movement, and they share it everywhere. That's the power of community. It's not just about products, it's about belonging. And when your customers feel like they belong, they don't just buy, they advocate. Think about the podcast you follow. You're not just listening, you're part of the conversation. You engage with other listeners, share episodes, and sometimes you even feel like your best friends with the hosts. That's more than content, that's community. And that's what great brands do. They don't just sell, they build a community. Whether you're running a podcast or launching the next must-have product, building a space for your audience to connect can turn your customers into superfans. And with the ClickFunnels Community app, it's never been easier. Inside your business, you have your community. And within that community, you can create groups. And inside those groups, you can have topics. But what's even better? You have complete control over how your community operates from the ground up. In your community settings, you can do things like editing the name of your community and updating its status. Want to keep things hidden while you're still setting it up? No problem. Switch to draft. Ready to go live and show the world? Just flip the switch and your community is ready to thrive. Want to have a quiet launch to test things out with your inner circle first? Set it to private. Or open the doors wide and let everyone join the party. You're in complete control. Need to ensure things stay on track? You can even set post approvals to make sure everything aligns with the brand's vibe before going live. And don't forget the membership emails to roll out the welcome mat. Along with your digest emails that keep your members in the loop. Whether it's an update about a new product or a major announcement, your community is always informed. You control the pace, the vibe, and exactly how your members experience your brand. Once your community is set up, it's time to start building groups. Groups are where the magic happens. This is where your members will gather, connect, and engage with content specific to their interests. For example, if you run a fitness brand, you can have a group dedicated to nutrition tips, where members share meal plans and recipes. And another group focused on workout challenges, where members can cheer each other on. Or if you're in the coaching space, you might have separate groups for beginner courses, advanced master classes, or specific topics like marketing or sales funnels. In your group settings, you can add a custom name, description, and cover image. Want your group to have a strong identity? Add your logo or a custom banner to make it stand out. You can even control the type of group access, whether it's open to everyone, private for selected members, or secret for your VIP crowd. You can also automatically add members to new topics within a group, require post approvals to maintain quality, and even add an upgrade link for members to unlock premium content. So whether it's a fan group for your latest product, or a mastermind where only the sharpest minds gather, you're in control of how your groups work. Managing content in your community shouldn't feel like hurting cats. With ClickFunnels, it's as easy as organizing your thoughts. Once your groups are up and running, it's all about keeping things organized. Pin important posts to the top so your members always have easy access to critical updates, whether that's a new product release, special offers, or the latest community rules. And because each group has its own flow, you can organize posts by topics so everything stays neat and accessible. And don't worry about manually managing every little detail. Automated workflows handle the heavy lifting. When someone joins your community, they're automatically welcomed. Assigned to the right groups and can jump right into the conversation. No need to micromanage every post. Because let's be honest, you've got better things to do than approve every comment, right? People love to express themselves. In the Community app, your members can create profiles that feel like them. They can upload an avatar, link their social media profiles, and customize their experience in the community. Whether it's a picture of their dog in sunglasses, or their favorite motivational quote, it helps them feel like they belong. These profiles aren't just about identity. They help members connect on a deeper level. Your community becomes much more than just a bunch of people. It becomes a network of relationships. Community engagement is all about energy. With real-time notifications, your members will always be in the loop. Whether it's a new post in their favorite group, or someone replying to their latest comment. It's like having a constant buzz of excitement in your pocket. Only this time, it's not from an overcaffeinated group chat. Users can even add images, videos, and gifts to their posts, keeping the energy high and the conversation flowing. And for those members who miss out on the action, don't worry. Daily digest emails keep them updated, ensuring no one falls behind on the latest news, discussions, or announcements. As your community grows, click-funnel scales with you. Whether you're managing a few hundred members or a few thousand, the platform keeps things simple and streamlined. And let's be honest, trying to manage a growing community by hand sounds like a nightmare. A thriving community isn't just a group of people. It's the backbone of your business. It's where brand loyalty grows, relationships deepen, and your customers become your most passionate advocates. And who wouldn't want a community so connected and obsessed with your brand that they're wearing your logo, sharing your posts, and even hosting events in your name? The ClickFunnels community app makes that possible. Build the space where your brand can thrive, where your fans can connect, and where your business can grow. So what are you waiting for? Start building your community today, and turn your fans into your biggest advocates.
