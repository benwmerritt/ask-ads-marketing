## Transcript
Pat, thanks for coming on. How are you today? I am fantastic and I'm also super excited because I get to geek out with you guys on about a topic near and dear to me, which is courses. Well, yeah, I want to, I want to, I want to, spoiler alert. I want to start with one that's not real traditional, and there's maybe a little bit of curveball for you. Okay. But here's what I found real interesting as I kind of studied up on you before we jumped into this. Would you do it differently? Maybe talk about that a little bit. Like you almost made me curse, but I'm not going to curse live on radio. To answer your question, absolutely yes. Yes, it is. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Tell us more. If you want to learn how to build courses, it depends on who you want to build courses for. So I wanted to be able to build courses for corporate entities, the federal government, you know, colleges. All right, everybody, welcome back to another episode of ClickPhone's radio. We have a guest here who is probably more knowledgeable in their topic than anyone I personally in my career have ever met. And I'm going to get to that in a second because I want to hear from the co-host, Chris Cameron, Chris, are you also a little jazzed up for this? I'm really, I'm really jazzed up. You know, it's funny. Sometimes, you know, in these pre, before we hit record, you kind of say, we're a couple of topics and she starts rattling off. We're like, oh, we'll go 30, 40 minutes, something like that. She starts rattling off what we could seriously talk about for 90 minutes. So let's see how this goes. But I'm super excited for our guest today. Yeah. And it's our pleasure to welcome Kat Dunn, aka Kat the course builder. Kat, thanks for coming on. How are you today? I am fantastic. And I'm also super excited because I get to geek out with you guys on about a topic sneer and deer to me, which is courses. Well, nerd alert. Yeah, I want to, spoiler alert. I want to start with one that's not real traditional. There's maybe a little bit of curveball for you. Okay. But here's what I found real interesting as I kind of studied up on you before we jumped into this. You often refer to like less, fewer and fewer people are doing formal education, right? And they start to dive into these courses. But then I look in your bio and you are somebody who holds two master's degrees. So here's the question, right? For the like, for the first like hard hitting thing, if you could go back in time, or even right now, would you invest in getting those two master's degrees knowing what you know now? Would you do it differently? Maybe talk about that a little bit. Like you almost made me curse, but I'm not going to curse live on radio. But to answer your question, absolutely yes. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Tell us more. Number one, I'm a total geek. I'm a total nerd. And I'm, I'm just a lifelong learner. And so I just love all that. I love school. Yes. That's number one. And number two, I, the two degrees in particular, one, my master's degree in business is in entrepreneurship. So I got that one first. And then I got the instructional design and being able to put those two together have really helped to give me some insight, right? That gave me the theory, but to see it in real life, I think is really priceless. So would I do it the same? Probably. Well, that's cool. And I think what people need to understand is I think it's different for everybody. I'm a college dropout. Like, you know, Russell got a degree, but he also often talks about, Hey, what's the means to an end? Like, if you're not buying the drill, you're buying the whole like, so you're trying to get the result. And so talk to us about maybe if, is it, is it appropriate for some people to just say, Hey, no, I'm going to learn informally, and I'm going to go find the right things that I want to dive into. Is that something you dive into into courses instead of going traditional education? Yeah. So if you want to learn how to build courses, it depends on who you want to build courses for. So I wanted to be able to build courses for corporate entities, the federal government, you know, colleges and anybody. And so when you have that, that formal education, it kind of gives you a little bit of a head of a leg up, just because you can speak the language, no matter who you're selling the course to, and make no mistake about it, the languages are different. Okay, the language of corporate, you cannot talk to them about sales funnels, they could care less, right? Right. And vice versa. You know, the average, you know, the coach, the expert, the entrepreneur is not going to know what an LMS is, they're not going to know what a SCORM package is, and they're not going to care, right? But to be able to speak the language of all of those folks, then you probably, could you learn it on your own? Absolutely. But I think it's a lot more fun to learn it in the classroom with a lot of different scenarios. And then when you tie that together with an MBA, and you get to see the mechanics of selling and the business of selling courses, I think that just, it just opens up a whole another world for you. Now, can you learn it informally? Yes. However, you have a little bit less perspective, I think, just in terms of experience, and you tend to kind of stick only with one thing, as opposed to having a broader swath of things that you can offer. And so as an entrepreneur, we want to be able to offer more than one thing, especially in today's marketplace with courses, you don't kind of want to be a one-trick pony in this marketplace. You may want to learn it. Absolutely. Sure. Well, and I even think for people who are trying to learn a skill set, right? People who have plenty of courses where you can go out and do this informal learning rather than going to school, maybe not for courses specifically, but I was saying they want to learn something. That's a service you provide as an agency. One thing you said that I want to dive into a little bit and Ben, jump in anytime. You mentioned like, I love when you say, hey, your degree makes you have a little bit more credibility, I guess. But you mentioned one thing that caught my ear is whether you're selling to like government agencies. If you got a course, you say, I got an MBA in this, talk to us about that. Are people creating these courses and selling like to governments to use in different places? Like what's that landscape like? Absolutely. Because you know, we build those courses that people are selling to government agencies, right? And those are the buyers. That's wild. They are the buyers. They are the buyers. So you can sign up for Sam.gov, register as a business, right? So that the government knows that you are there and what you have to offer. Remember that the government is not going to, you know, invest in personal development courses. They're not going to invest in courses on menopause for the women in that workforce, right? Like a lot of infopreneurs, right? You're talking about real meat. Yeah, okay. That's right. They're going to buy it. They're going to buy it. So a lot of people, what happens in a lot of cases are people are working out in corporate or for government agencies, and they know that their companies need these courses or they ask and they inquire or they'll go down to the second floor to the, you know, the EPA office and say, hey, you know, what do y'all need? And they go and create it. They go and create it and sell it to their own company. Like you don't have to not be working there. That's right. Yeah. What's an example of like a course that maybe you or somebody that you've worked with has sold to either a big corporation or a government? Oh, yeah. The menopause, that's the one that came to top of mind because that one was the most recent. I never would have thought that a government agency would be interested in that for their employees, but they absolutely are and they absolutely bought licenses so that any woman in their, you know, in their organization could have access to that. So that's the one that came kind of top of mind, but there are lots of courses on like dealing with people, leadership courses. Those are really popular. Financial literacy type courses are also really hot in terms of government agencies and things like that because, you know, people want their companies to care that if they have this information and so they're investing more in that licensing. Do you have like a price tag? Do government entities and these big companies, well, I'm looking at this way. That seems to be like a bulk package like order versus you're going to be a regular infopreneur and try to sell, you know, to Ben Harris, a course and then you're going to sell it to me or you're going to sell it 100 different times where you can just license this thing out. I assume there's a big difference between those two and it's, I don't know if the sales cycles a lot longer. Talk to us about that. No, the sales cycle is a lot shorter because what I have seen mostly is that people are leveraging their relationships. And if you're thinking about doing this, you want to go on LinkedIn and look at your connections and ask who might need this. And so, no, actually the buying cycle tends to be shorter because they know someone and the person says, yeah, we could use that. Show me what you got. And so, the people who actually get those opportunities are the ones who have something ready. The ones who don't. Don't. So, you kind of have to be ready in those circumstances, you know, or you might miss out. Now, I'm kind of naive to this. What price tag can you usually sell to a government entity or corporation for? Is that a lot higher? Yeah. So, yes and no. It's priced a little bit differently because you're pricing per person or anticipation of the number of people. So, if it's an agency with thousands of people, then you don't have to price your license super, super high, right? Especially if it's a PD course, a personal development course or something, they're not going to pay thousands and thousands of dollars for that course. But somewhere between what I've seen is like anywhere between 20 bucks a person all the way up to 100 bucks a person. So, it's per license per person? Per license per person. Got you. Okay. I didn't even know that. Yeah. So, typically the higher the number of employees, the lower the cost per license. And so, but if you're selling, now look, I wasn't getting math. I was a journalism major. So, don't look. Don't even test me on this, right? But if you've got a thousand people in an agency and you're offering your course for 50 bucks a head, how much is that? Somebody do the math. Well, what'd you say? 50. 1000 times 50. 1000 times 50. We got you. 50,000. I didn't pull out my calculator. I was like, easy as math ever. Same on me. Thank you, Chris. Okay. I'm here for you. Okay. So, 50,000 bucks. And you think about how long would it take you to sell 50,000 bucks worth of courses to the consumer market? Now, some people, you just open up your door and, boom, you've got 50 grand. For some people, especially if you're just getting started, it might take you longer. Corporate and government agencies really don't care about how pretty your website is. They don't really look at how popular you are on social media. They really don't care about that. They're looking at the quality of the product that you're bringing to the table. Do you answer a need? Do you feel a need that they actually have in that moment for their workforce or for their clients, for their vendors? So, a lot of people are cashing in on the fact that American companies are sending people, sending work overseas. Okay. So, how does that create a challenge for the American business? Well, there are cultural differences. There are language barriers. There's all kinds of things that, you know, unintended consequences that a course and courses can fulfill. And AI has played a major role in that because now your courses can be in any language that you want, you know, with the clickable button. Right. Even to like where it matches what the people are saying. Like if it's a video course, you could even use it. It's wild. Like do the deep, not deep fake, but I guess it does the translation. That's right. Perry Belcher was showing this a trafficking version, right? Then like, yeah, it's crazy, like what people are doing with this. That is crazy. It's so, so crazy. And the cool thing, don't tell anybody, right? But the core differences, they're kind of behind the times. So, right now, they know about AI. They don't know all the stuff that it can really do. So you can really put a nice little price tag on there. All right. For selling them courses in different languages to match the different cultures that they need because they're like, wow, we really need this. They don't know it took you like two seconds to change it to, you know, Swahili, right? Yeah. Big demand over there. Yeah. That's right. I'm just going to meet you in the lamppost. That's fascinating. And I really do want to unpack how horse creators could be leveraging AI to a higher degree. And maybe some of it's ahead of its time, but some of it's not, right? Some of it's actually even behind, like you just mentioned. For your, you know, clients, people who follow your content that are getting started, because we've mentioned there's a lot of, you know, B2B market as well, what would you say is the best way to get started? Because we, you know, in our community, this is fresh, right? We've never had a lot of people come in and talk about this stuff. Do you think it's a better avenue to get started, to get a better adoption rate and with your content and refine it before you launch to a consumer market? How would you, you know, let's say I'm looking to create a course on how to make a tomato garden in my backyard or something like that. Yeah. So it kind of comes down to what came, what comes first, the chicken or the egg, right? Do you put the content out there first? Do you build it first and hope they come? Or do you know, if you, you know, if you don't have it, what do you do? So I always err on the side of be ready so you don't have to get ready. Get it done. You can't stretch for a street fight. You know. Right. Like you've got to be ready so you don't have to get ready. If the opportunities are there, but you're not ready to meet those opportunities, that's gonna, you're gonna miss out because, because things are moving way too fast. There's a lot of competition out there. And so I would say if you want to get started, the first thing we want to do is make sure that your, that your content is consumable for an online market, if that's what you're trying to do. If you, if you want the course to be online, because there are different kinds of courses we can do in person, we can do online, we can do a combination, a hybrid. So you want to look at what is your lifestyle that you want to create by means of this course. And what I mean is this, the marketplace is definitely changing in the, in, in what it will accept as a course at a certain price point. So if you're pricing your course over 200 bucks or so, the marketplace is now saying, I need to see you before, before COVID and COVID, they, they accepted that you may not be there. Okay. But now the marketplace is changing. They're shifting back to where they're saying, I need to see the influencer. I need to know this is real because in this world of what's real, what's memory, what's not, you know, I know I'm dating myself with a memory thing, but Ben doesn't know what I got you. I'm falling. Ben has no idea to find I'm with you. But in this world, right, people are much more skeptical. And that skepticism is lengthening the sales cycle, because now people's gotten a lot more choices. And they're not sure if your course is is AI. And even though for us as business owners, artificial intelligence is like, it's amazing, it can do all of these amazing things. But you have to remember that the marketplace doesn't necessarily see it as amazing. They see it as, you know, another way for them to get tricked and do. You know, and another way for them to not get what they paid for. And so they're a lot more skeptical now. So we have to, you know, those who are thinking about jumping in to building courses have to take that into consideration, you know, when they get ready to sell it. Boy, 200 bucks, though, you got to think like that's, that's tough, right? Like, is it a race to the bottom right now with these courses and pricing like, in a lot of ways it is, in a lot of ways it is, because what's happening is that the market is being flooded with mediocrity. Okay. Oh, I love that. Cool. It's so true. My gosh. And the consumers have a hard time sorting that out. They can't even consume it. They can't figure it out. Right. And so, yes, it is a race to the bottom. And so what's happening is that the, the, the, the alternate reality is that people are saying, okay, we know that there's this mediocrity out there. We know that there's a lot of garbage and trash out there now. So now I'm looking for the real thing. I'm looking for someone that pierces through the facade that I can see right away. And so you want to start investing in your authority, investing in your brand in a way that you didn't even have to do maybe even three years ago. Wow. This brings up a whole other subject for me. Like, if I'm the consumer, how do I sift through and find out who's legit or not? Because listen, there's a bunch of people who are entertainment influencer personalities on TikTok and all these other things. Right. Versus the Infopreneur actually has a lot of them have really good content. Yeah. So how do you separate those two if you're the consumer and sift through and find the quality? I'm glad. I'm really glad you asked that because over the last, I would say 18 months to two years, we have, as a business, really spent a lot of time trying to figure out what consumers really want when it comes to information. What is happening in the marketplace? Because we noticed the changes maybe about two years ago. It started then, but we weren't sure if it was just a fluke or something that was happening. But we are headfirst into the realized information age. We have been in the information age, but now the consumer has decided to fully engulf themselves in the information age. So what does that mean for us as business owners? That means that now there is a surplus of information. People feel like if they wake up in the morning, all they have to do is say, hey, Google, what's the price of tea in China? And Google will tell them, right? They didn't have to pay for that. They didn't have to ask anybody. And so because the flood is in the marketplace, that means that your information is not as valuable to the consumer. Yeah. And maybe they can go find free stuff on YouTube or whatever. Correct. So what does that mean? Does that mean the course building industry is over? And there's nothing we can do? Absolutely not. So what we found out is this. Information is about 30% of what really interests people and makes them press the buy button. It's about 30% of what they really want. They're not buying your course because of the information, not solely because they already feel like they can get that. Okay. They already feel like they can get it, right? They can get it on Google, YouTube, TikTok. They can get information. So the information itself is not what, why they're buying. They're buying because of the other 70%. The other, what is the other 70%? I'm glad you asked. I was, it was on tip my tongue. Yeah, I'm a little bit about to lift up my mind. We're on the edge of our seat like, tell us 70%. Yeah. They want your course for analysis, insight, strategy, experience, case studies. That's what they're looking for. So you, you've got to have information. Okay. You've got to. But what happened, the mistake that people are making right now is they're putting way too much emphasis on their information. I know. It's like, it's a total, you know, ego killer, right? Like my information is so amazing. I'm sure it is. Okay. But for the consumer to press the buy button, you cannot emphasize information and you cannot throw information at them. It used to be that pre COVID, right? Pre AI, you could just dump a bunch of stuff on people. As a matter of fact, a lot of the gurus were saying, you know, just fire holes them. It's going to make them want your course to really figure it out, right? Right? Well, it doesn't work so much anymore. You cannot just throw information at people and think that that's going to be good enough. They're not going to like it. They're not going to take it. They're not going to refer anybody and they're not going to finish your course. So it's going to be bad all the way around. So not only that information is not as as meaningful, valuable. Okay. As we like to think it is. So what you've got to do the solution is to wrap your information around analysis, insight, strategy, right? And help them to see something that chat GPT can never do. It can never give your insight, analysis, expertise, case studies. It can't do it. It can only give from a conglomerate, right? From people, an aggregate of people all over the world, millions of people. It can't give your insight. It can't give your analysis. It can't give your experience, expertise. They can't get it from there. So what happens is people get caught up in what AI can do. AI can help me to give people what? Information really fast. And they're like, yes, this is awesome. But then they can't sell it and they don't know why. I also think, I love this is such good insight. I also think people get caught up. And Ben was mentioned this on an earlier podcast we did. People get caught up in this information loop without taking action, right? Like you can go and consume and consume. And a lot of people get this dopamine hit this addiction of saying, oh my gosh, I got more information. I got more information. But in a course, if you're selling a course, a lot of times, like what we do, click funnels, like when we give this education, we're also providing ways for them to go act, right? So where are those courses that happen? Where do you draw the line of here's all the information? And here are some actionable items for you to do. Very good. So there are, I'm going to wrap that up in four things that people will pay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to answer your question. Four things that people will pay for. They're going to pay for process. Tell me how to do it. Right. You're going to pay for access. Give me something I can't get for myself. They're going to pay for implementation. Help me do it. Right. They're going to pay for a destination. Give me a safe place and a beautiful place to access all this information. Okay. If you as a business owner can wrap your course and as many of those layers that I just gave you as possible, you're going to be able to raise your price, raise the value, and people are going to buy it. Okay. So the key takeaway is not just information. Just give them information. Give them process. Give them access. Give them implementation and give them a destination. Wow. Would you say, these are all like rhyme now, like congregation, right? A place where community building, you know, we are now. Deliation. Yeah. Can I get an amen? Amen. Would that be an aspect you could maybe add to course building as well would be a tribal community aspect to it? Or is that not as important as, you know, a lot of other things that we see make things sell, I guess. It is. If you can make it a destination, don't call it a community. Okay. I like that. If you think about it as a place that I want to be, I am seeking out. It is a place of nurturing. It is a place that I feel safe and I feel comfortable and I feel served and I feel warm. Right. Think about the Bahamas and Jamaica and Bermuda, right? It really has to be a destination spot as opposed to just a community, right? Because the market has changed. They don't want to be in all your Facebook groups. They don't care about your Facebook community. Why? Because it's not a must have. It's not a place where they feel safe or nurtured or getting fed and served anymore because we don't have the time to do it. And so it's just a place now. Well, tell me this and I'm going to kind of rephrase that. I'm trying to understand maybe a good example of that. A destination, oh, maybe this is it. Maybe it's like the Two Comic Club award, right? People are funnel hackers. That's the community. But when people come together on this, the goal is by kind of coming together, we can help everybody achieve that million-dollar award. Like you said for you when you started this, you said, I want to have a million people teach a million people. Does that align kind of with what you're talking about? It does. So a destination is a place where think about, right? So like when you get off the plane and there's somebody with a lay and they're putting it over your neck and there's someone to greet you and welcome you and show you where the drinks are in the bathrooms and those sorts of things, that typically is not what's happening in most communities nowadays. Most communities, that's not happening right now. It's they get a DM message that says, hey, thanks so much for joining ABC group and so on and so on. Don't you want to get on a call? And they're like, no, right? They're not feeling warm and welcoming and that's with real people who are interested in what's really happening with them. So you have to just kind of go out of your way a little bit more to to make them feel like they're supposed to be there. The other thing that that it does is another example of how you can make it a destination is by giving them custom freebies, custom value as opposed to everybody gets the same freebie when they come in, the same download, the same ebook, blah, blah, blah. So we have to make it more of a custom experience. Do you like water sports or do you like fine dining? Which one? So that means we got to have more variety. That means we have to have more things that we are offering them instead of just keeping it kind of you know, stay on. How do you how do you customize that without coming into this? Yeah, yeah, I am too. Like how do you customize this without like adding tons more bandwidth to your team? Are you leveraging AI in that aspect? Or like how are you doing this where you're not trading time for dollars? Yeah, great question. So no, you're not leveraging AI because people don't real people. Is it going to be more bandwidth? Yeah, if it is, is it going to take more bandwidth? Yeah. So what a lot of people are doing is they're having more opportunities for the influencer to see them virtually in person, right? So they're offering them, you know, come on, let's go to a virtual dinner party. Hey, let's all meet for lunch and learn. So they're giving them more more time and more opportunities to actually meet with the actual influencer. So to customize it, right? When you when they first come into your community, we're asking them three questions, right? What's your problem? You know, give me your email if you want this and that sort of thing. So instead of just giving them that one little, you know, million dollar blueprint to, you know, life as we know it, we're going to ask them for their number so that we can actually ask them what it is that they want. So we text them, we call them, does it add bandwidth? Does it add, yes, but it pays off. It's real value. It's real value and it separates your community from those who are not doing that. It doesn't seem rote. It doesn't seem like it's just, you know, so so remember what I said when we're talking about those four levels, process access, implementation, destination. Those are four that you want to aspire to to include. You don't have to include all of them, but the more of them that you can master, the more you're going to be able to put a price tag on your course. So I was just talking as to someone the other day. I'm over here taking notes. He has an agency. Okay. And he wants to put out a course. Now, here's the thing. The people you have a couple of different avatars in your community, they're either DIYers or they're done for yours. Okay. So they're going to end up mixed in there. So just like with click funnels, you got some people who are ready to figure it out. And then you got other people who say, you know what, let me just pay somebody to do it for me. Right. I still want it done. I want it done for me. So those of you all who are putting a course together, I want you to really put some thought into is this really for the DIYer or is it really for the person who says, I want to halfway DIY. I don't think I can pay or afford for someone to do it all the way for me. So I'm not really like it. Maybe like I've done with you over the shoulder or something. Done with you over the shoulder combo. So for example, for example, you're going to incorporate a little bit of implementation. Those are templates. Those are done for you graphics where you can just share the link to Canva. So instead of just doing a Canva course, okay, let's give them some templates that they can use and work on without having to start from scratch. Everybody thinks, Hey, if I give them this from scratch, it makes it more valuable. No, it makes it more valuable if you give them something that's not a blank piece of paper. Okay. Isn't that what chat GPT is all about? It's about you don't have to start with a blank piece of paper. Give them a head start, give them a push. So instead of just having your course, right, that's going to give them process how to do it a to B. That's fine. Now give them access to something they would not have access to. Like your Canva, like your membership site, like your software, like your templates, like your dish or that I mean just as you got, now you got an offer. Now you got stacked value. There you go. There you go. But do they still need the information? Absolutely. Of course they do. But now we've made it more valuable. Like 10 fold. That's insane. 10 fold. 10 fold. Now your four points you've hit on, are those ranked from top to bottom in terms of importance or impact? Yeah, actually they are. So process, we've got to give them that because that's what they're paying for. They're paying for them for how do I get from point A to point B. You got to give them that. So that's first. Implementation is access and implementation are about equal. Because if you can give me access to something that I don't have access to, I'm going to pay premium dollar for it. If you and implementation is even higher than access, they're not in that order but implementation is even higher than access because if you can help me do it, like help me get out of my head, help me get off this blank piece of paper, that's really valuable to me. So here's the conundrum for a lot of people. They are still stuck in, I'm just going to offer something passive. I want passive revenue. I want to make money in my sleep. I don't want to have to do anything. I want to throw out my course and turn my back and walk off. I hate that. Look, I'm just a messenger. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. It's the truth. But that's not really going to happen. 2015-ish, probably. Maybe. But 2024, no. So what can we do to offset the fact that we are going to have to create a destination, that we are going to have to do a little bit more? We're going to stack our offer, stack our course, leverage our course so that we can charge more money. That way, you don't have to quite work as hard. But yeah, you're not going to be able to really turn your back and walk off. Sorry. Consumer behavior is changing. Even past tense, it has changed. One question, it is backtracking a bit, but you've mentioned within that behavior, there's more skepticism. Fighting that, we mentioned leveraging more on content, possibly information on the front end, let's say. But how do we as sellers in this market fight that skepticism? Not fight it, but combat it. No, you do have to fight it. You got to fight it like a street dog in the alley. Because people are really getting aggressive about it. They want to see your credentials and they want to make sure. How we fight it is, be real. Just be real. Be something that AI can't be. Genuine. Right. Be genuine. People are like, oh, God, how do I do that? Well, you got to show up for people. You have to really be willing to be the person that people need. To me, that is the number one thing to do. And that's probably the hardest thing for most people to do. Because people are good with their information. Their information, they can talk about it all day. They know their stuff. They can talk about it in their sleep. But showing up is the differentiator. That is the thing that people say, is this person a fly by night? Is this someone I can trust? Or is this someone who is just going to throw stuff at me and I don't see them for weeks? I don't talk to them for weeks. They don't give me an opportunity to meet them. Or it's only one opportunity. I have no time to. And so that's the thing. Now, remember when we were talking about the analysis, the insight, all of those things, those are things that people really place value on. So when you do show up, don't just show up with your face on the camera. Do an audit. Do some hot seats. Help them to analyze their website or their garden or their baked goods or whatever you're helping them with. And then they're like, oh, okay, this person is genuine. They really care. And so maybe their course is something that's going to help me get there. And look, don't be afraid to show them behind the curtain. A lot of people are gatekeepers. Right. And so the gatekeepers are, you know, they're getting put out the playground. Okay. People like are tired of the gatekeeping. And so you can't be afraid to share with people the process, your connection to the process, your story behind the process, why they should take your course as opposed to take a chance, take my course instead of taking a chance on somebody else. Yeah, I love what you said show up because it's so much more than physically being in the building or physically being on the call show up has so many different levels to it. Well, we could talk to you forever. This has been fascinating for me. But for those who want to get started and have found a lot of value in this, yeah, where do they go to like work with you? Do you have social handles? Is there a link that they can go to like use you as an agency and get these courses built and have your help? Where do they go? Absolutely.
