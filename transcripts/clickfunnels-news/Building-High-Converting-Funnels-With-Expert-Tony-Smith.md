And I'm excited to bring to you a guest that I've actually had the pleasure of connecting with recently. They're a mutual friend and someone that I've been able to, one, call a friend and two, learn a lot from really, really quickly. And Chris, you were just echoing that statement as you did some browsing before, you know, as you were prepping for this episode and you're excited to learn from this guy. Oh, totally. Yeah, totally. I looked at the landing pages, a lot of stuff he's done. What's so cool is, you know, a lot of times, you know, you have the auto mechanic who his, you know, sometimes his car is on cinder blocks outside in the front, right? What our guest has done has done so much work for everybody else's and is now getting like momentum. Like it's pretty crazy how many like two comic club awards like this guy is responsible for and is now carving out his own and so on. So this is going to be a lot of fun. Yeah, for sure. This is your funnel builders favorite funnel builder. But with that being said, we're so excited to welcome Tony Smith and Tony. What's up, man? How are you today? Man, what is up? I'm super honored to be here. I remember when I first started building funnels, it was like I was a big Shopify guy and my friend Justin, the one you met, we were, we were so scared of click funnels because we didn't understand at the beginning. We were trying to like build a funnel on Shopify and it just didn't work. And then that's how we understood how powerful like click funnels was. And then ever since we switched, like I've just been, you know, a fan of click funnels, you know, I've been to the events and for me, it's been life changing to what a funnel can do in the past year and a half that I've been messing with funnels to see how many lives are changes, how many business have changed. I just talked to a client this morning. We had a 10 a.m. call and you know, most people look at their click funnels and they look at like the past seven days. So what we did was we looked at it for actually we looked at it for the months, right? And what's cool is I'll show you guys right here since everyone knows click funnels. Literally this guy was like struggling like, you know, save my business with stress. And I was like, it's going to work. You know what I mean? Just like hockey stick right here, man. Yeah. So like look at this month, you know what I'm saying? And this is something that is very attainable that anybody can do. Like these aren't humongous numbers that scared to chase. But March, three hundred twenty four dollars, four thousand dollars to this month. He's at like twenty thousand by running a webinar, you know, on click phones that we built for him. That's awesome. I'm curious. Is this a webinar like with the typical, you know, you blast it out on Thursday, then you do the replay Friday and then close down sequence on sat on Sunday. Yeah, this is a live webinar, you know, just like you guys preach all day. Like this isn't even the auto webinar. He's doing it on Mondays. We built out the automations form and everything and it's just running. So I mean, like Monday, huh? So when do you do it? When are you doing the like the when everybody signs up and everything? Usually we do that like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday is a promo. But when are you doing that if you do it Monday over the weekend? Yeah. So it's just like it's kind of the same because it's like if you do it Thursday or Sunday, there's still seven days in between. So like attacking his list and his like whether it's email or text, but we he also actually does too. So we have we do the encore on Thursdays because that's kind of the day everybody's still in the mix of watching them, at least in like my industry. So he does it on Monday. And the thing that's good about that too is if you think about someone who's new, like he was 20 K for the month, newer coach is less noise on a Monday on in my world with my clients, like everybody's doing Thursdays and Sundays. So it's like now you're competing against, you know, other other topics and niches and all that. So it's like he's in the box truck field, but then somebody may hit him up and be in the courier business. And now he's trying to figure out presentation to go to. So yeah, yeah. Very cool. Yeah. I kind of want to start from the beginning, Chris, do you want to go on that? You look like the wheels are turning. Well, you know, you know, you know, webinars are my thing. We could get into that more, but I don't know that this is all about. I am curious though, like how did you come around to this whole internet marketing thing and be like, OK, this is going to be my thing. I'm going to build funnels for other people. What's the story that led you to that destination? I would say I was led to it. It was compounded skills for one. And then it was just like it was God sent. Like it just happened. And I tell you the story. So a lot of people that may be even looking at click phone was maybe T-shirt people, e-commerce people. I was an e-com guy. So in college, I started doing Photoshop because I wanted to learn how to design it. Couldn't pay for the stuff because it was college. So I learned Photoshop. Then I started doing graphic design for like night clubs and business cards, but I got tired of that. So then I met a guy that taught me screen printing. So that design skill moved to the T-shirt. So I would do like the Click Phone logo. I would make y'all search for the event and that would be a huge order. That was cool, but I got burnt out in the warehouse. So then we went to e-com and I was like, oh, I don't got to deal with clients. We just got to like let them know their order status. That was what I did for about 10 years. That's how I met Justin that you met been. We became friends through T-shirts. And then ironically, I wanted to start an e-book and during 2020, that was kind of like the e-book phase. And it was called the T-shirt game and that e-book sold a lot. Justin partnered with me and then Justin ended up leaving the T-shirt space because his digital business was growing fast. And then he hit me up one day and this was the epiphany. You know how Russell always talks about the epiphany story and everything. He said, bro, you got to get out the warehouse. And I'm like, maybe like two years because I had like automatic screen printing machines, people, everything. And it was like something I thought was one year out the other. But then a couple of days later, I'm at work and it was like all my staff is gone for certain reasons. My wife was working with me at times. She was mad at me. So she wasn't helping me ship that day. And I was like, do I really want to be standing in this warehouse manually shipping shirts and everything? And then that summer, my business just tanked because my energy left. So what happened was I kind of went broke that summer because my energy had left the business. And then Justin and the girl named Ellie had did this humongous webinar challenge called Mission Black Friday. And then I made the funnel and it just looked so much different than traditional funnels. Like, you know, most funnels typically have like a boxy look. This one had like fire flames going CSS all through it and everything because I always had that eye. And then people were like, who did that? Who did that? So then I was at the Circular CEO's conference here in Atlanta and there was another guy that I had briefly met through my friend Justin. Will Rivera, Will's got the two CC plaque, 25 million. Shout out, Will. Shout out to Will Rivera. So then he was like, oh, that funnel was hard. And he was like, well, we don't like our funnel guy. You can make ours. So to kind of bring it full spectrum, I was doing like 800,000 a year in my t-shirt business, but it was like at a loss. It was just all expenses. So Will gave me the opportunity to make a funnel for 1500. And then it was like after I made it in like three, four days, the money was clear. And I was like, this is my future right here because I was like a cleaner job. I felt like I could do more. And then since I met Will and I knew Justin, it just opened the doors to all these big coaches that I was able to do a lot of work for. So David Amari, Will, Deon Coopwood, all of these people are doing like five million plus. So I was able to already doing great work, but leverage these humongous coaches and, you know, their likeness, getting their testimonials to, like we said, I'm 40,000 away from my two comma clubs. So that's a lot of funnels done, you know what I mean? And in less than 12 months. And the thing that I love about it so much is it's actually now grown outside of just coaches. It's like I'm helping life insurance companies. I'm helping solar people because it's a perfect lead generation system. So the webinars where it started, but I love the VSL funnel, like just the amount of leads that come through it and the automations. I got to ask you this. And I saw that like you said like 950K with this t-shirt business. Not all two comma club awards are created equal. And I want to kind of dive into this a little bit. There's a big, big difference between revenue and profit, you know, and when you dive into something and you're like, yeah, I did a million dollars. And I know there's a lot of people with plaxing and on the wall, they did a million dollars that may be slightly profitable or maybe not even profitable at all. Like talk to us a little bit about that. Like what was that like when you kind of realized, oh wait, sure, this revenue is cool, but it wasn't profitable as much as you'd want to. And the shift with that. Talk to us a little bit more about that. Yeah, so it's actually two parts to that. So you're absolutely right. People can make a lot of revenue in any type of business, but it doesn't mean that it's profitable. Right. What I do love about the ClickFunnels industry is that you can get rid of a lot of expenses because it's not like hard expenses. A lot of your team is going to be, they could be remote. You've got AI now. You could do all of this, but the world is endless to kind of create profit in whatever business you have. So two ways, if you do it all the way, you know, a ClickFunnels, whether you're an agency service provider, you can really get rid of a lot of costs because you don't have to have office space. You don't have to have like the cost of a full-time American worker in an office that has to drive to work. But then again, the other part is say you are the local business, right? What I try to teach people, you know, in the offer that we have is you have a skill and, you know, ClickFunnels has empowered us to be able to digitally package that skill and train somebody else. So if you are the best cookie baker, you are the best landscaper, whatever it is, I truly believe you should be creating a second income stream by creating digital products around what you're skilled at and selling stuff like that on ClickFunnels. So when you talk about churning revenue, you know, ClickFunnels allows us whether you're a service provider or want to add an additional revenue stream to be able to create profit in your business. Yeah, I love that. And then people have got to realize, you know, jumping in to find the right tools and the most efficient way to do something. Yeah, revenue is very different than profit. Yeah, for sure. Now, going back to webinar versus VSL and that type of thing, are you saying VSL is now kind of your new favorite funnel? Is it E-com? Is it webinar like you as an agency? What do you think from your experience is the quickest path to say a two comma club, you know, type funnel? I would say the quickest path and it's slightly cut depending on the case basis. And what I would say is VSL due to high ticket, but I've also seen my friend David Amari get a two comma club in 10 days off of a webinar. So yeah, 10 days. And I built his first funnel to he does YouTube automation. So it depends on the coach, right? So the reason why I do VSL though, so either or is great. And I truly think as you grow as a coach, I call funnels like weapons, you deploy them at different times for whatever you need. I think you should have both because what I know is super busy people don't tend to always watch webinars just going off of this. The stats, but they're great for VSL's on a lunch break. I'm going to catch this five to 10 minute video, book a car real quick. They're back to their world. The guy that's trying to figure it out. He's at home at seven o'clock watching the webinar. So it really depends on your audience and who you're going after. I'm a high ticket guy. So the VSL works perfect for me. But if you have an offer that's kind of like, let me explain this to you. The webinar works great. But then here's another thing. So where the auto webinar fits in the auto webinar fits in is really been great. These past few months during this school boom that's been out where people are like, instead of doing the hour webinar, do like a webinar where you pitch at like 20 something minutes because it's just in time and then just stack it with testimonials and reviews for the remainder of the time. But it's a low ticket offer. I like that. 97 a month. 97 a month. And then I have a friend named Smitty here in Atlanta. He's at $86,000 a month and monthly or current revenue by doing it. Wow. You know, I feel it's funnel. Wow. I got a question though about this VSL. You say VSL to high ticket. Usually VSL is something that in our world is usually a hundred bucks to 500 bucks. But you're using and then if you go high ticket, you're going to go or webinars up to maybe three grand and then three grand and higher. You're going to a phone exactly like what Ben's saying. So if you're doing VSL is that to book like an application call or what? They're not buying on it. So it's just to walk us through that process for people who don't know. So high ticket with a VSL. How does that work? Yeah. So to piggyback off the initial question, the reason why I do VSL is because I get a lot of new coaches that are trying to get in the game or trying to package their first product. The issue with the webinar is if you are a new coach and I don't say this to hinder anybody, the thing is it's the tech that's involved because let's say you're a new coach. It's the tech that's involved because let's say if it's live, people aren't looking at that is actually a live event. It's just on the computer. So that day we have to make sure the emails are sending the text are sending. We have to make sure, you know, that they have even the ad spend to support it because what we look at on our data on our side here is we usually get at best 20 to 30 percent show up rate. So now if we're looking at the math $5 on average cost per lead 20 to 30 percent to show up, you need 500 leads at $2,500 to get 100 people to show up. This is cold audience we're talking about as well. So work to be hired. But when you go to VSL, they're opting in. Now you're my clients are like, wow, we're getting leads. That's a win for them. Then, you know, you can have an appointment center that you find on, you know, online for $7 an hour that's calling every single lead to get them to book appointments. People are self booking appointments. And then now what you notice is with that $2,500 ad spend, they're getting literally way more interaction because people are booking calls. So not only if they're not closing, they're getting that market research. They also have the opportunity to call all these leads and it's faster because my calendar and slack. I see the leads coming in all day. People are booking for the next day and getting clothes versus the live webinar we have to wait. So that's kind of why Russell, even in his books always says seven days of promotion, you kind of waste money because people forget. And he said that in his book, you know, he promotes like two to three days before the webinar so that it's relevant. Yeah. Yeah. Are you using AI in any of this? Like you talk about, you know, maybe people that are setting and booking appointments versus like self booking, you leveraging AI at any point of that process? The only we have it in like a chat bot that follows up with people, but I haven't really trusted like that, like not the hate on them, but like the air AI and all that stuff just because there's a part of personalization that makes people have trust. And what I tell my clients is the only reason people don't buy from you is because the trust factor in the middle hasn't been like solidified. So every time you go to purchase something, it's like you may see something, then you go look at it on Amazon, go look at reviews, then come back and buy it. That's the trust factor. So webinars are great because they build trust in the VSL is great because the closer builds trust. But if you use all AI, you can miss out on that middle piece of trust that kind of glues it all together. Yeah, that's a great point. Dang. You are insanely knowledgeable about this stuff, right? And this is a conclusion I'm drawing in my head so you can either confirm or deny this. Do you in one quick context as well? A lot of people listening to this show are looking to get started. Make that first dollar, right? A lot of times that does start in the agency realm, right? If you don't have a product or service, you study about it and it that way you're almost getting paid to learn in a way. You've been able to work with amazing offer creators, right? Incredible entrepreneurs. And in the process, it seems like you became one yourself. Would you say that you learned a lot by finding the right clients to work with and you were able to, one, create amazing looking funnels and then two, learn about all this offer creation and the process as you got going? 100%. It's like the beautiful part of it is in the past two years, 365 days times two, there's probably been like 25 of those days I haven't built a funnel or touched a funnel. So it's literally like ingrained. Like my friends, if you were around me, like we just like nerd talk all day about like offers and everything, right? Yeah. So the beautiful part about it is, yes, I have became my own coach inside of my agency in a sense, you know, working towards my own plaque, all of that. But the thing that's so great about it is it makes me better every day because I'm listening to their problems and I'm fixing their problems and I'm just like, oh, I didn't know I could do that. Well, let me move that over to my side too as well. And then so being able to be around, you know, all these big coaches makes it even better for the new coaches because every time I'm learning stuff, I'm just bringing it back down to them. You know, so that's kind of how like that new coach that I showed you that went from that 4,000 months to the 20,000 month is because I'm learning the highest level game from the big coaches and then I'm able to share it with my new coaches. So it's like I'm always in like a mastermind learning, you know, dude, let's hit on that. Because even the saying of, you know, look at your five closest friends and you'll see your future. Like that is, it's so cliche, but oh my gosh, it's true. And that even dates back to, you know, the employee and hill mastermind concept. Touch on how that's impacted your life professionally and personally. Yeah, it's amazing because I think I went from it's always like my friend Justin told me he's like you're like a level A talent in a in like a C playing field when I was in the teachers. And what's so cool now about being like this, you know, renowned click funnels builder or whatever is really just the fact of like being able to take your skills set and really put it in a high level because my ring golden always said like if you want to become rich, solve a rich person's problem. You know what I mean? And I feel like that's what I've been able to do in this funnel world because they're making all this revenue through their funnels and it's like I get to come in and solve their problems and then to be able to see like like this month's our biggest month and there's you know, coach is bigger than me agency is bigger than me but like we're at like 154 K for May and just funnel building which is awesome. And like a year ago, a big month in t shirts for me was like 40 and 50, you know what I mean? So to be able to be around these guys and then build out an agency I have 16 people on my team. It's like it wouldn't happen without having the exposure of being around them. And it really just shows you what's possible when you're around like these types of guys the types of high level information you're getting wheels going to the Atlas program and bringing the game back so really, it's like being around these guys has made it to where it's like even being the smallest in that group makes me just a big fish in another pond just because they're all bigger than me and coaching in the sense that but it's like, just to see where my life has changed in a year and a half, you know what I'm saying about being around them has been amazing. So definitely got to have that circle type of just people that are always elevating. Yeah, and it's, it's the right circle right everybody listen you're always part of a community or part of some type of circle. You know but that that doesn't mean that it's the right one so being very you know, I guess specific about who you're spending your time with and being around for sure. Yeah, for sure. And so and then just being able to like, will and David both have like the X plaque him 500 was one another one of my close clients he's got the two CC. So like when you're talking to like these people and they're regular people and so like what I would say to anybody on here is when you ask yourself what's the difference in them and what's the difference in me. It's just that they keep investing in their exposure, and they're just becoming the authority so a lot of I have clients that want to get in the game and they fall off I think the funnel is going to do the work. The funnel is the tool so I tell people I can build you the fastest and best race car, but you still have to drive it and win the race. So when you have this tool, it has to have traffic. You have to go on podcast you have to spend money on ads, you have to get out there but the good thing about it is this funnels going when you're asleep or you're on vacation you're sick the funnels working for you. You just got to get the traffic to it you know I mean, right. Yeah. Diving into into your agency realm. You've built a lot right and they've achieved a lot of success. And if you want to pick more than one, you know, Chris let's say we allow it, give us your top two to three maybe an honorable mention right your top tier what are your favorite funnels or offers that you have built that even our listeners can go and tap into and check out themselves. Yeah, so my favorite ones are recession proof tour.com. And then I'll show it to you real quick since I can share my screen. So let me was let me tell you what we did for this him 500 calls me and says hey I'm doing a tour. But the issue is, you know, I have no way to collect leads because we're selling on ticket master or like event bright. So the way we built this funnel is really just a legion funnel. We created all these different tickets to where it looks like, you know, you can choose what city you want to go to. But it's just a pop up and the pop up is the exact same pop up everywhere. But what happens is he now gets the lead they get on his text list they get on his email list. But the thing that happens after that is they then choose what city they actually want to go to but they don't know that they're just giving him the lead. So this funnel was super successful for him to get tons of leads and for his, you know, his system, then another one ticket price do you know what's the ticket price for this tour. Oh, these were cheap. This was like an in person he was going to all these cities. I think it was like 50 to $100. Just curious. Then you got to think like 1520 years ago to that's what people rock stars were charging for their tickets. I mean, yeah, they're filling up and stuff. Who thought as an internet marketer or you know, you're talking about recession proof business, then you charge $50 to $100. And you charge more than that. You know what I mean? It's wild. We live in a brave new world guys. Yep. Yep. Exactly. The next one that I was working on is this one from my client, Carter and George. They do a challenge five day challenge right here. So the way that we do it is we go challenge tickets on a webinar. So simple webinar funnel right here where they sell them into the challenge. Yep. So what what happens is they opt in, then it goes to the bridge sale by the bridge sale. After they say yes or no thank you. So thank you page webinar curse. Once the webinar curse they land on the challenge on the challenge right here. They pick you know what tickets they want. We've got upsell. So if you go general mission is going to upgrade you to VIP or ask you to. But these guys right here. $2.8 million you know on their challenge 80 90% cash collected. So then when you look at like these designs are phenomenal by the way. So good. So like even on my opt in form like this was last just last year so like hopefully you know this year the even better when it goes to Vegas but like these are all my clients right here. So you see like they got three the ones I just showed you will just a bunch of them to even like this guy ties on really cool young kid has a offer on Instagram teaching you how to make a shout out page. So I'll show you that one and then I'll get off but I just want to show you how cool that it looks. So this is a great insight to what I mean screen sharing could become a thing on the pods now I don't know maybe make you right we got where we got to incorporate incorporate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like this is his his challenge he's doing the same thing right here five day challenge. 21 year old did $700,000 on a challenge spent 200,000 and adds so like 21 years old you know what I mean in click phones doing his thing right here. Social proof or whatever but the thing that they're doing is like I said they're no different than any new coach that's only here watching they're just investing in traffic for themselves so like if you build the funnel and don't do anything it's going to sit on the shelf. But if you're pumped traffic to it emails text sales is going to happen so that's the only thing different that the new new coaches have to do. What's your what's the number one traffic source that you guys are using because I think that's a lot of times the problem. Right and obviously you go reading traffic to you there's so many ways to do it but I'm curious what you're using because the funnels are beautiful and everything else. But sometimes that secret ingredient is the traffic what is most effective for you traffic for me personally and for the clients. Both. Okay if they're different scenarios to explain that. Yeah so pretty much. When you're running traffic right there's traffic and Russell says this in the book there's traffic that you own and then traffic that you earn right so you can go to Facebook. You know by your ads you know from Mark Zuckerberg meta and then they'll start promoting your ads but what the goal of it is and that's why you have to have a funnel is because they own that area but you want to leverage Facebook ads so that you can own the traffic so that you own your ads. And then you can have a list the emails the names the phone numbers so Facebook and Instagram of course are where it starts at but then for myself personally and for these clients they all have humongous like they're on a lot of podcasts you know that you get on everything they can get on because I don't have that much following on my YouTube page but I'll have people by my highest offer and they're like man I just watched all your YouTube stuff. So the most important thing that I've been coaching is don't focus on vanity numbers with likes and followers and stuff like that, which you want to focus on is being a real person and just being an authority. Like if you look at like one of y'all's big click phones person like Elaine Wilder like her Instagram is not crazy, but she's always consistent, you know she's got social proof that's all you got to do is just be out there, be a real person, because here's another thing when it comes to funnels, we're solving pain points, you either want to figure out how to fix the car, you want to figure out how to learn stocks whatever that offer is. That's what you're doing is sometimes coaches can slightly get it confused and get a little too much into selling themselves, but what you got to figure out is people are on your page just for a few seconds to figure out if you can solve their problem. So if you can literally with your offer solve their problem and then in your content show that you really know how to solve their problem and that's your trustworthy for solving it you'll get the sale. And it's pretty much like that easy, a lot easier said than done but those are like the main points and then you know I'll be geeking out about this stuff so like even with the secrets right. It's true. You got secret one secret two secret three you don't need no more than that. If it's not working is probably the vehicle wasn't working right so you got to get in the right vehicle. Secret number two you got to tear down their internal beliefs of why they think they can do it and then secret number three the external beliefs of why they think outside factors are stopping them from doing it if you prove those three things to anyone they'll purchase. Oh so good. Flip it. Flip it. That's awesome man. And even you know Tony for our listeners that that want to opt in to want to learn more and follow you all the information that you're putting out into the world. Where would we like to send people will put all the links in the description as well. Yeah so the easiest just to get to everything is my Instagram at tuned in Tony to you in ed I n t l n y tuned in Tony. And then if you just want to go straight to the V. S. L. it's super easy for this audience funnel hacker workshop dot com. This is awesome great insights to and as in parting. If you have advice for an agency owner knowing what you know now you can get in the delorean back to the future style go back and even tell your younger self something. What's the number one piece of advice that you've learned for experience before it closed just for agencies. Awesome question. The number one advice is find the who's who's of your industry and work for them for free for a couple of projects and build up the social proof because the biggest clients that I have actually aren't the ones that pay me the most. It's the newest new coaches but I'm able to leverage the big coaches I'm able to leverage their testimonials hang around them to where all the new coaches are like well that's the guy that's where I want to be. Obviously their knowledge is rubbing off on him so I'm gonna work with him because he has to know something because he's talking to these people. So to reiterate that is. It's it's it's not that you're doing the work for free because you're going to make the money the him 500 funnel has brought me so many clients. So find who's the best in your industry and just do great work for them for a little bit of time so that y'all will come you know friends and you could just leverage that in your portfolio and then they'll bring the rest of the crowd. Bingo proximity love that. I love it. Awesome man. Appreciate you. I appreciate Tony so much. Thanks for having me guys.
