You're sitting in your closet, you're sitting on your bed and you guys are making like money hand over fist. But first off, let's talk about the sister thing. How's that? How did that come to be? Do you always know you wanted to go into business together? What's up with that? No, I can say that this is not anything that we ever would have dreamed would happen. So we moved out here, we never dreamed that we were going to business. It was just kind of like, all right, well, this is where we ended up cool. She is so dumb, like she's gonna get scammed, like she's gonna lose her money. We're just roasting her hardcore. You're taking shots from husband, from sister and be like, no, I believe this. It's cause I know there's entrepreneurs right now who have this dream and they believe, but everybody around them doesn't. Hashtag feral kids. Yeah. If you're present with sticks and we're just like, hey, did you respond to that person in socially? I've never met someone that's creating that's depressed.

Here are your hosts, Chris Cameron and Ben Harris. Welcome back to ClickFunnels Radio. My name is Chris Cameron and joined with me as always is the co-host with the most Mr. Ben Harris. What's up, dude? What is going on? This is going to be a real fun one. I'm excited, Chris. Yeah, this is kind of a change of pace. Like, I think it's really fun. What is super fun about like ClickFunnels and our community? Well, it's not only the software, right? It's the community, but we find these diamonds, like these people who are like up and comers, who are absolutely crushing it in like the last amount of time. So I'm excited. We've got two guests today. And these ladies, like seriously, I'm looking at them right now. One is sitting in her bed, right? And this is on camera. And the other one is sitting in her closet, but they have built a seven figure business in less than six months, like from a couch. Like that's their whole thing is like couch office mom. So without further ado, I want to welcome Megan Hall and Paige Herzog. How are you guys? I got super good. Yeah. Well, maybe talk to me about this. Yeah, you guys are both sucking down ice coffees. This is great. Getting the energy. Your sisters, first off, I want to kind of know how you decided to kind of come to business together as sisters and like, does that work? But then I want to dive into like, you're sitting in your closet, you're sitting on your bed and you guys are making like money handover fist, doing digital marketing, affiliate stuff. But first off, let's talk about the sister thing. How's that? How did that come to be? Do you always know you wanted to go into business together? What's up with that? No. Yeah. No, definitely. This is, I can say that this is not anything that we ever would have dreamed would happen. Megan's the older sister on the youngest and we fought growing up and things like that. And we lived apart for several years. Megan moved away, came back. And now we actually live next door to each other, like a hundred feet away from each other. These ice coffees look the same. Did you guys go get them together? We went and got coffee. They look similar. That's often how we conduct our business. It's over coffee. And people, this is kind of weird. We live on a compound. That's what our friends call it. That's what we call it. And there's three of us, me, Paige and my brother, Sam. And we all live on the same like six acres. No kidding. And yeah, and so we just walk to each other's houses all day and our kids run feral in the middle in the big yard. So that's the compound. Yeah, Paige. So we moved out here. We never dreamed that we would go into business. It was just kind of like, all right, well, this is where we ended up, cool. Where are you guys located? We're in Texas, kind of outside of San Antonio. And it kind of started with like this digital marketing kind of started getting into it. And I originally wanted Paige to do it with me when I started, but she was like, I think you're about to get scammed out of so many. I was laughing at her. It was like having a meeting to learn more about it. And she was like, I think I'm gonna do this. And I was standing in the kitchen with her husband. And we were like, she is so dumb. Like she's gonna get scammed. Like she's gonna lose her money. We were just roasting her hardcore. And then it turned into what it is. And even still, I was just watching her do this for months. And I was like, I'm okay. Like I still need to see you be successful first. I'm like insanely skeptical of anything like this. And I watched her just succeed month after month. And I was like, you know what? Like if you can do this, I know I can do this. And so I hopped on board, Megan taught me everything she knew. And then we just both dove head first in a research because like that's the kind of people we are. We are just constantly researching and looking for ways to improve. And that's kind of gotten us to where we are now. It's crazy how it's happened, but this has been the most fun thing I've ever done. Can I ask you something, Megan? Yeah. All right, here you are. You're taking shots from husband, from sister. And be like, no, I believe this. And the reason I wanna dive into this a little bit is because I know there's entrepreneurs right now who have this dream and they believe, but everybody around them doesn't. So talk to me about how that felt. And like if you had drive or something to say, well here, just watch. Just like seriously, like hold my eyes, coffee, watch. Right? What was that like? Take us through that process. I mean, obviously now they're followers and in it with you, right? It was really scary. Say I'm also really skeptical. We're a farming family. My dad's a farmer, our dad. And we were raised to work hard. Like you work, you go to school, get your degree, and we want you to work for somebody. And that's what you do. And that's how you support your family. But my dad's also an entrepreneur. He's got several of his own businesses. So we kind of grew up with that entrepreneurial mindset, but I never knew how it would happen for me. And I didn't even think this would be it. I just knew that I was miserable in my nine to five job. I was really unhappy. I was a project manager for an engineering firm managing a team of writers doing zoning reports. Like the most boring thing possible. And honestly- You're not passionate about zoning reports? Come on. My whole thing was for years, I have felt like there has to be more to life, period. It was how is this how I'm supposed to live my life? Really, it's just working five days a week, living for a day and a half on the weekend. Is that really what we're supposed to do? Is that how we're supposed to be fulfilled? And I just felt that so strongly. But when I found this digital marketing experience, I did not realize this was going to turn into this like world changing opportunity. I just knew that it might be a step in the right direction. And call it what it is, intuition. They were making fun of me, which fine, roast me. But I was like, guys, I know even if I lose money doing this, at least I'm trying something. And it was the first real risk I'd ever taken. It was very uncomfortable for me to make content. It was uncomfortable for me to put myself out there to do anything outside of what I was taught and trained to do. So it was really, really scary, but it was kind of like, I don't have a choice. If I'm this miserable, I have to do something. And I wasn't really afraid of being wrong. I wasn't afraid of failing because I was like, maybe I'll learn something from this that I can take to another opportunity. And at least I'm finally stepping outside of that comfort zone that has kept me uncomfortable and unhappy for so long. Because that's what comfort zones do. So I was like, if anything, I'm just taking a step in the right direction. And they laughed. I laughed because I was like, yeah, I'm probably getting scammed right now, but let's see what happens. And then a year later, and it's turned into this. I love that. Let's see what happens and keep going. And Ben, jump in whenever you want, but I have so many questions. Like, I want to know, obviously the brand that you have right now is called Socially. And before we get into that, I want to know, you guys have your handle and stuff as like couch office mom. All right? Like, what's that all about? Is that what you're calling the people that join your programs and stuff? What does that mean to you? Why do you kind of band around that type of thing? We're laughing, right? You're sitting on your bed, you're sitting in your closet, but it doesn't take this big fancy office workspace and a bunch of employees to make money. You dive into that a little bit, if you could. Yeah. So when I was coming up with my handle, when I literally got was getting started, never posted on Instagram ever in my life. And I was like, what do I even make? What's a handle? Like, how do I even come up with this? And I was just trying to think of what I want from my experience, what I want other people to glean from my account when they just look at me. And I was like, I, this is not, you know, we were talking earlier, this is not like a fancy operation. This is low budget, but we're making big money. And it was kind of like, I want people to know that you don't need anything fancy. You don't need any kind of setup. You really just have to get started with what you have. And what we all have is a couch. What I had was a couch. And I was like, that's where I'm gonna do my work. Cause I don't have an office, a home office. I have my bed. We've lived in an old farmhouse, two rooms. Like this is not, I don't have a dedicated workspace. So my couch is gonna be my workspace. Well, my kid was like blaring cocoa melon, like the absolute, that was my one. And so I wanted people who found my profile to realize that you don't have to have everything to be, to just get started. You need to have very little to get started. And I wanted them to feel comfortable with that information because that's who we are. We're very regular, normal people. And we want our audience and our community to understand that if very normal sisters living in the middle of a field in south Texas can build a seven figure business from their couch, why can't you? But now do you both have kids? Yes. Okay, so how many kids? So how many do you have Paige? I have three. My, my love. My house is insane, which is why I'm working in my closet. I have three, there's six, four and two. So they're. Oh my gosh, you're in the thick of it. Yeah, yeah. So, and that's another reason we kind of like really just drive home on the, you can do this from your closet. You can do this from your couch. You can do this with your computer stacked up on shoeboxes in your closet and a cheap ring light from Amazon because like if we can do this, if we can make this work, anybody can. And even though, you know, we still, we're making income now, we're still doing it like the easy way because you don't, it does not have to be fancy. And I feel like a lot of people get really hung up on that, you know, when they're trying, when they're thinking about starting, they're like, well, I don't have the money to go out and buy this or that, or I don't have a fancy setup or like you don't need it. We'll help you get there. Like just, just start. I love it. And okay, so Megan, how many kids do you have? I've got one, he's three. Okay, so talk to me, both of you about this, either one of you can take this. I think there's plenty of women out there who have a dream, okay? They have a vision and they want to do stuff, but they're also trying to be in their community. They're trying to be a mom. They're trying to be a wife. They're trying to, you know, volunteer at church or PTA or whatever and trying to do all of these things. How does mom, does mom guilt play into this? Can you have it all? Is there a certain formula that you guys have figured out? What do you teach people about that? That's a really good question. It's great, but I would say it's the exact opposite. There is no guilt. Your kids, my kids is my motivation for doing this. He's the whole reason I wanted to get away from my job. And, you know, I was like, who's raising my kid if I'm stuck at a desk all day? You know, and so there was no mom guilt. There are times when it's kind of like, all right guys, like we gotta get this together. I got a post on Instagram, which is the craziest thing in the world. Like you need to just zip it for a second. But most of the time he's just screaming anyway. And so I posted, like, you know what, that's real life. But there is no mom guilt and maybe there should be, but... No, I don't mean it that way too. I was just kind of meaning like, seeing what you're doing, I think that it's a way to be able to do what you wanna do and not have that, right? And I think you're explaining it perfectly. Yeah, and this is the, like Megan said, this is the whole reason we got into this. You know, when I got started, like I was working from home, but I still didn't have the ability to be with my kids. And I didn't, I had insane mom guilt when I was working a full-time job, insane. Because I was out of PTO, so I would have to ask my relatives to watch my kids when they were sick. That's a mom's job. Like that's kids wanna be with mom when they're sick. And now we work for ourselves. If my kid gets sick and he needs to come home from school, I don't even think twice about it. I go get him. I do what we need to do. I can be, I'm completely, you're able to be there in a way that you're not there when you're working a nine to five. Like emotionally, I'm so much more emotionally present for my family than I ever was when I was working a nine to five job. And that alone, like wipe everything off the table. Like being able to be emotionally and physically present with my kids has been enough of a reason for me to continue doing this. It's been a game changer. I love that. Now, I understand that you guys are graduating from the couch, the bed, the closet, and you guys are building this office. Like on property, you guys are building a legit office. Like tell us about that. Yeah, we literally bought it this morning. And guys, we're telling you all. Before this meeting. We like something people always ask us, like what do we need to spend, you know, to start up with this? And we're like spend as little as possible. And we still live by this mentality. We're something we say all the time. We joke about, but it's actually very real. It's real. We will like cut subway coupons out of the, you know, that whatever paper gets mailed to us and they're on my fridge right now. We find a promo code for everything that we buy. We're not extreme couponners, but we're always out to save some money. I don't care how much we make. That hasn't changed in a year. I don't see that going anywhere. So we bought an old used like tiny home that is not finished out. And it's on wheels. No, it has, it's like on cinder blocks. And we're going to have it to our property. And it's, it's, it's super cute. It's got windows. It's got like a tiny little porch. We're going to make it really adorable. It's like a shed. It's a shed. It's going to be a key shed. And, but we're going to have to get in there and do the work. Like it's a mess and we need to fix, you know, insulation. We need to put up walls. And so that's what we're going to do. And that's going to be our new office after. We could have spent a lot more to get like a finished out one. But like Megan said, we are cheap. And it's not even like, it's not a scarcity mindset kind of thing. Like we're very much in the abundance mindset, but we're cheap. And we're like, if we don't have to spend more, why would we, you know? Yeah, absolutely. One fun thing to look at, and even the listeners and viewers too, in the online marketing space, and quitsidentally is also in Boise, Idaho with ClickFunnels, but Nathan Barry who co-founded an email service provider company called ConvertKit during COVID, he built his own home office in his backyard. And the whole thing was vlogged on his YouTube channel. So which I'm sure you have plans to do so, but I'm sure audience wants to see every step of that. So as soon as you hear the beep, beep coming in, you need to be pressing record and documenting the whole thing, right? Definitely. I got some videos today. Like right now it's full of an old saddle and a bunch of Christmas lights. So that's going to have to be. It's in rush shape, but it's going to be amazing. I love it. Well, I'm excited to dive into the business side of this. Okay, so let's talk about socially, all right? Seven figure business, all right? We've talked about kind of how, you know, you're doing this and where you're doing this, but talk about the framework or the strategy. How did you grow that? What's the business? What do you provide? What are you teaching? Man, this was gradual. So this was not like an immediate, we have a one of completely built out product. And I don't think any business starts that way. It was, we started as a small Facebook group back in June of last year because we were just kind of helping people who'd just gotten started doing digital or affiliate marketing themselves. And we were like, well, maybe we can offer a space for support and for extra guidance. But as we got into it, we realized there is room for additional help through additional types of products. So we began building those out ourselves. And we started with what we called the social vault. And this has evolved into what we now sell as our high ticket offer is our socially masters program. And this is like an all encompassing program that will take you from beginner to digital creator, learning how to build a brand online, how to build your brand voice, how to create your digital products, how to grow a following, how to foster community online. And we're really giving you the framework, the foundation and then all of the resources that you need to learn how to build an online business from scratch. And that's kind of our brand butter. And one of the biggest components of it and kind of what makes it different is our community. And this is not something that we ever expected really to come from this. It started in our Facebook group and it has moved over to the platform that we have now. But it's really just the people that have joined in our Facebook group and moved with us. But we have the most supportive community I have ever seen. You can go in socially and post people, just post their questions and beginners and intermediate and advanced alike. Everybody just kind of flocks in and just helps each other and answers each other's questions and lifts each other up. And that's huge because I feel like that's something that I really needed in the very beginning. I just needed support from other people when maybe not your family doesn't understand or your friends don't understand. And you're just kind of trying to figure this out on your own. Yeah, it is. What made you wanna go in that direction? I'm even just kind of, you know, building a community. Again, a lot of the stuff that, you know, Megan said you were learning starting out. It's like, you know, worst case scenario, I learned something, right? And I mean, it's kind of learning and creating is just the key to one procrastination, but two, just like general, I don't know, peace of mind and wellbeing. I've never met someone that's creating that's depressed. Like, that's not advice, but just based on my experience. But what made you, we know what made you start, but then what made you go in that direction and build a business you guys have now? I think so much of it started because, you know, as a creator, when we were first getting started, people were just messaging me constantly. They were DMing me and they were like, what are you doing? Like, how is this working? I'm struggling. Like, what, how are you growing so quickly? I started at the same time as you and I'm struggling. And it kind of got to the point, I was trying to help people through my DMs and it was just kind of got to a point where I was like, I can't just keep doing this in my DMs. Like, you know, I've got a kid at the time. I was still working a full-time job. And so we thought, let's get these people into a group. And it was a paid group because, you know, we also realized this is our time and this is a lot of- I'm curious, what do you charge for that? It's $60 a month. So smart though, because people who are paying are gonna be engaged, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's $60 a month and we are constantly providing new resources within that group. We host weekly live calls where we talk about a new topic or new content hacks or, you know, something about that to grow your business around your community. And our mentorship group itself is just jam packed with information. And so we figured, you know, for these people, if these many people are struggling, maybe we can provide a resource for them where we can kind of help them and guide them weekly. And it got really popular. And I feel like the reason that it grew beyond just the mentorship group for us, was because, you know, partially, we wanted to see what we were capable of, but two, like also, we also saw members' needs within the mentorship group. They were just telling us areas that they were struggling in. Like, could we help them with those specific struggles? And so Megan and I, just being the people that we are and kind of overachievers, were like, sure, we'll make a resource for that. And then that's just kind of how these new things started coming up. And that's kind of how the vault was born, because the vault houses, you know, all of our education and our courses. Because we're like, sure, we can make a course for that. We can make a course for that. And it just kind of grew organically and slowly, like Megan said, it didn't just kind of happen overnight. And it's taken time, but it's really cool, the way it worked out, because it's based around the needs of our audience. It's, there's also something that we kind of, it's like a hill that we're always gonna die on. It's kind of, I don't wanna say it's our motto, but it kind of has become that, because our members tell the same thing to their following. And we tell people all the time, if you think you're giving away too much value for free, give more, because it's all about building an online community is about establishing that trust. And it's about seeing your community for the real people that they are. And real people- And serving. And serving your audience. Yeah. And that's why I think, I think a lot of people will charge every resource they get. It's like, okay, let's charge for this. Let's charge for this. Let's charge for this. Even if it's five or $10, and people will spend it, but ultimately they get to a point where they're like, I can't keep spending this, but I kind of need the help. And so we've just kind of come to a place where it's how we want to run our business. It's how we want, it's how we sleep at night, and we feel really great doing our business. And it's like, we just, we're gonna give away as much as we possibly can for free to help people as much as we can. It's funny, Chris and I just had an interview, and one of his, I guess, main phrases is, people come for the content and stay for the community. And you both really embody that socially. That's a pat-flin thing, yeah. Yeah, with what you've built, I can tell that you're both extremely passionate about the community that you serve. It has to be two separate stories. That's the rule. What is something that comes to, a member that comes to mind of a success story that you could share with us? Yeah. I know who I'm thinking of, and it's probably the same as you, Megan. It's probably the same, but so within socially, we have some members who have been with us since the beginning, since back in June. And our one, like, and socially has really only been alive for like six months, socially. That's what's crazy, like from the beginning, like back in the day at June. I know. Last year. Yeah, last year, yeah. Yeah, so, yeah, that's so crazy. But we have one member. That's so cool too. Yeah, very. Her name is Liz. She initially started with, in the online space, making money online, the wealth niche, but she realized that she is really passionate about skincare. And within socially, what we teach you is not how to resell a course. We're not having you join socially, so you can turn around and teach other people how to make money online. We want you to join socially, discover what you're passionate about, and then we want to teach you how to monetize that through digital products, through services, but not just because there's so many people who join, who purchase a course, and they're like, well, now I only know how to teach people how to make money online. And that's not what we're here for. And so within socially, we were like, look, we want to help you build something that is yours, that is uniquely yours around what you love and what you're passionate about. And so Liz is really passionate about skincare, about natural skincare. She calls it face yoga, or that's what it's called. And so she has one account where she does talk about the wealth niche, but her biggest account is face yoga, where she gets online and she teaches people how to minimize wrinkles or 11 lines through just exercises with your face. She's creating digital products. She has a course for it. Her following is growing exponentially. She's got, I think, almost 60,000 followers or 50,000 followers now. It's over 60,000 now. That's right. Very cool. Yeah, and that's what we want for people within socially. We want them to figure out what they love and then earn money with it. Because when you do something you love, and I know it's cliche, like I get that, but when you are doing something you love and you're making money from it, it does not feel like work. It socially never feels like work to us ever, but it is. Never. Yeah, and so we also have, and we have other people who are growing within socially, like Erica, then you can talk about Erica too. Yeah, Erica, she's been with us from the beginning too, back when we were a Facebook group, and she's kind of grown with us. She was in the make money online niche for a long time. But she had been telling us for months now, she's like, I'm really passionate about the fitness niche. She's like, I've come a long way in my own health, I'm over 40. I never thought that I could be at this level of fitness at my age, and I really want to share that, but she was just kind of nervous about getting started, and we encouraged her, we're like, you should. You should do what you're passionate about, because that's what's gonna feel good. That's what you're going to be able to sustain. And we want you to feel good about what you're doing. And so she started, and she's already doing so well. And I feel like when you've been on one path for a while, and you've finally gotten comfortable with it, it's so hard or scary, I guess, to move over to something else, especially something that you're passionate about, because you could be worried that your passion will become a chore and things like that. But she is already killing it, and she's having more fun doing it. And that's the whole point. Like, Mani and I have so much fun with this, and I probably work more now somehow, but it never feels like we're, as we work doing all kinds of stuff. Like we work getting our coffee, getting our nails done, like getting our groceries, things like that. But yeah, we've had so many people that started off in the wealth niche, in socially, that have since moved on to what they're passionate about. We have people doing, I'll give a member doing gluten-free lifestyle. We have someone, we have a member who's teaching people how to find joy after the grief of losing a loved one. Life coaching, wedding planning, like, you name it. There's so many. Like, we could go on all day about that. Pet training, yeah. Wow. Like how to live through, you know, manage diabetes and then lose weight through all of that. So yeah, lots of different niches. But we found the reason we really kind of started socially was we found that people were investing in all of these different courses because they were desperate to make money online, because like us, they were miserable. But after taking some of these courses, they realized the only thing they learned how to do after this education is teach other people how to make money online. Yeah, you find that a lot within this industry, right? Right, and that's not the goal. That's not the goal of any of these courses, I don't think. But somehow we leave knowing, and maybe because that was the prime example we learned from, we somehow leave thinking that's all we can do. And so we were here, we started socially to kind of correct that. And it's working and it's great because there's so much space. And that's part of that abundance mindset. There's so much room for everybody to be successful online, but you do have to find your little pocket. You have to find your niche, what you love to do, and that community of people who are looking for the same solutions that you're providing. And there's two results, I think, that often come from, I guess, teaching people online or doing this. I always look at it this way. There's income that can happen, right? But then there's also this impact. And I think when you do the first, right, and it's like, well, hey, I'm gonna make money, but the way I'm gonna make money is teaching people online how to make money. And then you can teach them how to make people online money, right? But you, I can tell from the stories that you're telling, look at the impact that you're making. You're helping people lean into their passion, not just how to sell other people's stuff. And there's nothing wrong with that. I don't wanna clown on that at all because it is awesome. And we, gosh, I mean, Ben runs this at ClickFunnels. We have so many affiliates that make so much passive income, but they have to understand too, they're sharing the dream. If you get ClickFunnels, you know, if you get socially like, there's so many things that you can do that is your vision and make this impact. Is that something that you guys have found is that's worth more than like the income, especially when it's happened so quickly? Oh, and like, and yeah, like you're talking, you have affiliates for ClickFunnels. Absolutely, part of what we teach is if you're doing affiliate market or digital marketing, if you're selling your own products, you should 1,000% be doing affiliate marketing. Incorporate those products that you use daily, sign up for their affiliate programs. Like we are all about capturing every bit of passive income as possible. I've been an affiliate for ClickFunnels for a long time, he has to. And so it just, it doesn't make sense to miss out on that opportunity. But yeah, like with the impact, I mean, it's more than the community that we're impacting and not more because I'm not saying that's not important, but I've noticed the change in me personally. I have grown more in the past year than I ever thought, ever thought that I would as a person, parent, as a spouse. I never saw this coming. The personal growth, I never expected it. It is a happy little side effect of starting your own online business. And I feel like I never, I never would have believed anybody if they told me that this is how I would feel now versus back then. And I feel like it's something a lot of people deal with, but it's like imposter syndrome. They're like, well, I don't know what I'm doing. Like that's how I felt. I was like, who am I like to get online and start telling people stuff? Like who's gonna listen to me? Like I'm just a hot mess mom, like with three feral little children, like barely holding it together. Like who wants to listen to me? And like that was- All the other moms in the same situation that know you, that relate to you, resonate. Exactly, but I did not think of that at all when I was first getting started. That's part of what held me back for so long when I was watching Megan be successful was just myself doubt, like not believing that I, with being, I have an RN background. I thought that I did not have what it took to do something like this. I was never on social media and that's what holds a lot of people back. But like just from that inception, like just starting and just having the guts to just post that first reel to now, it's crazy like the amount of confidence that I've gained. I have more patience. I feel like I've even somehow as an RN, like even gained more empathy because we're in this community that has come about in socially. It is crazy. I'm just, I'm so grateful for all of the people in it because of everything that it's given us and what we've been able to give other people. Yeah, definitely. The personal growth has been absolutely insane. And this is probably, you know, like over sharing. But before I started, I wouldn't let family take pictures of me. I wouldn't post on Instagram unless it was very curated. I didn't take pictures with my kid because I didn't like to see myself in them. Lots of things and that's probably deep rooted from other things who knows. But I was desperate enough to get out of the situation that we were living in that I was like, if posting online is going to help us get there, I'll freaking get over it and I'll just do it. So making that first reel, making that first post was horrifying and it was kind of like, just click and do it. But in people ask, like, how do you post online? Like, I can't do that. Believe me, if you're not gonna believe anybody else, it gets easier and it kind of gets to the point where you're just like, you don't care. And that's coming from somebody who would literally never let a camera within five feet of me. So it does get easier. People are generally pretty nice on social media. And it's kind of like, you kind of just expect that people are just gonna immediately point out all of your insecurities and they don't. You just, you bank that first post and people are just like, yeah, I go you. Like, you're just another person. Like, we don't see all the things that you're worried about because only you see those things. But I think you're leaning into that too. I think some people, when they try to look like they have all their stuff together and like, ready to go and the kids are perfect and we're going to this ballet recital, we're doing all this other stuff and we're perfect husbands doing this. People don't relate to that. But if you lean into, hey, I'm coming live from my bed or my couch right now, it's pretty hard for people to be mean about that. Like, oh, look at this person there. Here's not that. Look at their couch. The mess becomes the message. That's what so many entrepreneurs need to realize is like, you become this hero because you're just like them. When you try to do this pedestal stuff, it doesn't work. So it's probably, people are nice because you're leaning into it. When you do the pedestal stuff, people can be totally mean. Like there's a couple of influencers like, seriously, then I'll send to my buddies and I'll be like, check this one out. Like, because we know they're trying to do this posturing. I actually don't have any problem clowning on them because they're being clowns, right? Yeah, you can see it. We've definitely, I personally had people come after me because we live in this really old farmhouse that we've been renovating ourselves for three years. And people are like, oh, really, you make that much money but you have curtains like that. These guys. Exactly, yes. And I don't get those often, but they're hilarious. Like I really love them when I do because you're right. Like when we moved into this house, I couldn't afford curtains. These are $10 drop clouds from Harbor Freight that I turned into some curtains. And now they look good. They look, they're chic. That's awesome. But you know what? Yeah, I make six figures a month, but no, I'm not gonna upgrade my curtains because I like what they are. But also represents something. My gosh, the journey, Megan, right? Yeah, I mean, and that's what's really important to us. And it's the personal journey. It's the personal growth that's so important. And we tell people all the time, especially when they come after us with stuff like that, or really you drive a minivan and how much money are you making? It's not about what the money buys us. It's about what the money has allowed us to do. It's about what this opportunity has allowed us to do. The freedom to stay home with our kids. If I got nothing but the freedom, if I was only making enough to pay my bills, but I had the freedom, it would still be worth it. 100%. The money thing is always funny because I think whenever you do come on and you're like, I've been able to make enough money to be free, to quit my nine to five, to be home with my family, blah, blah, blah, and they're like, oh, well, why don't you live in a mansion? And it's just funny because even though we probably could go out and build new houses and whatever, we're not going to because... Yeah, we want the she shed. We want the she shed. We have... The life that we have right now is just to not sound really cheesy, but it's beautiful. I could never have imagined it. We live out on, like Megan said, seven acres of land, six or seven acres. I have three, my brother has three kids, Megan has one, and all seven of our kids play together every single day. And we get to see each other and have a close knit family, and we have privacy because we're out in the middle of a corn field, and our kids can be as loud and feral as they want to be. It's just amazing, and I would never give that up, period. I don't care if I had billions of dollars, I will take this and I will always take this. And I think that we like to share that a lot too because I think there's a lot of other moms in this space who are like, our goal isn't to be bougie, our goal is just to be free and enjoy our life the way that we want to enjoy it. It doesn't matter if it's a fancy house or not, that doesn't make your life happier. Yeah, and we sit in the backyard, and it's a little bit gross today, but usually we're just sitting in the backyard, we have a laptop on our laps, and we're just yelling at the kid, like, quick touch in the bubble machine. And they're like, we're like. Hashtag feral kids. Feral, like, and it's mostly mine, mine are the most feral. I will take like, your cousin with sticks, and we're just like, hey, did you respond to that person in socially? Most kids don't live that way. I just think this is pure, I just think this is Americana. I think this is the American dream. And we haven't talked too much tactically, and I know Ben loves to dive into that. Ben, you got any more questions, like, about the business specifically before we wrap? Yeah, so this one, you know, we've touched on so much right now. Shout out to, like, one shout to socially, and Harbor Freight, Subway, Cocoa Mellon, maybe one I'm forgetting, but on a business aspect, right? Because I'm sure there have been obviously, you know, mistakes, things like, oh my gosh, what's happening right now? How are we gonna get past this, and then boom, it's done. Then you're like, all right, what else can we take on? What else can we accomplish? And you may have hit on it, but I think this question is worth asking just in case not for our audience. What's the biggest lesson you've learned throughout this process? Ooh, for me, personally, it's okay to make mistakes and that we're gonna figure it out. As, you know, two regular moms who don't have experience in, who didn't have prior experience in this, and begging to be a project manager, me being an RN, we were, once the one thing that we say all the time is we're building the ship as we fly, or we're building the plane as we fly. And that's pretty much it. We work on something, we come across a mistake, or we hit a road bump and we fix it, and we know better, do better, and move on. And that's just kind of how we've done this entire thing and to not freak out over the mistakes, because we're perfectionists and we hate disappointing people. But I think now we've both kind of been like, you know what? Like this is just part of the process. Part of success is making mistakes and just learning from it and getting better from it. And that's been huge, I think, for both of us. What mistake specifically, or I mean, it doesn't have to be one, but anything that comes to mind, like what made you realize that? What mistake of like, you know, we got past it, and guess what? It's okay, right? Like we're not bleeding, right? It's, you know, we're not dying. What sticks out to you? One of the big ones is choosing the right platforms that are best for your business. So getting started, we were kind of, we didn't have experience. We were just doing our research, trying to figure out how we can kind of piece together our products to make it as cohesive as possible. And we have hit friction points. We're still at this point, which is why we're building, we're having a custom platform built currently, which is gonna launch in a couple of weeks. So we're calling it socially plus. Very cool. It's gonna be fantastic. We're having brand new funnels built out and everything. But one of the biggest things is really trying to figure out what platforms and what tools to use for your business when you're starting. And that's part of it. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to realize these programs maybe aren't exactly cut out for us, because it affects your customer experience, the customer journey. And that's kind of something that we've had to deal with often, and it's not something that we can go back and fix now. It's only something that we can adjust in the future. And so that's why we're having, we're building out this new platform because we're going to minimize those friction points, get rid of them all together, and make this customer experience better. But that's not something we knew about when we were first getting started. We thought, we've kind of called our platform, for lack of a better word, it's kind of Frankenstein because it has grown. Oh, Star, yeah. Yeah. And so we have different programs that we have pieced together and tried to integrate as best as possible to serve our audience's needs. But we realized that this is just long term not going to work, which is when you reinvest back into the business. But that has been a big learning curve for us as well. And that's probably where we've made most of our mistakes, is not maybe doing enough to do this. A lot of the tech stuff and roadblocks with making sure our members user experience is optimal. But we've learned from it. And now we're building, like Megan said, a custom platform called Socially Plus, where we have literally, we listed out all of our friction points, all of the recommendations from our members, something things that they would like to see or et cetera. And we're building that all into a platform. So it's built for our members and for user base and what they need, not necessarily just what we want. But we're really excited for that. That's the highlight right now. I cannot wait for everybody to see Socially Plus come out. I'm just trying to sit on my hands because I'm so excited. Yeah, that's awesome. I love it. So Socially Plus is coming out. That's what you're excited about now. But if people want to know more about you and even get involved, where's the best place? You guys can drop Instagram handles, like links. Where's the best place for them to find you? Yeah, the best place is probably our Instagram page. You can find me at couchofficemom. And I'm at socially.page. That's me. And you're going to see all about Socially. You can DM us. We're still responding to DMs. And all our content talks about Socially. It talks about growing in the online space. And that's where you're going to learn the most about us, about how we live most of the time. No, not most of the time. Every bit of time. I don't look like this. I don't look like this. I put on makeup for you guys. I did. I put makeup on today. Just for this. So it's going to be a little bit of a shock when you go and find me on Instagram. Oh, I love it. That's what you two are so authentic, so awesome. And I cannot wait to see where this goes. Major kudos and congratulations on everything you're doing. And the sky is the limit. Anything else, Ben, before we wrap? No, I'm lost. That was amazing. I really appreciate the time of you both. It was a pleasure. Absolutely. Thanks so much. Yeah, thank you all. This is great. Have a good one. Bye.
