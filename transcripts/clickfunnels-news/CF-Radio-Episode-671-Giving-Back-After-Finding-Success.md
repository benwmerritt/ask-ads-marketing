Here are your hosts Laura Demetrius and Chris Cameron. Welcome back out to click funnels radio. My name is Chris Cameron and here as always with Laura Demetrius and today by the way how are you Laura? I'm doing great. I'm here in Canton. It's it's fun. There's a lot of activity behind me if you're watching this on camera. So I apologize if you hear noise but it is kind of exciting in the background. You're where the sausage is made like where everything is going into 2.0 to improve and just make this the best funnel builder on the planet and just keep it keep it going. But hey, we are joined today by a good friend of mine Doug Bouton. Doug, what is up man coming to us live from San Diego. What's going on everybody? Thanks for having me today. I'm excited to talk to you guys. I have to notice too when you just raised your hand there. You kind of talk with your hands a little bit but I notice you got a cast. You got to tell us what happened there. Yeah, I got a little injury about two weeks ago trying to get excited about something I'm doing with house builds knocked over a vase tried to grab it and it broke and it sliced my finger went to Mexico regardless of what my doctor said to build some homes for families in need and it got infected. So I have a few weeks of a healing journey had but it's feeling a lot better. It's going to be gone. Hey, a lot of you may know Doug. Well, hey, I hope that heals really quick for you. But a lot of you know Doug and if you're watching on video too like over his left shoulder, we've got the dream car award and then we also have over his right shoulder. We've got the two comic club award. Now I want to ask you this which was more difficult to actually obtain. Oh man. I'm going to say dream car award because and not in a difficult way as far as like effort. It happened a lot faster believe it or not. It was like 66 days. I'll never forget when I started my Facebook community. But it was hard. I say it's more hard because it was my first journey to doing anything that I set a goal towards and going to achieve that. And there's a lot of things we tell ourselves. There's a lot of mindset blocks I had to work through to show up every day to go for it. So I think that's why and I think that was a really great milestone to say I could do this. I could go for that next thing I want to achieve. So I want to dive into a story here in a second. But one of the cool things if you don't know what the dream car award is click funnels affiliate program and click funnels has grown massively by using this affiliate program best affiliate program in the business by far. And we will literally pay for your dream car. It doesn't matter what dream car you want if you'll get 100 active users under you. And then if you get 200 active users we double that price that we pay towards your car. So I would agree with you Doug. I think that's probably more exclusive like every year sometimes we're giving out three 400 to comic club awards and sometimes maybe like a dozen dream car award winners. And that's where Doug and I met is because you know Doug's been a powerhouse affiliate in our community for a long time. And it's cool because your story doesn't necessarily start that way. It's it's not even that long ago. You know you've been scrappy right and become a household name even to where like what was it a few months ago you and I ran into each other in Miami because Grant Cardone just invited a few affiliates to come down that he thought he would be the most effective in promoting. And of course you know Russell was one of them I went down to represent click funnels but you know ran into you and and and Kelsey and it was just really really cool. So talk to us though like how did you go from you know being really scrappy 2018 2019 not quite knowing what you're going to do to having people like Grant Cardone invite you you know to their office and then even finishing top five in Click Funnels 2.0 affiliate launch. Yeah it was amazing. Matt Grant Cardone through Click Funnels launched the 2.0 launch when he came to speak and just wanted to stay on the radar get in front of him. He always says who do I need to get in front of who how do I get their attention. And that was just a great opportunity for me. Finish number eight on that leaderboard for awesome his launch and got to go to his house in Miami. We spent a weekend there really amazing. But I think for me it was like what do we need to do. A lot of people that were top 10 on that promotion even with the Click Funnels 2.0 launch a lot of people in the top 10 were big email lists big audiences and you know my email list isn't crazy. It's like 5,000 people. So I knew I had to do something a little bit different and anytime I'm approaching. Can we stop for one second. You tell me currently I didn't know this you currently your email list is only 5,000 people that I actively email. I have like 18 thousand but a lot of them are I clean it very tightly if they haven't opened email in 60 days. Doug I have so many questions. You are you are legit man for having 5,000 active like and I just got to give you kudos to the reason that you were in that room when Grant came up is because we knew you had like the fuel and the power to to do very very well in the Click Funnels 2.0 launch which you did too. So kudos to you there too. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. I think for me. I came from really just out of college. I dropped out of college my senior year. I couldn't get a student loan for my senior year. I needed a new co-signers and all I had is my mother, my grandmother and they couldn't co-sign again. So I dropped out. I was doing sales door to door sales and restaurant work in the evenings and I just wanted to find a way to pay off that student loan debt. So I was kind of chasing like let me get out of this pain of this debt. How do I eliminate it. So I got really curious about making money online. Like most people people think I just came overnight in 2019 and just got the dream car word but it really was like eight years. I've counted over 30 different opportunities I was trying to promote the eight year overnight success story. Yeah. I mean I tell you I was selling started with ACN network marketing company. A day later I was promoting something new. It was really shiny object was serious but I sold everything from brain enhancement pills to like oxygen and can called action for energy. You name it but it wasn't like until I found click funnels around 2018 that I call it real. I found a real product and that's something relatable to my journey something I could earn with very like you said the best affiliate program in the world alignment. I mean I couldn't find a better company better team and Russell to align to their mission and then long Jeff. I knew you guys me around long term were a lot of these things in the past. I just were you know one week one month here and then gone and I went all in and just really became fascinated with the tool that was for me easy to use and trying to figure out WordPress and all those things. I'm not the techiest person. So that was like my introduction to click funnels. So how did you go from you know shiny object syndrome and you know obviously a lot of people who know that they want to be entrepreneurs they just they get so excited about the next thing. What what do you think gave you that like laser focus like was it actually the software itself like you knew that that was sustainable for you. What was it. The focus for me because I was still believe or not when I was using click funnels still all over the place for another two years or at least a year and fall of 2018 I finally said I'm going to quit my restaurant job. This is the time I usually would say six more months six more months I finally just did it cold and the reason I was able to is because of one fall away challenge. I saw this book 30 days book and I'm like this is awesome and then I didn't know about the challenge until after I got the book came with the one fall away challenge. I think now it was like by the one fall away challenge get the book as a bonus. So it was repositioned but I don't know the 30 days book Russell co-authored with 30 of these two comic club award winners. These people who had made over a million dollars. So yeah Doug's got it right here is they all put in a chapter like hey if you lost everything had a starter from scratch how would you get from zero to a million bucks and they outline this is a ton of different industries. And so that's the book that Doug's referring to within this one funnel a challenge and that was a huge friend and offer for us. And it was amazing for the affiliates. I mean I read that book. Really I have a product or an offer so I went and read a few chapters one was my Spencer Mecham and really just dove into the affiliate side went through the challenge this time. And kind of just paid attention. I didn't really implement just took notes and just learned went through the second time and built out an offer and then the third time I started promoting it and that's where I made my first 22 sales at the time is a hundred dollar commission so I made twenty hundred bucks. I'm like OK I'm ready to put my notice and take this thing full time. I know I could do this but I could do that in two weeks and earn what I did in two weeks and a month of serving tables and this is going to be it. But to answer the question it wasn't until the OFA challenge I luckily got a spot on day 30 live with Steven Larson who is hosting it back then and asked the audience like if you have multiple things and it was like what could you talk about every single day. What do you really want to do. And at the time I was doing restaurant marketing for the restaurant I was working in plus a few others. I had a credit repair thing I was trying to get off the ground and then click balls affiliate and I was like of all these things it's absolutely marketing and click funnels. I'm going to go all in on this and just let that ride. And it was that question that Steven asked me that said you know I got a you know if you're heard of some cost fallacy sometimes hard to let things go. I mean I had a course about the launch books offer the credit repair stuff at the clients for the restaurant. I let everything go. We're all in on the click funnels affiliate for one fun away challenge thanks to your contest which was such a cool leaderboard to be on because it was a six month competition. I knew if I had six months I could compete with the bigger names with bigger audiences and ended up number two on that board and really got to meet Russell for the first time at headquarters and we went to Lake McCall with Dave and Miles and the top 10 affiliates. That was really special. That's that's awesome and this seems to be a pattern for you these leaderboards because you know as we jump into 2.0 you know we knew that you were going to have some firepower as well brought you up to Boise you know we hung out. But then man you just crushed and I think you finished what third in that contest. Third. Yeah. I was number two for up till midnight mean goose done we're going back and I remember that I was like one. Well we were like we were we're on Facebook Messenger like midnight or something and I didn't want to tell you exactly where you were but I knew we were close that was that was fun times. Yeah. What we did what was really really cool and Turner kind of had this idea. Turner Leslie if you guys don't know he's our relationship manager and he was he was really instrumental in this launch and we thought OK what would be really cool something huge that like these affiliates could ignore but they could use in different ways. And so we came up with this idea to get these huge like prices right publisher clearinghouse type checks. And we didn't realize how expensive these would be to send like we had a source and weird they had to make special boxes. And so we sent as I think it was what $25,000 we sent. Third place and we sent it over and we're like well let's see what these affiliates do. And then what was it two weeks ago Doug I saw one of the coolest like tear jerking kind of posts on Facebook you tagged me and I was I was humbled it was really cool to see what you did with that earnings because I think you've reached this level of you've had some earnings now you've had some income and you're just telling Laura and I before we hit record that it's not about that as much anymore it's a little bit more about impact so tell us kind of what what happened after that contest. Yeah. For me it's like I always talk about new aims one of my coaches once said you know you paid off your student loan you got the two comic club award and I just kind of got stuck at a point and you know as entrepreneurs like we just want to keep growing and he said you need a new aim and he's like what's the new aim. So the 10x award he goes no it's not it's like you already did these words and you're saying like the fulfillment wasn't there and you need a better aim so honestly I look at click funnels and some of the leaders in the industry like Russell and Tony Robbins and what they're doing is giving back and a lot of people say you know they give back they'd write the checks but like when I see Russell going to Africa to build schools and he's doing it. I just stumbled across a cause by accident down in Mexico called Baja Bound and they build family homes for families in need down there and their quote is like get kids off the dirt ground because these kids are living in 5x5 huts with families and siblings and it just really moved me so I have gone on 3 of these and I said I want to sponsor one about a year ago and this was a perfect opportunity that check was able to build 2 homes for families in need 2 weeks ago so it took us while to get everything together. And logistics of getting that check down you physically took the check to Mexico. You guys this check is so massive I did a live in my office here I couldn't even get in the frame I was just like if you watch my Facebook recently was like you couldn't even get it in the office but it was so cool to be able to give that and part of what I announced back when this was going on because I didn't actually expect to be top 5 I knew when I showed up to click funnels during that live launch I wasn't even really doing anything with the launch and I got motivated there to do something by Friday you guys said I was top 10 I'm like let's go. So if we finish top 5 whatever the check is we get is going to go to this cause and we brought 36 people down 2 weeks ago. I mean it was so moving for people to see now we've got other people doing builds and sponsoring kids to go to school and we're going to keep repeating this and in fact is so impactful one of our clients got a tattoo on his elbow of the bottom in my logo. From it. I was pretty awesome. That's when you know you've made it right is like Harley Davidson. I don't know if you guys know Jeff Bannock like I ran across him in Vegas one time like literally just happens to be a big fan of the he's got a big old click funnels you know tattoo so when somebody's tattooed your stuff here your vision on them Doug you're doing something right man and that's the hat you're wearing to is the Baja bound Baja bound. Yeah, you see right there got a new fresh one smile last one got a little painted on at the last build but that's all story but like you know you've made it when you've you've gotten the awards you've you've paid your student loans have the things that you want financially and now you are creating impact by giving back like what like what now. Yeah, it's it's it's where I'm at honestly. 4 years ago I set 5 goals for myself and we're coming up on completing the 5th one right now to talk about here for this we published after the announcement. Get at this part out if it's if I'm not allowed to say it but my goals were to pay off my student loan earn the dream car award to come a club award to a Russell's inner circle and speak on stage at following live. And I haven't really thought beyond what's next until recently and on that first mastermind when we will if a competition we got top 10 and that leader board we went to McCall and as you guys know Dave was there running that and I remember having a conversation late night and we were there and we had a conversation about type and giving 10% and like how Russell doesn't he does it and never really thought about that conversation much until recently and just I see the faith based entrepreneurs and what they give back and how much more they're able to do with the things are doing so that was really moving for me and I Dave as you guys know is like one of the best man I've ever met my life and I'm like what's more than just the 10x award and to me is that they would word award to honor his name some excited to really go for that next big goal. They're going to be in dollars you know you have to do something to bring it in so well. For those of you don't know the Dave Woodward to heart award is for entrepreneurs to give back a million dollars to charity dog. I love that you brought up Dave to I can't tell you how many times and this is homage to him to this whole click funnels radio relaunch that we're doing Laura and I is really to pay homage to him and you know I worked under him for 3 and a half years and what a special individual but here's what I love that you just mentioned that Russell doesn't shy away from is this faith that also is behind click funnels in the community here to and giving back is a core part of that and what is always fascinating is in interesting is those who are willing to be fluid with their money. It usually is you know when they give back they're getting that much I'm sorry when they give back to others they're getting so much more return whether it's financial or whether it's emotional or spiritual or anything else. I think it's Myron Goldens said you know your fist is so tight you know you're holding on to your money so tight that you can't even grab any right but if you open that up and then give that's when you start to receive as well so and of course Dave you know such a good example you found those moments. So just have that one-on-one conversation like with Doug or with me and you had these little teaching moments. So cool. Yeah, what is the example of what it is to give back and to be so happy and honored to be able to do that especially for somebody who saw so much success in business and like it's really not that long your timeline from you know when you got started and the success that you saw in the financial gain and to already be at this point where you want to and you're able to give so much back is so powerful that you know people watching this or listening this in a couple of years could be doing the exact same thing. Absolutely and I think it's like my I used to tell myself I don't have enough to give but I mean anything even a little amount of you feel like it's not enough might be embarrassing to give what you can like like Chris said it comes back to you not just in money like every time I've done a build there's been some kind of breakthrough right around the corner and health and wellness relationships and business as well. So I think that it's just something special I never experienced before and I'm excited to go for this goal. It's not me alone. It's my community that people were reaching so it's just really awesome. I appreciate you guys being a big part of that. This reward too that you get out of this like I said financial everything else does not come without sacrifice. So a couple questions here is one what was the hardest thing that you had to go through in this journey and then maybe in relationship to that what would you tell 4 year old in I'm sorry 4 years ago not for you tell 4 year old Doug something but like 2018 2019 Doug that could barely afford to go to the conference. What would you tell him hardest thing for me was making a pretty tough decision for me. I know when I was making the decision about 4 years ago look at my current environment and the people I love my friends and family back East is hard to leave Connecticut I was born and raised there the only time I was away was for college and I went on a retreat out to San Diego from there I joined a mastermind just to get in the right room with the right people. I'm like these people out there you know younger than me building 7 figure companies I got to be around it and they're talking about these house bills and the things are doing and I had 4 more trips to San Diego back then every time I was delaying my flight or stay an extra week and I send it in a program to their year-long mastermind which had 8 retreats a year 8 meetups a year in San Diego so make you know what it's going to be better if I just live there so I did pack up everything. Donated what I could fill my car where I can fit my car state and ship my car out to San Diego and I've been here over 3 years now so that was a tough decision and I'm not saying like move across the country but like look at your environment and who's in it and go find the people get in the right rooms and I think that's really I believe why I am where I am today. I love it maybe Laura we get tactical here for a second like I want to revisit this 5000 list because you're doing like I've been wanting to bring this up again so yeah, you've got about 5. Yeah, 5000 people. Yeah, what are you doing that's working unbelievable so what are you like if you are not just utilizing your list and mailing those you know active 5000 people on your list like what's your secret. Yeah, it's I think the answer is not. Anything everyone's going to be surprised by but I think it's doing what people are willing to do like I think about leader boards. I'm not a full-time affiliate love those things much when I find things I could really get behind there's only a few things I've really went all out on most of its click funnel stuff. In addition to Grant was one of the new things we did will be doing something Dean and Tony in the fall but it takes a lot to stop me to go and put all my energy into that but that's what we do we will put all our energy into that and just focus on fulfillment for our clients and really halt sales and marketing and go position which I think a lot of people aren't willing to do that for their companies and I see the value especially when you guys have a top 10 leader board I get really competitive and I mean spending was it a day with Dan and Russell like that's priceless to me so I'm like I'm going to be in that top 10 to be a part of that. But also I know I'm certain and the confidence behind the products and I'm such a fan of of click funnels. So I really gave people an incentive to opt into the challenge funnel to point out challenge funnel I gave them incentive to upgrade a VIP I gave them incentive to buy the offer which was 8 weeks of coaching with me beyond the launch itself. So I think it was just really being intentional talking to every single person like when I think about those 5000 people I know most of them I have conversations and messenger with them I've met some of them in person most of them are customers which is really cool. So I think it's you know 5000 person email list and some people might be like that's actually quite a lot and I think so too but when you're going against people at 1.2 million on their email list you know some people is like that's I was so proud of my team and and just what we were able to accomplish with that but I think it's just putting that intention in and saying what do they really need. Beyond just this challenge and what can we bonus package up and help them beyond it so I think that's what really allowed us to do that. I love Doug that as somebody who shared so much about giving your promotional method is giving. You know it's what worked from day one how I hit the dream car was I started a free community. I built a course I knew I could sell and I just focus on giving away to a thousand people and that's like 2 months in we had our footlings in that course and got to the dream car so it's funny what worked 4 years ago and what worked most recently for this launch and grants launches is really the same principles so I think a lot people just want to go and get the cash right but I think it's like what can I give and just I think that's that is the advice I'd give to myself 4 years ago is don't focus on the offer and the launch just keep focusing on showing up for community and it'll come at value. Yeah, that's great. I do have a question because you mentioned that you had 5 goals and you went over what those were and I'm just really curious. It's really out of my own curiosity like do you do any like what do you practice to try to realize those goals or make them happen is is there any to help manifest those things so I don't have it and I do have it in here dream car word is still the same I always have some representation of it dream car word same thing I had it on my wall. This was something I drew up a few years ago and home. This is this is just listening on audio. This is this is a chalkboard drawing that's framed that he hung on his wall here for the 2 comic club award. Yeah, look at my background. This has been going on since 2019. It's me at Photoshop on a phone like live stage. Oh my goodness. Yeah, I do a lot of you know it's cool look at my board to have my garage when I work out and a lot of it's just coming to fruition and it's like it's just people got out of the past became more present and just like focused on what's to come and then gratitude spend huge for me. I see those are things that really helped all these 5 to come to fruition and be patient because it's been so glad I asked it's a beautiful thing like you you have the literal visuals. Yeah, what you want to manifest and you're making those things happen like I think that that's it's incredible. I think it's feeling it to us like we could look at a visual but feeling as if and you know over the years has been sometimes I'm impatient. I get frustrated but then it's like I've realized more gratitude I have and there's a Bible verse I always it's been showing up yesterday show up 5 times on different calls it was so fascinating but it's a Luke 1610 and it's talking about pretty much like if you could manage what you have and show that your good stew or you're going to get more and I thought I just keeps coming up for me and I'm like Parable the talents man. Yeah, it's just man speaks to me and yeah, they came up 5 times me my one of my staff were talking about it. We got a call the next call that person brought it up the second call the owner about how about brought it up and then my third call with one of my coaches brought it up and I was just like there is something here. Wow that's so cool. So I like everything that you shared with me today like I wish I could physically show you how many times I've gotten goosebumps with you sharing your entire journey and how it's it's been all about giving back and how that has led to so much success in your business and how giving receiving it just means more giving more giving more giving and it's just helping you grow immensely and I think that that's such a it's a huge story for all of our listeners and anyone who is maybe even just like thinking about starting their own business and they feel like they have a calling in that all of these things are so possible because you are visualizing your feeling you know what you want out of this and you're not willing to give up and you are overcoming all of these different challenges and obstacles and you came from a place where like you weren't sure if you could afford a ticket to funnel hacking live and that put you on the trajectory to where you are now and I think that just speaks in volumes for what one decision can do for you. Yeah now I'll just go in there a little bit because it's so I think it's important people here when I was at phone hacking live 2019 I literally had someone buy my ticket and my flight my hotel. I was just getting underway with the ClickFunnels affiliate program back then so I knew I had it was so fresh that I still was in the 30 day wait period for that you know for the distributions. So I knew I could pay that person back but I was in that room with like checking my bank balance to make sure I had enough for lunch and stuff and at that event I went home that's when I really started you know getting fired up is February hit dream car in March. So I think there's no coincidence there but it wasn't just being in the room. I remember you'll still catch me to this day my phone hacking live you want to find out where I am during the award ceremony I'm front row after I get my stuff I'm in front row taking photos and videos for everybody up there and I'll watch it every time because I remember the first time being there watching like the belief came and watching all these people cross the stage. I just talked to that person and this person I meet them afterwards and then Shane Larson coming up to me like you're going to be up on that stage like really think so in the belief in the confidence in him to say that to me. I'll never forget that moment. So I think you'll meet people that will inspire you that will believe in you and even if you don't know what kind of business you want to do like I didn't know back then you just stay on the path and the next thing's going to show up for you so. Thank you so much for sharing that with us I'm certainly inspired by it and I know everyone else listening will be and it's it's such a beautiful heartwarming story about giving back and I'm just really really really impressed with what you've done in the years and starting and it's really powerful so thank you for that. And if you listen for those people are listening watching if you have not been to funnel hacking live there Doug's not like an exception here like a lot of times you know we got to put fine print or something like results not typical well maybe that's true but I can tell you out of the 2000 plus people that have won two comic club awards it's uncanny how many stories are like that like boy you talk about you know Stephen Larson right how he could you know he's trading funnels for hotel rooms you know back in 2017 and San Diego to have funnel hacking live I mean this this is a reoccurring theme over and over so as a plug to if you haven't been go to funnel hacking live dot com get your tickets and come join us we're back in Orlando but as we kind of closed down here I want to know Doug like what is working best in your business and like what are you most excited about like what's the one tactical tip or something that people can really gravitate to and grab on to from this podcast. Yeah, it's something that's really working for me I never felt too confident and you know cold messaging and booking calls and closing on the phone and just really looked at what Russell was doing just providing immense value and you know when you do see an offer from Russell it's one to many and I thought that was so fascinating so 3 and a half years ago when I put up my first program. I did an event a virtual that and just made the offer one to many until this day we still do that we have programs ranging between you know 1000 all the way up to $30,000 and I don't do sales calls my team does do sales calls and just feel so liberating and it's because of what Russell has done with 5-day challenges so our model right now is weekly trainings that we create content from and then one live challenge every single month we run that same event and make our offer to the right people in the right room and it's been working really really well for us. It's for growing our coaching program. Do you ever green this challenge or is this something you do in live every month talking about that it is live every month recently I've been looking into a couple tools to do a hybrid of like replay for the general sessions. I'll still do VIP live and I see what you guys are doing with the year first funnel challenge I'm so inspired like running it every week as it's live but it's not that live community aspect to it sure so we're absolutely looking at that. But also like the MFG like putting into same thing I did 4 years ago didn't realize it was a MFG book giving out something free of value that has in it a step to the next thing which is our back so having a free course on challenges leading to our 5 day challenge and then an offer there so it's kind of like in a sense the linchpin which is Russell's main thing that I'm excited to learn about at phone Huckin live and dive in deeper to I see a lot of people following that model. Yeah, he's he's doing incredible things with that and for those of you don't know what MFG is to this is something that comes from Dan Kennedy right it's he deems it the most incredible free gift ever and it doesn't have to be free but it's something that people want you know Russell always say hey it's the sports illustrated swimsuit edition or the football phone right it's that's got some of the examples that they used and you can use that in any business Russell right now Laura is running how many 12 companies I think something like that and he's literally close to that it's a lot. Yeah, and he's using this linchpin model with the MFG. How many of those. Well he's working on creating the linchpin model for all of them and if he doesn't have them in place the plan right now is what what is the continuity program we want to get the MFG people into and from there planning out the dramatic demonstration for each of these businesses like this linchpin model in place and then we all know it works. Yeah, you'll be hearing more and more about that to Doug's implementing it so many other people are implementing it but before we wrap up Doug where is the number one place where people can find you if they want to follow you if they want to opt into your stuff what's the best place or for them to go find you. Yeah, I'm proud to say this but we've been four years without a website and now I could officially say you can go to DougButton.com to get more information on that so appreciate you asking that and it just shows you don't need a website or a logo to go and build the business of your dreams. You know just start with a funnel and I'm excited now to go and put everything somewhere where people could get more information no matter where they're at in the journey. Love it. Didn't happen to a nicer guy too like this is what I love about this community. You know it is real genuine hardworking people that have a vision and a dream and are driven and Doug you represent that so well so you are a great representation of our community so we just appreciate you. Thank you so much Doug. I appreciate you guys having me. Thank you so much. Thank you. Talk to you later. Bye everybody.
