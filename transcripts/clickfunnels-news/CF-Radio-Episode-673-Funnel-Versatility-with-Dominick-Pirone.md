Laura, what is up? How are you today? I'm doing great. How are you guys doing? Doing awesome. Hey, I'm very, very excited about our guest today. Our guest just we released just yesterday when this is going to air. I don't know. But yesterday in real time, we just released that this man is going to be speaking at Funnel Hacking Live in September in Orlando. So welcome out. I just asked him to it's Dominic Perone. And I said, Hey, is it Perone or is it Peroni? And what and how did you reply? It's a both depends on where you're where you're from. It's a lot of Peroni. Yeah, exactly. United States, Perone. Or if you're drinking beer, right? That's awesome. Such an honor. Such an honor to be with you guys today. Super. Yeah, we're we're excited to have you and so excited to have you on Funnel Hacking Live. And we're in the safe zone. We know that this is coming out after some really, really big news today. So it's pretty exciting. Exactly. Yes, I know I've had to keep this a secret for two weeks, which has been unbearable. But I made it go right. And now the news is out. And this is just, you know, a very, very surreal experience. Are you going to keep in secrets? No, terrible. I'm like, just like Russell, I talk, I talk a mile a minute and I'm just, yeah, yeah, like we give all the secrets away. Well, this is great. You know, it's funny. I for a long time with ClickFunnels, I used to go to a bunch of different events and the number one question. Well, I'd say probably the second question. The number one question is what is a ClickFunnel? Okay. This number two question was like, Yeah, but will it work for my business? And then, and then that always launches a series of questions. And I think you are like the answer to, this will work for any business. Yeah. Like how would somebody think, okay, how online do I do funnels for DJs? It's just so crazy. And I noticed there's a couple of really fun things like on your, on your website, your website is cratehackers.com. Is that right? Yes. That's our membership slash software. Hi. Yeah. So talk to me about why, you know, why you thought, okay, I'm a DJ or I have been a DJ and here's some of the problems that I've faced and I could help other people, but using funnels. What was that journey like? Yeah. So long story short, I read four hour work week many, many, many years ago. Classic. I was like, I wanted to, I want, I want to create a digital course and I want to, you know, be on a beach working four hour work weeks and just raking in the money, right? Yeah. I think that's a very common or like a, that's where a lot of people started, right? Is kind of being sold on this idea of being able to sell knowledge while you're, you know, while you're, while you're sleeping, right? However, my journey went was not very smooth. And luckily in 2018 is when I found Russell, because I was struggling. I was riding the struggle bus. I was trying to sell courses to people and I realized, oh, I need to niche down, you know, and right around that time I basically was introduced to DJing and I started DJing weddings for my brother, Tommy Perron. What's up? Tommy introduced me to this DJing world. I had so much fun at the time I was very, very broke. And it really, DJing really changed me because it introduced me to this concept that, hey, you could work for a day and make at least $1,000 Dominic, you know, like this was new to me because I was so broke. I would make, you know, just working the dead end jobs, marketing jobs in my whole life. And from there, I just wanted to teach people what we were doing. Me and Tommy were, you know, the top DJ company in our area. And so we became more than just making money while I'm sleeping, quote, unquote. I wanted to help other DJs up level what the experience factor that they were bringing to their clients because wedding DJs have a very, very bad name. Everyone thinks they're corny. You know, you kind of think wedding DJ equals not a real job. And so I ended up linking up with one of the influencers, one of my dream 100, in the DJ space, Joe Bunn, shout out to Joe. And we created the DJs vault. And that was really our first big success is, and Joe's story is incredible because he all, you know, he tried the other real boy jobs, right, the real guy jobs, right? He tried real estate. He tried selling shirts. He tried, you know, all these real people jobs. He hated every one of them. And now here he is, you know, I think he just turned 50, 51. First of all, he looks great. He's very presentable. He has a huge DJ company and he's living his best life doing what he loves, which is his passion, which is music. And so sorry, that was a very long answer. But that's kind of where everything started. And that is, you know, fun when you talk about funnels, you know, the first thing that we did was just get a lot of people on webinars, right, and challenges and start to change their ideas of what is possible. You don't have to work a UPS job, right? That's not a real, that doesn't have to be your real grown up job, right? You can make money doing what you freaking love, you know? And so that's our big messaging around the DJs vault. And then later on, Krate Hackers came to be with with Krate Hackers. Maybe people don't understand. And as I went to your website, you know, and I followed you along, I was like, man, Krate Hackers, why is that like an industry term for DJs? What's a crate? So a crate, if you if you think back to the good old days, DJs used to carry their records around in crates. Exactly. So now we don't do that anymore. I mean, some DJs do. But mostly DJs don't do that. But that concept, it's a, everything's in the digital world now, right? We have everything in MP3. I love that that terminology still exists even for digital files. Pretty cool. Because yeah, it's one of those things where crates look very different these days. It's literally just a folder of music, you know, in your DJ software. Like let's say I'm, you know, doing your wedding Laura, right? I'm going to have a crate prepared with all the songs that I'm about to rip at your wedding, right? Yeah. And it's a preparation thing. Like you go when you go to a wedding with with with fire crates, that means you're about to destroy that wedding. You're about to you're fully prepared. I love that industry jargon and that it still exists today. Like, you don't, you're not just going to call it a folder. It's a crate. Yeah, it's a fire crate. It's a pretty cool. Yeah. Filled with bangers. That's another, you know, another jargon we like to use. Love it. But basically we live in this digital world where for DJs, there's literally 120,000 songs that are uploaded to Spotify every single day. 120,000 a day. One every single day. And with the rise of AI, it's about to go into what I think is hundreds of thousands or millions a day. Yeah. Because it's so easy to make songs. And it's put DJs in a huge predicament because we've never had to keep on top of so much music at one time. You're literally getting bombarded from, you know, TikTok, Billboard, YouTube, like there's, it's very hard. It's never been harder to stay on top of what is hot and even like TV shows and film, right? Exactly. Yeah. Like, you know, today this one song, these five songs are viral. Tomorrow it's something different. Yeah. So as a DJ, you know, imagine me, a 37 year old man needs to go to a wedding or my worst nightmare, a prom. You know, like, what the hell are these kids listening to? Right? Right? That's where Craig Hackers comes into play. Oh, you use this, you use this term on your website called Serato Face. What is that? Yes, please explain. Serato Face is the face that a DJ makes when he's looking at his computer for the next song, like frantically searching for the next song because the song is only, you know, three to four minutes, right? And as a DJ, if you don't have your next song ready to go to mix into, you're about to destroy this person's wedding. Is this, is this, is this similar to RBF? Yes. Okay. All right. I'm not going to have to explain that. RBF though. Yes. Yes. Yeah. We did. So how, how resting Serato Face, by the way, how big of a party file is it if there's like a gap between songs? Major, dude, major. You do not do that. So it's not a play also, right? You want to make sure that like, based on the vibe and everything else they're doing, that's like a lot of work for a DJ then. Yeah, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. The other thing, and this is how, you know, the industry, just the way the industries are changing for everybody, the DJ industry especially because these days when you go to a party, people only want to hear one to two minutes of a song at most generally, right? It's just the, we call it quick mixing, right? And so the only way you can quick mix for a DJ and to keep going song after song after song, and you know, which is kind of, it's kind of a newer thing in the last decade because of shrinking attention spans and all. They don't want seven minutes of rapper's delight. We want instant gratification. We want the next vibe. You want the next vibe. And also because music is so crazy these days, you kind of only need to play one minute of, you know, ice spice and then go back into, you know, something from the 70s or 80s or 90s to make everyone feel included. You know, that's my assessment at least. Like music is very, it's quite varied and people are listening to, you know, people are still, the older folks are still listening to the radio. Newer people are listening to, you know, Spotify, they have their own playlist. There's no like single source of music that everyone is listening to. I love how niche this is. Like Dominic, you found like this blue ocean that nobody's really thinking about. And so you come in with a funnel and show them how to overcome some of this, you know, fatigue or serato face or whatever and help them be better DJs using your software with funnels. Correct. And I want to give a big shout out to, because it's not just me who made this go right. It's Aaron Trailer, Joe Bon and Glen Rinda are a programmer, but Aaron Trailer, one of my best friends, they're all my best friends, but Aaron had this insight that the future of music is not, you know, DJs are some of the only groups that still have records. Some of some have CDs. Don't ask me why. But a lot of us still have MP3s and we're about to go into this full on streaming world. And Aaron was the first guy to really hit that home into the DJ's noggin's and it was met with a lot of resistance, you know, sometimes this is one big like takeaway, I would say is sometimes your new opportunity is going to be met with resistance, but it's also going to be met with welcome arms from the super fans. Active. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm a little bit curious because you mentioned that like when you got started in this, when you started learning more about like entrepreneurship, you also were familiarizing yourself with the DJ industry and you talked about four hour work week, which most of us know and love. Yeah. You went into something that requires, you know, sometimes late hours and a lot of prep and, you know, actual labor of being in a physical place to be a DJ. Yes. How did you like, how did you kind of cross that? Like, I want to not have to work every single night, late nights and turn it into a successful online business. Yeah. So just diving into Russell's dot com secrets and then expert secrets and then the new version of expert secrets, you know, I've been connected to him for very long time and then, you know, I went to my first funnel hacking live in 2019 and funny story is I was DJing weddings, right? So I had a wedding on Saturday and also I was very broke at the time. And so really I could only go to one day of my first funnel hacking live, which was 2019. And I see you flew up to Nashville for one day. I went, I drove to Nashville. Luckily us in Atlanta, we can do that. Gotcha. Three and a half hour drive, four hour drive. Still. But yeah, I had to drive like either late that night after my wedding was done or like very early in the morning. Oh my goodness. And I went for Saturday and guess what? Still like 1000% worth it. 100%. I found my family and more importantly, it made me realize like what we had going like I already built up a little traction with our online programs, but being there and seeing Russell talk about this stuff. It was like, dude, I'm taking this full, you know, we're going to full send this, we're going to explode this thing, right? And that was right before major, major expansion in our membership. Yeah. So at the, you know, at the time we had a couple hundred members, I would say, and then that first year 2019, 1000 members 2020 came along. Totally destroyed the wedding market. First of all, totally destroyed basically everything about DJs. Everybody's going, you know, everybody's trapped in their house now. Everybody's canceling or postponing what? Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And a lot of DJs are torn because they have to go get those real world jobs that all of us hate, right? Because we all just want to be DJs, most of us, or and do music, do what we love, right? And so we're, you know, I think my life is over to be honest. We had just started the DJs vault, which was our first membership and that was all about the business side of things, right? But the business side of things suddenly evaporated, right? And so, so in 2020, I did Aaron reach basically we had a lot of time on our hands. Aaron trailer reached out to Joe Bunn and Joe, Joe and I, you know, Joe had that first membership and Aaron was just a guest on this as a guest on this membership, but he was a super fan. And the super fan comes, comes onto Joe's show for the DJs vault during 2020 worst year ever. And we, for, we, we saw this huge like pop of viewers, like a lot of our members were really interested in this topic, this, this, it was called the one playlist to rule them all. And it was kind of like our first indicator that our, our people are really into this. And so as the story goes, Joe is like, Hey, Dom, Aaron wants to sell this membership thing for $5 a month. And it's called the perfect DJ playlist. And I was like, Oh, I don't think that's going to work, right? I didn't like the name at the time. This is the pre-crate hackers. So I did the thing that I learned, which has changed my business and I'll always do. And, and is one of the things that I see is missing in a lot of people's online businesses. I surveyed our audience. I didn't think it was a good idea to be perfectly honest with you. I thought perfect DJ playlist sounds boring and sounds stupid, honestly. Okay. But I was given this task to kind of launch it, right? So I surveyed our audience to see, and it turns out music organization was a huge problem. And that was like our first survey that we did within our group. Hold on, Dom, real quick. This is what's so cool. And I love yes, so many things like from what Russell teaches, like, Hey, your opinion doesn't matter. Like you think that's not a good idea, but you had the foresight to go, Oh, well, maybe I'm not the like, maybe I'm not the opinion that matters. And so I'm not, I'm not. Yeah, at the time I was still, you know, three years, four years deep into DJing. Like I know that I'm a beginner, right? And so yeah, yeah. So I was like, well, a lot of people were on this, this members only webinar, you know, for to see Aaron and Joe talk about this subject. So that was a good sign. So that's why I, yeah, I was like, let me just survey and see. And also I surveyed because I'm before I was funnel trained, I was ad trained. And what I learned is if you do the proper survey, they will give you every single piece of copywriting that you need for your webinar script, your webinar landing page, your ads, everything will come out of those surveys. And I have a, I have a different way of talking about surveys because surveys are done so poorly in my opinion. If we could kind of dive into that, because that's, this is, this is important to me. I really want to bring people's, I really would like for people to use these cheat codes and they're called, you know, it's a deep dive survey, but I want to re kind of rename it and I want to call it, the way I look at it is a vent session. Oh, I love that. So, so one of the big insights that I got from Steve Larson and Russell is, you know, if your current audience is not frustrated enough about this thing or that about this problem or this, this struggle, this challenge, it's going to be very hard to sell them to be honest. So with a vent session, think about a deep dive survey as a vent session. You want your people to vent about a particular topic and when they do, especially your super fans, you will get absolute gold diamonds platinum. Oh, that's great insight. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, it's, um, yeah, I've been trying to kind of redefine the survey because as soon as I say survey, people's eyes kind of gloss over, but I have to give credit where credit is due. You know, the, the Russell talks about doing kind of like survey funnels. Ryan LeVe has the incredible book called Ask, where is where I really had that first insight about deep dive surveys, but I want to take it a step further and and kind of get people to think about it as a vent session because I think it just helps you understand how to talk, how, how to put your surveys together so that they're fun, they're conversational, they're open, open-ended questions, a lot of open-ended questions. You really find out who's in your audience. You segment your audience and then you find out about their external challenges, their internal struggles and their current frustrations with the current vehicle. Just getting the right feedback, not just a bunch of crap that you have to sift through. Like you are getting the problems so that you know how to answer it for the customer. That's amazing. I cannot say enough how much this is a cheat code. I probably shouldn't be telling anybody about this, but whoever's listening to this. I, first of all, thank you for listening to my episode. You're awesome. Second of all, anybody that is coming to Funnel Hacking Live to see me speak, I'm going to give you like an awesome bonus, but I can, I can't wait. Well, we could even go into that right now. So what you're going to do is are you going to talk about diving into these surveys at Funnel Hacking Live? 100%. Yes. Oh, this is going to be good. People love permission to bellyache, right? Everybody's so worried about doing it. Exactly. No, I heard Robbie Somersay's and I don't know if he got us from somebody else. He says, listen, nobody, and a lot of people know Robbie from our team. He says, nobody goes and leaves a review for a gallon of milk. You go in and if everything's good, it's great. But when you say, no, I want to know what your pain is. I don't want to know what your struggle is. Now you have, like you said, unlocked everything, given permission to bellyache. This is great. Exactly. And the other thing that I want to, that I'm really going to hit home in my speaker bonus and on stage is just the concept of building a data flywheel. Okay. What I mean by that is your data is going to power your whole business. At least it should be, right? You, first of all, we need to own our own data. We need to stop having the big tech companies own our data. And more so than a list, we need to have a database. So name and email is good, but I want to really like drive home at Funnel Hacking Live and in the future. Better than a list, name and emails is a database, name, email, segmented. I also know their, their external challenges, their internal struggles, their, you know, hope, streams and desires, their big goals. If I have all of those things, doing ads is super easy to be honest with you. Getting people to sign up for a webinar or challenge, very easy. We take all the guesswork out of everything and it's all because of event session and data flywheel. We're also very, very in tune with our members. Every week we go on to zooms with our members. And again, these are our super fans. They're already their future forward, new opportunity, loving people, right? So they tell us exactly what they want. It's the ultimate cheat code. We know what their struggles are. We also know why they're leaving crate hackers because cancellations happen. We survey them, we let them vent. I even in our cancellation survey, Chris and Laura, I asked them, you know, why are you leaving? Please tell me more about that vent, about that. And how would you solve this problem if you were us? Oh, that's so good. Interesting. So even if you can't change their minds, at least you're fixing future problems. Right? I'm like, Hey, if you're, if you're going to complain, you know, how would you fix it? And also, yeah, to fix future problems. So yeah, really cool. Okay. I want to go back to something real quick because you kind of talked about how you're, you're letting some cats out of the bag and maybe you're sharing things that you shouldn't be sharing, which I think is funny because I imagine that you in this industry probably own a decent size, a decent bite of the market share being a DJ with an online business. Yeah. Talk a little bit about what that's like and why you're using funnels or how you're seeing funnels be successful in what you're building. Yeah. So well, first we have, we just, we couldn't turn it off if we wanted to, you know, just like our funnels are working so good, you know, thanks to ClickFunnels and all the knowledge that we've gotten and the ongoing support from the community, you know, I was in two CCX, I was, I'm in inner circle now. Before that, I would just read the books and go to every FHL and just kind of surround myself with as many people as possible. But we absolutely live and die by workshops or webinars, you know, web, the whole dramatic demonstration concept, right? Challenge, three day challenges have totally changed our lives. And also you enjoy teaching. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And me and Aaron and Joe and Glenn, I mean, we're all, it's a, you know, group effort. So Aaron is the main educator. Joe is kind of like, he does the stack at the end. I, I just like kind of manage our ads and our funnels and, you know, Glenn is there listening to our audience, building exactly what they want, you know, listening to our super fans, programming. And fun fact, we actually found, we started Crate Hackers in June of 2020, literally in the heart of the pandemic. Glenn was actually in that first round of membership buyers. Like our, when we first started Crate Hackers, it was not a software. It was a, every month we're going to send you a list of songs via PDF, right? It was very, very, I will say, bare bones. And because we were so in tune with our membership and we were doing these weekly, you know, Zooms, Glenn came out of the, you know, he was part of the kind of rose to the top. And we, he was like, Hey, I think I could program a solution for you. Almost like a Russell and a Todd story, which isn't, you know, so I just, I cannot say enough about memberships. I mean, we have literally over 7,000 subscriptions at this point. We started, you know, I started when I created my first membership in 2018. I had 30 members, but even a group, and I talked about this in Mexico, even a group of 30 members is a huge accomplishment. And it gives you the power to start inviting your dream 100 to start coming into your group and speaking. And that's how I met Joe. And with Joe, who talked to my little baby group of 30 members, Joe was like one of the leading industry experts in the wedding DJ space. And then with him, we created the thousand person membership. And then we kept inviting people in, inviting people in invite. And then we found Aaron and that's our 5,000 person membership. That's the who not how, right? It is exactly. Seven thousand. So these people are all, you mentioned membership, a big part of what Russell teaches right now is the linchpin. Yes. And one of those things is continuity. Is this something that people are paying monthly, Dom? Oh, yes. So instead of charging $5 a month, the way, you know, Aaron was wanted to, we now charge $30 a month. And you can, you know, do the math on that, right? Everybody get your calculators out. And it's a full blown software, right? I mean, people can go in there and yeah. It's a full blown software. And even, even our other memberships are $30 a month. Now, I'm not saying that you should price yours at $30 a month. However, one thing that I've found is, you know, having a lower priced membership makes it very easy for people to just kind of give it a try and give it a sign up. So that's one thing that I will say about a low cost membership. You should absolutely listen to Russell about pricing your membership correctly. But for us, you know, I don't have to do a webinar or a workshop to, to drive people into our funnel. We have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ads. Thanks to our deep dive surveys, our vent sessions. Every time I have, you know, want to write a new ad, I just look at what my people are saying. Oh, they just gave me the idea for Serato Face. They just gave me the idea for music hoarding, right? We have a whole series of ads about music hoarding, right? Well, like somebody wants to keep playing call me maybe or something. And then they're like, yeah, I'm going to be in the center. What exactly? Right, right. Yeah. Yeah, we can throw rocks at that. We throw rocks at, you know, all the fun things that are in the industry, you know, drunk people coming up to you and requesting, you know, demanding call me maybe by, you know, Carly Ray Jepsen or Bad Bunny is a big one. Oh, that's hilarious. Right now. Oh, that's hilarious. Well, this, this is fascinating to me. I mean, from you attending one day in 2019, FHL, to then coming back in 2020, to 2021, 2021 was a big year for me. I paid off my, my, you know, again, I was in very bad financial conditions. So I had a SUV with a 22% horrible loan interest rate. So 2021 I paid that sucker off. I know. Yes, sir. Eyes are about to bulge out of her head. Wow. And now, yeah. And in the midst of a pandemic as a DJ, impressive. Yeah, that's great. Like you really turned it around. Oh my gosh. So now we're moving into 2022. Okay. And now you have been chosen to speak at funnel hacking live 2023, which we couldn't be more excited about. You teased a little bit about a speaker bonus that you're going to be providing for people who buy tickets to funnel hacking live. So there's still a chance. Go to funnel hacking live.com. Will you tell us a little bit about your speaker bonus and what you're, what you're offering? Absolutely. So I'm going to dive into this, this vent session concept with you. I'm even going to show you some examples of how to put your own vent session questions together. And then I'm going to go one step further because remember I started as an ad guy and turned into a funnel guy. And now I have kind of this, you know, I have a very interesting perspective because I have a holistic view of the entire funnel. Right. And so I'm going to teach you also inside this bonus. How we're taking our survey data, our vent session data, our data fly wheel, if you will, our database and how we're turning that and using AI to create some really creative ads that are getting insane amounts of clicks. And then I'm going to also teach you how you can then turn that ad into a video ad and break the internet. Hopefully that'll, You heard it here first folks. There's a really great speaker bonus coming up. Funnel hack. Oh, I love it. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. So just to like tease that out a little bit more, I'm working with a friend of mine right now. We surveyed her audience and we found out a lot of women are posting, posting, posting for their coaching business and they feel like the post goes nowhere. They feel invisible. So I'm actually going to do this whole ad series with that feeling of invisibility. And then we just did another ad where we literally used mid journey and some crazy AI tools to make ad images. We made the women blue, like they're blue and blue faced women. And the hook is do you feel like you've been posting to social media until you're blue in the face? Oh yeah. Right. And so I'll teach you guys how we're doing that and show you a little bit inside that. So yeah, it's fun. You know, and if there's one thing I can say about this, not, not only do you love DJing, but like I can tell that talking about the marketing side of things really gets you fired up. I can see the joy in your face when you talk about these things. It's my number one passion. And it's yeah, before DJing, there was marketing and there always will be. And this is what I'm most passionate about. And I'm very, very excited to inspire, you know, young Dom from four years ago, whoever's there in those chairs who made it go right. Cause it's not easy, always easy to get to funnel hacking live, but whoever's there, I am going to, I want to inspire those people and just let them know that they can do it. Even if their dreams are crazy right now, you can do it. There's nothing special about me. I don't, I have no superpowers. I just read a lot of books, specifically Russell's books many, many times. And then some others here and there. So yeah, we could, we could, we could, we could, we could talk to you forever about this, but I think this is a good place to kind of keep people teased. And go get your tickets to funnel hacking live because we have so many other speakers too that we're just announced that we're going to have here on ClickFunnels radio and Dom, you are the man. And we're excited to see you at the lacking live. Hey, if people want to go find you, obviously create hackers.com. Where else should they go? Follow you. Yeah.

Well, Hey, you, you, we're excited to see you at funnel hacking live and also all you listeners and young Dom out there.

I'm going to, at funnel hacking live, I'm going to nerd out. I'm going to be in the hallways. I'm going to be talking to people. I'm going to be like, like I just, you know, it's such an honor for me to speak on stage. Like I've been dreaming literally every night before I go to bed. I visualize speaking on stage, speaking on stage. Speaking on stage, speaking on stage. So I don't, I just want to be there for whoever is at funnel hacking live, find me in the hallways. We'll nerd out. I love you guys. That's really beautiful. Thanks so much, Dom. We'll see you in September. Talk to you soon. Thanks guys. Bye.
