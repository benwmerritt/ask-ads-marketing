Here are your hosts Laura Demetrius and Chris Cameron. Welcome back to click funnels radio. My name is Chris Cameron and joined with me as my co-host as always Laura Demetrius. Laura what is up? Hey Chris I'm excited this is gonna be a good one today. Yeah this one's this was interesting I was trying to figure out you know everything that this guest does and he does everything like this guy is a navy pilot like true top gun guy like he could legit beat Tom Cruise easy in dog fight but then he's a farmer he does this crazy podcast he's won an affiliate contest when he's not really necessarily that's not his niche I mean this is crazy and a speaker and an author so I want to introduce everybody to my good friend Bill Allen. Bill what's up? Hey Chris how are you? I'm doing great and Bill spoke at Funnel Hacking live last year. Bill so you I want to ask about something that happened I think it was what a couple weeks ago you flew into Boise for this groundbreaking right of the library and next thing you know you're taking people on planes to Montana just to go eat a chicken sandwich at Chick-fil-A you're recording podcasts you actually are pilot you're recording a podcast from the plane just one did one with Russell tell us about that. Yeah so like I'm trying to figure out what I love to do and and where what direction I want to go and what I want to be known for and I've struggled with that for many years of just because you said it in the beginning like this guy kind of does everything so if you do everything you really do nothing nobody really knows who you are what you're known for and I've seen the most successful people are folks that that do one thing really really well and I love to fly and then I wanted to build something that where I'm talking to entrepreneurs and just kind of interviewing them and their story and and how they can help people and I wanted to build this YouTube channel and so I was like everybody's got something like I love to fly and I love to talk about money so what if I what if I put my studio in my airplane and we just flew around and talked about money and business and all the things that I like to have conversations could it open doors for people who I wouldn't normally have access to to go do something that they've never done before that's kind of crazy and no one else can really catch up to me I don't think like every like Grant I was on his jet a couple a couple months ago he can interview somebody in the back but he can't fly it that's true so I was like I got a leg up I got a head start and I think it can be unique that not a lot of other people have done and hopefully what it does in the future you mentioned I flew to Boise and interviewed some folks my goal is to get it big enough where people come to me like they want to come to Nashville I do like one or two of these interviews a month and that's it we put them on YouTube cut them up make them really good like a show not necessarily a podcast but like a show and then I think what I'm what I'm considering doing is taking the entire interview because we leave a lot on the cutting room floor because it's only about a 30 minute 25 30 minutes on YouTube and put that on a podcast where somebody can act they want to listen to the entire conversation everything Russell and I talked about for like an hour and a half then they can listen to the long-form podcast something like that so I'm trying to build something that's new that hasn't been done before because I love to do it and I think it's something that hasn't been done before in that specific way and that's kind of what we need we need something that's a little different right now to be noticed and I also want to be the guy everybody should think like Bill's the guy who has the flying he flies in his airplane and interviews people like he can talk on the radio like you don't hear all the radio calls that I have to make while we're flying like it's a whole another channel that has all the all the noise off I got to listen to them I got to talk to the I got to think about my next question I got to listen to what the person's saying I got to scan I got to make sure we don't crash into the ground yeah you're still flying the plane yeah Russell was like dude this is really cool like we're times like he's like this isn't that bad like I can just fly Marley I Marley jacks came on the plane was there and she was like oh I'm pretty good at this I was like yeah but you also don't have to talk on the radio you don't have to interview the person you have to scan for traffic you don't have to check to make sure we have enough fuel you don't have to think about what happens if we lose the engine and we have to land and we have an emergency and so like all that stuff's going through my head while we're doing the interview so wow it's a lot of fun though too so yeah that almost seems a little bit over stimulating so the fact that you I mean you've definitely capitalized like this is like such an original business idea after you know with all the other things that you do so it's crazy to think about all of the things that you have to focus on while having these in-depth business conversations with others but I'm curious to know you clearly do so many things well like is this podcast on a plane thing like is this your groove like is it your favorite thing that you're doing right now? It's probably one of them for sure and I just I love to fly I tell you what I love more than flying though and I and I realize this in pretty much everything that I do you only get to have that experience like once or twice you ever watch a movie that's like really good and it has this twist at the end like usual suspects or memento or some of these these these movies that you see at the end and you can never see it again for the first time right yeah and I love it like usual suspects I'm like I know what happens at the end and even if it's 10 years or 20 years before you watch it again you still kind of remember and know and you can never have that feeling for the first time so that's the challenge that we have with everything that we do so in flying what I love is I get to bring somebody like Russell on the plane and I get to see my first flying experience through his eyes again while I'm talking about the things that I love and I can see him getting nervous I can see him uncomfortable and I think the other thing that it does a little bit is it brings out something inside of them that they wouldn't normally share on a typical interview so as an example on Russell's interview I was able to get him to tell me how much the offer was for Click Files and I've never heard him talk about that before so I don't know why he shared it but he shared and I was like going into the interview I was like I want to get everybody to tell me something that they wouldn't normally tell somebody on is that something that you're going to publish uh I it sounded like there wasn't a problem you got so and it wasn't exact it wasn't exactly way more information than I've ever heard it was stories and and also we talked about the three things that reduce the valuation from a VC firm that they're working on right now that other people can work on if they want to sell their business so like all this really valuable kind of conversation and information and then I saw him squirm when he was like setting up the way on the plane and kind of freaking out a little bit so it's just you can see it through somebody else's eyes the same thing when I take people fishing I love to go offshore fishing but I pretty much caught like every fish out there so when I'll take somebody who's never been on us on a trip like that and I want to see it through their eyes because I get to experience it and help them and that actually gives me more joy than doing it for the first time myself so I'm really passionate about that and then Chris mentioned the farm like I really love that because it's in my backyard it's like families are kids are seeing food being grown for the first time they're seeing chickens lay eggs and really where stuff comes from and it's all local and I think you know I'm losing money doing that but it's like filling the passion bucket for me of like my soul yeah I love that I mean you're doing so many things I want to dive into what I think you are known for like obviously as a pilot and everything else I mean I loved like when you came on stage at FHL your walk on music was dangerous I like it's so cool but seven figure flipping this kind of really caught my attention and now I'm a customer right but what's so cool about this is I hadn't seen it done this way and maybe some other people are doing this I want to dive into how you're doing real estate funding you're funding deals in these big syndications using funnels and webinars so talk to us a little bit about how that works and what seven figure flipping is and what's working yeah so seven figure flipping is my kind of coaching and consulting business it started as a single family house flipping and wholesaling business so we have a couple hundred clients across the country that flip into wholesale houses and we just teach them how to build their own business so we don't do the marketing for them we don't do any of that stuff very similar we run a very similar business to what you guys do in click funnels in the masterminds like 2cx and things like that so we I've modeled that for years in there so we have masterminds coaching programs all kinds of stuff like that events and and then we built a multifamily mastermind a couple years after that so I partnered with a partner some good friends of mine they were clients of mine in the single family world went in multifamily and I got really good the reason why I was successful as an investor is I could raise money I could talk to people about money I could be like a financial advisor without the certification I could really tell them some of the things they don't even understand about the stock market um bitcoin other areas where they're investing their money and where they can get the best returns to really truly be passive I just because I was doing it myself and for years I've been a money guy like I love money like I said well like airplanes and money I love to talk about the two of those I'm the weird guy 4th of July yesterday who is talking to everybody about how much they make like if you sit next to me at a party we're going to talk about money like we're just I'm I'm going to help you make more of it and I'm going to figure out and I'm going to make you uncomfortable a little bit sometimes so what I realized I hate talking on the phone I don't like talking to people one-on-one I don't really I'm not really that social of a person I actually gave up my phone like four months ago to my assistant I had no cell phone at all anymore you're telling me this I'm fascinated to hear more about this but I don't hear more about seven figure flipping first well I wanted to figure out how to raise capital like one to many because we do one to many coaching I don't like one-on-one and I was just wasting so much time I was having the same conversation over and over and over again with people like same conversation where's your money now how much you think about investing you know why why don't you want your money like why are you why are we even having this conversation why do you hate the stock market why do you hate whatever what kind of returns do you want same conversation over and over and over again and I just said we've been doing this in the digital marketing world for so long of selling you know high ticket products this isn't this is the same thing how can I figure out how to use this to just go raise capital on a webinar one time or my email list and just email people and not have to talk to them and just have the same frequently asked questions asked at the end of the call on the webinar and just get them to hit a link and make a commitment because I just I my time is very valuable like I really only work money through Thursday from 10 to 4 that's it right now and I have six different companies we have so much going on I just can't have 30 minute calls every single day I would have done nothing done so that's what we did we started really I realized that I could start automating this I really am a I'm an engineer in my background is a mechanical and aeronautical engineering and I just figure out how I can automate this operationally to make it really easy and get people to and so I know I got to get the no like and trust factor up I got to get in front of them I got to bring in people and then you know they refer people and bring other people in and we've probably raised you know 50 60 million dollars over the past a year or two for for these deals now that's incredible I love that you mentioned and I just thought about this when you were talking about when you interview people as you're flying a plane and you just talked about how you were the guy at fourth of July parties talking about money and it sounds like you can position yourself to really get people to open up and maybe you're making them uncomfortable but you're finding out so many things that the average person probably isn't able to find out about people by having that leg up of like putting yourself in situations where you are more confident you are more experienced in things so to learn so much about people in a way that gets you to understand them on a whole new level is really fascinating I would agree with that I think most people are like they're afraid to to have a difficult conversation or I think I'm just like somewhat socially awkward and I really don't I don't understand when people are feeling like when it comes to money when it comes to that something business and money I just I love it so much that it's pretty much a lot of what I think about so I talk about it a lot and I'll tell you the most people they're afraid to tell people what they do or what they're going to do or what they're planning to do until they become really really successful I think the people out there like if there's something that you want to do if you put it out there and you start talking about it people are going to start seeing you that way I guarantee like all my if if people don't know what you're doing right now then how can they ever invest with you how can they ever do business with you how can they ever get involved with you how can they get interested in it you can't keep it a secret I think everybody has a secret identity that that they don't share and this is what I teach when I teach people how to raise a lot of money is you've got to you've got to share it before you become successful and that's the challenge yeah I mean I think so many people don't share what they're doing or what they plan to do maybe because they're afraid of failing but really it's the brave people who are out there talking about it even before they're necessarily doing it that you know if they're comfortable enough and confident enough to talk about it they're the ones that are probably going to succeed yeah I put it out there and said it was it was months ago like a long time ago I was like I'm going to have a million subscribers on my youtube channel I think I have like 79 right now maybe 80 some my farm channel is growing way faster than my my fine channel yeah we're just I'm just not I'm trying to let the youtube algorithm take over I'm not necessarily talking about it a ton but I put it out there and I'm like I'm still committed to this it's just gonna I don't care how long it takes me it's just gonna take me a long time and I'm dedicated and committed to it I really love this idea and I'll figure it out and I think a lot of people are just and I I could easily share that and be like oh yeah I decided not to do that but like that's it like I'm going to figure it out I've been working for like six months on this studying buying courses training watching at what other people are doing iterating what I'm doing getting a little bit more views on each video and just you know trying to figure it out like we hit the algorithm really well recently on a video for my farm and so I'm trying to figure out how to do the same thing for my personal channel and it's just it's gonna take a long time and the people who have millions of subscribers and on there they've been doing it for a really long time yeah like 10 20 years so most people are just not willing to do something long enough and be bad long enough to be successful and I think that's the that's the challenge that we have and I'm willing to I'm willing to be really bad at stuff for a really long time and I love learning new things and just getting better like that's my whole life I just want to learn new things that's like the quote of this whole podcast too willing to be bad for a long time right that's that's so cool yeah yeah there's an advantage to that I want to go back to I know what Chris mentioned earlier about you wanting to get rid of your cell phone and how you haven't had a cell phone for a few months tell us a little bit about that so that's a really long conversation I'll try to give you the cliff notes I don't like to talk on the phone really and I'm also as somebody who I really am family oriented I love my I have three little boys one of them special needs he had five open heart surgeries and the four of them in the first six months of his life has six heart catheters he's he's a challenge he needs like one-on-one support a lot of times I put him in the realm of like an autistic kid he's like has a routine and things like that and he doesn't really speak that well didn't eat for three and a half years so we have some tough things that are going on and I just want to be present and I realized I was never really present especially when I unlocked this entrepreneurial world like nine or ten years ago I mean I was a pilot for the Navy I was making like $90,000 a year I thought making 150k a year was it that was like the peak in the pinnacle I was going to retire after 20 years get half my salary and probably go get another job as a test pilot flying for some other company probably and so I didn't know this world and this world kind of consumed me and it's very easy to get eaten up and never catch up like always be going all the time constant notifications totally and my wife is somebody who is cool just like sitting on the back porch by herself doing nothing like she does not need she's not driven she's not like she has like I don't know I was like what is your purpose in life she's like I don't know and I don't care like I just want to live and do my thing like and so it's total opposite for me and so the problem is is a digital marketer and somebody who's online all the time she sees me when I'm on my phone as I'm working even if I'm just like reading an article on CNN right like it wouldn't matter but I'm working on the couch all the time and the kids were saying my name like five times before before I even I'd be thinking about stuff so I really need to figure a way to unplug and so I wanted to do this for years and I've even had a second phone for a long time thinking I'd get a bat phone that only three people would have the phone number for and my son had a make-a-wish trip to go to Disney he's a wish kid so he's going to Disney world and we're going and we get to the front of the line Disney universal SeaWorld whatever we want to do amazing experience once in a lifetime thing right for these kids that have a have you know a terminal type diagnosis and so we're going there and I'm like I just now's the time like I just need to give it up so I can be fully present while I'm there and not have to be on my phone check my email like you have a computer in your pocket you have every answer in your pocket so for 10 days I had no phone I gave it I have a chief of staff that works for me and she took my phone with her while I was gone so she answered all the text messages and phone calls answered the phone when it rang and stuff like that we mean executive used to have secretaries that would answer the phone and it was just a thing whether it was a man or a woman doesn't matter but answer the phone in the 80s and 90s and there's a somebody in the way between somebody getting to them yeah so it was magical like it was incredible I realized that I was totally addicted to it for the first couple days I was like I feel a vibration in my pocket and it wasn't there you know it's like stuff like that and so I just said well how about two weeks how about a month how about forever like I don't know what it's like but what I realized was people solve their own problems you don't have to answer within five seconds like people think that you do if you stop talking to people they'll stop talking to you so and if they realize that somebody else has is a gatekeeper for you they'll stop talking to them too like the amount of messages I get now are much lower than what I got before and let's think about this they have Facebook Messenger Instagram messages TikTok Slack Asana text messages phone calls voxer voxer like just keep naming them and so it's not bad yeah I mean YouTube yeah YouTube comments everything like it's not email we didn't mention email I probably have five different six different email accounts yeah but it's not even it's not bad when you have a few people that are connected to you like in the beginning I had maybe five or ten friends or people that have my number that were messaging me early on in my life and it's no big deal like I became somebody who would respond quickly and I prided myself and my identity was wrapped around responding quickly and I think all most of us are and so then what happens is you scale to a hundred connections and I'm still somebody who responds quickly and everybody loves me because I respond quickly they're like I loved working with Bill because he responds quickly he gets things done he does what he says he's going to do he's on time all this stuff and then when I scaled a thousands or tens of thousands of connections like what happened is I would get a hundred messages and I would I would clear out 10 a day yeah and then I have 90 and next day I get another 100 and then the next day a hundred and next day a hundred I never feel like I can catch up I go home and I'm like I can't catch up and so then I would beat myself up because I'm somebody who responds quickly and people would get upset with me because I didn't respond to them when I used to respond to them all the time and think that I'm mad at them I actually had clients of mine that thought I was mad at them I was like I love you I will never be mad at you like you can't do anything to upset me and piss me off like really you can't it's just the fact that I didn't see the message I got 300 facebook messages last week like I missed it and I'm not mad and they would keep it inside and so now it's a different conversation it's like I don't have a phone yeah like what are you talking about you don't have a phone this is incredible let's talk about this and I spend more time talking about this and that's the thing I when I did before so what I realized is in order when I have that many connections the only thing I could do is burn it down like I could never catch up ever so I just burned it all down and now I I build a system around how I communicate with people like they can't text me and call me it's not like I have another phone anymore like I do not have a phone at all I I mean I have I have an iPhone but it's a camera and it's connected to three other people my social media team my my chief of staff they can all see the pictures that I take I can i message on wi-fi so Chris you and I have messaged before this yeah I was gonna say when I text you what happens I'm getting something sometimes it's me sometimes it's me sometimes it's my chief of staff yeah we both get the same messages you'll only get me if I'm on wi-fi and so and I intentionally wasn't on wi-fi yesterday when I was at my friend's house I could have asked him for the password but do you know how rude it is when you pull out your phone and you're talking to somebody yeah like you don't know if they're like texting or looking at something like what I have to do now to check my emails I have to open a computer could you imagine if we're at a fourth of july party and I break out my backpack open a computer while we're having a conversation and open up my laptop and start checking my email and typing a response but that's what people are doing with their phones I know that's what I'm saying very similar even at a restaurant with their phone but it's socially acceptable now and it's so rude I couldn't agree more yet you're you're super successful you've been able to figure out that you don't have to have that constant drip right of this contact yeah but I you know so I do I do also know and realize that I'm probably losing some business or something by not being as connected as I was before but I will tell you I feel a lot more free and there's a lot there's a lot there and look we're on a marketing podcast and I run a marketing business and I'm on social media I'm making videos every day like we do a ton of videos in the airplane my instagram account has all of our airplane videos I'm focusing on that right now to grow it I need to grow the attention and eyeballs that I have on me and I realize social media is a big part of that but you can figure out a way to systemize it and automate it such that it works for you and you're putting out great information that's really helpful for people and you can back like we batch it every time I fly it costs me thousands of dollars to fly so when I fly out to Boise I'm making reels the entire way there I'm making like 30 40 reels and on the way back I'm doing the same thing I'm when I'm there I'm I'm making some of these videos and then my team takes it and they work on it for months and I give them content and I only have to do it like once a month and so I fit we try to figure out I figure out how to do that where I don't feel like it's sucking all my life I was a total consumer on there I said I was a creator but I was a creator and a consumer yeah that's a big difference right and it's okay if I'm intentionally going on there to consume something but not when it's like seven hours a day oh amen you know I want to ask about one other thing too which I think is interesting for people you are not you wouldn't label yourself as an affiliate would you like as just a pro affiliate but let me tell you we went kind of head to head in this grant cardone I remember I was in Costco with my wife and you and I are texting back and forth and we're like hey how many is this personnel like we kind of kept going back and forth and you took was it second or third I got second yeah this is crazy in one of the biggest affiliate contests there was bill comes out of nowhere and just hammers people how did you do that if you're not known as the affiliate guy well there's a couple things that I did the first the first step is I knew how much I could pay to acquire a customer right then I think a lot of people don't do so when ads got really expensive and people were expecting to pay like five dollars for an opt-in and they were paying like 20 that they yeah that's right that was about the number that cleared the field and I knew that we could pay up to 20 dollars an opt-in for what we were doing on the back end of it like I I engineer everything ahead of time like I want to know my predicted outcome there's actually something that I heard I was in 2ccx for like years before Russell opened up his inner circle again I was just like knocking on the door for like years and years and years and so I would pay for 2ccx for years and I was on some like virtual call that that they did and I wish I could remember who said it they said hypothesized test pivot these are three words that they use they're like this is how I run my business and since then it's been written on my wall on my ipad every got my hand everywhere that's all I think about so I hypothesized test and pivot so before I do anything I come up with the expected outcome of what I think I'm going to see and I was hoping for opt-ins around 10 bucks we were getting them like 20 and then we were able to dial down to 16 but I knew that I could do that and and still be because we had something on the back end that we were going to sell these people that was the key yeah and they were real estate people I knew that the audience and avatar was perfect for me and my offer which like that's the challenge that I have a lot of times with some of the click funnels affiliate stuff is I can't figure out how to like I don't have the program on the back end to make money from the people that opt in and come into my world they were also willing to share all the leads all the emails like real time so so all that stuff really helped so I was able to come up with the numbers and do the math to try to figure out exactly how I could do this and then I took that and I went and I found the person because we're not good enough at Facebook ads to run a campaign like this so my team did not run the Facebook campaign that we did fortunately I was in the Atlas group and I was able to find the person who could run Alicia was is amazing she ran our Facebook campaign with us we came up with a plan and in like 10 days we were able to drive like 7500 opt ins but the thing is other people didn't convert the way that we converted so on the back end of this the other thing that I did tactically Laura I know you want the tactics right yes so what I did was the weeks leading up to it when somebody opted in I got on I got on calls I was on zoom calls twice a week leading up to his challenge seating and preparing what his offer was going to be because they they gave us all this training they told us the five pillars that they were going to keep teach and sell and I taught all the five pillars myself to warm them up for that before they got there so our conversion rate was probably like three or four times higher than anybody else that had opt in so and I was looking at all the metrics all the data I was also able to get them on the call by sending a calendar invite directly to their Google I just invited all 7000 people that opted in that we had in a calendar invite to get them to come on it broke our zoom account like the most people that ever showed up and so I just really like just warmed them up and they were in there like because they didn't know who I was I was using grants likeness on the ad it was me and grants picture next to each other and they're like when's Grant showing up I was like I just didn't address it I just kept teaching I kept training and I showed them that I had value and I think the difference is they see Grant Cardona as the billionaire and I was a closer step to where they are and so I was able to build trust and I was able to easily like boil things down and then the other thing I did is on the back end after every day that he trained I would train with them in the application to real estate because I was training business and I was I knew that all these were real estate investors because I wanted only real estate investors ran ads only to investors because I want to convert them into my program on the back end so I built out my own like it took me like a month once we decided that we're going to do it which was a very difficult decision it didn't make a lot of sense for us we'd never done this before and the other because I also knew that if I'm going to participate I'm going to win yeah like I don't do anything to become in second I'm pissed that I got second the reason I'm texting you is I'm like I'm still trying to win this I want to know where you're at and if you know where anybody else is at I want to know how much harder I need to win and so I but you told me that I couldn't beat Anthony and you were right there's even it's hard to beat Anthony man that guy shows up as affiliates for sure he's a power up I think our email list is like maybe we might have 100,000 people on there and he's got like a couple million when I talk to him and I was just like you're right there's no way I could win it's also a life lesson I think for business operators and what you said about understanding the offer and kind of diving into what the offer is coaching that teaching like certain methods and it makes me realize there are probably a lot of people out there that are thinking listening to this and thinking I should probably have my offer better prepared you know more than 24 hours before I just go and launch the thing because I think that that's something that like a lot of people like that's the fault in so many launches is like knowing your offer and if you have a really great affiliate program letting your affiliates know exactly what's going to be happening if I can take that a step further I think the problem that most people have is they create their offer first and so what we were able to the only reason that I back that offer number one it was a good offer number two if I only sold his offer and and I didn't make these real estate investors understand why they needed to learn this they wouldn't have bought it so if you can think about this for a second his offer primarily those people on there were confused because he was talking about marketing he was talking about sales he was talking about attention he was talking about like creating a digital product all this crap that my real estate investors do not care about they don't get niched down they don't know they he's talking to digital marketers people build courses the people like Russell's world right the clickfunnels world which is none of my people they're just they just they don't they don't use that stuff they're directly they're going directly to a seller they're buying their house and they're fixing up and selling it they don't understand that they have to be really good marketers so what I did was like and people need to start with their avatar first that's step one it's like understand who you're serving and get really detailed there and then figure out like your non-negotiables what you're willing to do what you're not willing to do and then figure out where those people hang out and what kind of media you can talk to them in and then create your offer like don't create the offer first because you're usually serving just you're creating something that you think that you want but the audience might not want it and so we do the offer like last and then we take all of our non-negotiables and things like that and then build it into the offer and so I we did it backwards and I said would my people buy this and I was like no like right now they will not buy this my my real estate investors I could spend hundreds of thousands of dollars getting a ton of opt-ins but they will not buy this course some of them will buy it because I tell them to and that's where everybody else got went wrong they were telling their audience to buy it and their credibility only bought a certain level of conversion yeah I knew that I had no credibility with the audience that helped me and then I wanted all these new people and I wanted I wanted grants offered to pay for to build my list and then I'll convert them down the road like I'll sell something to build your list I hope you're listening to this this is genius stuff yeah and our opt-ins with his face on it were like if you've tried to run an ad with my face on it like nobody knows who the heck I am and so if I can put me next to him then I can get in front of people way faster and so we so then we figured out how do I get my audience to buy this offer because I thought it was really and also I believed in it I thought it was good for them yeah so if because if I don't if I don't believe in it if it's not something that I would buy and I bought it like I paid a thousand dollars personally to buy it because he didn't give it to us for free so I was like if I'm gonna buy it then I'm gonna be able to tell other people to buy it and I watched every single I watched it catch me if you can you guys know this movie yeah of course in our caprio when he was the real guy the real guy spring out again yeah yeah when frank was doing this is like based on a true story somebody asked him how he how he was able to teach the college level courses that he was teaching and he just said I just read one chapter ahead yep I was able to read one chapter ahead so I just the whole time I was just reading one chapter ahead I watched the I attended the trainings I watched the videos of the course and then I was able to teach the people my application to their business because I knew their business so I think people get amazing a lot of times yeah super smart bill we could we could talk for hours about this I have so many other questions too about events we're gonna definitely have to have you back but here's what I want to do before we go tell us uh where they go especially for the youtube channel I know sevenfigureflipping.com is also another place where's the best place for people to opt into your stuff and find you yeah so if you're interested in real estate I have a podcast called seven figure flipping podcast it's a great place to kind of learn more about me I talk about everything from my wife asking me for a divorce to my kids to real estate to business things like that but I would say the you we talked about youtube so the bill allen youtube channel is very new it's exciting Russell's going to be on there soon doing an interview in the airplane and so we do the same thing on instagram but there's something that I'm working on right now that's probably my favorite thing and it's it's a membership that we're doing for entrepreneurs and it's so cheap like it's I want thousands and thousands of people in there and we're calling it the profit pilots so it's like my favorite thing is is helping other people make a lot more money so um that's where the youtube channel is kind of directing to and a lot of what I'm doing is serving more more business owners and just helping them kind of understand the numbers and the data and the science of their business because you guys are people are great marketers and salespeople but they just don't know the operational side and the number side and they think it's they don't want to learn that stuff but you have to as a business owner you have to know the numbers you have to know the data and you have to know your finances so that's probably my favorite place and the profit pilots.com it's uh it was it's like 97 bucks a month and I coach in there once a week like full time so that's where you talked about real so you're creating a lot of video content where can people go to check those out yeah my instagram page uh at bill alan rei on instagram is uh is the place we put some of them on facebook but i'm really kind of focusing on instagram I think there's a lot of um I I just I want to learn something new I suck at instagram so I'm learning that right now and it's been growing it's been growing pretty steadily and I love some of the I just I just did one because I get these questions like how do you go bathroom in the airplane when you're flying four and a half hours so I just did one that was like the most fun real I ever made was this is how I go pee in the airplane very interesting love that stuff like it's usually it's usually more business content that this is the most fun one I've done so far it's like when we were going to pick up we're gonna launch one that's like I flew to montana for chic balay so yeah kind of like fun awesome well I mean this conversation alone was probably a peek into all the different things that you talk about and it was great to learn more about your business and then talk a little bit about farm and farming and who knew that you would be teaching people on this podcast alone how to be a great affiliate so yeah it's been a lot of fun you're the man Bill we appreciate you and we'll talk to you soon thanks take care
