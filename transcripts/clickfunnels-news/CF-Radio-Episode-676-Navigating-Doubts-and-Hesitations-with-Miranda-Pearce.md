Here are your hosts Laura Demetrius and Chris Cameron. Hello and welcome back to click funnels radio. I'm Laura Demetrius joined as always by my wonderful co-host Chris Cameron. Chris how's it going? Oh it's best day of my life. Thanks for asking. That's a total lie but if every day is the best day of your life like it's gonna be great. I had a buddy of mine who used to say that all the time and I got annoying but that's a great way to be right every day being the best day of your life. I guess if you keep saying it you'll eventually believe it right? Maybe. Well today we are joined by Miranda Pierce. She's gonna be on stage this year at Funnel Hacking Live and we're super excited to hear about the awesome things that she's gonna be talking about. I personally loved the pitch that she gave for seeing if she was gonna win one of the spots of speaking at Funnel Hacking Live and she used the term with the blood of your enemies and I was like I am already like hooked. I am hooked. That was the best hook. I loved it. I watched it and now she's gonna be speaking and I can't wait for it. So welcome. It's my deep honor. Awesome. So can you just start by giving us a little bit of your backstory? Okay. Should I tell you a little bit about how I came to have funnels in my life? Yes. Tell us all about what brought you here. Okay so you can probably hear from my accent that I am in England and it's funny because my husband and business partner Tim, he was actually in Russell's original potato gun funnel. He was in the funnel. How many people can say that? How cool is that? I know. I know but we didn't do anything with funnels. We started our business. We have a brick and mortar med spa and a training company as well but we didn't do anything with funnels until 2019 and I discovered Russell from his 10x speech at Grant Cardone's conference. Was this the one in Vegas or Miami, Miranda? The first one. The $3 million one. You know where he comes from? Oh my goodness. And I saw it on YouTube and I remember exactly where I was. I was driving the kids to a swimming pool in Manchester, UK and I was listening and I was just totally transfixed. Like who is this guy? He is clearly a genius and when I got back from taking the kids, I immediately texted my business partners, we need to do funnels. Oh my goodness, we need to do funnels. And I don't know whether it's still there. Click the link in the YouTube description and sign up to the coaching program with Maura. I don't know if you know Maura, she's one of their amazing coaches. She's the best. Yeah, I love her and she helped me through because I said to myself, how are we going to use these amazing funnels? This God is telling me to use funnels and we did have some e-learning at the time, but we weren't really pushing it that much. So I said, I just want to do this by myself. Now, business partners are busy and no one else is particularly on board, but I'm like, I'm going to go. Well, that's one question I had. If I get in or out for a second, like I went through a similar thing, okay, where you watch Russell, this happens all the time and I think this is going to be key for our listeners. People get passionate about this and that we've got to go do funnels. But then sometimes there's a roadblock and sometimes it's a business partner. Sometimes it's a family member. How did you navigate that? Did your business partner jump on board initially or were they hesitant? How do you get through that? To be honest, Chris, I just did it anyway. I think I hope that my speech at The Walking Live is going to inspire people to walk away and prove to, first of all, themselves and then the doubters in their life that these things work. You've got to be sneaky and just go for it. Of course, I got permission from my finance director to use the money for the coaching for Morag, but she was kind of like, oh, yeah, yeah, okay, fine. And then I had to put that effort in. Anyone listens to this now, please know that the buck stops with you. You've got to prove it. You've got to get out there, be inspired, take this moment of inspiration and just implement. So that's the answer to that question. I love it. We've been going with your story. Yeah. I had some serious adversity that actually really got me to be serious about funnels. So I had this little event, a little mindset event that I was doing just with my audience. I only wanted to sell about a hundred tickets and I thought, right, this is going to be my test bed. So Morag and I created the funnel and we sold this event, but the price wasn't very much. And, you know, it bundles, I'll be honest, in that moment didn't massively help me because I was selling to my audience. I was doing Facebook lives. You know, I could have sold out that event anyway. But here's what happened next. In 2017, in England, there was a terrible disaster in East London where 74 people died in a tower block. It was a residential tower block and it just went up in flames and it was just, you can just imagine, hideous. And that was the Grenfell Tower disaster. Because of that, the regulations changed. So every building that had the cut, I don't know whether you guys call it cladding or siding, that basically the outside of the building, it was faulty. And that was the reason those people died. So we at Skinviva, my Med Spa, we owned a building with a lot of cladding. And we got hit by the government with a hundred and sixty thousand pound bill, which is about $200,000 out of nowhere since 2019. And we were just scrambling around like, what are we going to do? By the way, that bill had to pay that. Just pay it. Just a liability, get nothing from it. Because there was no, no one was at fault when they made our building. They were, they were according to the regulations, but then the regulations changed. And little did you know at that time that the following year was about to get a lot harder, I'm sure. Exactly. That was another inflection point for our funnels. Anyway, so when, so I had this little event going on, I sold the, I sold the tickets using a funnel and I turned to my business partners and I was like, guys, I need to make some money at this event as well. And so I said to Tim, who's my husband, who's now he's like a world-renowned aesthetic doctor, but then we didn't have much of an audience. And I said, you have got to sell your e-learning from stage at my event. And so he created what turned out to be a webinar. And he sold from stage. He closed 40% of the room and I was like, Four zero. First, first one to many from stage. Is he using perfect web webinar script? Of course. Yes. Love it. So that was the moment because my little funnel that he just didn't really, it wasn't needed really, but that was like, Oh my goodness, this thing works. So we made 20,000 pounds towards the 160. Yeah. It was impactful. And then we were like, Right, this is a webinar. We need to do this. And we started doing the webinars. And then the next crazy thing that happened, which would have happened to you guys as well, is the 21st of March, 2020. And I closed my business as doors. So the vast majority of that time, the vast majority of our income was coming from the brick and mortar. And I don't know what it was like for you guys, but in England, the lockdowns were super stringent. You can just imagine, we're very compliant in England, you know, very rule oriented. And, you know, we just weren't going out of our houses. Once a week, I went to the supermarket and that was it. And so we had no income. And I was like, Right, that's it. Close the doors. I don't have a cry. And I'm like, I'm going back to my house. And we are going to smash this e-learning. We are going to use funnels. And guess what, guys? I had just been to Funnel Hacking Live January 2020. So everyone listen to this now. Go and immediately buy your funnel Hacking Live tickets because that changed my life. I have funnelhackinglive.com. Two months, two months before the pandemic hit. So then what? So we started selling our e-learning that we already had. And just bearing in mind, we'd sold like little bitty, bitty, bitty, the 20 grand was by far the biggest that we'd sold. And we made, using funnels, one million pound in that first four months of the lockdown, actual lockdown. And bear in mind, we're a B2B business. Those people's businesses were closed as well, but they still bought off us because of the power of funnels. Close, burst, and even pandemic, launching something in a funnel for the very first time, using webinars and e-learning. And you made one million pounds in four months. Like that, what a testimony. And you can now, and now you're brandishing that thing over your left shoulder, this two comma club award, well-deserved. You know what is interesting? I love, it's kind of the Phoenix story, right? I mean, you rise from the ashes and over and over, we see this pattern, right? Of entrepreneurs, a lot of times when things got hard and they pivot, that's when they had their biggest breakthrough. Absolutely. They say that diamonds, well, obviously diamonds are not formed unless they have the pressure. So anyone listening now, if you are feeling a little bit inspired by Russell, by me, whatever, but you've got something bad coming down the line, like the recession or the impact of COVID or something bad in your personal life, like take action because you will shock yourself. And that's where confidence comes. It comes from action. So I love this. Yeah. I mean, one thing, the one question that I have too is now, you learned all that going through. I want to know what you're doing right now with funnels that you are so passionate about and that is crushing it. Like, what is the main thing? Is it the webinar funnel? Can you give us maybe some ideas around that? Like when do you, when do you promote and how long is the webinar? What's your follow-up sequence like? So we are, it is still webinars. So we have three webinars that we run and we still do them weekly. So we have, you know, we don't, we don't, they're not on demand webinar. And yeah, they're about three live a week. Are they all in the same day or three different days? Different days. We don't always do them live. But Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So we, I mean, in answer to your question, like, what is the webinar like? It's like expert secrets. So just follow everything that Russell says. And I want to shout out as well another in a circle member, Danny, who is, he's French Canadian and he really helped me actually double my webinar conversion. Really? Based, yeah. Based on, he took a look at my webinar and he said, just like, change this, this and this. And so Danny's your man, the webinar whisperer, if you need. Danny is one of the most delightful people on the planet. He has this contagious energy where Heather, he goes and, and he's got chops. The guy knows what's up. And that brings up such a great point too about people just in the click funnels ecosystem is we see people who, you know, like you see success after a few months of launching a funnel and they make that two common club award in their first year, but they still can rely on the community and other inner circle members or anyone in the Facebook group to give them feedback or advice willingly because everybody here seems to want to support one another and the amount of help that people are willing to give and the value that they're willing to add for the other people to, you know, really elaborate or expand on their funnels a little bit more or see a little bit more success or increase their conversion rates. Like it's so cool to see that help happening within the community. That's what Russell's created. And it was so interesting to me when I, because it's a big journey for me going to Boise twice a year, you know, I've taken three flights and it's a big, it's a big for everyone probably. But the point is that when I got there, it was like I was just seeing all my friends because Russell had created the culture of relaxed, lovely, like family oriented. So absolutely. I think that the culture in click funnels is the main thing. Yeah. So you, you're doing webinars. You said you have three different ones. Have you considered or have you ever greened any of them yet? Or are you thinking about it? We're thinking about it. Yeah. In fact, I recently got Dave Lindemann's help because, and in a circle, by the way, you didn't, you guys didn't ask me to sell in a circle, but seriously, like that's the best $50,000 you'll ever spend in your life. We're on year two and it was a no brainer to just, just go, go in there again. But Dave is the crow expert and I spoke to him. He has, he, I think Russell like pays into for his time or whatever. And he helped me and I now have a sales project manager, Natalie, and she is implementing that kind of thing. So we're just looking all across the funnels and just trying to optimize every little squeeze, every better juice out of it. I love it. Another shout out to an inner circle member. Dave is the man, Dave. He knows what we're talking about. He calls everybody, babe. So can you tell us a little bit about traffic? Are you getting most of your traffic from ads or are you doing anything else organically? What, what are you seeing that's working? I'd say like when I came out of the womb, I was very much an organic gal. Like it's in my nature to show up and just build a community, love the online community. Oh my God, I'm so like protective of my Katie is my dream customer. She's a nurse, a meds bar owner, and she is a bit doubtful about herself. She doesn't want to put herself out there. And my course is about helping her show up on social. So that's my nature. Like I, when I first built my brand, so we've been going since 2008, but I didn't start my Instagram until 2016. And I didn't monetize it one penny until 2021, when I created my first course and I launched with less than 10,000 followers, less than 8,000 people on my list. And I sold $600,000 in the in three days in the launch, because they, I built up such a weight of trust and love for my audience. Honestly, they're like my best friends. And like I meet them, I love them, I would do anything for them. And so I would say organic is wonderful if you can do that. Of course, you don't need it. But I think the combination of that with the direct response ads and all of that as well is just like this perfect. It's kind of like Russell Brunson and Gary Vee, in a marriage, like that's the perfect solution. I love that. And it's great that you had even just a little bit of a organic social following on Instagram, because I think the people who know and love you and trust you and have seen you, be honest and put out content on there, like the conversion rates, I'm sure are way more significant coming from people who have been following you on Instagram for a few years versus doing paid traffic. They know who you are. If they're interested in what you've been delivering on social media, they're probably way more likely to convert. And again, you mentioned trust and they already trust you. So that is huge to already have, even if it's just a small following on social. One thing I love about this is so many times people say, okay, well, will a funnel work for me? And especially in a brick and mortar situation. Now, what you've done is you've proved it not only for yourself, but now a large portion of your business is helping other med spa. So this is like skin health, everything else will people come into a spa and get treatments. And now you're teaching, is that right? You're teaching other spa owners to do the same thing and giving them templates? So I don't teach them funnels yet. Okay. So that I'm sure we'll be coming down the line. So I teach them how to do organic social. Got it. And yeah, and that's actually incredibly appropriate for our industry, because it's a very, very personal thing. You can imagine if you are going to get your, your lips done for the first time, and you're worried that you're going to look done, or maybe there's going to be a complication or something, you don't want to go to a big fat brand, you know, you want to come to someone who is your friend. And so my model is very much about showing up on social, of course, with competence, but also as a skin bestie. And so that's what I teach them. And then they can do for free, you know, without any paid traffic, they can build an amazing business. And a lot of my audience as well, they're not looking to smash it and like make millions of pounds that just want to be able to take their kids to Disneyland for the first time, you know, and they want to be able to work fewer hours. So that's who I serve. That's amazing. I love that. I want to know a little bit more about your journey here and becoming a funnel hacking live speaker. Was this something that you've had as far as like a goal? We just announced these last week, I don't know exactly when this episode will air, but that is for a lot of people in this industry, that is like the pinnacle achievement is to be invited to share the stage with Russell. Tell us a little bit more about that. Yeah, never mind the two comma club awards. So you just went across and the stage and collected that last year, right? Yes. Well, we have three, we'll pick up our third in September. So amazing. But we weren't allowed into the country in 2021. You guys wouldn't let us even in. So we haven't come to 2021. But oh, you are so right, Chris. Like I actually have an amazing story here. And I, if you guys go to my Instagram at Miranda Pierce mindset, you can see this. I documented this whole journey. So after 2020 January, for my hacking live, I was absolutely buzzing. You know, it was the first time we'd be to broad for, you know, conference. We were just loving it. And I every morning on my Instagram story, I walk around a field in England, it's very English. And I just do little mindset snippets and whatever. Anyway, I shared in January that I had had a dream on the flight home. I saw Marley Jacks, total queen at 2020. And I was like, I want to be like Marley. And so I said, I want to be up on that stage. And I documented it. This is, you know, three years ago, you can see the evidence. And then I just, you know, did everything I could to kind of show up. I told Morag, my ClickFunnels coach, and she was kind of like, you know, gunning for me, then we joined in a circle in 2021. And yeah, I just did everything I could. And then in Mexico, you know, we all went to Mexico, obviously in April or whatever it was this year, I, we were on the way to Chitzenica, the seventh wonder of the world with the kids and Tim and the car and everything, my father-in-law. And I was in the back of the referential car, writing a pitch to Russell for how I could speak at 2023. And I was literally writing it in my book. And I didn't know no one knew I was literally writing out the script. Anyway, I couldn't believe it. A few weeks later, Morag texted me, oh my goodness, have you seen Russell's letting people's pitch to speak at 2023? And I was so funny, my reaction. I was like a bit scared because I knew I had to step up to the plate. I had never pitched him. I said, I was going to do it. I was going to like DM on a boxer or whatever. And I never did it. And so now I was ready. I went straight into that studio, wrote the perfect script and yeah, the rest is history. I just had another one of those goosebumps moments, Chris. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That is so cool. I just love those manifestation stories where not only are you thinking about it, or is it a goal or it's maybe something that you've talked about, but like you wrote it down, you visualized it, you had that dream and like you literally made it happen. And it's so exciting to see the things that you're going to be talking about, how your journey happened and how like it just, it seems so rapid, right? Like you, we were all in, you got into this community, you went into the coaching, you got your two comic club award, you are doing live webinars still every single week. Like this is just so cool. And to know that you are going to be on the stage talking to so many people that are going to follow this same story a few years from now is just really, really powerful. You mentioned the word rapid, but not like, look at this journey Miranda from 2008, right? Okay, now we're going to get a little bit more into social and stuff in 2016. I want to say something to those who are listening. I deal with partnerships here at ClickFunnels and oftentimes I'll have people kind of say, this is why I need to speak at Funalhacking Live. And I think people need to understand that it's not just who you are or what you're doing. It's being in the community, being a go giver first. If you look at people who are speaking, like we have a few, you know, big, big names, but most of the people become big names like through our community that are speaking at Funalhacking Live. So it's a front door approach. It's giving in the community, it's joining into the masterminds. And then what people have to understand is a lot of times those are the tryouts, right? Everybody speaks at Inner Circle. Everybody has the opportunity and you know, sometimes they get invited to speak at Mastermind and Paradise. And that's really how Russell then kind of sees these people and notices them and says, this is what the community needs. And I think you're exactly that is what the community needs. Yeah, that's who I was inspired by in 2020, you know, and in 2022. Yeah, Marley, right. It was the Marley Jackson. It was those people, you know, it was, I mean, obviously you don't get me wrong. I love the headliners and to see Tony was phenomenal in 2020, but it's the people who are actually doing it. Those are people who you say when you see them, you're like, I can too. So that's what everyone needs to come to Funalhacking Live because you walk away believing in your bones that you can do it too. Yeah, I love that everything that you've shared with us, it feels like there was never anything holding you back. Like you didn't, even if you had maybe some self-doubts, like at every point you were like, I'm going to keep going, I'm going to keep going, I'm going to keep going. And you gave yourself permission to just go for it. And the fact that you were writing down a pitch to Russell just proves that you were like, I am willing, I am confident, and I'm going to make this happen. I have self-doubt every day, Laura. Like you can't, anyone who's up on stage or on these podcasts, like don't think that they are the finished article. We are all just monkeys in shoes. Like, seriously, you know, okay, so yeah, it was successful, but it's like every day you feel the fear and then you do it anyway, you know, and that's what I said. When, when more I sent me the link that Russell had asked for pitches, I was scared, like I didn't want to do it. I went straight onto an Instagram reel and said to my beautiful audience who I adore, I was like, guys, make me do this because I'm scared. Like, I know I have to do it, but I don't want to have to do it. But you cannot let excuses come in. You've got to go for your dreams and you've got because as well, self-doubt, the only way to smash that self-doubt is, there's an amazing Alex Moezy quote where he says, it's something like that you cannot get confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror. The only way you get confident is by giving yourself unimpeachable evidence over and over and over again that you are, you say you are, and those little actions, those little brave steps every day that you do showing up on social when you don't want to, you know, I don't know, maybe you've got acne or something and you don't want to show up, like do it anyway, because then you will get self-trust. Every single piece of success we ever see in the ClickFunnels world is because someone had just enough self-trust to take action. Yeah, there's definitely something to be said about that transparency too. And I see that now following you on Instagram and I'm like all in with everything that you're sharing and I love how you are willing to kind of expose yourself and share those valuable insights with your following. And I certainly know that everyone who sees you at Funnel Hacking Live this year is going to love that as well. Brandy, you've given some amazing golden nuggets too about self-belief to webinars to just do it, to pivoting. I mean, this is incredible. Before we go though, one, everybody go to funnelhackinglive.com and get your tickets. Like this is where you are going to see people like Miranda who are not necessarily overnight success stories that have put in the work, put in the time and an effort to do this. But Miranda, where can people follow you? I know that you mentioned Miranda Pierce mindset. Where else can they follow you? So I love me a bit of TikTok as well, same handle. To me, TikTok is the future. Today, Instagram threads started growing up already. I know. Russell follows me. Yes. So I'm all about the social and I have Facebook groups and things like that as well. But anyone who just wants to get a bit of my energy and like you said, Laura, I'm super transparent. I tell everyone everything that's going on in my mind. If you want to hang out with someone who is deeply flawed, but who's still doing it anyway, then come and find me on social. That's where I am. That's where I'm at. I love it. Well, we could talk to you forever. Thank you so much for being a guest and we're very excited to hear what you have to say. And I'm telling you, your life's going to change. You think you got followers now. Wait until after you speak of funnelhacking live. And I'm super excited for you. Thanks for joining us today. Thanks, Miranda. We'll see you in a couple months. Thank you.
