Here are your hosts Laura Demetrius and Chris Cameron. Welcome back to another episode of click fun radio. Join with me my well first off my name is Chris Cameron. Join with me as always is my co-host Laura Demetrius who unfortunately has been a little bit under the weather. What's up Laura? Yeah I'm doing all right. I've got this head cold and I feel like I don't usually sound this. I don't know if I sound worse in my own head or if it just sounds like I'm super stuffy to everybody else but I'm gonna try to limit myself a little bit more today but I do have a lot of exciting things I want to ask. You sound amazing. Don't even worry about it. You sound amazing. Well I am super excited for our guest today Kevin Anson. Kevin is best known for helping businesses conceptualize and create video ad creatives. He's actually done this. He's produced thousands of videos and ads for some of the biggest names over the last 19 years including Russell Brunson of course, Brent Rushard, Grant Cardone, Ty Lopez, Tony Robbins, Dean Grosciosi, Mike Tyson, just to name a few. Kevin what is up? Why is a roster? Like that is an insane roster of clients you've had. Yeah well I give a lot of the thanks to Russell to be honest. I mean Russell's a big deal and being able to work with him made a lot easier to introduce myself to these various other people be it backstage at different events or over email. However we're able to get introduced. Russell even introduced me to like Brent and Brushard and the guys at Kajabi and so I give a lot of thanks to Russell for sure but yeah it's been quite the journey over the last five years working with some really really cool clients and it's been a lot of fun. I love to recall a lot of these guests that I've met five years ago or more and Russell was doing a speaking gig down at what was it flip packing live in San Diego and Kevin that's where I first met you. That's when they first launched the One Funnel Way Challenge and we had the 30 Days Book and I remember watching you. This is how I know that Kevin Anson is not only obsessed with video but he's obsessed with internet marketing. He grabbed, I remember you grabbed his book and by the time the event was over you were like halfway through this book and you were like this book is gold. Do you remember that? I do remember that yeah and my son was there at the event too and he was probably you know seven years old and I was so excited to get a copy and give it to him and then Russell, I believe Russell signed it for him then they took a picture together but yeah I remember that. That's probably, is that the last time we saw each other in person or was it? Well I don't know. I think we ran into each other Funnel Hiking Live a couple times. Funnel Hiking Live yeah yeah. Or maybe TNC actually. Oh, Travelling Inversion yeah that's possible too. Yeah. Yeah that's right. Well I have to, I have to also notice you know you were worried a little bit about this having a video aspect and it probably won't for those who were listening but we may use some video stuff. We may cut this up and you were just saying that you were embarrassed because you usually don't have a bed in your office. What's going on with that? What kind of videos are you made over there? Yeah so I'm not making those types of videos but now we had some family over recently and we have four kids and four bedrooms well in addition to the master bedroom and the only other bedroom for the family to stay in was my office because I have a pretty big office so we had to put a bed in the office and so now I have a bed in my background for those of you who can't see right now and so it's a little bit awkward when I get on Zoom calls. I'm like listen I don't usually have a bed in my office but it's temporary so we're making a joke out of it. I feel like everybody who works from home can relate to that at some point in their lives. At some point you're going to have like a guest or a bed or something you don't want behind you. Right yeah and I know you're talking about it too Laura. I've had plenty of kids toys in the background probably a dirty diaper at some point you know it's the list goes on for sure. Yes yeah that's why I finally got this office. I had to get away from the constant distractions of baby and toddler things behind me so I can relate. I actually want to talk about something for those of you who don't already know obviously we had mentioned Kevin is going to be featured speaker at Funnel Hacking Live and he is going to be with a cluster of other folks talking about the attractive character and if you don't already know the attractive character is kind of a big part of what Russell has been teaching and what the theme of Funnel Hacking Live will be this year which is the linchpin model and I'm really excited to learn from you because I know there's going to be a lot of people that are like I think I'm the attractive character of my own business if not I should find one like what does this mean for me what does it mean for my brand how do I promote that can you talk a little bit about what your talk will be like and how doing these video ads will be really helpful for somebody who is an attractive character of their business. Yeah absolutely so something that we found after doing thousands of ads over the last you know five years I've been doing videos since 2004 so it's been a while but only in the last five years or so I got really heavily into video ads and something that we've discovered after running so many ads and testing so much stuff is that when a person is on camera representing the product or service that they're trying to sell or trying to bring awareness to that those ads typically do a lot better than something where it's just you know maybe it's a voiceover maybe there's just music in there and so when you have the opportunity or you have the skills or you have the desire to be on camera to represent your brand it is like the best thing that you can do and it doesn't mean that you have to hire a camera crew and hire an editing team and do all that crazy stuff you really just have to put yourself out there get on camera and frame your messaging in a certain way to get people to you know to click on your ad and to actually learn more about you and so when you are the attractive character you're putting yourself out there you're energetic you know you're excited you're passionate about what it is that you're trying to share with the world then you know it resonates with people and so they want to make that connection that personal connection with another human being it's kind of like getting on a zoom call with somebody and you've ever done that where you know maybe you have your camera on but the other person doesn't for whatever reason yeah and just you don't make that connection with that person even though you still have a great call but you would have preferred to see their face and go through that meeting so that way you can kind of build that connection you build rapport right I always assume somebody's doing something weird right like you just woke up your hair's not done or something you know or you got a bed in the back or I don't know what it is but I always assume something weird's going on like if they don't have it on and when you talk about I'm just joking but when you when you talk about the attractive character I know some people are the second that a camera turns on Kevin they freak out they like freeze even if they're somewhat the attractive character whether they have a book or anything but when when the video element gets involved sometimes people freeze and I think a lot of times practice and just doing it over and over is a good answer but what do you have to tell people who are like I freeze on camera I'm scared of camera I trip over my words what would you tell somebody like that? You stole my question Chris. Oh! We're same way. I love this though because I do feel like it is something that people just get like stage fright or they're like a deer in headlights and even people who have authority feel that way so I would love to know what your best advice is for people who are like I don't know if I can get in front of the camera. So I mean we've all been there right where the first time I ever created a video online I have a YouTube channel which you can find and you'll probably make fun of my hair but the first video that I ever made on YouTube I mean my energy was low I wasn't very exciting to watch and I learned from watching myself and I thought that's the advice that I tell people is to pull out your smartphone record some videos even if it's in your car because that's where you have the most privacy and just because you record a video on your phone doesn't mean you have to show it to anyone I mean you can delete it when you're done but practice recording videos of yourself see what you look like and see how you sound see how your gestures are just get a sense of that and then once you get to a point where you're more comfortable with recording videos and you think you know maybe this is good enough to share with the world or share with share with your spouse or share it with a friend and say hey what do you think of this video I just recorded give me your honest feedback the more times you do it the better you're going to get I mean that's just how anything works in life right and so the other advice I would give people is to to really have a lot of energy on camera because the way that you speak to a human being when you're sitting in a room together is different than where than when you're on camera I mean you just really the easiest way to do it is just to speak really loud I mean my wife gives me a hard time because when I record my record my course content she'll be outside like maybe walking by my door and she's like oh my gosh like I could hear you all the way downstairs are so loud it sounds ridiculous but then when I get the course out there I've never ever ever once heard someone say to me you had way too much energy on camera you sound ridiculous like it's just it's natural it feels good like if you've ever been in the room when Russell is recording a video or an ad if you've been in the office with him when he's doing that it does sound weird but to the other person on the receiving end it sounds totally awesome like hey this guy's got a lot of passion he's excited I want to hear more about what he has to offer and so yeah just talk loud record lots of videos on your phone until you're comfortable and the more times you do it the better you'll get I think that's great advice in fact I don't know anybody who would want to go through several days of course content watching videos from someone who is speaking monotone and is not excited about what they're teaching it's just the last thing you want you want someone who is obviously excited about what they're doing so I think that's exactly and one of the things that helps me too is to like I'll even put a post-it note on maybe it's my camera or my laptop where I have my slides and I'll just you know say something like you know make sure to smile because I forget to smile when I'm doing course content or when I'm doing ads so remind you the resting face yeah it's like a little happy face I'll just write it down there so it's a constant reminder and then also I will bold or cap capitalize the words that I want to emphasize because if you ever listen to a song and if you hear the same beat for three minutes you get bored and you check out right so that's why songs have highs and lows movie trailers have highs and lows there's a moments of emotion there's moments of excitement it's to keep the audience engaged and they also don't know what to expect next and so that's the same with your voice so your voice is your instrument so you really have to kind of you have to emphasize certain words say words louder and then you get quieter depending on what you're talking about so definitely you have to have variations in your voice otherwise people check out and they don't want to hear what you have to say so that's another way to kind of keep that excitement going bolding certain words and and really speaking louder at different parts in what you're trying to deliver yeah that's great Russell teaches that he teaches that a lot with you know I used to do a lot of speaking for Russell you know go around to different spots and speak and when we train different speakers whether it's on stage or whether you're on camera to actually go to an uncomfortable place of excitement right because it's going to come across normal to them he always teaches that and if you watch also to another thing that you said watching yourself if you pay attention to the best athletes they go back and they watch film as weird as that is if you're talking into a camera you know to go back and watch yourself but you're going to find out oh my gosh you're going to be your own worst critic but it's also going to help you a ton you know then you're full confident showing to somebody if you like it chances are a lot of other people are going to like it too because you're your own worst enemy yeah like for instance I blink way too much when I'm interviewing people and I every time I watch it back I'm like Laura stop blinking stop blinking but you know what can't help it if the haters want to say something they can I'm a blinker now everybody's gonna notice I never noticed that but see we are we're totally our own worst enemy now you've worked like I said at the beginning we had a total rolodex of these people that you've worked with do you have like in your mind was there a super bowl like project for you was there something that was like your favorite project that you've worked on that you'd like to tell us about I would say just because of the notoriety of this guy we were able to work on some ads for Mike Tyson he came out with 12 rounds with Mike Tyson which he also used click funnels to uh to use Rudy Rudy Moore was involved Mark Lac was involved yeah I remember that yep and so we came into that project early um and we we weren't given a lot of assets for the project which I guess it kind of also helps to make it one of my favorites because it's not like they were recording you know 15 different scripts for video ads they literally they had nothing to work with for video ads and so they gave us the vsl which was the video sales letter which was this five or 10 minute long raw clip of Mike Tyson talking on camera it was supposed to go on the landing page to get people to buy the product and that's all we were given the work with so we had to go in to the vsl and pull out specific nuggets inside of the vsl and turn that into video ads and so it took a little bit of work because you know like I said the the videos weren't recorded specifically specifically specifically for video ads and so it was a challenge and so we took that and we're able to turn it into 78 different video ads assets and so they they ran that with uh with a bunch of traffic but it was just a really cool project to work on because when I was seven years old I had a cat and I named him Tyson because um he I don't know he always just liked to play and he would like always punch at me and stuff and so I was like this cat's name is Tyson for sure so and I've been a fan of Mike Tyson my entire life I had Mike Tyson's punch out on Nintendo when I was a kid yeah and yeah so then to get to work on his campaigns later on in life it was just really cool for me and so that's probably one of my my favorite projects that I've had to work on so we we got a hold of a we got a hold of a picture uh and send it over to Russell I have it somewhere I have to box it to you of Mike in a funnel hacker shirt no way which is super cool like Mike Tyson is a funnel hacker I thought that was so cool well you mentioned you mentioned you know that you didn't have a lot of this stuff for video ads do you walk into a situation a lot of times where it isn't scripted I mean some people can pull this off some people can't are there certain elements is it script is it background is it story like what are the elements that make good video ad creatives they're a list like how do you do that so this is some of the stuff that I'm going to get into at funnel hacking live but there's 10 ingredients that we look at when we are creating video ads for our clients and there's 10 ad types that we look at and the best way that I could explain it is it's kind of like when you order a sandwich on a menu there's different sandwiches and each sandwich has different ingredients inside of it right and so the ingredients that we have inside the video ads you don't always put all 10 ingredients inside every video ad that you do so that's why we have the different ad types right so like for example you might have an ad that has a lot of pain points in it it's got pain points it's got social proof which is testimonials it's got you know results talking about what this product or service can do for people and then you plug that into the different ad types so I'm not going to get into all 10 ingredients unless you guys want me to I can kind of touch on all 10 of them I think just tease us because I know you're going to cover it for my hacking live yeah and I mean I I do have a free download for you guys who are listening so I don't know if you guys want me to mention that now or we can talk about it later but yeah tell us what that URL is and then we can talk about it later too yeah I created a specific page for the listeners of this it's at kevinansson.com slash cfr stands for clickfunnels radio so get that you're going to download a pdf and it's going to show you all 10 of the ingredients but the um these are 10 ingredients that I've discovered after making thousands of ads like I would we would make an ad for clickfunnels or someone else and I would keep the notes app open on my phone and I would just start making notes of the different ingredients that we put in ads that we're working I'm like okay we made this ad like it started out with a pattern interrupt like that's that's got to be something that's really important we should really start out all of our ads with pattern interrupts or you know we should identify the people like make sure that we say what's a good example of a pattern interrupt a pattern interrupt could be something where you know I have a wallet that catches on fire and so I flicked the little flint on the wallet and it catches on fire or you could be waving at the camera or you know you could show like you could have a fidget spinner you know whatever it is just like really into like the weird goofy things within those first couple seconds or like slime or you know the things that kids are into and just some weird stuff but then yeah rustle rustle a guy doing pancakes once yeah I mean even if it's irrelevant to your content it's like oh well it did its job it got your attention now you're watching now you're listening now you're reading subtitles yeah exactly and it's interesting to see too because I'll watch ads online all the time because I geek over this stuff and I'll see an ad on Facebook and it's got like 20 million views but I always notice it has like this weird pattern interrupt in the beginning where it's literally like somebody taking a hot knife and like cutting a piece of soap and it's like what like what is that has nothing to do with anything but it's one of those yeah it's a satisfying video and like it's the first two seconds and then people watch the rest of the video it's the weirdest thing so that's the pattern interrupts and that's a a neuro linguistic programming an nlp term where it's something that breaks people out of their normal everyday patterns because when you're scrolling through Facebook if you see see a bunch people you know where you see talking heads people talking on camera it gets a little bit mundane and boring but when you see somebody cutting through a bar of soap or they have something on fire it makes you stop and so it's stop it breaks up your pattern it interrupts your pattern so those things are really powerful and that's one of my favorite ingredients on the ingredient list and we always fascinating I feel like we could talk about that all day we could yeah I know it's so powerful and so but like I said to keep it simple I mean you could wear a funny pair of glasses you could put on a wig you could wave at the camera you could spin around in a circle whatever it is but starting out your video that way is really really important to give people's attention and so there's 10 ingredients that we're always looking at so consider that you know the meat the cheese the lettuce all the stuff and then we have our ad types so those are different combinations of ingredients like I talk about sandwiches and so there might be an ad type where it's just all about social proof right so you have you start out with a pattern interrupts you talk about results you talk about social proof and then you have your cta and so that one is called the the social proof ad right so that's an ad type and so we have 10 ad types in total that we're always looking at and these are proven ad types that we've discovered over the years after geeking out over this stuff and so those I mean we just stick to what works we stick to the ad types we stick to the ingredients and once you do that and you know you you get good on good on camera and you stick to the ingredients stick to the ad types you're going to start to see some results so it's really cool stuff it's it's just how humans are hardwired it's like when you're watching videos online and you're thinking you're maybe you're in kind of purchase mode and you're seeing some ad about you know I don't know if it's like some maybe it's like a cleanse like a juice cleanse or something right psychologically like you want the ad to talk about certain things because it's going to check off boxes in your head even though you don't know what's happening like does this thing work for other people you know is it getting results to other people talk about it what pains is it going to solve is it safe um you know can I get it fast is it a affordable cost whatever it is like all the objections and things that people have in their mind as long as you address those things in the ad which is what these ingredients and these ad types are designed to do you are unconsciously you're just driving that person to the sale because you're like so you're checking off all those boxes yeah well it sounds like your experience you know speaks volumes and you know these are tried and true methods and I imagine anybody is uh going to gain a lot of value out of these 10 ingredients so can you just tell us that that URL one more time so our viewers and listeners can go grab that of course yeah so go to kevinansson.com slash cfr and if for whatever reason the vote the web's domain doesn't work I've had some issues with go daddy recently I don't know what it is but you might have to type in the www.kevinansson.com slash cfr awesome I'm going to grab those 10 ingredients myself yeah well you know what I've noticed too and and I never noticed right before getting into funnels and I see it more and more and I could probably say within the last two days I have purchased something through a funnel that started with a video ad creative like scrolling through Instagram one was like a toilet cleaner one was like a special shampoo that I was like oh yeah I'll look at this and it was exact that so talk maybe about you mentioned call to action you mentioned you know kind of the hook with the um with the pattern interrupt but then where do they go from there like how does that work is it usually just dropping into like you know if it's a coaching product like how are you using the funnels in the call to action so are you talking about how we use the the funnel inside of the actual video ad like maybe we have yeah so yeah so what do you do where basically have the video come in right people are engaged and then where do they go from there there's some type of call to action what do they do so typically the video ad is driving somebody to a landing page and so got you one of the things that we've discovered is that if you can have congruency between the video ad and the landing page that is a huge um that's it's a huge win I mean people like to see that so it's kind of like if you have a video ad and you know you're sharing all these things that are red and then somebody gets the landing page and everything's green unconsciously they don't they don't feel that congruency like it just feels off like did I go to the wrong spot did I go to the wrong spot um and so it's really important to when you can to create congruency between and sometimes it could just be the messaging right like maybe it's the things that you are addressing in the video ad have to match the messaging on the landing page so if you're talking about you know here's how to homeschool your kids and then they get to the landing page and it talks about you know how to develop a a curriculum um you know for something else it's it doesn't use the word homeschool and you talk about maybe it's curriculum or something it has to be the same and so am I am I a victim of poor split testing right yeah so make make sure there's congruency between your messaging or the colors or the branding whatever it is and then also another thing that we found too is that if you're recording video ads and you're you know hopping on your smartphone you're recording a video ad showing the landing page is could it could actually help your conversions quite a bit too so what you can do is in the video yeah in the video you could pull out your laptop smart and just flip your camera around and say so you're going to go to this page right here all you need to do is enter your name and email and then on the next page we're going to give you our free download so make sure to check it out so you're automatically showing people where they're going to be going smart so that way when they get to the landing page they're like oh i'm in the right place all right cool i i need to get this thing all i have to do is enter my name in my email and i get what i want that's great so you also just showed them how how to do it which kind of gets in another one of my ad types which is the demonstrator ad which is you're demonstrating how the process works and like in click funnels case like we've done a lot of ads for them where it's demonstrating some of the benefits and features of the software and how it works because when people it's kind of like buying a new pair of shoes and you don't ever get to see the pair of shoes like why would you ever buy a pair of shoes online but you don't get to see what they look like first i know it's an extreme example but a lot of software companies they don't demonstrate the software and how it works and what it looks like before people actually get to it and then you know it makes them want to buy it so anyways going off a little bit of a tangent there but showing people the landing page is is important too yeah very cool you can see how that that makes sense you know having a demo of something you don't want to sign up for something if maybe if you do know what the results are but you like if you don't understand what the features are and if it's going to serve you and your business why are you going to sign up for it so being able to see the the insides of it and kind of like you know remove the curtain there i'm sure is extremely valuable yeah and i mean another example is people sell a lot of online courses right so but they never show what the course looks like like is it going to be high quality like what's it going to cover like maybe how many modules yeah how many modules how long is it going to take me what does the back end look like and so that's one of the things that i did personally for my course when i was running lots of traffic to it last year in the year before it was i would show people inside the course and show them what they get so it creates that familiarity as well you're demonstrating the product well okay so then what are they going to be from you at funnel hacking live so on these 10 ingredients at funnel hacking live it's still being developed as far as what i'm going to cover but it's going to be tapping into some of the ingredients some of the ad types some of the stuff that we've talked about here today how to be an attractive character inside of your video ads and just using like you know really just using your smartphone because just keeping it as simple as possible for people without having to become some crazy advanced professional editor but how you can use your smartphone to create video ads i mean if you look at guys like dean grassy oce or frank kern or even sometimes russell they will pull out their smartphone and record ads on their phone and then they will send it to their ad buyers on their ads team and they'll run the ads without this is without captions without titles or without anything on there and the thing about them though is they are really good marketers and they know what to say inside of their video ads which is why they do really well and it's not like you know 100 of the time when they create a video ad on their phone it's going to crush but they know really well like they know how to speak copy and russell knows how to speak copy and he knows what people want to hear inside of their video ads and it's usually a lot of these ingredients that i'm sharing with you guys and so just knowing those things and knowing what to say inside of your video ads versus just going out there and winging it it's going to get you a lot further ahead a lot faster awesome i can't wait to hear about it it's going to be really fun and exciting for our entire audience and anyone listening to this i think they're going to gain a ton of value from it i think it's really cool and one thing that i did want to bring up is i went to your site and you have a ton of content you've got courses and you've got a challenge and some higher ticket things for going in depth with like youtube ads and stuff which i think is fantastic but i personally signed up for your five day challenge because it's free and i know that i have a lot to learn about ads so can you just tell us a little bit about that in case people want to go check it out yeah definitely so there's a a course in there where it's five days takes you through some of the different stuff that some of the stuff we talked about here today but it goes more in depth like the pattern interrupt and you know the different ingredients that you need to be putting inside of your videos and some other resources and tools and things that we use to create videos for some of our clients and so it's free i mean you can't you can't beat it and the i don't know if you guys want the link for that um or you guys can put it in the show notes but there's a link for for the challenge we'll be sure to include that in the uh in the summary yeah so it's it's definitely something that you're going to want to check out um and you'll learn a lot you learn a lot about just like the psychology behind what's going into video ads and just video online in general i mean even if you watch organic content on instagram or tiktok or facebook a lot of the people who have a really deep understanding of what people want to hear and see in their videos they're using um some of the same ingredients that i talk about and so it's not like you know it's not like i invented this stuff right it's human psychology since the beginning of time but i just applied it to video ads so i know what needs to go into video ads and what doesn't but um you know it's it's been really fun to understand this stuff and you know taking the teachings from people like dan kennedy and russell brunson and just kind of mashing it all together into specifically video ads these ingredients are dialed in for video ads yeah um but there's of course more ingredients that you could be putting in other videos on organic stuff but these are the ones that we focus on and it works for us so yeah and you make it so approachable one last question too as we wrap up i'm gonna talk to you forever but i'm curious like we talk about a lot of these things that are good to put in videos is there anything where you'd be like in any circumstance do not ever ever do this um that is a great question i think my mind immediately goes to compliance because i'm always like oh you can't say this type of stuff i mean that's a great point it's it's obvious but it's like you know you can't say you can't make any guarantees that people are going to make money which is just something that you just don't do you know i guarantee you this is going to get you know make you so much money or it's going to change your life we're going to be able to quit your job things like that so we're always careful about how we word things like that but as far as video ads i think that if you're not if you're making a video where you're speaking on camera and you have your camera on a tripod and it's sitting there and you're just not very engaging and that exciting to watch it's probably not going to benefit you very much in the long run so i would definitely focus on being amazing on camera it's it's it's something that's going to set you apart from other people and then if you're not great on camera and you're still learning how to do it instead of having your camera on a tripod just kind of walk around the room walk around outside just so that you know the shot has movement versus sitting there in a boring office so do that but that's that's all i can think of i'll try to think of more for you but sorry what's that i there was kind of a trick
