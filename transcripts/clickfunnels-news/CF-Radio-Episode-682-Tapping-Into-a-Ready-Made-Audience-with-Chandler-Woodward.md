Here are your hosts, Laura Demetrius and Chris Cameron. Welcome back to ClickFunnels Radio. My name is Chris Cameron. Enjoyed with me as always is my co-host Laura Demetrius. Good to see you today, Laura. Thanks, Chris. It's good to be here as always. So this is super fun today because I feel like we're, we kind of have a full circle episode coming back. One of my favorite people on the planet is joining us today. Mr. Chandler Woodward. That's that name sounds familiar. It's because this is, and this is self-proclaimed, right, Chandler? Like not only Dave's oldest son, but I think favorite son too. Is that accurate? 100% proven. I mean, there's records on it too. We can find it. I'll make sure we send this to Jackson and the others, you know, Christian and Parker. Make sure that they hear that first. Totally. We'll have a debate on it. We can do the whole thing. You know, I, this is what I think is so cool when Russell wanted to, you know, kind of relaunch this and brought Laura and I on. I just thought it'd be so cool to have you on because here's the thing. I want to talk about Dave for a second. And then I want to jump into a lot of the things that you're doing as a businessman that are really unique. But we've all known Dave as, you know, the CEO of ClickFunnels. And now it's been what? Nine, 10 months since he passed. Yeah. Yeah. And it's nine next month. Yeah. Pretty, pretty wild. And I'll tell you, just it's been a gaping hole for us just as far as, you know, his leadership and he was such the heart and you've heard Russell do tributes and everything. And so we know Dave is the businessman. And I was honored when I came on about five years ago, I have, I have the chance to work directly under Dave for, you know, four years and fell in love with him. You know, not only as a person, but as a businessman. And so I'm curious. Here's the first question. Is since we know him as CEO of ClickFunnels, you know him as dad. And I would assume that he probably was a huge influence in you as an entrepreneur and everything else. Like, what was that like growing up with Dave Woodward as a dad? And how did that shape you? Yeah, absolutely. My dad was you see him on stage and you see him with his high energy, right? And like just, just giving everything he can to the people. And you see, you hear so many times of like two different types of personalities of people like, oh, what's their what's like their their home life look like, though? And I could like, hopefully say, I know my brothers and everyone else would come to say as well, like he was the exact same person you would meet on stage at events in the hallways as he was at home, where the most important person in the room was the person he was talking to. And no matter what, like it was crazy. Like, you know, you hear my dad was always my superhero. You know, he was the guy I looked up to and wanted to be and felt like he could overcome anything. And and so you have. And so when he was going through when he would go through life, you know, I see him as a superhero. And then I hear later on in my life when we're getting older and we're having more mature conversations, all the stuff he dealt with raising us, you know, financial troubles, things that were just like not working out. And I never would have guessed that was happening because he was giving us his life, giving us his time as much as he could. Like my number one memory of my dad, he wasn't home a lot. Like when I was up, you know, when we were when I was a teenager, you know, growing up as much as he was when he finally because he was trying to figure things out. And the crazy thing is he was doing tons of stuff in the real estate space. And he would this was my. So just I just learned how to drive. I was just turning 16. So it was like sophomore year, junior year of high school. And he would do these crazy flights where he'd be, you know, across the country doing some kind of seminar, doing something to do with real estate, take the earliest flight or latest flight he could to get back to see me before I go to school, before I do something. And I would go take him to the airport on my way to school and drop him off in that hour long drive. And this was, you know, either driving to school or he would even take a red-eye flight at night so he could just as spend as much time as he could. Where I, you know, it was 12 in the morning driving to LAX, you know, and we'd have this two hour long conversation, just me and him. And so he was just like, that was, you know, that was me growing up as he would give as much time and try to try to just separate, you know, get me in a space in my own brothers as well, where you could just have that one on one time with me, my mom, my dad, my brother's, all that. And so, yeah, he is, you know, he's better than life than I ever could think of. What a testament of his love for his family, too, to make that personal sacrifice of like taking a red-eye, which nobody wants to take a red-eye, especially after working your butt off and speaking with a bunch of people, just to have that hour with you in the morning of special time. And what, what a beautiful thing it is. I'm sure to look back on that now and know you, you got that time with him. Oh, 100%. I mean, like I have two young, two small kids, right? Like I'm close to the age. My dad is four. And the two kids I have right now, like they take so much energy out of me right now. Like four with the work, with everything. And so it was just like, you know, the more I get older, the more I realize how amazing my dad was. And so, yeah, yeah, those things. I love, I love hearing that. I'm going to tell you a story that I don't know that you've heard that I watched your dad. What one thing that I really respected about him is it didn't matter how good he was or how what position he was in, he was always self-aware. And trying to improve himself. And it's easy, right? Like you try, you get into these modes, we have these roundtables. And I want to say this was FHL, maybe, maybe 2019. Okay. And he was helping Steve Larson at his table. Right. And he was getting like a drink and he was be lining to like say, like, oh, Steven, you need something? And he wouldn't go get him like a drink and was on his way back. And somebody tapped him on the shoulder and he kind of turned. And he was like, oh, hey, one second. And then he kind of was going to go give that to Steve. And then I saw him take two steps. He took two steps and stopped cold and turned around and grabbed this person by their shoulders and was like, oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. I was in a hurry, but I wanted to say hi. And he said, so sorry if I walked past you. I was like, he had this moment where he just realized like, wait, this person came and they wanted to say hi to me because ClickFunnels has changed their life or anything and they had this amazing thing. And I think he handed me the drink and I went and grabbed it and gave it to to Steven. But one little moment like that taught me so much about your dad. Like people are in such a hurry to get somewhere, but the one person mattered to him. And even if it took two steps to like realize that, I was like, that was the coolest thing to see because don't we all have those moments in our life were so hyper focused like your dad on business and everything else. But he realized that taking a red eye flight meant that he could spend another hour or two with Chandler. And that's, I think, was one of Dave's superpowers is he would figure that out. And that wasn't easy for him. Sometimes he had to think that through and plan it out. But I respected that a ton about your dad. And I'm sure you have countless other stories that are similar to that. Tons, yeah. I think it was cool. So, you know, have you ever seen that like that last dance documentary with Michael Jordan, right? Where he's talking about, he's talking about like when he was playing in the league and they kind of talked about like how this year's, you know, these people and then be right now, like they would sit out on games and stuff. And so Michael Jordan was saying, like when he would go play a game, he would say, there's probably some kid in the stands and the nose bleeds who's like their whole life. They just want to come see Michael Jordan that day. And so he could never take a day off. And I felt like that was my dad every time of like at those events, especially like fun like in life, like my dad and the crazy things that my dad as well as like, he would never want it to be the front. Right. He was always trying to make other people in front. He never wanted that. And he kind of really needed the attention. But the people who were there, like he would, no matter who you were, he would try to like to make sure you were taken care of and that you had like just the greatest experience at an event at whatever it was. And it was just something that's so special where to this day, I'm like, that how like I get so I get so frustrated today. Like to this day of like, how do I be like you dad? Like, this is so insane to me. And obviously, people have their stories and, you know, my dad is not perfect. I know that by far, you know, but, you know, he would, there's no one more who would give their best every day than my dad, you know. And so it was just, it was crazy. That's beautiful. And when we had our episode with Russell, where he kind of set the expectation of the future of ClickFunnels Radio and what this means and how we get the honor of paying homage to your father and everything that he did for this podcast. What I love is that even though I never got to be in the same room as your dad, I get to see the legacy that he left in you boys and your family and in the company. So in a way, it's like he's still so present with us because of the impact that he made and we feel that and we see that in everything that happens. So I think that's what's it's it's such a beautiful thing because you mentioned he lived to let others shine and you don't have to be just like him or do the same things that he did or, you know, have the same business impact that he did. But he did what he did because he wanted others to shine. And I can see that so well in everybody that he every life that he touched and how important and how much he valued those relationships. So it's really cool that that carries on that lives with us. And it's still here at ClickFunnels and with everybody today. Oh, 100%. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it's been awesome just seeing there's a great as a it was interesting quote, like I don't know if you heard the Hermosi thing, like we talked about, like, you know, you pass away and like no knows who you are or whatever. And I remember I hear that the first time I was like, what? That sucks. Like that was crazy. And I still think like, you know, whoever will figure out what happens. But there's so like there's a people, though, if you do focus on like impacting people during their life, like they'll carry that experience on the rest of their life. There's so many people who like the last one I can live was pretty special. And I met this year's is going to be absolutely amazing as well. For me and my family, at least, you know, because my dad wasn't there last one I can live, you know, we try to get in there, we couldn't. And so many people would just pull me in the hallway or I'd be walking around like, Woodward, do you know, Dave? And, you know, I'd have to do the whole story of like, yeah, he's, you know, he's my dad and they would always, there's here some crazy story of like, he has probably no idea who I am, but this he did this so much to me. And they'll carry that on the rest of their life. And so I just think there's, you don't realize the people you're impacting almost every day where you see like you make a social, you make a post. And like, man, no one's really liking these things. No one's really commenting, but like you get a message some day like, hey, that thing really impacted me. And you're like, what the heck? I didn't know like people were even, no one's commenting, no one's doing anything, but like people are watching. And I just think that's like that. It's so much deeper than what you think. Oh, insanely. Insanely. Yeah. And I remember, I was brand new. I was brand new to the company just like a few weeks before last year's Funnel Hacking Live. So everything was just like getting thrown into the middle of it. And I remember you and your family being at Funnel Hacking Live and just seeing the love and support that just surrounded you guys everywhere you went. Walking down the hallway, going into the rooms. And I remember I just like watched an amazement at like, wow, look at the people that are just like in love with this family and everything that they're doing. And it's funny because I've recently had a couple of people ask me about my job. And they're like, well, like you say that you love it. Like what's one thing that you would maybe change? In my answer, like it was it was astonishing to even hear myself say it out loud, but it was I wish I'd started sooner. And that not only is a testament to how much I love my job in this company and the exciting, cool things that we get to do, but I realized that also meant I would have loved to be under Dave's leadership and the things that he did for this company because everybody that I work with today is like, oh man, like this exists now. This process is here. This culture is here because of Dave. And when I say I wish I started sooner, like that still encompasses everything that he brought to this company too. And it's it's really, really powerful. And it makes me really grateful to be a part of it. Oh, I love it. This is this is legacy though. Like that is what I think all entrepreneurs want is they want this impact over income. Income is a great, you know, byproduct of it. However, that's something your dad was able to do. And even if you're not the face of the company, think about that. He was Russell does a whole tribute to him and he doesn't talk about him as a sidekick, you know, or, you know, his Samwise Gamgee or whatever, but that he was kind of his guide. Like, and I love that Dave was his biggest champion. And I know he was the biggest champion for Kerry and for you boys. Talk to us a little bit about how that has created a legacy for your family and then also for you as an entrepreneur. There's an amazing quote. That Eric Beer, right? You know, he's he's in the click phone space. And so he when we're losing my dad, he's he's Eric is amazing. He's so cool. And so he lost his mom exact same age as I did. And I have two kids and one of them was very, very close with my dad. To the point where like they, you know, he would, yeah, it was awesome. They why'd you bring me on? It's always different when you talk about your own children, too. Right. Oh, insanely. That's always gets me because I was so scared because I would see Nick's and play with my dad. And I know I'm like, man, he's he's two years old. You know, he's not going to remember these things. I'm like, and I just had a and last year I had my second kid just get married. I was just just my his was born. And I was like, man, she's going to have zero idea, you know, who he was. And Eric was telling me this cool thing. He's like the when you lose somebody like that pain, it never goes away. Like and the cool thing is, is you hope it doesn't because that's how you know that person meant so much to you. And it made me it made such a huge impact on me of like, OK, cool. Like it's OK to feel sad. It's OK to cry about my dad because he was huge. He was bigger than life. And then you also share like with my kids, like I can share. He said his kids never got to knew his mom. And he says, but I got to share with them was obviously the only the good things. And so my kids, his this is Eric talking. He said, my kids now have just the greatest relationship and greatest imagination, who his mom was because of all the stories and things that they hear. And so they knew who grandma was. And so when we're doing that with my we'll do it, you know, every week, we try to sit down and just talk about papa as who would call my dad. And, you know, we pick up pictures of Nixon and my dad. And yeah. And so that that legacy, you know, it's just and there's also the other another fun quote where it's like, you know, you you'll you'll start going after your dreams or you start doing things or maybe rebellious. It's like you start going after rebellious things or things or or change or going after what you really want when you lose your dad because they're not there over there. You look at you and it's like the exact for me. It's the exact opposite. Like I feel like I still see, you know, I feel like he's still there looking down on me and still cheering me on. We had a cool, a cool opportunity in inner circle where we got to go up and speak out of, you know, just in front of some of the people in the circle. And it was awesome. It was Russell had just walked in somehow. And so he was back there, you know, behind this, you know, he was by at the end of the end of the hallway, they were looking and like for a second there, you know, I could see like my dad's smile and just imagine him. He's so happy and so proud. And the cool thing about, you know, with my dad and the legacy he has in all of our as me and my brothers is a lot of people would always say like, Oh, I bet, you know, he's pushing you to be an entrepreneur. He's doing all this kind of things. And my dad was like just amazing at like making sure all his boys and the people he cared about were going after what they wanted. And actually employed like, I remember a couple, some of the people who worked at ClickFunnels, like they wanted to go quit and they want to go do their own thing. My dad will always kind of push someone to do their own thing. Right. What do you want to do? It's like, Hey, I have zero interests. And so my dad never put his interests on us. So like whatever we were interested in, he would be interested in instead of the other way around. And so like my brother, Jackson, was a perfect example of this where my dad was not like the manliest of men, you know, like he would he he would never be able to go fix a car or do any kind of like, you know, things that were like a typical man would do. Right. And Jackson is the exact opposite. Jackson loves fixing things, hunting, fishing, all these kind of things. And my dad never would do that. You know, he was never into that kind of stuff. And but Jackson got into it. And so my dad did. And he did that with everything where my dad would like, whatever we were interested in, he would put, you know, he would go study. He could go like, try to be the best at it because he was insanely competitive and would try to beat us and everything. And so it was just like, it was the best. Like he now I just picture him like stomping around in boots and camo. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it had to be like, it was as full out too. Right. Like it was like the best things. Like he wouldn't like he would not try to go. It's like, oh, let's go try it out. It's like, OK, my dad's going to go. He's not going to go small. Yeah. So we went to go buy this. We went to go buy some guns and a safe and all these kind of things. And it wasn't like just some regular or safe. It was like, hey, what's the best? Like, I got to know everything about it. That's right. It was awesome. And so that's the kind of legacy I feel like my dad, you know, as a parent, like money and you guys talking about income and impact, right? It's like, obviously, my dad made an amazing amount of income and he did very, very well. But and I bet you can talk to anyone who he ever met is like the most important things for my dad was his faith in God. And then it was my mom and then it was us and that. And then it was anything else underneath that. But that was like the biggest thing I was like, OK, cool. So there's more perspective on life than just going out and just making a ton of money. Like that's great. And that's the goal, right? Like you got to take care of your own. And but once you do, it's all about like, hey, cool. Now everything's taken care of. You can now go and let's go get let's go help people to serve someone. That was that was what my dad hated gifts, right? Like he hated getting gifts. Like it was his he was just that wasn't his thing. And so when he would get when we do presents, right? His birthday, Christmas, it was my grandma, his mom actually has the coolest gifts she would give him because she understood that he hated gifts. She would do this thing called a is like a red letter. And it was like, there's a crazy story about it, but she would write. She would basically take what she would give as a gift and go do some either charitable thing or some donation and write a huge story of that whole thing that happened that year. And so that was the gift for my dad. And and that was it was this really cool thing that my dad always loved. And that was his thing was experiences and service were like his number number one thing. And so yeah, it was pretty cool. I mean, you it's funny because he didn't push entrepreneurship on you, but you even worked at ClickFunnels for a time and we're like, and I can't really work for somebody. And now you're off doing these incredible things because it's what you wanted to do. I want to dive into that for a second. You're doing something that is very, very interesting, that I don't think a lot of people understand or know. And I'll lead with this. I know Russell would always kind of tell these stories about, for example, when Facebook acquired Instagram, they really didn't acquire Instagram because they were interested in the platform or the software. They wanted the audience and you've created something that helps people facilitate this, whether it's Facebook groups. Tell us a little bit more about media acquire and what that does. Yeah, it's been awesome. So yeah, you have like Russell sharing traffic secrets, right? Like how important it is to like have acts like have a show, right? Or have some kind of like instant thing. And it's been really hard. For me, it was always hard to build it, right? Like it was always like, man, this thing just takes a long time. You have to either like nail it right, like focus a ton on the content strategy itself, focus on how we go viral. Like there's tons of things that go into place or running tons of like spending a ton on ads, trying to like get in front of those people. And my business partner, Raleigh, shared this really cool thing of like he was that he worked as an M&A attorney. And when he was doing these massive deals, they would always say like, we're not like instead of building it, why don't we just go buy it? And so we'd have that's like kind of like a whole thing of media requires. Like there's all these there's these amazing communities, people who have spent tons of time who and there's tons of time, right? You're building a community, building up an audience of these things. And either are burnt out, want to go to the next thing, never figured out how to monetize it or just don't even know what's a possibility to sell. And we're now able to go reach out to these owners, get in front of them and acquire these Instagram accounts, newsletters, Facebook groups, email lists, podcasts, you name it. Like there's just so much there's so much possibility and so many opportunities to be able to go and get in front of this huge audience. That's like already built, warmed up and ready to go. You know, and so that's kind of what media choir is, is we're we'll show you we have the marketplace. And we've got like services and other programs and stuff of how to actually go and facilitate the transaction. How does it, you know, and then find those kind of groups that are perfect for your your business and then as well be able to go out and actually monetize that? Like, how do you actually squeeze the juice? Which is, you know, everything ClickFunnels talks, you know, talks about. It's like, you know, it's the best customer acquisition platform out there. And so you everybody listens as digital marketers, they would crave to have like access to Mr. Beast, you know, the rock, you know, all these people. Right. Huge audiences. And so we're just showing you exactly how to go either create some cool partnership with them to be able to have that or go buy it out completely. And yet we've done it. We actually did it for Russell. We bought him an Instagram account for his the secrets of success. Right. So he has he's been talking about Napoleon Hill acquiring all these cool books and doing all these cool things. And so we found an Instagram account that's Napoleon Hill focused. Right. And we went and bought it. It had a couple hundred thousand followers on this thing, purchased it. And now we can go send people to his newsletter and a product he has and said. Yes. And so instead of, yeah, like, you know, he's been trying to build this. You go to secret his secret of success Instagram page. You know, it's a couple of thousand people on there. Like it's going to take a lot of time to like either get hold. Everyone will follow that account specifically or we just go buy it out and now have, you know, all that hard work of doing that is you shortcut that whole process. Very cool. Yeah. I would love to know, like in terms of how you go about the acquisition, like, do you? Like, is there a strategy for finding people who are maybe on their way out or they're they're kind of just done with that list or they're no longer in the business? Or is it more of a, you know, they have a relevant audience. Let's go after them. Yeah. And so the two, like really, like two groups or two kind of like filters you go through, right? Is you have to get rid of the kind of audiences that I've like, we call like a leader group, right? Or it's like, that's the face, right? Like I can't go buy the rock's audience because if I go buy it, like I'm not the rock. Like they're there to learn from the rock, right? If you go to Facebook group where it's like some kind of, you know, affiliate marketing with Chris Cameron, like no one's going to go. Like everyone's coming to learn affiliate marketing from you, right? From the authority figure. Yeah. Exactly. And so we go find things where it's more question, more like they're looking for their they have the problem in their head. And they're like, say, these are groups that the community is solving. And there's really no like leader to go and say, hey, here's the actual solution. Let's go this way. And so we go find audiences like those where there's no actual face where once I show up, there's not going to be like some crazy like, who the heck is this dude? Like let's get out of here. You know? Yeah. And so yeah, we come in. So hey, here's how to either be the leader and go in and start pushing them that way. Or you can continue to kind of be in behind the scenes and just kind of and push products different ways too. And so that's kind of the and so those are the for the transaction. You can find ideally you want to find someone who's like has doesn't really know the opportunities selling. It's still a pretty good group. But they just never figured out how to monetize it. That's the real goal of it. Like, oh, yeah, like I built this. We bought a local actual Utah business owner group here. Twenty thousand members, you know, the group owner just wow. I had no idea really what to do with it. You just built it because you wanted to network with other business owners and you buy it for 250 bucks. It's like, well, OK, no way. Yeah, like it's just because they they they're so they're either onto something completely new and they're like, oh, sure. Like here's, you know, it didn't take me really any like it didn't cost me anything to build this. I just built it from scratch. I just kind of grew over time. And so that's kind of that's very, very cheap. Right. And so that's like very low. Like that's amazing that you can do something like that. Most of the time, though, like this other group we purchased was a podcasting one. And the person is for podcasts, podcasters to come in and talk about booking, like getting on other people's shows and stuff like that. And the reason the person started it is he got kicked out of a different one. And I was like, you know what, I'm going to do it way better. And started this whole thing and never figured out how to mod. He's like, I did it as more as like a I want to compete with this person. Never. And so once we gave him the opportunity to buy out, he's like, oh, yeah, sure, that sounds good. Like pretty much accomplished what he wanted to. Yeah. So you get to really see the value in different opportunities too. So does this include like social media, websites, communities? Like, is this a little bit of everything? So we go after more. So what we're looking for is the audience, right? Like if you go, if you're going to look at like the website and things like that, then you're kind of getting into like acquiring a business, which comes with more of a higher price tag and more of like due diligence and more like, how do we value this thing? And then you're into that's the problem with like, we just go and say, hey, I want just the audience. And most of it. And so if someone's just getting started, like I always say, let's go Facebook group first and then we can go and branch into other ones. But as well, so I say Facebook group first, but if you're a master at like, I was listening to this one, I think it's a warm, but he says it's one plus one equals a hundred. Like, how does that happen? It's just because you're one person who has like, you've got this product who and you know, you build this huge product up, but you don't know how to monetize. You don't have like customer acquisition or you don't know like fulfillment. And you bring another person who's like, that's their thing. Like you can't put a number on what that is, right? Yeah. You put that one person who has the product and the one person who has the skill. It's like an it's like there's just endless opportunities there. And so that's the that's the amazing thing about this is you're take your you're coming from like, hey, I know what I want to do with this audience. The other person probably doesn't or is just on the new things. And so you're going in your just acquiring just the audience itself. Got it. Very cool. This is so it's kind of interesting. I think the thing of this through. Are you ever like when you say, OK, I'm going to go pick this list up. Are you brokering these deals then for other people? Or do you kind of like buy these and like flip them? I mean, is there an element of that? Like, OK, now I know what I have. And now it's kind of in the hopper. I can go sell it to other people. Are you teaching people how to do that? Yeah. So we don't really broker as much. Like me to acquire started as a marketplace. And I think that's kind of like the end thing that it would be awesome to keep that as the thing is like as a cool marketplace. But to be honest, it's very, very hard to monetize. Like it's really hard to make money on those things unless you want to broker them. And I'm just not a very it's just a very hard, hard scale of business in my mind. And so what we've done so we bought when we were launched our first business, it was in the mergers and acquisition space. And so people were looking to go buy and sell businesses. And so we started this Facebook group and we're like mergers and acquisitions for digital entrepreneurs, right? And we're spending anywhere from like seven to nine bucks for per group member. And it was pretty good. We were pushing it through our audience, like through our social medias as well, trying to get people to join it. And so we got around like 2000 members. And we were looking at like, this is just taking way too long. And so we found another one that was like the mergers and acquisitions group. And so the name of it is called Mergers and Acquisitions. And so we went out and looked at it, reached out to the owner and it was around 6000 members and we're like, OK, how much would you know, what would it cost to test in time or money to get that? And like it's pretty high up there. And so we basically found a way with evaluate with like come with a pretty solid valuation. We bought the group for five grand and so we go and do this for five grand. We announced this acquisition and basically say, hey, we're excited to be in here. We're looking to improve this group. But by that, like we'd love to know kind of what your problems are with mergers and acquisitions, right? Like do you have problems selling, dealing with brokers, all this kind of stuff? And we ended up getting all these base getting all these questions, putting it in basically like, hey, how do we turn it into like a product? Solve that. Sold the product for two grand three weeks later and we did 25 grand. And so we basically have five extra money just on that. And then through over the next couple of months, we do, you know, 80 grand on that through the group. And now we have a couple of seller, a couple of people who are looking to buy a group for 25 grand right now. And so we basically forget flipping real estate. Oh, for sure. Yeah. There's a huge opportunity with this. And so digital real estate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And so you're basically, yeah, you're taking, you're learning how to like basically turn this thing into a cash cow, right? Like this thing's monetizing it very, very well. And yeah, you're fixing and flipping groups, Instagram accounts, newsletters, whatever it is. And it's a huge market out there. It is. We're not the only ones. You know, there's people out there who do it as well. And now we're just kind of teaching it too. Yeah. I was actually, I was browsing through the marketplace on there and it's just so many different industries and niches. Like there's so many things to choose from. So like there's something in here for everybody. Oh, absolutely. Like it was funny. So my, my business partner, Raleigh, he's, uh, he owned a trampoline park. And one of his employees at the time was like wanting to get out, you know, and like start his own thing. And so on his off time, he ends up buying this. And it seems like always in sunny Philadelphia, Instagram account and, uh, buys this thing for really cheap, uh, and then ends up selling some merch on it and, uh, gets enough money to be able to quit his job and go out his own way and do his own thing. And so even if you're just starting out, like the biggest problem, right? Most people have is like, everyone, there's so many products out there. You need an audience. And so that's what we've seen. It's like, even if you're just starting out today, like go buy a bit, go buy some kind of group, uh, newsletter, an Instagram account, something to be able to start at least getting your feet warm with, like, with promoting, with doing some affiliate products, anything. And, uh, and start making money that way is like, uh, way better than going out. Starting a bit, like starting to create your own product and try to build up your own audience from scratch. You know? Yeah. Finding value in opportunities. Yeah. When I go talk to about partnerships with people, right? It's like one of the questions you always have on these partnership calls is like, okay, let's talk about the list size, you know, talk about your avatar, what are these people doing? And that's the value, right? That's the value of a partnership. If you're going to go do something is who are the people and can we get in front of enough of them? And then you run the math that way. Um, this is fascinating. I think it's such a cool, different niche. Um, so where's the best place for people one to follow you on social media. And then also to come check out more about media choir. Where do they find you? Yeah. Um, all my social, yeah. Instagram, Facebook is probably best. I said, it's channeling Woodward. No spaces, no caps. Um, and then, uh, yeah, media, if you want to go check out and see if there's anything up for, uh, for sale on there, it's probably the best place. And guys, it's so cool. I'm on it right now. I'm browsing through some of these things and these lists are awesome. Some of them are hilarious. They're very cool. Very fascinating. Love it. Well, we appreciate you channel. You're the man. And thanks honestly for being so candid to about Dave. We all love and miss him and his legacy just lives on through us. So I appreciate what you're doing, man. And, uh, and look forward to seeing what you're going to do, not only with media choir, cause I know there's a lot more too. So I'm, I'm along for the ride. Oh man. No, thank you guys. And by you guys have absolutely crushed it too. I know you guys have taken this and, and, uh, done very, very well with it. And so I know my dad would be, uh, proud of the, the hands it's in.
