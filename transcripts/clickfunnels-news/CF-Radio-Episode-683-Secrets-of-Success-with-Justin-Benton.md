Here are your hosts Laura Demetrius and Chris Cameron. Well welcome back to click funnels radio my name is Chris Cameron with me as always is my co-host Laura Demetrius. Laura how you doing today? I am fantastic thanks for asking Chris. This is really exciting for me because I love episodes like this because I love interviewing people and you know we have relationships with a lot of people but I love interviewing people that you know have tons of relationships that I've known for a little bit of time that are really involved in the community and today we have just that we have the one and only Mr. Justin Benton who is a self-like proclaimed serial entrepreneur what you say did you say nut job? Nut job yeah or serial entrepreneur like you can blow a serial either way. Captain Crunch? You got a Crunch Berries. That's right. All Berries for Justin. Well this is crazy because I've known you for years now right and I've seen you in so many different things like you say serial entrepreneur like that's the truth I've seen you you know doing CBD I've seen you doing other things like but where did that whole journey start like as an entrepreneur when did you know you were gonna be an entrepreneur and what did you start with first? Well as a lot of us did or many of us I should say I got you know we you're supposed to get good grades in high school then you get into a good college so I went to Creighton University in Omaha Nebraska and then I graduated from there kind of by the skin of my teeth as a serial entrepreneur like just give me the piece of paper like Russell get me out of here and so then I went I got my big you know degree and I went out to go get that big job and I did find a good job it was back in 99 when White K was happening and then I got the big job and I got the salary and and I was like okay I did what I was supposed to do and then I came in to get a review for like a payment bump or whatever and it was like a 3% or 4% increase and I was like this is really crazy and so then immediately I grew up with now our family business was in commercial real estate so I was like alright I'm going back I'm gonna go get my teeth wet in entrepreneurial journey so I was in the corporate real world for about two years realized that was not for me and then ever since then it's been you know just some serial entrepreneur it was commercial real estate then it was in grew up in Omaha Nebraska so we actually had lots of like direct marketing direct mail all of these like direct response things that I knew about but the crazy thing was I and I immediately started running organizations and it had my own company back about 15 years ago and ran that forever and I was always on the sales side so and I went to see Zig Ziglar and and and the success magazine and I missed Dan Kennedy which bumps me out because Dan was at the end Zigg was at the middle we all laughed after Zig and had I met Dan then then our past went across earlier Chris but here we are now and a lot of people know me from the the miracle plan and the raw hemp and the miracle store with my son and the and helping him overcome a severe diagnosis of autism but then one thing led to another and then obviously back in March of 2020 everything slowed down and the world shifted and we were open up brick and mortars and then we're like that's not gonna happen anymore and so that's when I knew and that was the immediate time the traffic secrets came out I read the book I already knew beforehand that Russell was the way and so then I remember talk to our marketing director and she had a lot going on in her plate and I said look we got to go this is it this is now and she says if you've got enough time go for it I said I'm on it and that was it man I went all in rabbit hole of rabbit holes with Russell and and the rest is history going to FHL yeah yeah this is what I want to talk to you about though is what's what's so crazy is you come in the front door right you know a lot of times people come in and be like well hey I want to work with Russell and they say you know I want to create a co-product with them or something like this but that's not how it works sometimes you are a master of relationships and you came in the front door but now you are literally working with Russell on a project do you want to tell us a little bit more about secrets of success and like what you guys are doing absolutely it's what's crazy how it happens so and there's kind of two ways I think a lot of people out there are kind of looking for shortcuts and sometimes there isn't a shortcut when it comes to building genuine relationships with people you know you there you have to really like deliver and it's crazy with guys in generality speaking we measure our relationships of the quality of our relationships with numbers of experiences or time so it takes a lot more that different with females is that different with females Laura and general women can have quicker emotional connections and feel more close I was just going to say emotional typically does come first but I think that I think that's probably pretty accurate for general population yeah and so like I said I immediately soon as the inner circle open back up I was at that phone hacking live and I was like oh my gosh I'm in and Robbie and and we got in I was so excited from all the amazing stories you know the Myron Goldens and everybody that's come through 1.0 if you will and so I got in the front door and I was just learning everything I could possibly learn and collaborate with all these incredible marketers and innovators and I'm a giver and I like DNA want to help people like I cannot help people sometimes you are much like they're like you know I'd be you know it's one of those things where like even with working with Russell now it's like I'll give him a bunch of ideas and you can beat you can tell he's like I'm good like and when you watch his mind work he's good on I didn't help he's got it so I have to sometimes like say here's an unsolicited advice idea that I have anyways it's absolutely magical this is a passion project though for you like I mean I know Russell has been so passionate about like Napoleon Hill and all these other you know you know pretty much grandfathers of like marketing and like self personal development and that's really what this is all about and I know you're passionate about the same things that's kind of how you guys made the connection right well the crazy thing was so we met through personal development world I was in Tony's world Tony Robbins and he I was driving down the one Malibu I think I had the top down and I saw an email alert that Tony's going live I'm like that's weird he doesn't just shoot a live on an email in an hour or whatever so I'm like well I decent coverage so I pop it on a zoom and all of a sudden you know Tony and Dean are doing mastermind.com and would you know this fresh cut you know young you know looking guy hops in the middle and starts talking about serving the audience as you were called to serve and while I'm on this mission to heal the world and put this miracle plant it just struck a chord and I was like oh that's my dude. Mr. Russell Brunson. Oh yeah back in 2019 I think that was and so anyways that was how I got really introduced to Russell and what he was all about and then like I said traffic secrets came out right when the COVID hit and then it was like everything shut down everything went to online because there's a stat out there like 17% of average Americans shopped primarily online so they were already doing Uber Eats they were already getting groceries delivered pre 2020 after that we got conditioned to buy online that number quadruple so if you're not selling online like it was it was something you knew you needed to do before 2020 now it's something you absolutely have to do because that's where everyone's buying things the vast majority of Americans especially around the world so when I was going to pick the mentor it was a no-brainer that it was going to be Russell and so when I got in the inner circle you know I was serving the community and serving Russell and then in the inner circle we have this Facebook group a private Facebook group that we just kind of like you know help each other and there's asks and gives and all this kind of stuff well I was reading the no BS newsletter with Dan Kennedy and Russell and on the back page there was something from Napoleon Hill and it said there's no such thing as education he says in this article the back of the newsletter says there's only self education and I was reading it and I was like whoa man that's powerful and so then I posted that picture of that article in the Facebook group and said for those of you guys I hope you guys are all reading this because this stuff's powerful and then I said oh by the way I happened to know that there's going to be a Napoleon Hill auction in Hollywood Hills where I live in California. That's the hook. So consciously maybe I knew Russell would read it because he reads through those but I was also like hoping because there's a bunch of us inner circle folk down here in Southern California that we get all meet up and go well wouldn't you know ten minutes later chirp chirp boxer Russell what's the deeds so I tell him all the details it's down in Hollywood Hills I said I'm going he goes well I would love to go I just got my first boat and we're taking it out on the lake is there's any way if you're going it can you just tell me what they have and I was like absolutely and so I hopped in the car drove down to this billionaire's house and he's winding roads and in Hollywood Hills and that's where I met Don Green who was there who was the president and founder of you know chairman of the Napoleon Hill Foundation. Yeah sweet sweet guy southern he's awesome met him awesome. Oh and so we chatted up and and Russell's hit me up on boxer and he's like so I don't want to spend any more than three hundred thousand dollars and I'm like Russell how about we look to see he was ready just to buy the whole lot you know how Russell is he's like he knew this was the treasure trove because this was artifacts there was some checks there was NFTs first signed books there were things that have never ever been sold before and instead of going just to eBay going one by one he was just like just give me the whole lot plus there was the magazines that he was collecting so I said Russell hold on let me go meet with Don let me talk with everybody let me see what they have you send me everything you have we'll cross-reference it and we'll just get the stuff you don't have sound good is like sounds great so I went through we did everything that we needed to do and I got him everything that he wanted the funny thing was it was a live auction so I'm sitting here calling Russell now I've talked to Russell twice in my life that's one he's a boxer boxer guy he doesn't take phone call phone no no he took this one because I was like well hey like we're at fifteen thousand dollars for this first signed copy do you want the book and he's in the boat trying to get down below the wind and he's like yes buy it buy it and so anyways I and here's the here's the here's the thing where so we got the thing we only spent around thirty thousand which was awesome and so then here's the thing right so I have all this incredible merchandise first off of thing will do I said exit to him number one if it gets lost there's no there's no like insurance this is once in a lifetime like signed checks from Napoleon Hill the first edition sign I mean you this stuff is lost lost so sitting there thinking why here's here's a win win why don't I go ahead and just fly it out to Russell and so that was the first time that I it just dawned on me so then I told Russell hey you want me to send it give it to you on this Friday or next Friday and he was like this Friday and so it didn't even it's was one of those moments where you know you kind of act on spot native and intuition and then so that's when I delivered all the stuff to Russell we got a chance to hang out talk about our families talk about our boats and then in that conversation I was like hey man we have a really good relationship I think I can like you know really solidify this relationship for you and at the time Russell was like well I don't know he had this kind of other plan that he had put in motion and then eventually a buddy of mine Ken was told me that what I told him Russell's plan to to like form an alliance with the Napoleon Hill Foundation that's not gonna work that guy that he's trying to see that overtaking it's not gonna happen that guy's actually not a part of the foundation so that's when I told Russell I said Russell don loves me half the time he thinks on you I said why don't I fly out to the foundation and why don't I talk to dawn and see what I can do to make this relationship really sore Russell said go for it and so I hopped on a plane went out to Wires Virginia met with dawn he had all these ideas about raising money for kids and future education you know for their education and you know the pulling hills teachings the University of Virginia would match it so he would like if you could get another $500,000 they would match it up to 2 million Russell wanted all these TV rights and all these you know manuscripts and typewriters and books and all this crazy stuff that only the foundation had and the foundation won't sell it to anybody but if you're there the top tier you know contribution or donator they will do special things for you so we kind of had a you know shook hands out there and in Wires Virginia and don and I become like best friends dawn's been sending all this amazing stuff to Russell that we're gonna get to talk more about here in the secrets of success and that's what it you know Russell started with the $1.5 million laws of success which was Napoleon Hills and then it's just spiraling for anybody that's been in the you know click funnels headquarters you've seen the boxes and the box has got so big he had to buy more offices to put more boxes in and of course we know we're going to library library in the back setting up like the bookshelves of all of the things that will be placed on them it's insanity and the cool thing is that he's collecting all these amazing works Napoleon Hill being the first and foremost but like there's people that taught Napoleon Hill you know like Charles Handel and then there's Samuel Smiles and Orson Swett Martin so this really started back in the 1850s called the it's the the golden era or the fought era and then 1850s and so instead of getting playing the telephone game and hearing what Tony Robbins has to say about it being passed down you go right to the source and you can see where they deviated and you can get these insights and Russell's basically one of his greatest you know assets is that he curates so he spends so much time understanding and learning and figuring all the things and ciphering through all the information and then takes the golden golden nuggets and then hands them to you and teaches you like a third grader in simple frameworks that you can you know apply step by step by step so that's been the most amazing thing eventually you know I could go on and on about the story but eventually Russell was just like dude like why don't we partner on this thing why don't you just keep doing your thing and I've got another relationship in place with the night and gill Earl Nightingale Conant Foundation that we got put in place and then we just have this we have like the entire personal development library from 1850 to present and Russell's going through every single thing and he's going to give you the best of the best in personal development to take control of your mindset because so many of us know over you know over 80% 90% of this entrepreneurial game is mindset and if you get out of your own way if you can figure out a way to take control of your mindset because you don't want to be the bottleneck in your organization and the leader always is and if your mindset isn't correct and if you have limiting beliefs or you're operating with fear or whatever it is that's what's going to limit you from getting to where you get it. So Russell's just like I'm going to give you the true secrets of success dating back 200 years of everything that's ever been written on this topic and give it to you and we're going to specialize and work on very specific author so there'll be one author one book that we're going to do like a total deep dive on for 30 days. Russell's going to teach on it. He's going to go all the way down the rabbit hole. We're going to bring in speakers. We're going to do all these amazing things for the people that get signed up there in the in the membership sign. That's so cool. Can I tell you guys something really cool and something that I know about this project that I won't I won't give away too much information because we don't want to leak content before it's available. But I've been lucky enough to get to listen to some of those books that Russell has the rights to publishing on Audible because my husband is actually producing those audiobooks. So sometimes when I go down in his studio, I just get to like hear these narrators reading off these books and I'll just like watch Time Pass because I'm like, oh, I got caught up in listening to that. That was incredible. And there are hundreds. I mean, it's going to be amazing. Yeah. And the content is endless. I've learned so much along this journey. Like for those of you listening, like you probably have heard of the book thinking grow rich. But it's just the tip of the iceberg. I mean, Napoleon Hill had written over a hundred books. And and when we got into those archives, when we got into the library of the Napoleon Hill Foundation, there were unpublished manuscripts that we'll be working on later. And when you sign up for the, you know, for the Secrets of Success, Russell's going to send you these books that he has spent millions of dollars for free. It's crazy because he is such a passion. He knows that he knows what is limiting the entrepreneurs. Russell's worked with people for so long and not just entrepreneurs. Everybody is if you can get your mind right, if you can figure out your mindset, overcome those limiting beliefs, operate in faith instead of fear, practice gratitude, you know, those things, those fundamentals that might sound simple, but there are frameworks out there. I mean, a lot of us know Tony Robbins and he's given us these frameworks as well. Russell's given you everything up to Tony, including Tony. And it's just amazing to watch him work in his mindset. And now that you're listening to this now, for those of you that were at FHL, you just saw what he's doing with Secrets of Success. He is building a hundred million dollar company in two or twenty four months or less. And he just showed you the framework. When I saw that video for the first time, it was actually Atlas in the Pirates Code. And I just, it was an hour and 37 minutes and he just went for it. And he just shared that at FHL for those of you that went. And it absolutely blew my mind. And he had all that up in his head. If none of it was written down and he just boom. And I just go watching his mind work and watching him as a visionary. Never seen anything like it. He'll go down in the history books as the greatest, you know, marketer, greatest entrepreneur. It's just been absolute joy to work with him. And we can't wait to get all these incredible insights into your hands and into your ears. Do you, do you have any more teasers like specifically of kind of like what this is going to look like? I mean, is it a launch that's happening? Is it a membership? How do people get involved? Kind of maybe tease us a little bit with that. Well, the biggest thing that you can do right now, if you're hearing this podcast, as it comes out right now is look, we understand, you know, grass roots, organic, gorilla marketing, whatever you want to call it. We're also built click funnels over a hundred million dollars with partnerships, with affiliates, with he didn't flip on a paid ad for 18 months. And that's how we want to do this. We want to do this, you know, it's the bootstrap award. It's the bootstrap mentality. It's about doing it on the shoestring budget. So there's no excuses because he's going to show you, he already did, if you were at FHL, how you can make a hundred million dollars a year, not just once a year with his linchpin model and exactly step by step, how he's going to do it. So again, how the, what you need to do right now, the fastest thing you can do, just like, you know, Chris, and you've been so helpful with this is you can have an opportunity to get two tier affiliate commission, meaning you will get a chunk, the first, you know, 40% of anything that you sell to your audience, you get 40% commission residual lifetime, which is nuts. Then you also get a second tier. So anybody that you bring in, who brings someone else in or an affiliate or just a second tier, you get 10% on them for life. People are going to make millions of dollars just on this. And they probably already have, probably already have by the time this is going live. So it's just, it's an amazing thing where you can really focus on impact, changing people's lives, mindset and changing people's lives when it actually comes to their wallet as well. So I'm just so excited to be a part of it. I'm just so excited that you've been able to help me. That's what we're here for. I've done a lot of affiliate stuff for Russell over over the last few years. And Laura, I know you're doing a lot of affiliate stuff on your side too. So I mean, if you look at this, people are, yeah, people who don't have a business, they want to get started. They're excited about Lynch pin. This people is the best way affiliate marketing. Laura will tell you, Justin will tell you, it is the best way to cut your teeth on getting, you know, basically becoming a pro at online marketing. And then having a great offer without needing your own product. I mean, it is, it is the easiest way to have an online business. Yeah. So where, where do people go, Justin, to see this opportunity? It's a simple one, secrets of success, forward slash JV. That's the one that's going to get you signed up because you want an affiliate link, you want other people to buy from you. Don't forget the dot com. Don't forget the dot com secrets. Secretsofsuccess.com. For slash JV. I'm so excited about this, this, uh, the offer that's on there. I'm on there in the video with Russell. We shot some fun videos, but just like look at the offer. You'll see the books, you'll see the excitement. There's another video on there that really shows the grander scale of what this is going to be all about. Secrets of success. And it's a free, it's a free MIFKI as they say, go check it out. It's free. It won't cost you anything. Just patient handling. Yeah. Yeah. The most incredible free gift ever. This is, this is going to be really cool. So I want to ask a couple more things around this. What has been the coolest thing because you've been to museums. I remember you brought this typewriter back that, that Napoleon Hill actually wrote think and grow rich on. Is that the coolest? Is that the coolest thing? And I remember that was at FHL, like the unveiled it. Like you were, you were really good at like dream 100 gifts and that type of stuff. I know you and Christopher Voss talk a lot about this return on relationships and we've had him on, he spoke at FHL. So what's the coolest thing though that you've gotten your hands on through this journey? Well, so basically I kind of think of myself and maybe I need to change hats is I think of myself as like the Indiana Jones with personal development artifacts and like Russell knows everything that's out there. You know, he's studied everything. And then he just kind of like, it's funny. Like he'll just have an idea and leave a box art and then I'm like, he's like, could you imagine if we had everything from the personal development library from Earl Nightingale, Conan from 18th. Dustin's already trying to collect it. And you're like, you're like, you're like, you're like, hold my you who doesn't hear the only guest we've ever had that I see sipping a you who. I got the interview. I love it. I grew up back East and I would go to Mets games and me and the old man would go grab you beforehand. So I'm changing that. I'm changing it from hold my beard to hold my you who now exactly. Exactly. So to answer your question, I mean, obviously the typewriter is super cool. You know, with my Indiana Jones hat and whip, you know, and we flew that one out. That was really neat. Another one was for Mets. It's just exciting. It's exciting to see Russell get excited. You know, when he's just like the roof, when I got him the outwitting the devil manuscript, it was actually his wife's copy signed by his wife, Annie Lou. And when I delivered that, I also delivered that at FHL to him in person. I had it on my person and I was, you can see me walking around at FHL taking pictures with it, letting other people take pictures with it. And then I gave it to Russell behind stage and then Dan Kennedy was right there. And he was like, you got to show off to Dan. He's like, Dan, check it out. I got no, you know, and so Dan's a huge Napoleon Hill fan. Yeah. So that was one of them. We have another thing I can talk about it. We, we with the relationship of Earl Nightingale, Earl Nightingale is the guy that did this trade to secret. He was kind of the beginning of personal development on the radio. And he was the first guy that ever got a million copies of a record bought in a spoken word, very first. And so we have a relationship with Koten Nightingale, Koneit. And for those that signed up for the affiliate and the top leaderboard, we're going to do some really, really special that has something to do with that as well. I can't give you all the deeds, but, but, you know, there's a literally a gold record for over a million copies of it. And if you, those of you that have heard the story of the strangest secret, Russell's talked about it on his podcast. It's a crazy story. Basically, he went sailing for three months and his office manager, he left a record for the sales team to listen to the sales team, listen to it. And he's loved it so much that they wanted copies. And then it got on the airwaves of like WGN back in Chicago. And then by the time he got back from his sailing trip with his kids, it had already sold a couple hundred thousand copies. And it was just exploded organically. People were calling in and it was just this nuts thing that he was doing back in the insurance company. Anyways, we're we're going to get that gold record. No way. So it's really fun to like, like I said, Russell says something. It's like, OK, cool, because it is just, you know, Kevin Bacon, six degrees of separation. Everybody knows somebody through somebody. So you just like get an introduction. And then, yeah, we got those meetings set up. But there's so many cool things like another one. Russell's talked about sometimes I don't want to like, you know, spill the tea. So he's talked about this before. Napoleon Hill wrote a book called Outwitting the Beast right after he wrote Outwitting the Devil. And so Outwitting the Devil's Russell's favorite book, Outwitting the Beast is about Hitler. And so we're going to publish that at some point. Russell's going to do it and it's going to go out there. And it's it compares why Hitler, what Hitler actually was getting was a huge Napoleon Hill fan, believe it or not. And the problem and when the pulling, he'll found out that that jury that Hitler was reading his book, he stopped selling the book to Germany. And then he goes through and talks about why he didn't succeed because he followed 15 of the 17 rules and one of them being the Golden Rule. And also, you know, obviously being positive and, you know, looking out for other people's interests. But basically, the whole book goes through and talks about all this and Russell's going to put his spin on it. So again, like there are literally manuscripts this thick that that have already been written and they've been sitting there collecting dust at the at the archives and Russell comes in and we come in and it's just going to be amazing. And then we've got this really cool like, why are you talking about it? Like, you know, something like The Chosen, let's say, the amazing TV series, something like that may or may not be happening in that realm as well. So there's just so many cool things and I'm just so excited to be a part of it. So many teasers. Yeah, I love it. You know, and go back to like outwitting the devil. Everybody knows Napoleon Hill for thinking Go Rich, right? But I remember I read thinking Go Rich. This is probably right when Russell and I were kind of reconnecting, I want to say 2015, 2016. And I still have like a boxer of he and I going back and forth and we were referencing outwitting the devil and like the original kind of first time I had heard about Mastermind and like, you know, where Napoleon kind of sits in a in a room and then he kind of taps into this idea of like, well, if I was sitting across from, for example, I don't know, Abraham Lincoln or Martin Luther or whoever, like, how would they answer my question? Right. And he gets so much insight just from that. And I just I'm fascinated with that book. And I get why Russell thinks that that's his best book ever, too. And it's it's not the most popular, but if you haven't checked that out. And if he's got the original manuscript, this is nuts. I mean, so much of this is so this is gold. It's absolute gold. It's it's completely priceless. Like literally cannot put a price tag on it. Can't buy it anywhere. Can't find it anywhere. It's one of one, which is another reason why I flew the stuff out to him. So I could you imagine like losing it in the mail? Like this genius, hey, genius Dream 100 play by the way, like, hey, this stuff is so priceless. I don't want to get messed up in the mail. Tell you what, see you on Friday. And I didn't give him an option. I didn't ask for permission, right? Big for forgiveness. It wasn't like, hey, should I FedEx this or should I show up? This was like, well, and Russell was the top of my dream 100. Part of it was just poetic justice to pay him back for everything that he taught me and helped me out with with traffic secrets and always brilliant, you know, brilliance is when it comes to marketing and online sales. But and then, yeah, it was an opportunity to get to know him because I knew when March of 2020 hit, I was like, there's only one guy that's going to lead us through this. And there's not even a second place. I mean, Gary can go out there and talk about the things that he talks about, which is fun, you know, confusing activity with accomplishment. But Russell is the one that's going to give you step by step. Nobody else on the planet has had that kind of success. And then not only willing to teach you how to do it step by step, paint by numbers, but his brought hundreds and thousands of others up with him. And he can show you what see this person. He's got the track record. No one's who there's not even there's no one else. Plus two comma club award winners. People have made over a million dollars and that's just in click funnels, right? It's crazy. Yeah, it's amazing not to mention to comma club X and to comma club C. People make it over a hundred million. Yeah, you hyped this up so much. You've gotten me excited. I love your energy. There's like just buzzing sense here in the atmosphere about all the things that are coming and I know a lot of people will be excited about it. I'm curious to know now, because I mean, I think you've already closed people on. I'm already I'm in. I'm in as they're going to the JV page. They're in. Is there such thing as too many affiliates? I, you know, let's find out. Let's let's find out. I mean, you know, at the end of the day, look, you're going to have an opportunity to win in the most incredible free gift ever. When you check out that page, you'll see it there as well. Russell is going to be sending you, you know, his copy. He also, because of the relationship with the Paul Hill Foundation, he was able to write his own copy of Think and Grow Rich. And he is the most amazing forward. If you read his forward and how how this book was the book that started his mind and thinking of what he could actually create. And then his thoughts became things and his things were sold and helping his customers help their their audiences. And it was just this beautiful forward.
