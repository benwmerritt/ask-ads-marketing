Here are your hosts Laura Demetrius and Chris Cameron. Welcome back to click funnels radio. My name is Chris Cameron and joined with me. Always is my awesome co-host Laura Demetrius. What's up? Hello. How's it going? Oh, it's going great. Hey, I'm excited. I felt so bad because prior to funnel hacking live, we had this guest schedule. It was one of my favorite people. Like we've connected gosh for five years now and just kind of see each other. It's like boats kind of passing in the water and we have these cool little connections that happen from standup comedy to just speaking on stage to all sorts of things. But we had to reschedule this person because we had so much happening before funnel hacking live. And this man actually spoke at funnel hacking live. He's one of the only people that consistently gets to share the stage with Mr. Russell Brunson himself. As many of you know, I'm talking about Mr. Steve J. Larson, who is the original capitalist pig. He is a multi two comma club award winner. He's a dream car winner and an all around just champion in our community since day one. So I wanted to introduce and welcome Mr. Steve J. Larson. Hey, thanks for having me. Good to be here. This is super exciting for me, Steve, because as you and I have talked kind of like about what we'd speak about today, a lot of people know your stories and, you know, you being involved in one funnel away and working with Russell initially and going back even farther to like, Hey, I'm going to make it to funnel hacking live. I'm going to trade funnels for tickets and for hotel rooms and all this to kind of where your business is now. It's quite different, but I want to lean into some of this. I mean, because what I love about ClickFunnels Radio is this is a place where we tell the stories a lot of times and then we get tactical to Laura loves that part and we jump in and really kind of dive into these funnels as well. But maybe if you could give us the CliffsNotes version, I know that's crazy of like, Hey, here we are in 2023, Steve J. Larson, the capitalist pig to like, where it all began and how and why you're sitting here today. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So, you know, I actually got on the internet because of door to door sales. I don't really tell that part too much, but I was a door to door sales guy selling pest control. And then one day, I don't know, I was doing well. And I would sprint between doors and I was one of the top kind of newer salespeople. You seem like the guy that would sprint between doors. Like, Oh, let's go. Let's go. Let's do this. You know, and so I was like running between doors and I remember one day though, thinking like there has to be a way. I remember thinking this explicitly on the drive in the morning time. I'm with the rest of the sales crew, sales managers going to drop us all off in our neighborhoods, you know, and I remember looking up at the billboards on the highway and thinking that I'm waking up every day, going and knocking doors, talking to people who are not planning on talking to me, trying to convince them to buy something. But the people who call these billboards are calling asking to be sold. And I remember that thought hit me very hard. And it got me on this track to go. I was like, well, what if I started, there's got to be of some pest control, right? So it was like, there's got to be people who are looking for pest control versus me just interrupting someone and trying to sell them. So I started pest control. Exactly. And that's exactly what I did. I went and I just started putting up on like free classified sites like Craigslist and different places. Hey, we'll do pest control for you. And my phone started ringing like crazy. And my manager was like, what are you doing? This is crazy because I was getting as many sales over the phone, people calling me in thanking me while they bought me bought for me versus, you know, the same amount as I was selling on the doors. I was doubling my sales. And I was like, this is interesting. I got to learn how to like put more stuff out on the internet and get in front of people. And anyway, after the summer ended, I started getting in more like ebook writing. And that was really my first internet project. And that's kind of where it started. I mean, from there, I got into affiliate marketing and made my first dollar on the internet truly from the internet, from affiliate marketing. And then started like, oh, I started to become a traffic driver because I didn't know how to get traffic. That led me to work with Paul Mitchell schools while I was in my internet marketing classes. Is that why you have such amazing hair? Exactly. Right. They marvel my head. That was back when the hairs on the other side of my head. No, I it's just that's where it all started. And then I could get tons of traffic to these schools, but none of it would convert. And I literally Googled one day, how do you convert traffic? And that's when I ran into Russell Brunson. And and I started going really deep into the funnel game that way. And, you know, everyone knows kind of the middle part of the story. Yeah. Well, I mean, I may fast forward a little because I feel like we're on like the sequel or like three, right? I don't want you a spider-man to have to tell your whole origin story again. Get it, right? Which is awesome. And everybody knows that. And there's plenty of places you can find this. I want to I want to bring up one moment, at least for me, watching Steve J. Larson might grow. OK, I remember it. I don't remember what year it was. It was probably 19 2019 is my guess. Offer Mind downtown Boise. Yeah. All right. And I remember Robbie Summers and I came and we brought a bunch of like OFA box and stuff. We were just there kind of support and kind of, you know, help. And I remember we were kind of cruising around with your sales team. And I remember you had sold this offer from stage. And I remember it being your first million dollar like day. Like from stage and correct me if I'm wrong on that. But I remember you opening this envelope. And I don't think we've caught up on this. I remember you opening the envelope and looking at the number that your team gave you and you got emotional. So that's my side of the story. It's going like, oh, my gosh, he did it. I want to hear your side of that story. Yeah, more happened, actually, than just that. You know, I think what's interesting about entrepreneurship is you. Have to grow quickly and you have to be personally comfortable with feeling the ground moves beneath your feet a lot. Right. And so you are always learning a combination of skills. As far as tactically, but you're also always learning and emotional intelligence as you keep learning yourself and reneeding yourself because you're growing so fast. You just can't help it. And and sometimes skills will outdo. Personal. Capacity and vice versa. Right. And that that day. So from the stage, yes, we got like it was over a million dollars in commitment. But I was still new. I didn't know what I was doing and I didn't get a payment processor lined up. I couldn't run that money for six months. That's the other side of the story that I'd like. Furious. Oh, I lost a million dollars. I over the next six months, it took I started working with four different payment processors, but what do you think happens to the payment processor? When someone comes in and says, hey, I got a million and a half dollars to run almost immediately, like they freak out. And so I went through this huge vetting thing and their lawyers were looking at my stuff and they're like, who are you? Why is this? Meanwhile, I'm self funding fulfillment for the people that I sold. Oh my gosh, I didn't know this. Yeah, almost no one does. I was going to go make a whole YouTube video on it. You still said. Yeah, I'm totally going to. Like I'm going to tell the entire story, all of it. And, um, and all the players involved as well, because not great things happen also as part of it. And from that, a ton of people went and blew up and got their business big, which is awesome. Right. Is what you'd expect from a, from a coaching program. I didn't, there was a lot I didn't understand. I understood how to sell and market and fill a room. There were parts of business itself that I was still very new at and just didn't know, you know, and it was four or five years ago now, which feels like an eternity in the internet game. But, um, yeah, there was a lot that happened with that. But no, I appreciate you saying that because that was a fun. That was a, um, I remember in college, I was always that kid who didn't know what he wanted. You know, I don't know if you guys are experienced that like, I think a lot of entrepreneurs that I waive and you're like, I don't really know what I want to be when I grow up. And, um, so I went in as a programmer, except when my dad was. And then, uh, but that same, like, what am I going to be when I grow up? Thread kind of kept going. And it took me a long time to like really get clear on who I'm selling to, where I'm going, who I'm serving, what problem I'm solving. And, um, the benefit of that mentality is I got to touch a lot of different. Backgrounds, you know, Ecom got a great model for it. Sass and software. Awesome. You know what I mean? Info coaching consultant, B2B affiliate network marketing. It's like, it's too much stuff. And then like in 2020, I got a, um, a message from Russell at the beginning of 2020. Dude, you got into the offer thing, but under that umbrella, you went wide again. He said, you're too good at too much again. And he's like, don't feel bad about it. You did the same thing I did, but you're too good at too much. Go get a good narrow in again. And that's hard to do for a lot of us who can pick up skills. Who has a friend or a mentor that has a relationship like that that can just say maybe even unsolicited Steve, like, yo, it was. That's crazy. But that shows this relationship that you two have too, which is amazing. Yeah. And it's interesting because you kind of answered the question I was going to ask, which is how did you, like, how did you fall into the thing that felt right for you after kind of dabbling with so many different things and going through that? I don't know what I want to be when I grow up. Do you feel like you found that and what did it take to get there? I would say that I found that in the last six months. Wow. But, but even then it's continuing to evolve, you know, and I think that's just where this road leads. The trick is being able to plant the flag long enough to build something sustainable that really helps people, you know, otherwise you just look like you're not focused. But I remember I was around that time, 2020, no, 2018, 2018. I was still going through that question. All right. I was, I was since six years since I worked at ClickFunnels, which is amazing. And I had left my job, joined the inner circle, I was talking with Russell at an inner circle thing. And I was like, I'm trying to figure out what my purpose is. And he started laughing like hard, like, and I'm, he knew what I was asking, but he just, he just, he buckled over and started, I mean, I mean, laughing, I know I'm really well, except next to each other for a while. You know what I mean? Like, and he really didn't laugh that hard that often. He laughed so hard. And it was like, that's a, that's a painful thing for a lot of us to go through. What am I going to be when I grow up? Kind of a thing. What's my purpose? That's a very vulnerable statement. Yeah. I know. I was like, what's my purpose? He's laughing. He's like, oh, he's laughing. Why? What's, what's, what's the reason? Is it because he gets it or what? Well, after he caught enough breath to speak, he lifts his head up and he goes, someone else asked him, wait, what did he just say? And he goes, he asked the purpose question. And he goes, just like laughing his face off and they both go down laughing harder, holding like the stomachs. And I'm like sitting there in this vulnerable spot at this little inner circle pot like, like holding beef. And I'm like, and he goes, dude, I was playing this game. 13 years before I found out I was, should be the final guy. Wow. The guy next to me goes, yeah, man, I'm in my sixties. I just found out I'm supposed to do like six months ago. And he looks right at me and he goes, he goes, you know the answer to this. Solve people's problems and just serve. And you'll, it'll be half designed and half discovered. I was like, sweet. So this is a normal thing for entrepreneurs to experience, right? Like all the freaking time. That's what was probably so funny for him. It's like every single person has is asking themselves that same question. And even the people that have been in the game and are successful are probably still asking that. Yeah. It's one of those moments where, you know, I have certain people that have similar life experiences. Like if Russell runs into a wrestler or something and is like, oh, he did that move. And you're like, oh, he did that move. Right. Where I have certain people, you know, in, in different channels that I run through that nobody else would understand. And sometimes you can just look at him and be like, dude, how's it going? And then you both start laughing because you just understand that so completely. I think that is an amazing moment. Plus half discovered, like half by design. That is, that's powerful. Steve, that's my little saying. Yeah. It's like it's half design after discovered because I had to somehow answer it and you go, I can okay with that. Otherwise you swim in the sea of never really like completing a project because you're like, I should do this. I should do this. I should do this. And what solves it is first getting clarity on who you want to serve. Then you build a business around their problems, not around your interests. That's that, that changes everything. Because I could do this. I could do this. I could do this. And the reality is entrepreneurs are unnaturally gifted problem solvers. And so you can kind of figure anything out. And so the terrible way to anchor your decisions in life as an entrepreneur from business, like you have to instead start with not what should I sell, which I do, it's who do I want to serve, get real clear on that and then just get to know their problems. And that's like, that's how I've had to solve it personally. Yeah. And I know you taught this a lot too in OFA. And like I said, I want to keep kind of moving on to like where you are now, because I think we could spend 20 minutes on people trying to understand where they're at. So two things that I want to kind of know next is one thing that's always drawn me to you is this identity of the capitalist pig. I think it is so polarizing and so magnetic, right? Like at the same time, how do you balance that identity into the business world? And like what you're trying to do now, maybe you can kind of bridge that gap of like, Hey, this is what I want to do. And here's how capitalist pig fits in. And was it your plan to do so well in this personal branding or did it just kind of happen? Like I think that's very fascinating as well. Yeah. Yeah. It was again, half design, half discovered. I saw a shirt years ago that said just the words capitalist pig on it. And I thought it was hilarious. And I bought Russell and I each one of them while I was still working there. And I wore it one day while doing some coaching. I think it was for one final way or something. And people were just going nuts. And I was like, it's kind of funny. This is kind of cool. You know, and I didn't really think that much of it. Fast forward like three years later. Um, and, um, that's probably two years. I, I started, I started making my own versions of it to just be super polarizing with it. But what I started learning was how this is not a logo, you know, it's not a logo. Russell's worn it. I've seen a lot of Ryan Moran loves it. I've seen a lot of people, a lot of big people where no one would wear the logo of an offer, right? Especially big people. And that's what's so different about this kind of thing. And so I started diving really into the personal branding piece and recognizing that usually I have like on a whiteboard and I go through this part of it. But how this was designed is we first have to think that the person that we choose to go serve as a company is not a market. This is very different than what college taught me. College would always say the question, who's your target market? Incomplete question. Cause people are not places. Markets are places, not people. And so what we do is we first design a customer. This is our dream customer. This is the problems they're experiencing. This is what's going on in their brain. This is the stuff I wanted to go further in in Final Hacking Live with Russell, but just can't find it, you know? So once we have designed a person, then we start trying to find the place that we find them in. It's not just Facebook. What market are they in? Are they in the smartphone market? Are they in it? Right? You start naming markets based on problems, right? And all these companies are around them. Um, and so what I started doing is I was like, well, who's the market that I currently find my customer in? Well, right now for the six, seven, eight years, gosh, only almost nine, it's been the funnel space. And the funnel space is really good at attracting a newer person. Russell's got a weird gift for that. Sales force was shocked about that when they were talking about, you know, they were like, how do you get so many like zero to 50 million companies when most of the rest of the consulting world does 50 million and above all only, you know, funnel plan is very unique. I'm bringing brand new people in. And I think it's because of Russell. Um, I was like, okay, so if that's who I'm serving, let me look five years down the line, what market do I want to be finding my customers in in the future? And I want it to be really big. And I want to be the entrepreneurship market, just the broad stroke, you know, where I'm competing with as much as I love them, Marcus Lamontus, right? People like Steve Larson's another Marcus Lamontus, right? You know what I mean? Like that broad stage, not necessarily funneling a really, really big world stage. Then what I did is I said, what are the conflicting social issues inside of that market? Not rights, opinions. And I was like, what are those things that everyone in entrepreneurship are always fighting in? Right. And you can see go down to funnel and what is everyone in funnel and fighting over webinars are dead. No, they're not. Big one. Right. Facebook ads are dead. No, they're not. Whatever. What are not rights, social issues within that marketplace? And I was like, I'm going to go, that's a little deep. But like where I usually go is I'm like, I'm going to go to the entrepreneurship market and I'm going to choose one of the most cutthroat, intense arguments that exist since the dawn of man in that marketplace, like capitalism versus socialism. And what's interesting is when you develop a brand around it and existing social issue, you enlist an army immediately. You enlist enemies immediately also, but that's where this came from. So it took about five years to really think through and design it, but that's how it happened. It's really brilliant. It is so genius. And it's so funny as you think about this, like you probably have realized over the last couple of years, like, oh my gosh, it's really genius. And like didn't realize that kind of evolved. And here we are. Well, how does that play into? Because here's what we kind of talked about is you said, hey, I did OFA and what it did is attract a lot of people for offers. Did offer mine? It was offers, offers, offers. But I think you've kind of grown from that too. And like I've seen you working with some of the biggest names in the industry. Like tell us now who your dream customer is and how you're helping them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that question. Um, I became the offer guy after Russell was laughing, that whole laughing thing where he's like, the purpose thing. What happened is like two days later, he sends me a message. He goes, by the way, if you don't become the offer guy, some guy I don't like will. So please do. I was like, all right. And the reason it started is a quick way to find your purpose. Russell just tells you. Volunt told very quickly, but it happened because I was doing so much one phone away into comic book coaching at the time. And I walked in from a coaching session, four hour Q and A one day back into my desk, you know, and he's sitting right there and he goes, I've noticed you really like teaching the offer stuff. I said, yeah, he said, I'm so glad because I hate that part. I was like, really? Said, cool. He's like, yeah, please dive into that more. So that's really where it came from. What started happening was. And I'm grateful for this person who comes to me because of it. But when you call yourself the offer guy, like who is that attract? People who don't have offers. Yeah. Right. And it's not, it's not that it's bad. But. Entrepreneurship is tough. You know, you end up. I call it the five year old in the Ferrari. I ever told you this, Chris. I don't know if I ever. I don't think so. Huh. All right. So imagine this. Uh, someone's like, I got to get from A to B super fast. And I'm like, check it out. I'm going to teach you how to build the coolest car on the planet. It's this Ferrari and you get in it and you have this pride and you're sitting in it and all of a sudden you start thinking this car sucks and you look down, your feet can't touch the pedals and you can barely reach it. You can't even look over the steering wheel and you're like, this car sucks. And you're like, it doesn't suck. You're still emotionally a five year old. I'm giving you this vehicle, but you're not tall enough to drive it yet. You haven't grown individually to be able to handle it. Just like Russell is not the same dude now as was it was when he hired me. You can't handle what's going through now. Right. So like that's a five year old in the Ferrari and what it created far too many for my personality to handle situations where there's a lot of five year old in the Ferrari's call myself the offer guy, where suddenly I had to like babysit their emotions like, what if someone doesn't like me? They already don't get over it. What if someone gets a hateful comment on me? Like just mess with it, you know, but I had to become like, we thought in one final way I was going to be teaching marketing and mostly there's a mindset guy and I was never planning on doing that, but it was because of the offer thing. You're really good at it, by the way, the mindset stuff, like unreal. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Um, so what ended up happening though is that's when I started calling myself the offer launch guy, which assumed you already have an offer that wouldn't track you unless, you know, I'm far my events are called that now. Um, instead of just offer, still have to have it, but like, how do you get the traffic? How do you sell it? You know, um, and then from there, what I've, I've done a lot of consulting and I just don't really talk about it. Um, I should talk about it more, but honestly, my dream customer, if someone who has already, like the person I get the fastest results for is somebody who has probably already crossed at least 500 grand, they're an innovative entrepreneur. Yeah. They've innovated something too. I don't like working with someone who is just like trying to sell the next fidget spinner. Yeah. You know, I like to work with the entrepreneur who is solving a legitimate problem that they were experiencing and they have passion for it, but they're so into the product. They don't know why they have to go sell people on it. You know what I mean? It's a beautiful thing. About entrepreneurship is, you know, you're serving entrepreneurs, but as an entrepreneur yourself, you get to decide who your market is, who your ideal customer is, who you're serving and why, because it fits your bigger purpose of helping these people really grow. So like there is no right or wrong answer to that. It's what do you want to be as an entrepreneur? You get to choose. Yeah. What other business would you say? I don't think we're a good fit. You know what I mean? Like somebody comes in and you know, you want to make them cake. It's like, I'll bake anybody a cake, right? Because everybody eats, but there is seriously sometimes where you work with somebody for a week and you're like, Hey man, this isn't good for you. It's not good for me. And you move on, right? Yeah. It's primarily first and foremost the mentality thing. You know, if they're like, Steve's going to save me. I always tell my clients, you're Frodo. I'm Gandalf. You're going to carry the ring. I'm your guide. I am not here to save you. You'll save yourself. And people always go, God's coming to save me. I was like, he already did. This one's on you. Okay. The financial thing is the same. Okay. All right. Come on. This one's on you. You got a financial burden to grow you, but it's the person who thinks the hardship or I don't know what the answer is equals bad. Not bad. It's, it's a path. Growth. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Is this then kind of a, you're diving, I think a little bit into, and maybe, maybe tell us a little bit more about this of, I've seen you kind of take on fractional like CMO type stuff where you come in and you look at a process or whatever, and you actually can do that for a business without them having to hire a super expensive salary position. Super cool. Yeah. It's been kind of a stumbled into thing again. I tend to do that, I guess. I, it actually happened the first time with Russell. Yeah. A lot of people, people don't know us last year for a couple of months, I went back as a fractional CMO, click funnels for a little bit. And, and it was, it was super fun. It was super fun to listen to the visionary, have a vision, and then go develop the plan and then kind of, you know, disseminated out to the team and the project managers to go execute. It's very CMO role. And it's really hard to be an indoor cat once you've been an outdoor cat. So that was the only reason that I left my great parents, but I could only be in there for a couple of months. I was like, dude, Russell, I love you so much. I gotta go though. I can't, I can't do this. I am solo. Also, I think, I think Russell has a lot of resources, right? I think you and I talked about that too. And I think you finding the people who are the scrappy people who are established, have an offer and want to make this thing really grow is probably your sweet spot. So maybe that wasn't the dream customer, even though that you and Russell, I mean, gosh, you guys are Batman and Robin, which is awesome, you know. I'm Batman. So he knows. Just so he knows. He'll be Robin. I don't want to wear those tights. No. Uh, so I started doing more fractional CMO works than where I help. It's an entrepreneur who has already sold, but they've sold. And there's, I really, it's the Steve Jobs of the world's, you know, of the world. It's, it's they're like, I just want to focus on the product, you know, offers got to be great, but there's a lot of broke entrepreneurs and they have a great offer. They want to make the iPhone and you want to figure out how to get it out to people. Exactly. And I was like, that's really my, that's really my jam is I call it a market disruption flywheel. And that's really what I go build for people who've built an innovative product, you know, and that's, I love that client. I got one right now. He builds, um, it's not like all info stuff either. I got one right now who's, um, he killed software for companies who build satellites. You know what I mean? It's not, this isn't like just like the, the expert space. I think it's what's so fun is you get into the, um, they are experts, but they're, they're not like entrepreneurs. A lot of times how we would think so it's those different from, from this world. Okay. I have a, it'll be my last big question, but like, you know, I'm coming at this from, uh, I have a different perspective. Like I'm just finally getting to have a conversation with you after knowing who you are and who you've been to click funnels and Russell Brunson in this community for so long. And after you've built up so much authority here, coming from your background and learning the things that you did for training funnels for, you know, tickets to events, I'm very curious. And I'm sure a lot of other people are as well, you know, after building that kind of authority and finally kind of digging into who your ideal customer is. What would you say it, it took? Like, was it starting to say no, was it setting better boundaries? Like, what do you think got you to that place where you're like, I think this is it for me. Yeah. Um, amazing question. You know, I, I had to, this is going to get deep. Are we okay to get deep? Yes, please. Let's do it. Grab a shovel. All right. Here we go. Shovel. Um, I think there's a portion of the path at the beginning where you were taking opportunities that are available to you because you're, you know, you're still trying to figure out what you want. And I think that that's completely appropriate. And you're also in this immersion phase. It's really hard to call your own shot truly when you haven't gone through an immersion phase, if you haven't touched all like the majority of the points in your profession, you know what I mean? I had to, um, here we go. All right. We'll pull, we'll pull them back to curtain here. Here we go. Uh, open the commode here. So, um, when I was going through my divorce, it really jacked with my head. That was like three years ago. And, um, I had people starting rumors about me just because they didn't like me. I had people, I mean, literally colluding and meeting together side by side, they're like, try to notes on like crazy crap, like stuff that really, really hurt. And it was painful for me because I feel like I have given a lot to this community, like a lot, like far more than I've ever said. And, and so if I had to reinvent me, like from the ground up. So how instead of asking the question, what should I be doing? I realized that that is a question that, um, a child mindset asks. It is not an adult mindset. Children make statements of am I an adult makes statements of I am. That's a totally different way to show up to life. And so instead of saying, what should I be doing? I had to get comfortable and get clear on the answer, asking the question, what do I want to be doing? Yeah. That's totally different. You're not giving away decision making power anymore. And so I had to, and I, most people do this and we don't realize we're doing it. Right. And, and so instead I had to flip it and start saying, what do I actually want? And I was like, you know, who actually want to work with, who I like working with the most is the customer who already has made something incredible. They've waded through the discomfort of building it. They're mentally a little more thick skin than a lot of others who were kind of newer, no offense, but it's true. And, uh, going blowing them up. That's fun. Cause they get to stay in their art. They're more artists than entrepreneurs, you know, that's what I love. That's so powerful. And it, what a powerful place to be, even though I'm sure you, like the people who actually come to those conclusions have really gone through some dark trying times, right? And the fact that you, you basically built yourself, rebuilt yourself from the ground up after all of that, to be in a position where you can say, what do I want? It's a really powerful place to be. And it's hard to know what you want. If you don't know what's out there. And so if anyone listening or watching to this now, you're like, I don't know what I want. And I would really advise that you go into what I just called a discovery phase. Um, I did that consciously during college because I didn't know what I wanted. There's another time I did that. And I told people around me and my loved ones, Hey, I don't know what I want to be and I'm supposed to be doing that here in college. So I'm going to give myself license to try a ton of stuff with the total expectation to not follow through. There's too much like everything's fine. I just, I'm a starter. I must be a finisher. That's garbage, especially for a garbage. You don't know what you want. If you don't know what's out there. And it also kind of gives you permission to fail, which is also part of the journey. Right. It was one of the reasons I had 34 product failures before one of them took off. I was, I got into one thing and I was like, I like the idea of this thing, but I hate the business of running that thing. And I would start going down the line like that and just trying stuff. You know, it's not encouraging for some of these wanting a short road. Yeah. Well, I think this has been so helpful to listeners because people are on all sorts of different journeys or they're at different percentages of this path, right? Like of completion. And I'll kind of leave with this because I'll always ask like, Hey, where's the best place to find you? And I'm doing these trainings and stuff for the two comic club X program. I'm doing a lot of the facilitation stuff. And Russell is often talking about, Hey, you're umbrella brand. And he's like, figuring out what this is, is you can even go use your name. So it's been really fun as we've had this to kind of come full circle in this interview is your, where people find you is Steve J. Larson, right? Where it's not Steven Larson or Steve Larson, but you've now created Steve J. Larson and one, it was because the domain was a little bit cheaper. Maybe you can talk about that for a second, tell people like what you would want them to do like, or how they find you that type of stuff. Yeah. It was only two parts of that story. The fast, real, really quick part is that the guy who owned Steven Larson.com wanted 20 grand for it. And I was like, no, 20 grand for domains. I can buy for 12 bucks for Steve J. Larson. So that, that honestly was why I, that was the main reason why I started seeing Steve J. Larson. So it matched the domain name. Yeah. Take that. Steve Larson.com. Yeah. Right. I, you know, it's funny because I, um, pretty soon he's going to be asking to buy Steve J. Larson from you. It was also challenging though to say, I know this is going to sound funny, but when I'm talking on camera and I'm introducing myself, what's up, my name is Steve and Larson. Two ends at the end made it hard to say fast. So Steve Larson is just easier. But the second reason, um, yeah, something to say about that there, the whole Steven, you know, Steve killed Steven thing was a mistake. I know why I was doing it. I was in some serious pain. And anytime I would, I'm about to do my 21st event. Right. I built an event studio. I've done a lot of events, spoken on 60 stages, not including mine. I mean, I do a lot of speaking. I love it so much. But what I used to do to get on stage to show up was intense wrap, knuckle push-ups, go back to when I was in the army, like really, you know, and I would bring the full out warrior. I've been backstage and I've seen you do that. Yeah. Right. It, I did like many workouts back there, but now I can just see I was dripping in anxiety and trauma. I mean, I had no idea. And so, yeah, Steve's just easier to say. I'm definitely still Steven. Ross always wants to know what that called me. But I think what entrepreneurship does is it is a, it does a great job of, you know what? In fact, Robert Kisaki talks about this, one of his books. He says, whenever you take the first step, I'm paraphrasing, whenever you take the first step into entrepreneurship, be ready to have character flaws explode in your face. And you have to deal with them before you can move forward. And so, for me, there's some serious identity who am I crap that I was going through, which I have a lot of empathy for if anyone goes through that. But I, putting on a face is cool, but it's also cool when you learn to not have to do that. You know what I mean? Yeah. And it can't be done off often times in six months. Here we are, however many years into this. I mean, Steve, you're an inspiration to a ton of people who are on this same journey. And I want to thank you for that because I see the people who are uplifted. You're the guy who's three, four, five, six chapters ahead that oftentimes has reached down to chapter one or zero, right? And pulled people up. And so in our community, like from ClickFunnels, thank you. You're an absolute stud. If you want to know more about Steve, SteveJLarson.com, and then what are your social handles? I absolutely don't know. Perfect. You guys can find it. SteveJLarson.com is the best. Yep. Oh, I love it. I love it. And thanks for letting us peel back some of those layers and get to know some of the stuff that, you know, it was a little bit more challenging to talk about and how you made some of the decisions you did. Because I know that we have people from, like Chris said, all different paths. So to be able to share some of that stuff, I'm sure is really helpful for so many people. So I appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. It's my pleasure. I'm a very open book, all one or lost in the head. So matters. Love it. Thanks for being on today, Steve. It was great to have you. It was great to have you.
