Yo, yo, I'm doing awesome. This one's going to be fun. This is a little different than what we usually do. This one's going to be great. It is. It is going to be a little bit different. So today, we're speaking with Parker Olson. And Parker is a young entrepreneur who co-founded Forage. It's a company that fortifies snacks with medicinal mushroom extracts. I can't wait to talk about this. He also started a SaaS agency that combines AI and automation with global talent to build low-cost marketing engines for businesses. Wow. That's quite an extensive background in history and business. So first of all, thanks for being on the show, Parker. Welcome. Yeah. Thanks for having me. I feel like you both are sort of like icons in the podcast world. So it's cool to like see you face to face. Hello. That is very generous. You too, guys. We're happy to have you. We're going to have lots to talk about. So you've just based on your history, it looks like you've experimented with quite a bit of different marketing methods and you have a couple of different businesses. So can you just start with your background on Forage and how that came to be? Yeah. I mean, look, yeah, I was, this is probably back in 2018, 2019. I had just graduated college, was like a year in the working world, was in like a kind of a tier two management consulting firm. And it was just sort of bored. You know, I've never been into food. I don't know. I don't know anything about food before I started Forage. And I, for some, for one reason or another, and I think it was to sort of gain autonomy back in my life was I decided I'd go vegan for 30 days for fun. I was just like, I don't know. I don't know why people don't sound fun. Just for fun. Yeah. Like I think I'm into this sort of like type two fun, like weird things. And I went vegan for 30 days and, you know, probably to no one's surprise, you know, felt kind of different, felt good. I don't know. I was like, oh, this is, this is cool. This makes sense. It makes sense. It's like, you know, you're going to get a lot of fat in your body will impact your feeling. Okay. And I did a do that for 18 months. So like every 30 days was like, oh, I'll try this nutritional regimen or diet for a month. And towards the end, I kind of ran out of like standard nutritional regiments. And so I supplemented with these like medicinal or functional mushrooms. I'd start to hear about for the entire month and got off of other supplementation. And that month actually was the month that I felt best out of all 18 months. Now, can I ask you real quick, like, this is not mushrooms like you're going out into the desert and talking to trees, mushrooms, right? This is not necessarily psychedelic. What's the difference there? Correct. Correct. And also slight disclaimer for anyone listening to this, I challenged Chris and Lorde to ask me something that would make me feel so uncomfortable that I could answer it. So I am waiting for that question to come up. We'll see. Yes. Yes. Yes. These are totally legal. Yeah. So when I, when people talk about mushrooms, right, they often think there's like three types of mushrooms, like cremini mushrooms you put on your steak. It's like psychedelic mushrooms that like are going to get you super high and mushrooms that kill you. Right. The reality is like, this is a broad spectrum, right? There are mushrooms that, that spam the board. There are some medicinal mushrooms that also kind of have some like quote unquote poisonous effects. There are mushrooms that like you probably have eaten in your life that you thought, oh, I would just have as like a side on my, as my dinner that are also providing medicinal value shiitake mushrooms. They have, they have lots of medicinal compounds. So, you know, medicinal and functional mushrooms basically have unique compounds in them that can provide all sorts of healing effects to the body. One kind of, you know, clear example and leading example that I think not everyone knows about or people who are into mushrooms is turkey tail. So turkey tail is this type of mushroom and you mostly are making tea out of it, but it's actually being used in cancer treatments in Japan. Like went through like approvals in Japan to be used as a cancer treatment because of it's cancer problems. I actually just learned about this, this past year. Cool. Yeah. I've been, I've been taking some supplements that have lion's mane turkey tail and I think it was called Reishi. Reishi, yeah. Right. Okay. Very cool. There's so much. When I first saw this too and I'm like, okay, we're interviewing Parker. Like this guy seems pretty granola and a lot of people like understand that term, right? Like I live in Utah. Like that term would be the people who kind of go to Moab all the time. They drive a super outback. Their dog comes with them. They repel everything. Right. But then I was like, oh snap. This dude is actually making granola. Like I thought it was the coolest thing. Like when I first saw it, anyways, just kind of fun, but it's really neat. You're not just saying, hey, go and take these mushrooms. Like Forge actually infuses kind of these mushrooms and stuff into foods that you're already eating. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. So I found early I became obsessed with mushrooms. Also like I was originally a pre-med in neuroscience and actually was just generally like, I generally understood what psychedelic mushrooms did on a fundamental like neurological level and knew that like, okay, it makes sense that mushrooms have additional compounds that can be really beneficial. But a lot of people think mushrooms are gross. Mushrooms are sort of taboo. I don't eat mushrooms. The consistency is disgusting. And so yeah, yeah, I started Forge to basically take like powdered and extracted mushrooms. So these aren't like physical pieces of mushroom and we infuse them into snack foods so people can seamlessly get them into their diets. So it's actually delicious. That's what I say. That's what our viewers say, but everybody has to try it themselves. Very cool. And it seems like you've used some pretty interesting, almost like gorilla marketing tactics in order to get into some grocery stores. Can you talk a little bit? Absolutely. Yeah, I believe in non-traditional marketing. You know, at the end of the day, to me, marketing is about like getting someone's attention, getting someone to pay attention to whatever you're doing or read whatever you want them to read or look at whatever you want them to look at. And I feel like so many people when they think about marketing today, it's like, oh, like, let's go put $10 or $100 or $1 million into the Facebook ad engine, right? Or it's like, okay, like we have our email and our SMS and we run our paid ads and we post on Instagram, right? And to me, it was so frustrating to me because those channels have become really saturated. I'm not saying you can't figure out how to make them work. I'm just not the smartest person in the room and honestly, never will be. And so I, you know, when I think about marketing, I like to think about alternative channels. Like where can you go where other people aren't going? How can you get people's attention in places where other competitors aren't trying to get their attention? So yeah, I've tried a lot of different things. I've done a lot of different things. So one, a couple of things that I've done and I think kind of what you're referencing is I really like this term and that I heard the other day it's called spectacle marketing. I don't know. I'm not even sure it totally applies. I just like the term. I think it applies. I feel like this might correlate with the dramatic demonstration, but let's find out. Yes, it's cool. Yes. So spectacle marketing, it's sort of has the like, oh wow factor where people are like taken aback and off guard. And so like things that I've done in the past, like when I was first starting building forage, I had to like store all this ingredient in my room because I didn't want to pay for a warehouse because we were bootstrapping. And so I decided I'd move outside in the tent. And then I kept people like thought that was the wildest thing ever. And I was like, I should be telling the story. And so we started recording all this content and I was posting on LinkedIn about it and on Instagram and on TikTok. And we had some things go super viral. And then, and then when we put paid ads behind this content of me being like, Hey, like I live in the tent and I make this really interesting girl. Like people were like, what, what is going on here? And so those were like our best performing ads of all time. And this, this was before the iOS update. And like our romance was like 10 to 12. Amazing. Amazing. And Chris, does this not sound a little bit familiar? Oh, totally. Totally. I love that you're. This fits right in with the lynching. Oh, it is. It's a hundred percent. And I think people ignore this. And I think maybe you do to buy accident too is like, there's so much power in documenting the journey because when you're going after your dream customer, you just be unapologetically you Parker, right? Yes. And then guess what? The people who want what you're selling are those that are going to be attracted to you and you may repel the others. Like if somebody finds it interesting that you're living in a tent, hey, chances are they may just buy your products. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people were like, I'm not just buying it because it's literally ridiculous how far you're going. And like, you must believe so much in this that like it has to be legitimate. And yeah, I do a lot of things where it's just like, you've got to be all in. You got to be fully shameless and like, don't care what other people think. So another kind of thing that I started to do as well. And this more went viral on LinkedIn. And this was interesting because I started to garner the attention of a lot of grocery store buyers this way rather than direct to consumer, but more like B2B marketing is I would when I would go on airplane rides, sometimes I just get like a little antsy. I get over caffeinated and I'm just like, I need to like do something. And I always carry a whiteboard on me. I am like the firmest believer in whiteboarding. Like I think everybody should own a personal whiteboard and always have it on them at all times, literally always. I don't have it in this room. I do have it with me. Not a pad and paper. Correct. Like an actual whiteboard and some dry race markers. Yes. Yes. A thousand percent. You can you can be testing, you know, CTAs or whatever. You can be testing hooks like all the time and touch on that a second. And so on airplanes, this one day I'm like, I had some product on me and I was like, you know what, like I'm just going to do, I'm going to run a giveaway. Like people run Instagram giveaways and like, you know, that's all good. I'm running a giveaway on the airplane and I wrote on this on this whiteboard and I was like, I was like food entrepreneur, like running giveaway, like, like, like no purchase necessary or something. And I walked to the front of the airplane and I'm like sweating bullets. I'm terrified. Like I'm absolutely terrified. And I turned around and I just like hold the sign up and I'm kind of like, no, way. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's your marketing. The rose one through 43. Yes. Yes. Nuts. And so I walked down and of course, and I started doing it every single airplane ride I flew on and I know the same thing happens every single time. The first couple of rows are like, oh my God, what is he doing? And most of the people literally like avoid icon hoodies hoodies and headphone guys is like literally trying to crawl underneath the like in one of the overhead compartments literally. And so that's that's going on. And then somebody typically like row four to six is just kind of like, you know, a good person, they're kind of like, oh, like, like, what are you doing? And then I explained to them, like, oh, I've got this food business. This is what I believe in. I have product. I'm just like kind of bored. I figured I'd run a giveaway. You just have to put your seat number on a tiny piece of paper and I'll put it in my pocket and then I'll pull it and I explain that. And then everybody around them, of course, is listening because they're super curious, but they're still pretending not to pay attention. And then, of course, like the one person's like, OK, cool. Yeah, I'll do it. And then like five people around them are like, actually, I'll do it too, actually. And then it creates this like wildfire effect on the airplane, which is really, really interesting and just like interesting social dynamic in general. Yes. I started to do it and I started to get figure out which airlines would like because there were there were a couple instances where I was going to ask, like, did you ever like people like do not cool? Like, don't be doing this. Everybody's trying to just watch the. Yes. Couple times I forget. I think like, like United was definitely not cool with it. Dude, the Spirit Airlines always cool with it. Alaska Airlines always cool with it. Delta's pretty cool with it. I never flew Southwest while I did it. They'd probably be cool with it. Probably. And actually, like then I would and typically to hear my strategy, as I get on the plane, I would go chat up the flight attendants, be really friendly and then I'd go do it and I'd kind of tell them, like, hey, I'm going to do this really fun thing. I'm a young, little, shameless, cute, little entrepreneur. This will be fun. You know, just just play into that card. And then they would let me get on the intercom. What? Hey, like good afternoon. Like it's Parker. I just ran a product giveaway on the plane. Like if you want to get in, you have to bring your seat number back here. Right now we're going to do the drawing in three minutes. I have some videos of it. So funny. This is incredible. How did it work? How did you run it? So, so I people, I just literally would rip up a piece of paper and carry around some pens and people would write on piece of paper and I'd put it in my pocket and then I would empty them into a cup and I'd have the flight attendant pick one from the cup. And that was it. Gosh, I love it. And so, oh my God, I had like, I would post about on LinkedIn and then organically I've had three or four people who were on the airplane see the post and be like, oh my God, I was on the plane. Like that was insane. So great. And I've run into one guy in the wild who was like, dude, I was on that plane last year when you, when you, you ran the giveaway, you're like the mushroom guy. And I'm like, yeah. The mushroom plane giveaway guy. Yeah, that was, that was hilarious time in my life. You were building your own personal brand and your business while doing these kind of crazy, spectacle marketing approaches that you were doing. Yeah. Yeah. And so, yeah, that was one and, you know, I don't want to spend the whole time talking about it, but just, and then the other one I did, I lived out of a pop up, a Japanese import pop up camper van in 1995. So the wheels on the other side of the car. And I lived out of that for a year and it was branded in our, in our, in our branding. And I would drive around to different grocery store headquarters and I would show up like at their headquarters and run like a little breakfast buffet in front of their front door. So the grocery store buyer would have to walk by to get into the office. And this is right when like people were coming back to the office after COVID. Would do stuff like that. I lived out of that for a year and drove around the country. And similarly, like collected a ton of content. It's genius because it's not only like, okay, I'm doing this, it's not only what happens physically and locally. It's what now you can put for content out to everybody that is super captivating and intriguing. This is, this is awesome. Yeah. And I imagine it also takes a certain level of confidence. You know, you say I'm the shameless entrepreneur, but like that takes some gumption to go up and just do those things without permission and just kind of see how it plays out. Yeah. I think I've created this like alter ego in my head where I'm like, I like justify my absurd behavior with the business. And I'm like, well, like I have to do this. Like, like we need, we don't have a lot of, we can't just spend dollars on things. Like I, like this is the cost effective way. You know, I don't know. I think I like should see a therapist. So has that, has that transitioned into online like virality? Like have people just gone nuts because of that content that they've seen? I would say we've, we've had some, some pieces blow up and have done well on D to C, but then it really started to be tunneled into like getting into grocery stores and that's where like wholesale, we started to see a lot of traction on wholesale people don't, our primary product was a bag of granola. People were like, people don't buy granola online, like generally speaking. So online became more of a challenge and it more really more became more of like a B to B marketing tactic. But I will say from a lot of the viral content, like now, like especially B to B and then also B to C, like people, like because it's so memorable, some of the things of like running the giveaway on the airplane or like living out of the van, it's like that, that becomes like an awareness key point a lot to kind of start that customer journey. Yeah. Well, it's, it's a little bit refreshing too to hear these different types of marketing approaches from a business that we, we don't traditionally speak with on this show. And it's, I mean, you're, you're doing a lots of other things to you. And I want to kind of pivot into that as well. But tell me about like what attracts you to now working in like the digital space after being in the food and beverage industry and how you're kind of incorporating AI into the SaaS agency. Yeah. So the hustle was so fun. I like love doing all this stuff for 4-H, but I sort of got a little burnt out from like doing a lot of these like fun stunts. And then, and then it kind of all became about me, which like I didn't, I don't always love like, I, you know, I enjoy like it not being about me, but it was like, oh, we'd work with like an agency or we'd have partners and like, well, like we need this piece of content from you. And I'm like, I like doing that stuff when I, when it, when it feels organic and fun, I hate when it becomes this like part of the engine. And so I really kind of got burnt out on it. And the food industry is brutal. Like it was like, look, I could be here for another 10 years doing exactly what I'm doing. And that, that wasn't, I kind of had like a stern look in the mirror and was just like, look, I'm really toasted on this. I can't even sit still for a four hour flight, let alone stay in this like lane for the next 10 years. Yeah. Yeah. And everyone was like, you're the girl, guy, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, yeah, like a food was really cool and really fun and exciting. And I like, I love nutrition, but like it isn't my like lifelong passion. So yeah, yeah. So we're looking at kind of exiting that here really in the next couple of weeks, couple of a couple of potential buyers that make a lot of sense, like manufacturers who like can get a lot of margin back and really make the business profitable. So, so that's exciting. And but yeah, while I was sort of at forage and transitioning out of some of these just sort of like gorilla, spectacle type marketing pieces. Again, I came back to the problem of like, okay, how do you market when like, I'm going to put it on my calendar where like, what's like, what's like the one thing you could do that like you could do and have it done in a month and they'll say it and I'll put it on my calendar. And I'll be like, okay, like, let's do that together. Like, I think that's really cool. Like my roommate, she like really wanted to get back into doing art, but she explained how it's really overwhelming because then she feels like she has to make something really nice and then it would take like three hours. And I was like, okay, like just make one piece this week, like for me, you know, and then she made one piece on Tuesday and then she painted again on Wednesday. And it was just like, that was so cool. And you could see how much joy it brought her accountable. Yeah. And so accountability partners are so important, but I love doing that. And you know, I'm sure one day like I'll find something where I'm like, okay, I can do this for the rest of my life, but I'm not sure I've quite found that. I feel like we've had a couple of those conversations very recently. And I love it. And if you're 27 years old, like you certainly shouldn't even have everything figured out yet. I don't quite have everything figured out yet. Most people will probably say that they're still trying to figure it out. And I think that's okay. I love that you are, you know what you're passionate about. You know what you like. I think that's very important. And I think part of, you know, entrepreneurship is self-discovery and just continuing to go after the things that you love. I mean, it doesn't have to be the same thing for the rest of your life. Like I'm an Enneagram seven and most people that know Enneagram sevens are like, oh yeah, they value freedom. They value the ability to do what they want when they want to be truly happy. And sometimes that means just doing different things. Yeah, it's it's while we actually just had this interview. What was it yesterday, the day before with Steven Larson? And I don't know if that'll if it'll get produced before or after this one. But it's fascinating, you know, what what what he's done and how he continues to evolve. And I just saw a post this morning, guys, like from Gary Vee and all these people are like, I'm 30 years old, and I still don't know what I'm going to do. He's like, you're a baby. And then it was going 40, 50. And guess what his answer was the same, like you're a baby. Like it's OK. You look at so many, you know, people like you think you read Think and Grow Rich or anything else like so many people, you know, Carnegie and everybody else like 40 plus. They finally got their like stride, right? And it's it's wild. So that's cool. I love that you're like, OK, we've done this. You got a potential exit that's maybe happening. I mean, which opens up a lot of doors for you to go try these things. So I'm excited to see what's next. Yeah, it'll open up some doors for sure. And yeah, I don't know. Yeah, for now, it's just like, all right, I'm loving this. This is so much fun. Like, OK, I will I'll commit a thousand days. And then after a thousand days, I'll look in the mirror and I'll be like, do I want to come in another thousand days or do I want to start? Maybe do I want to go be a kindergarten teacher? I don't know. We'll see. And that response really caught me off guard with your background and everything that you've done and what you've built with your businesses. I think kindergarten teacher was the last thing I was expecting you to say, but I love that. Yeah, I have this dream. I really want to I really want to run a summer camp. And actually, my brother's doing that now. So and we went to summer camp for like decades and like, man, I those were formative, formative years for me and just like becoming a human and becoming confident in my own skin and who I was. It was so accepting. And I and I love kids and I love like watching like the development happen because it happens so quickly. So I feel like part of me, yeah, that like my ultimate dream has something to do with like children and development and teaching and and like just like creating really cool communities. So that's amazing. Well, Parker, it was awesome having you on here. We had some great conversations. I would love to have some follow up conversations again in the future. But for now, where can people go to learn more about you? Yeah, I'm really active on LinkedIn. Like if folks are curious about like how to do some of this stuff or interested in understanding it. The other thing I've learned and do a lot now of now is like hiring around the world. And and and I really like doing that because there's great talent everywhere. And like we like we just made our first time hire for whatever we're going to be building this tech space. We're paying him and we're paying him five times the minimum wage in the Philippines. And it was like three times what he's ever made. And it was like $14 an hour and he's so good. Yeah, so good. And it feels really cool because you can like see like what this unlocked for him. And at the same time, like it's really affordable for us to as well and grow. And like it feels like such a good like team dynamic. So yeah, I'm on LinkedIn. I've got like a little mushroom emoji and my name is Parker Olson. That's the best place to just slide into my DMs. Say hello if you're curious. And then whatever we're building and maybe in the podcast base or whatever, I think that's maybe where we're kind of leaning. We're building probably at podpitch.com. We switch like what's up there often because we're like we're just right now. We have a couple of beta customers and a couple of these different products for testing stuff out, you know, trying to determine what to do and what's going to work. OK, well, when when you're ready to start using click funnels 2.0, you just let us know. Yes. Yes. Awesome. Thanks so much for being a guest on the show today, Parker. It was great to chat with you and we hope to see you soon. Thanks, Laura. Thanks, Ben. Thank you. You
