My name is Chris Cameron and joined with me as always is my extremely incredible co-host Laura Demetrius. Laura how are you? Well thanks Chris I'm great thank you. I am so excited for today because we get a dive in to like I love being like I don't know introspective like trying to figure out more about me and like the older I get I'm kind of like this is pretty cool like I noticed things about me but when then somebody else tells me something about me I'm like oh my gosh they're like spot on and even in our pre-recording already our guest is telling us like oh Chris like I know you and you thought you're one thing but you're totally something different so I'm gonna introduce what called Joan she has performed live on stages in front over over a million people in her lifetime and landed roles in several feature films this is wild including Disney's High School Musical 2 her life performing and coaching performers changed in 2020 when she attended FHL and realized that entrepreneurs could use what she knew to draw attention to their own life changing solutions in that moment charisma hacking was born she has since helped thousands of entrepreneurs become instantly likable persuasive and find their true authentic voice in minutes now on a personal level I love this like this family is like a family of rock stars if you don't know Catherine is also I mean Catherine Jones is actually McCall's sister-in-law and so we had Catherine on a way a while ago and both of them we got to speak a funnel hacking live was so much fun for me so McCall I want to thank you for being on and I want to ask you one question I'm so excited it started perfect what one of the things that you did first off backstage what's up with the fruit snacks oh I call them good luck for snacks from from the time I was eight years old when I started like my professional singing career I worked with a lot of crews I worked with a lot of crews and I'm gonna be honest I don't remember exactly who it was and I don't want to be super name drop me but I was on the program with with this awesome person I think it was Michael Bolton to be honest and he told me it was like one of the very first times I think it's something big he said the most important people in the room for a performer are the sound people they're like your sound guy you always got to think your sound guy they are the maker break they are the people who are gonna make you look good and sound good and you know in my eight-year-old brain I thought okay well what's a what's a way that I can thank my sound people so I started bringing fruit snacks and it became a tradition where I would make sure that every member of the crew who are the real important people in the room I just felt appreciated and and like I like I was thinking them and knew them so from then on I mean went through you know any movie set any anything that I was doing including then when I was running like my own concerts and things you just you bring good luck for snacks and if you give everybody a fruit snack then we all have good luck so we can all perform together so yeah I everybody that's one of my favorite things to do here at ClickFunnels is for the last few years I've been able to be speaker concierge like backstates like what do you need kind of like helping you in the green room and everything else and you busted out this big old huge like box of fruit snacks and we're just handing them out it was it was the best and you know what I this seat to stage thing is very real in ClickFunnels you don't find a lot of communities where this happens and your story from seat to stage was about a year I remember Catherine was speaking 2020 Nashville right this is right before the world ended and you were in the audience and what changed what happened I know you've performed in front of gosh even like nine ten years old you're performing and seeing in front of 30,000 people yeah you've learned how to have this stage presence but in 2020 you're watching your soon to be sister-in-law which you didn't know probably at the time right already was but she hadn't married Travis yet that's right okay so anyway you then what changed between 2020 from you seat to you stage 2021 yeah so I kind of think of my life in three phases so the first one is like you talked about like my own professional performing acting singing the second phase of my life was when I taught performers basically everything that I learned myself you know singing and acting and stage presence and things like that and I was doing that at the time that I went to support Catherine speaking I knew it was a big moment for her I knew nothing about internet marketing you know I didn't have an internet marketing business by any I mean not even at all and I went and I sat on the front row because Vince Green hooked us up and said yes yeah shout out Vince he's so awesome and as I sat down before it even started because Catherine was day one so it was like noon you know people were filing in and I sat next to this woman who was a friend of Catherine's at the time but I sat next to this woman and she was talking and kind of complaining that her videos quote unquote weren't working she was talking about how people kept leaving her webinars and she couldn't get people to click on her Facebook ads and how she felt like they looked so awkward but she didn't know what was wrong with them and to be honest I sat there and in my brain I thought I think I can totally help you but that is so not my place I'm in this place where I'm like I don't know anything about internet marketing like I've never even heard of what a webinar is so I kind of sat on my hands and I was like oh that sucks that sucks and then the very first speech that very first day so almost minutes later Russell Brunson you know that one guy that none of us know who he is Russell gets on stage and he said if you have something that's going to change people's lives it's your moral responsibility to give it to them. Yep. And in that it was the dinner break so there were like a couple other speeches and it was the dinner break and I turned to this woman and I said I think I can help you I think I know what's happening I think I know what's wrong and that night I went to my hotel room and I registered the domain name CharismaHacking.com and I started creating a business plan at Funnel Hacking Live. I mean Russell same day. You can go wake up and see because that same day yeah we have like the screenshot it's so fun but. So cool. He was giving away the secrets I was like how am I not doing this right now so I told her I can help you as like send me your videos and I didn't sleep the first night I didn't sleep the first night and I came up with a business plan based on like all the speakers who had spoken that day and then I left with my first client that woman who I originally spoken to and after just a couple coaching sessions with her what I realized is that you know even though she was doing webinars instead of like music videos or speeches instead of concerts she was facing the exact same problems that I had first solved for myself and then solved for these hundreds of performers and it was that she wasn't being herself you know and what we found with with in CharismaHacking is that people don't people feel uncomfortable watching people who are not being themselves you know so they leave and people don't like buying from people who are not being themselves because something feels off something feels sketchy so they don't convert you know and with that very first woman you know it was like three coaching sessions later not only did she come alive on video people were staying to the end of her webinars and we 12 X her click through rate on her Facebook ads and that moment I was like I think this works like I think I think these entrepreneurs can use this the thing that really changed for me like over over the couple days of Funnel Hacking Live 2020 is the more people that I spoke to the more I realized like how cool entrepreneurs are I didn't grow up like in an entrepreneurial space and they kept telling me how they were gonna help people you know and then I'd watch them like talk to different people or film different videos and and they weren't being themselves and they were being awkward and I realized like if I can help them then they can help other people yeah so immediately it was like you know performers it's so fun to help performers but these people are like world changers and life changers so I feel like my job is just like the humans spotlight to be like you guys are so great go help everybody else and isn't that different right from performing before yes if you're singing and you're being yourself but if you're an actor right a lot of times you are now being somebody else and unfortunately a lot of times people when they go perform on stage even when they're trying to be themselves they're trying to be someone else and I think this is what charisma hacking helps people unlock yeah that's so cool yeah what I am so curious like what is the first step of charisma hacking like I don't know like and I want to have that conversation with you separate it from this but like if you were to like live charisma hack me up right now like what's kind of like the first question or first thing somebody should ask themselves that's a fantastic question so people always ask like okay does charisma work outside or does charisma hacking work outside of video like outside of stage and I tell them yes but the place that it starts is what I call the intuition test it's by feeling and seeing that something is off right there's so many people who say like well it feels off but I'm going to push through it and maybe it'll get better or it looks off but I'm supposed to be different it's on video like of course I'm a different person and what I tell them is like as soon as you feel that something is off right if you can feel it they can see it you know so the first thing that we would do is we would look at either a video or speech something that is recorded where you could watch it and I mean the the catastrophic I guess word for it is like cringe but you want to feel the intuition of like I feel like something is off not natural from there yeah not natural sometimes people even try to explain it is like I just feel like my voice is so like yeah and I'm like okay you're sensing something is off now we can start to adjust and say okay who are you really and where's the gap here you know it's it's saying you you can and should be yourself all the time you know but first we have to sense that something's off the second thing that we do is we look at why right we look at why it's off because we all have things called triggers that we're not trying to not be ourselves you know but these triggers pull us off our center right out of our Christmas styles because either we're trying to be somebody that we're not like a specific person we're trying to imitate or impersonate a person or we don't want to be seen as you know too loud or too obnoxious or all of these things that that we adjust for in our brain so we say what's off and then why is it off and then we start to re-center and say okay how do we give you tools that you can fight the triggers you know you can see who you should model instead of the person you're trying to imitate that's nothing like you and how do we make you yourself by by the end of this interview I want a hot seat you know and you and I already did this for a second but I want to see what you think maybe Laura would be okay challenge and I love that like I love I love profiling people from like an enneagram perspective or even with like my your sprigs like I'm super into personality assessments this is so different this is so unique and it's really about like being your true authentic self in the way that you interact with others it's not just kind of how you view yourself even when you're alone and things like that like a lot of this is kind of performative like when you are on stage and you're looking at yourself like that doesn't feel like me like it's so cool that that's a signal of like well then that's actually not who you are you know it's kind of eliminating the things that you're not and I find that really fascinating and I love that you know you're you're so great at this but I imagine just having a regular conversation with someone is a little bit difficult to to profile them because you have to see what they're like you know on stage for them to really probably do the things that they don't normally do I don't know like it's probably easier for people to be natural in a one-on-one conversation and maybe I'm wrong but I feel like it would probably be easier to kind of signal those things based on how somebody is acting in front of a group of people. Great question. So for me it's not hard because I love it. But the interesting thing is what you want to think about is you want to think of yourself as a as like a spectrum of intensity basically. So you are your charisma styles all the time right when you are being yourself you're your charisma styles all the time when you are having a conversation with somebody here you may be at the intensity you know of Laura from a one to a 10 you may be at like a five that's usually where I am when I'm coaching just because I know and I've you know kind of tweaked everything you're at like a five when you're on stage it's not that your charisma styles change or really your mannerisms or behaviors change you just increase that intensity maybe to like an eight or a nine. So you're telling me a five when you're coaching is not kicking doing the high kicks but the eight or nine. Eight or nine. The high kicks. Yes. So yeah it's just kind of a matter of intensity. The thing that you're talking about that is super insightful that's awesome that you already kind of sense that is I give people two things to help them discover who they are. So first I give them what's called their charisma styles right who they are. And then I give them what are called their false faces and these are the things that they're trying to be over and over right. It's kind of the masks that they wear and for most people you know these masks can and will change based on the triggers based on the time of your life whatever but a lot of times like throughout a coaching period people have main false faces so they pull in specific directions I call it pull because you're like pulling off center. So in order for me to see your false faces or how you react to like different situations then seeing videos seeing you on a stage that's really helpful because I can tell you like oh you're compensating in this way let's get you back to center in these specific ways. So yes very insightful when you say like I don't know if you'd be able to see that but yeah your charisma styles remain the same they're just different intensities and then those false faces are the things that make you adjust and not yourself and that's how I identify those. That makes total sense. So fun. Cool. They're looking for questions. You're so smart. This is so fun for me. What are some of the biggest mistakes that people make like that you see over and over and over is it trying to be somebody else is it trying to be in too intense is it being too shy are there just some main ones people fall into. Totally. So we have three false faces and these are the patterns across all humans. So the first one and this is the biggest one we call it the two face so TOO and it's when we think we're too much something right and it's if we're told we're too big or too small we compensate accordingly right if we think we're too big we go smaller and we move our arms less and then we're not our best selves anymore right if we think or we're told we're too loud then we adjust by talking quieter and suddenly we're no longer our best selves. So that's the first first thing that people do is they compensate for that two face right whether they've been told it by somebody else or they tell themselves and they believe that. The second one is the face you know let me spell it for you. This is when people imitate somebody because they say that's the good one. They say well smart looks like that. So if I want to be smart I need to model that person. A lot of times it happens within the click bonus community people will say well Russell is high energy. So if I want to be high energy I need to imitate Russell instead of just increasing their energy. So that's the face they say that's the good one. The final one is the you face EW and this is when people think like I don't want to be seen as you. Yeah. I don't want to be seen as that's like the you that's cringy. Yep. You that's cringy or they have somebody maybe in their lives that you know was loud and obnoxious. So they think oh well if I'm loud then people will see me as obnoxious when they don't see that with each other. You know so yeah it's either I'm too much this I'm not enough that right the face or the you face I don't want to be seen as too. Ooh or you I love that. And you know when you said that the whole thing about some people feel like maybe they're too much or they're too loud or they're too this they're too something do you feel like that is more common with women. So I wouldn't. Well it's every person in the world thinks that they're too much something. There are more common like fill in the blanks after two for women that I've seen you know I've done like female only events. And yeah they'll compensate in specific ways because especially like women in professional settings you know half of them try to be less bubbly because they're told they won't be taken seriously. The other half are trying to be seen as softer because they've been told they're too direct or too intimidating or too intense. So it depends on the person and it depends on like the setting that they're coming from but those are the two most common that they are trying to compensate for for sure. So fascinating. So do you think the most common one is the the face where people are just being unnatural because they're trying to be somebody else. I would say it depends the the biggest one that we tackle first is usually the two face because it's the easiest one for people to find and it's the one that goes the deepest. Yeah that's what they've been told right. Maybe a false identity they've been told their entire life like totally like maybe sometimes it's like you're just being too loud you're being too this or whatever. Totally. Yeah. And a lot of times like it comes from I mean deep childhood stuff right. It's the one that's like deeply ingrained. It makes sense. The face is the one that tends to change based on like if they get a new coach a lot of times they'll like start to try to impersonate that new coach or if they find somebody like on YouTube or on TikTok that all of a sudden they really like or they think is really successful like they'll start to try to imitate that person you find within specific communities that people will imitate that leader more often than not. You know in the click funnels community everybody's trying to impersonate Russell you know even like in the Krista Mayshore community we did a lot of stuff together everybody was trying to be Krista you know Gary same. Yeah so it's fascinating. A lot of times I can tell if somebody has been previously coached by a specific style because they tried to make them themselves basically I was coaching somebody and I was like I saw every member of their team and all of them were different charisma styles but they were all trying to impersonate the same one. And I was like okay now that I've seen all five of you you have somebody who's trying to make you them and they are a roar and none of you are a roar right. Like we need to find out who this person is and yes take their advice in other ways but stop trying to take charisma advice from you because they're not making you yourself and they knew exactly who it was like based on examples they're like it's this person like oh my gosh yeah and they have been trying to give us advice here so yeah it's just. I want to back up just a second because I think you know if people don't have enough context they start to hear these categories and everything else and like okay I'm starting to get a peripheral idea like of what charisma hacking is. Yeah but can you maybe kind of separate the three different things and then some examples of each so people can understand that. We don't have a ton of time but I know you've probably got an elevator pitch I'd love to hear it. Totally yeah so there are three main charisma style categories so if you think of this as like the way that we get an entire picture of you is with these three separate style categories so one of them is authority this is how you move people to action kind of the in charge part of your charisma. The second one is your compassion this is the empathetic part of your charisma and how you talk about respond to pain and problems and the third one is your entertainment this is the fun part of your charisma so you know it's like in charge part moving people empathetic part pain and problems entertainment is fun part how you get people's attention so within those there are specific styles that you are one of each right so we're kind of trying to find your style recipe of how those three things look together so first with authority there's three different ways to move people to action you're only one of them you're only one of them you can't be all of them you can't be none of them so we have light lift and lead so light people say light the path they talk a lot about frameworks and processes and the more they can convince you that that process will work for you the more likely you are to move. The lift people are very person focused the more that they can convince you that you are capable of doing this the more likely you are to move they're very like personal transformation focused lead people are personal experience focused basically if they can the more they can convince you that they have walked the path before and that they are going to show you what to do the more likely you are to move so if you imagine there's three vehicles all going to a location they're all going to get there at the same time however the way that they get there is different light people say this bus is going to this location this bus is the only way that you're going to get there all I have to do is convince you to get on the bus right like which is like a Russell Brunson style like one funnel away follow the path. Yep. If you believe that a funnel will work for you you will buy all of his stuff because you are willing to move for lift people this is like me or Chris is also a lift or like a remote safety the more they can convince you that all of these people who are just like you have succeeded and therefore you will succeed as well the more likely you are to move they would say like my clients in the driver's seat I'm going to be in the passenger seat making sure that they're getting there right but I'm going to show them that they are capable of taking the turns so they give a lot of examples and try to make client audience parallels with lead people this is like an Alex Hormosi you know Gary V Tony Robbins is also a lead they say I'm in the driver seat and I have not only made I've not only done this successfully but I've also made mistakes so that you don't have to they are the blueprint themselves right instead of like the system like a funnel instead of like all my clients are the blueprint of transformation they are the blueprint so all businesses have all three of those things right I have a lot of systems obviously I have a lot of clients who have succeeded obviously and I've also done this myself however with charisma the way that I move people is I only focus on the one that moves people that I would do in natural conversations and that's how you want to think about it so that's authority does that make sense so far it totally yeah then with compassion you want to you want to think about how you talk about and respond to pain and problems so if you imagine that you have been stabbed in the leg these three styles respond differently so steady fix and mirror so you've been stabbed in the leg you have three friends they all deeply care about you equally but they all respond to the pain different steady comes and holds your hand and tells you it's going to be OK they're very soft and emotions focused fix which is the second one they acknowledge the knife they're very context focused they're like whoa crazy knife man you totally responded appropriately I would have screamed right they're very context focused and then mirror which is the third one they are very reaction focused they're like you're crying oh my gosh I'm crying wait you're screaming okay I'm going to scream with you too like I am here for you I I am matching your intensity basically so once again you're only one of them right you can't do all of them you can't be none of them obviously and the one that you use is how you react to things in your own life so you're one authority and then one compassion and then with entertainment this is how you get people's people to pay attention to you so a maze is very bright this is like Dave Woodward or like Paul Rudd it feels very there I call it I call him Christmas Dave right it feels like Christmas morning and then Excite is the next one so they're six of them Excite is the next one this is like Russell they are very enthusiastic and there's a lot of emphasis on things and then Charm is very playful this is like Ryan Reynolds it feels like very cheeky this is like Anna Kendrick and then perform perform is very theatrical this is like me doing high kicks on stage or Robin Williams Robin Williams and then Impress Impress is they intensify with weight and it feels very like intentional and on purpose this is like Brene Brown this is like Oprah the rock is an Impress and then Roar intensifies with power so the way that they the way that they talk to people all the time kind of feels like this it feels very powerful this is like Tony Robbins this is like Jennifer Lawrence this is like Gary V. Sandra Bullock is a Roar so it's looking at how do we intensify how do we get people to pay attention to us so basically all you're doing is you're looking for your style recipe right now you have to have all three of them to be complete. You have a very simple way for people to go and kind of just do a quick like oh yes. Oh yeah. Where do they go to do that? I mean I want to do it here too. But I want everybody to be able to just go do this and start to see kind of where they are so they can stay there to yourself. Totally. So if you go to Charisma.style we have a Charisma.style estimator that you can use that it'll give you all the information that you need and you can kind of drag it around and say I'm this one I'm that one and you can have friends or spouses take it for you too and you can start to see where you are. That one I think is actually pretty interesting because we're doing this in two comic club X coaching program and people are kind of some people aren't like I guess as self aware as others. I think people say well I want to be this and so they grade themselves. That might be an understatement sometimes. Everybody but but what you could do I love what you said right there like have your spouse or your significant other or your business partner is like no dude you are 100% like you did that for me just when before we did this like I thought that I was a lead mirror like excited you're like maybe no no no. Yeah you were like I think you might be like a lift mirror exciter maybe even a charm right like it's pretty cool to really find out what this is and then lean into it. So I love that you showed us where people can go do that. My next question is why the heck does this matter in marketing? Like yeah for performance and we're going for cheers. But people are voting with their dollars. So why is this so important to have the right charisma? Or as the kids say Riz. Who Riz Riz? I hope yes. So why is this so important in marketing? Yeah so when I started out when I got that very first client at Funnel Hacking Live I wasn't actually looking to increase her numbers because I had never done that before. Like I didn't even know which numbers we were trying to increase. I was just trying to make her herself. The cool thing was they go hand in hand. The more we made her herself the more her watch time went up the more her engagement went up and the more her conversion went up. Right and with that very first client all of a sudden I found not only could I help entrepreneurs more but the business implications were crazy. Right so we have to get people to do three things in our businesses. We have to get them to pay attention to us. Right and that's the very first thing you have to do on video because if they don't pay attention then they're never going to do the next two which are then they have to realize I have the problem you solve and I want it solved. And the final one is they have to choose you to solve that problem. And Charisma Styles does all three of those things in order. Right we first get their attention. We second get them to identify I have this problem. I want it solved. And third we get them to choose us to solve those problems. So hook story offer. Right offer baby. Yeah it's if you are in your business. Anywhere in your business what we have found is that people like and follow and engage with people who are being themselves and they do not like follow engage with people who are not being themselves. They can always sense like something's off. The very first thing that we talked about when Laura when you asked about like what's the first step that intuition test. Not only do we have it but our audiences have it too. They don't think to themselves they are out of their Charisma Styles. They just switch either yes or no. They click yes or no. Right when they say oh this is off because they have the exact same intuition as you. They don't stick around to find out what is off. They just leave. Right so instead we say well our intuition their intuition matches. So when we get you into your styles they feel that as well and they want to move forward with you. It's why it matters in marketing. It's the most important thing in the world. Right it's numbers. If you're not being yourself nobody's going to click on to see what your story is. Maybe they saw the hook but they're certainly not going to take your CTA as well. Like I love to that you have some of that data where you can go say hey once we got your Charisma Style now look at these numbers. Yeah yeah it's super fast. What we found is that each Charisma Style coincides with a metric which like I usually don't talk about the data because it's really really geeky and really in the weeds but we know if people are leaving. So if your content is exactly where it should be I should start with that. Then if people are leaving right the watch time drop off rates it's your entertainment style. If people aren't engaging it's your compassion style. And then if they are not converting if they are engaging the way that we want them to it's your authority style. So we just we first use it to like make you yourself and then we use it to optimize. It's so cool. So fun. Yeah that really does make sense too though. When you talk about engaging and there what is the second one? Compassion. Compassion style like it's the same thing even with big brands. It's people engage and even continue to buy or stay with like continue to be advocates for that brand because it appeals to their benevolence or it just it feels like something like innate like they do charitable giving or whatever people feel like they can relate to in that brand is that same thing. Like that's what keeps them. And I imagine it's the same thing when you're being so authentic and true to who you are that people can see that and they're like I'm going to ride with that person. Totally. It's also it's one of the things that we do as marketers and just as content creators in general is we're constantly helping people choose a side. Right. So it's choosing a side in every issue that we're presenting in every question. We're helping them choose a side and our compassion style is right. If we're being ourselves and being authentic, we help them come to our side in everything. Right. It's the reason why they start to believe what we believe and want what we want. Right. Because yeah, we're just we're helping to move where we want them to go. This is totally amazing. It's so fun. One of the OK, so I have maybe a guess. Here we go. And then I also want to do kind of like what's exciting for you right now and kind of tell people how to get there. But I kind of think and tell me if I'm wrong. I kind of think Laura is a lift and steady and I can't get the third one. I don't know. What do you think? OK, you are wrong. I'm wrong. Yes, you're wrong. But that's OK. So I would say, Laura, I would say that you are a lead, fix, impress. Oh, I can see that. So lead, you say, I have done this before. Right. Very, very like direct, straightforward, fix. You give context. So instead of saying like, how do you feel about that? You say, tell me what happened? Right. Tell me what happened. Let's go through how we make this better and then impress. You add weight and importance. You can even hear as you're talking. Right. Anytime you think like this is so fascinating, you can hear it in your voice. So yeah, lead, fix, impress. I put, man, I put lift, but question mark because I wasn't sure if it was lift or lead and then I put fixed and impress. Like I was writing these things down as you went over them. That's amazing. Wow. Bad, not bad. Well, OK, McCall, before we're done, I want to make sure that people know what you're working on now and how they can get involved. So what is most exciting for you right now? What projects you're working on and how can people get involved? Great. So we have an event called Stop Hiding. What we have found is that great title. Thank you. What we found and the way that I feel about Christmas Files is it really is kind of sounds cheesy, but it really is life changing and world changing from what we've seen so far. Like making people themselves allows them to help other people. So we decided to do a free event because we wanted to get in as many hands as possible. So we do this Stop Hiding event where we walk you through how to discover who you are and who you're not. We dive into the triggers that we talked about of like what is causing you to be not yourself and how do we recenter? So we go through that over the five days. By the end, they have what's called a charisma brand kit, which they can look at before they create every piece of content. And it's phenomenal. I will tell you, it is so good. It's the best thing we've ever done. And it allows me on that. That sounds awesome. I'm doing it. It's so cool. So yeah, that's how that's how we're kind of trying to give back and how we're trying to help people at all levels. There's no like barrier to entry. If you don't know exactly what you do in your business yet, or if you're doing, you know, millions of dollars a year, it's a new skill set. So everybody is welcome and everybody gets tons and tons of value out of it. And it's fantastic. So you go to charisma hacking dot com and you'll find all of the info for Stop Hiding. Amazing. And you know what I love about this is it applies to everybody. It doesn't matter. Like you just said, like if you don't know what you want to do with your business, this is like paring down to the core of who you are and your own authenticity. It doesn't matter what you're doing. It's really all about who you are, which is the best place to start so that you can figure out what you want to be doing. Right. Like, yeah, so cool. This really does apply to everybody. Yeah, it's it's been an interesting thing to see people even adjust like what they do based on discovering who they are so that they enjoy it more. And they're getting more filming because people that's a big part of it. And some of your quiz too, you go through celebrities, right? And you even said, oh, there's a way like once you've kind of been through this, you could go match yourself with a celebrity and be like, OK, that's somebody that I can now maybe model. How does that work? And I'm going to hold you to it because you said you do it for me. So yeah. Yeah. So once people get into our programs, we I go through what's called their charisma counterpart. So I give them a celebrity that not only is their same charisma styles, but a lot of times, you know, people will get in their head and they're like, OK, now I know what charisma I am, but I have no idea what that looks like. Like, who am I? What is this supposed to do? So I give them a celebrity that has like their same mannerisms, not only their same styles, but their same like intensity levels that they can model. So if they want to see their charisma and like different emotions, I tell them type the celebrity's name in plus emotion into YouTube. And it's pretty good. It's been out like them talking about that things or happy things. Or if they want to see the difference between them on stage or on video, then they can look at that. And the coolest one is when they have business people, right? Anybody who has the charisma counterpart of Russell, it has just hit gold because they can go and swipe all of his CTAs. They can model exactly what he's saying, and it will work for him or it will work for them. So yeah, the business people, you can you can swipe copy, things like that, because, you know, if you get a sales script that's not in your styles, I can't tell you it's going to work for you. You have to adjust your styles. But if you get a sales script of somebody who's in your exact same charisma styles, who is your charisma counterpart, use a word verbatim and you are you are good to go. So yeah, it's really good. This is so cool. And you know, if you don't know if you don't know who the celebrities are, you had one other tip where you could actually go and figure this out. Yeah. What was what was that link? I know we're throwing a lot of links at you, but I want to make sure. Yeah, it's great. So if you go to who are they dot help, whether or not you know the celebrities, I have 25 second videos there, where you basically just say, which video do I fit with? It's it's pretty easy to see the differences, especially based on all the examples. You say, which video do I fit with? And then you don't have to know the names of the celebrities or what they're in or anything like that. So yeah, who are they dot help? So wow, this is this is fascinating. Well, we could talk to you for hours and we may have to have you back. Seriously, this is a ton of fun. Well, Laura, anything else before we let McCall go? No, I'm just I love this. I love that because you invented this. I feel like it it it holds so much weight to like me now kind of doing a deep dive on my own, you know, charisma style. And it makes me want to do some research and look into these myself because I feel like it does help when you have some sort of frame of reference of like how other people are and how they communicate and things like that. So I just I love that you on the spot helped me out with that. Like it was just it's so eye opening. And I feel like every single person I've ever met should be able to do something like this. Like it's so cool. I love that. Thank you for doing this. Of course. Yes, thanks for having me. McCall, I don't think you realize the genius of this. You're so nice. I think what happens when you start getting more and more feedback. And I know people are talking about you everywhere. But it is truly genius. And I think this can change people in such a significant easy way. So thank you for coming on and sharing your genius with us. You are an absolute rock star. You're so nice. I will tell you. I think maybe the coolest thing about charisma hacking is that it gets smarter with every single person that uses it. And all of the stuff that we do, I know it sounds really geeky, right? And kind of into the weeds, but everything we do is based on data. So every person who goes through our event, the way that it's structured is we know their answers, right? We have things on our back end, like we know their answers and we adjust our framework based on the people. So like where it started, you know, in February 2020, it gets better every single day and we're just committed to getting it right. You know, we're committed to making it the very best thing in the world. I know that sounds like what the audacity, but we really do believe that that every single person makes it smarter and smarter and makes it better and better. And so we think of it as a privilege and kind of a responsibility to give it to as many people as possible so that it can continue to evolve. And thank you for being so truly uniquely yourself. I had a team members that were with us at Funnel Hacking Live this year. And as soon as you got off the stage, all of them were like, that was amazing. Like that was that was the one. Like they took so much away from that. Everything was so crazy one point and entertaining and fun. And you just you you made it so approachable and so cool. And yeah, you you're you're a remarkable person. And I appreciate you doing sharing all of this with us. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, the high kicks come out of nowhere, man. And then we love it.
