I'm good thanks Chris. How are you. I am so good and I'm so excited like I've gotten to know our guest over the last year or so and he's been in our community for quite some time but it's been really really funny actually just spoke at Funnel Hacking live and it was fun I got to hang out with his family a little bit Becca and Mike him up back stage and that type of stuff so it was really really cool but let me introduce the one and the only Eric Thame Eric is an entrepreneur founder of Celladora Studios a multi seven figure media production agency that helps brands influencers leaders and movement builders grow their influence in their business with social video content.

So I want to thank you for joining us today. Eric this is going to be fun. How are you man? Hey what's up Chris and Laura so excited to be here. Thank you for having me. Yeah. Well I am super excited because you know what I thought about on this. Oftentimes we'll go into story and we usually talk maybe about one or the other in the Heroes 2 journey. No there's an external journey that happens. But then there's also an internal journey that happens and maybe if it's alright and Eric maybe we dig a little bit deeper on this but I kind of feel like you had two different lives here in your entrepreneurial journey like one where you built up this business and then it didn't really stand and you had to change and adapt and create. Do you want to tell us that backstory and then I want to kind of get into the publishing. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. So you know I'm a creative. I'm an entrepreneur. I've always been growing up was always like how do I figure out what I love to do and how to figure out how to make money doing it. And so that was the thing it was always creative endeavors. I started playing the piano when I was like seven years old got into art and my very first business was actually designing t-shirts for scrimmo bands on MySpace. So if you remember MySpace like I would actually connect with people all over the world and they would pay me over PayPal. And this was 2000 scrimmo bands. I don't even I don't even know what a scrimmo band is. Yes. You were so loud with the scene. I'm old. But yeah that was that was 2003 like PayPal was brand new. Like just barely come out around that time and like it was so revolutionary and I don't think I realized I was young. I didn't I was 13 years old. I didn't know how I didn't realize how revolutionary that was. But that was my first business. And then I got into website development and even iPhone development started recording studio and a video production agency. And then you know it's just a lot of creative endeavors but always with this underlying tone of like how to figure out how to make money doing this as well because there's that entrepreneurial but I think most people are either like very entrepreneurial numbers data funnels marketing sales ROI. And then and then either that or they're very much an artist which is like brand and content. And right you know aesthetics. And so I took me a long time to figure this out but I realized that it was actually unique for me to be one of those types that like I'm like a perfect blend of both. And so it's I actually love talking about just the the entrepreneurship of art and the art of entrepreneurship. Right. And so I really think that entrepreneurs need creators and creators need entrepreneurs like to really strike a point meaningful and lasting. So yeah that's a little bit about me in a nutshell. How did you as a creator as an artist. Figure out what it was like I feel like so many artists and creators out there people who are just created by nature that maybe don't feel like they're entrepreneurs but they're like man it would be great to make a living off of what I love to do. How did you find that. I don't think it was always like native for me and natural but it was you know I think that like for entrepreneurs the struggle is to figure out how to be creative right and that's like nowadays that's like my whole mission is like I want to help entrepreneurs to be creative to build brands to create content to to build something meaningful and lasting and stop like focusing so much on the tactics and the numbers and everything but like how do you actually build something that has meaning and and you know and I've worked a lot obviously with creatives as well and help them learn the entrepreneur the business side of it. And so if you're a creative you got to learn the business side if you want to make money and you want to go to the deepest levels of your craft that's that's what it takes if you're an entrepreneur it's it's valuable especially in the day and age that we're going into to learn how to be a creator. Just really like the whole it's I feel like that's my my calling my mission my past that's unique because a lot of people can't be both right if they're an artist they're like well I don't really care if I monetize this right what would you say to somebody that's extremely artistic but doesn't know how to do the tactical stuff. Yeah I mean I mean it's it's a learnable skill right like you can learn the business side of things you can learn the marketing and the sales and everything even just a little bit will will go a long way. But then but then ultimately you know being a creator really is about figuring out what is your unique craft what are the things that I'm really good at love to do and leaning into those things going deeper and deeper down that one single rabbit hole and allowing other creators to take over the other parts of the process and other aspects of it. So you know I always think about how that for example Tony Robbins right if you look at Tony Robbins is a creator and his craft is in motivating people inspiring them and helping them like Tony Robbins doesn't fly his plane. He doesn't gas it up he doesn't run the events doesn't sell the tickets like Tony is a creator who has a team of creators around him that are leaning into their thing that they're really good at the thing that they love to do. And when everybody leans into that when you when you do the personal development the self discovery to understand what is it that I really love and I'm really good at uniquely good at that's why I call your craft as a creator when you really lean into that you go this is what I'm going to focus on allow everybody else to do the things that they focus on that I'm not that good at or that I don't love to do what happens is now when you have all these creators that are working together what you find is that what we have is a creator economy and that creator economy is what we're seeing happening in the world today where it's so it's become easier than ever with social media and the Internet for people entrepreneurs people with a mission with a calling whatever to become a creator right to create their craft to do their thing and only do their thing and collaborate with other creators in the creator economy. And so I see the creator economy is being like a a worldwide business thing. You know it was Naval Ravikant said he said there are 8 billion people in the world. Some day I hope there will be 8 billion businesses right and so it's like it's like looking at yourself almost as a business as a with a mission and a purpose. But that so that happens on a worldwide scale but then also within a company within an organization as an entrepreneur in our agency we we view it the same way every every individual inside of our company is a creator is is a steward over a specific skill set that they're really good at they love to do and they allow everybody else to do their jobs. It's interesting you bring that up because that is exactly what happens inside of click funds you know everybody looks at click funds especially go to funnel hacking live and you've got this well of machine is huge production. But there's a lot of behind the scenes that happens there and a lot of it is Russell what we call he will get these brain dumps right where we get these big old brain dumps we'll come and say all right brain dump incoming whether it's a loom video or Vox or anything else and then people take that big brain dump and this vision as the creator and everybody knows their little piece and then they start plugging in and we kind of bring it back to him and he's like yeah okay that looks awesome or it doesn't will make a couple adjustments so not only yeah I think in companies that happens like crazy and for people who are more corporate America. They're not used to that you know creator like economy and it's very very different when you run by a visionary you know in somebody who is a creator and that's been something that it's taking me some time to adjust to but it's really fun because he'll just give you a little snippet and then you run with it in your own lane and in your own superpower. Yeah it's very different from typical corporate structure. For sure and it but it but also allows for a lot more freedom and a lot more creativity and I believe that when you give your employees or your creators the space to be good at what they do and and give them this space to like not maybe constantly be busy like tactically doing things but like taking time away and understanding like their energy and how to how to like become the best at their craft. You end up everybody ends up going further together because as you're treating it you're treating humans with like the space and the energy that they need in order to excel at what they do. There really is such a difference when you actually talk about the creative process and understanding how other humans need space and boundaries and to do their own thing in order to be creative to to bring their value back to the table. And I can't imagine working for a place that doesn't allow something like that. I feel like I've been fortunate to work with visionaries who are creators who work with a bunch of other creators who you know as Chris mentioned you kind of disperse put your own pieces together come back you know Russell will touch the stone if he approves and like you keep moving forward or you go back to the drawing board and you start over again but it's so great to have that sort of collaboration with other creators with a visionary who sees the big picture and how to bring all of that together with the right people. Totally well it's interesting though is I have to tell you from corporate America to there's a lot of people who can't handle that structure and you just have to find the right people where the fit so if they're a creator in their own like for me right I've tried a lot of my own stuff but I'd much rather be like an interpreneur like I love attaching myself to Russell's vision to click phones and I want to be a rainmaker right and that's where I thrive but there's some people who wake up in the morning and they need to be told what to do and they want to maybe just have the same process they want to have the same routine. Hey and that's why there's chocolate and vanilla ice cream right is because some people like things one way or another but it's very important I think you are maybe speak to that to Eric like if you are the visionary if you are the creator how have you gone about finding the right people on your team that are capable of just you giving them some vision and let them run. Yeah no it's it's a different process for for hiring that way and team building that way I the way that I look at it is that I believe that everyone is a creator right so in my terminology in my dictionary right a creator is what we all are like we were meant to be creators we were all on this earth to create to produce to build to add value to the world to add light. And I think we all have the capability of doing that now whether we all step into that calling and actually do it is is a different story but I think we all have the ability to and we all are given unique desires passions interests gifts values beliefs morals that make up who we are that's that's your the makeup of your your brand your personality right and so and so it's really seeing that inside of it starts with seeing that inside of everyone and understanding that like there's no right or wrong there's no there's no good or bad honestly I think that everybody's just different and we all have a unique combination of skills and talents passions and interests that other people don't have we were given that that was breathed into us when we were born and we were built with these things or develop them over time but either way it's like that's what makes you unique and different from anybody else and so if you see that in other people and you go what like it's it's it becomes less like you need to be this way or you need to be this way in order to be on the team it's more like we bring people into our team and we go we want to discover what their gifts are what where what are you really good at like how do you like to operate and then lean into that so sometimes that means bringing somebody in for a role and then shifting that role over time and as you start to understand like oh actually you really enjoy doing this and you're really good at this but you don't like this let's cut that part off and let's hand it off to somebody else and you find those little little pockets that everybody takes ownership of that pocket and we call that musical chairs on the bus. Yeah, I mean the real thing though I love it that happens to click models to yeah. Yeah, it just creates this really cool culture where I honestly like you know everybody feels like they have their place in the company that they are providing value to the team that they're part of the vision that part of the mission and there and like and then it couldn't operate without them and so everybody's invested they want to be part of it if you if you're to ask anybody on my team. Like if you were to ask them like what's your favorite part of working with us they would say the fact that like Eric and the team gives us the autonomy to do what we're good at. And I think that's the most important thing when you're working with creators and you see people's creators it becomes less of a task list and managing people and more of a here's the vision. What are you going to do with it. And it's super super fulfilling for them on their side right. Yeah. So I want to switch gears a little bit because I want to talk about your book because I'm one of the lucky ones that got to actually get my hands on a copy of this and it's fantastic by the way it's really really well written and very approachable and I think there's so many things that you can take out of this. I have to say Laura I'm impressed that you're already covered a cover on this too. This has been like what three weeks or something like that's that's awesome. Got it. It's not even out yet. It's not even out yet. When I'm down for the count in ill while my kids still get to go to daycare I have some time to actually you know dive into these things and this is great. And as somebody who actually used to be like a lifestyle blogger and micro influencer and have brand partnerships and stuff there was so much stuff in here that we're just great reminders but also things that like I want to start pushing myself a little bit more and you know it's a lot of things help you kind of challenge yourself to get out of the comfort of you know being behind the camera and maybe do some other things to get some attention and I like how you talk about the ingredients of shareable content but also influence so before we dive into some of the deeper stuff in here can you just talk about like the journey of creating this book and why you felt it was so necessary for people to have this. Yeah yeah great question. So this actually goes back to like the beginning of when I started following click funnels and paying attention to what was going on. I've been in Russell's world for almost eight years now and I know click phones been around what 10 years now so I wasn't at the beginning but I was close to the beginning and I went to my first FHL seven years ago and I remember you know as I went through learning marketing and learning sales and understanding funnels and everything and growing my business. I remember there like my my business from the very beginning was built off of Facebook ads right my very first mentor who was not Russell but introduced me to Russell actually helped me set up my first funnel and it was it was like ads to a VSL to a phone call and that was it like I just I learned how to do it off of Facebook ads and nobody ever taught me organic traffic or media which is funny because nobody needed to teach me because that's what I was doing prior to all of this is I was producing YouTube content for big brands like we produced over 500 million views for people and so I had like all the experience of doing that but for whatever reason I got trained on how to run Facebook ads and over years you know we had peaks and valleys and successes and like ended up you know winning our first two comic club award and then joining you know two comic club X and then the inner circle and went through the whole process in click funnels and just grew and grew and grew and everything was going great and everything just you know on the outside it just looked like everything was perfect and successful and I think that's a lot of people saw in me and my company. But it was about a year and a half ago well like two years ago. If you guys remember there was a period where Facebook ads kind of stopped working. Yeah and things are not going so well. And I remember you know prior to this I remember going to FHL and all the events and everything and Russell would always say if you publish every day for a year. You will I'm convinced that you will find your voice and you'll be financially free right. Yeah and you know I remember hearing that over and over and over again over and over and over again and always be like OK you know what that's a that's a good idea I'm going to do it I'm just going to try let's do it for a year. And I would try for 2 weeks and then stop. And then I would not post for 6 months and then try another 2 weeks and stop and I could not ever bring myself to do it consistently which is so relatable. I'm sure so many people relate to that. And it's so weird because like I had done it successfully for other brands and other people. You know sometimes you have a skill or talent you're really good at doing for your for other people. But you just can't figure out how to do it for yourself. The car mechanic who always has his car you know sitting on the side on cinder blocks. Right. Your always your last priority you know I just you know it's it's it's like I knew how to do it I think instinctively natively I'm a creative type but just like never did it or never took the time. And a big part of the reason is because I think as entrepreneurs often were taught to focus on like to pay for speed. Right. Why would I spend all the time and the energy on creating content when I can just give Facebook a dollar and immediately get leads. Right. Or in today's terms like a tenth of a lead. So you know it's changed. But but that's really like that's that's what we're taught. And and the reality is well I mean I get this later but it's but that's but that philosophy has really changed for me in terms of like what's actually important in building something that's meaningful and lasting. So I was going to say to what what what actually was the pain point of doing that and what helped you get over that actually start publishing every day. Yeah. So so what happened is you know a couple of years ago Apple started putting these notifications on iPhones that were like hey ask app not to track me and you've probably seen those and like some 95 percent of people are clicking no don't track me on those which you would if somebody asks if they can track you naturally like a quick no for me. And so that killed Facebook's ability to track people and therefore Facebook's ability to run targeted ads and kill their inventory and then up costing them like $12 billion in revenue because of that. And when your business is built on Facebook's business and Facebook's business goes down your business goes down with it. And that's what happened to me. It was around Christmas time a couple of years ago. We had costs were rising. We were paying sometimes as much as $3,000 just to book a call with a lead which is not sustainable by the way. And so and so we were right in the middle of hiring a new sales team and training them. And when you're in the middle of that like you can't stop the lead flow because then otherwise what are you going to train them on. So we just kept spending money spending money spending money and we just watch our bank accounts go further and further and further into debt. And like I said it was right around Christmas time. This was honestly the worst Christmas of my entire life. I remember spending like the whole holiday just locked in a room working stressed out just overworked. I did not see my kids. I remember arguing with my wife like just we didn't even we literally didn't even take a family picture at Christmas that year. Which to me is like so sad. I just I my photos are like my journal right and like the fact that I don't even have a memory of that year was just devastating. And so it really like it put me into a funk and there were there was a time in my business that was it was really dark and hard and difficult and honestly didn't know how I was going to get out of it. And you know I this is happening for a little while for a few months and I just knew that like I had to make a change had to do something different. I couldn't I couldn't keep going this way. And so it was it was at Mastermind and Paradise actually so all of the inner circle and to common club like all got together in Cancun, Mexico. And I remember I was at that event and hanging out. I honestly couldn't afford to be there but I was there because because you know you know that like one idea one piece of advice one conversation with somebody could be the thing that completely changes everything. Yeah. And so I went with like the faith that that would happen and and got there and it was at that event that I made a dramatic decision for my business and I decided you know I can't keep doing this. I'm going to completely shut off my Facebook ads my entire source of business everything that I have everything that is funding my life and my employees life and my team and everything. I'm going to just turn that off and I'm going to start posting short videos on Facebook or sorry on TikTok Instagram and YouTube shorts every single day like or move. He said to do it. He's like he's like this will happen and so and you made that decision while you were there. Yeah. While I was there in fact I made my first three videos at the resort. I remember those videos. Yeah. So I went and I made the videos and I didn't know what I was doing and I was just like I they weren't very good. I remember walking around the resort trying to find a place to shoot them and I was looking for a nice backdrop which is easy to find a place like that. But I was actually looking for a place where nobody would see me doing right because I was so afraid of just like being seen making this business embarrassed and it was really hard. But I made those first three videos and I committed like for whatever reason. I didn't have another way out and so I was like this is it like I'm committing to this. I'm doing this 365 days nonstop every single day. Let's go and I started doing that. I started posting when I got back home started making videos every single day and it was kind of a grind of like wake up record a video edit it publish it like for a little while until I started to figure out batching and stuff like that. I started making videos and for the first two months of publishing videos I lost followers every day because when you have an audience of people that you haven't published to in a long time like and then you start suddenly coming out the gate with a ton of content. Most of them are like who is this guy. I don't even remember why I followed you or like where you came from in the first place. And so they started leaving. I started losing people and like low engagement like not going well and like I mean just imagine this like my business is on the brink of bankruptcy. I'm counting on this as the solution to solve all of my problems and I'm seeing it failing for two months. And if anything would tell you that I was committed it's probably that that like two months in I was still going. Like I said another way out had to do this. So first two months are like that. The second two months that went flat. I was losing and gaining the same number of followers every single day. So my following stayed flat lined and then it was sometime around the month month five continue posting every single day right in the middle of month five is when things took off like a hockey stick. And yeah I went I went from like in a matter of like a week or two I went from like gaining zero followers today to gaining hundreds of followers per day and that eventually grew into thousands of followers every single day. Like you pull up Instagram you know you click on the heart button it shows you your notifications. I would scroll all the way down to the bottom as far as I could go until it stops and it's like that's enough we can't show you any more notifications and that would be like one hour ago of followers. That was crazy just watching that happen. And so you know it completely changed my life completely changed my business saved my business saved my life that next Christmas was like the best Christmas of my life I actually got to get away from my business had the team take over things and like we started just get a family picture hopefully I got a family picture is beautiful with the kids and it was just awesome. The reason I tell that story is because what people need to understand is that like this isn't about me what they need to understand is that what I would say is influence is the new currency right. What does that mean what it means is that the approach that a lot of marketers and entrepreneurs take to business is like if I want to get sales or I want to get clients or whatever my approach is like I got to go chase down the clients I got to go chase people I got to go build a funnel like build a tactic like jump into a tactic or strategy or something that's going to make money right now. But I found that a lot of times the solution to a problem is not solving the problem itself it's figuring out what problem is this problem a symptom of and what I actually make happen so that I can rather than pursuing something because what I always say is if you're pursuing something is because it's running away from you instead of pursuing something how do I make myself attractive to that thing how do I put myself in front of the lead flow where is the money going right now where is the attention where is the attraction going right now how do I put myself in front of that and the answer to that especially today's day and age and going forward honestly I think for the next decade is attention is influence it's it's being a creator online is creating content is publishing that's really ultimately where things are going and so and so I think it's crucial for people if you want to be successful from now and beyond in this new creator economy the age of the creator that we're going into you really have to start to see yourself as a creator first honestly in a lot of cases more so than an entrepreneur put that first and then allow that attention then to fuel your business and become like the currency right. Yeah and not only that but being inbound getting that inbound traffic is a heck of a lot cheaper than chasing down your potential customer right. Oh yeah we were we replaced 40 to $50,000 a month and ad spend with all the organic media and our business has not just not just not just replaced it but our business is multiplied we're still we still haven't run a single ad since that's incredible. So just from like a mindset perspective when you said at you know that event I'm going to commit to creating content every single day for a full year you know at 3, 4 months in seeing that you didn't really see the change that you're hoping for yet do you think it's because you committed like I will do this for a year no matter what that you stuck with it in order to see things really start to change for you. I committed I would say that yes because of the commitment and also I focused on building systems around creating content and that was a big part of it too because as entrepreneurs we are generally very inconsistent. Yes, this is the right and I recognize that about myself and I was like if I'm going to be consistent at this act to build a system in fact if you like word play I would like to say that consistency kind of sounds like consistency right so the solution to consistent if you're inconsistent is because you need a system right so so the system that's people tools processes like I got team members to help me I started getting building processes and tools and like in the you know project management boards to help the content system all of that ultimately became my agency that I started now we do this for other entrepreneurs so that they can they can be consistent with their content as well. But yeah that was the big thing that really helped it to be consistent it was that passion and that commitment that I'm doing this but then also combined with being smart about building a system so that this could actually become a long-term thing and keep going. I love it tell us a little bit more about what you're excited about now and like if people want to learn more about you what is the best way for them and I would assume it probably has to do with the book like tell us what you're really focusing on for the next 6 months. Yeah so I do have the book coming out in a few months so you know if you want to check that out it's at create don't capture dot com. Yep that's the book you can also get on the waitlist that Eric Thane dot com. You can also go to Eric Thane dot com and get on my newsletter I send out a newsletter with tips and tricks on how to how to find your creativity build your personal brand create content and build your business online every single week it's a whole is 100% free. This is not a sales newsletter where I'm pitching you every week this is literally just pure value to me to me I see the email is like another social media platform so just creating content. So yeah that's definitely coming up. And the book the thing about the book is that like it'll teach you. Everything about like what we're talking about how to create content how to create short form video how to be a creator how to make it go viral how to build your business around it it's got all of those tactics in it but the but the purpose of the book actually goes so much deeper and you know when you get your hands on it when you read it you'll see this very clearly that to me creating content isn't just about creating content it's about becoming a content creator. And what that really means is. Like I see content creation as a personal development journey you know they say that entrepreneurship is the ultimate form of personal development. And I think that's true but I also think that being a content creator takes it to another level because putting yourself out there getting on video is exposing right there's the when you're showing up on video in front of a camera you can't you can't hide you can't put on a side like who you are is coming across to your audience whether you want it to or not. And so ultimately it comes down to like are you OK with being who you are right and do you do you love yourself honestly and are you do you love yourself enough to be willing to put that out in front of people and to share your light and your message with the world which is a very scary and hard thing for most people. Yeah. In consistent about creating content why we struggle with it because a lot of internal battles that go on to become consistent at creating content. I think people are so afraid of what their family is going to say or oh boy there he is again or there she is again or even the comments right the haters but does there come a point where you just laugh off the haters you get thick enough skin or you have enough self worth like what happens where you can just kind of you know fend all that off. Yeah well that's that's it that's a deep internal journey of like really discovering that and I don't have time to go into that if we want to talk about it or you tell me like where we at with this. Let's go into it for a minute I want to hear this. OK we'll go into it for a minute because it's actually the part of this all of this that I think is actually more fascinating to me is that a lot of people see the external journey the here's what happened and Eric started posting and he got all his success whatever that's all fine and dandy but like what a lot of people don't hear about as much is the internal journey that I went on through this entire process. Because Russell talks about how if you publish every single day he would say there's 2 things that will happen. Number one is you'll find your voice number 2 is you'll become financially free. Or I'm convinced you become financially free. He doesn't he doesn't guarantee that right. So there's those 2 things and a lot of people latch on to the financially free part like oh yeah so cool I want that to happen right and they forget about the finding your voice part. And if you were to ask me I would say that of the 2 things the finding your voice is the more important more advantageous more beneficial to you part of that equation. And the reason is because when you figure out how to step into your purpose your calling what you were meant to do which happens as a result of putting yourself out there and creating content consistently that is the thing that ultimately is going to change your life. The decisions that what's happened in my business externally is a result of the decision making has been happening internally. It's the result of me getting clear on my values and what I care about and building from there using those as the filter through which I make every single decision. If you accept that where you are in life is a result of the decisions you've made up until this point then the goal to getting somewhere else into a better place in your life is by making higher quality decisions and the way you do that is becoming a higher quality a better version of yourself. And so that's really the whole journey that I believe that if you're becoming a content creator or an entrepreneur or creator of any type you want to put something into the world. That's the real journey that you're on and that's the real journey that you want to focus on because that's actually the problem that the other problems are a symptom of. Right. If your content isn't working your business isn't working. It's really the bigger problem is that you need to do some work on you. Yeah. And when you do that work on you and you learn how to overcome those challenges that's where things start to take off. And putting yourself out there probably is a huge part of that self-discovery. And a great practice and confidence right like when you're willing to do that and do it every day even if you absolutely suck the first few weeks of doing it. What a like there's no better way to practice your own confidence than to just commit to it right like every single day you're just going to keep getting better and hopefully you're going to start to feel like I can do this I'm getting better at it I can see myself improving.
