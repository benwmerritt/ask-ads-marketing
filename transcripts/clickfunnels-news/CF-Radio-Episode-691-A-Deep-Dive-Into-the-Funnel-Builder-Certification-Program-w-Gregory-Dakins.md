Here are your hosts Laura Demetrius and Chris Cameron. Welcome back to another episode of ClickFunnels radio. My name is Chris Cameron and is with me as always is my awesome co-host Laura Demetrius. How are you? Hey, I'm great. How are you? This I'm doing great. This is awesome because we've had so much fun over the last few months interviewing a lot of entrepreneurs, people outside of the ClickFunnels organization. But today we have a very special guest from the inside, like from right inside ClickFunnels. And this is my good friend, Greg Dakens, buddy. What's up? Hey guys, thanks for having me. Thanks for joining us today. All the way from Canada. Well, here's how I'm going to start this. This is kind of a different way to do it, but it's funny, you know, you talk about seats on the bus, all right, and getting the right people onto the bus. But then you start about talk about putting them in the right seats. And I would say, Greg, you have been a person that has been on a number of seats on the ClickFunnels bus. There's no doubt that you are the right person, but you're such a weapon that we, you know, you've been utilized from virtual hackathons to different coaching things. And now you are running the funnel builder certification. Maybe talk to us about your journey here at ClickFunnels and some of the things that you've done, what you enjoy. Ooh, sure. Yeah. It's a fun story. So, um, geez, over seven years ago now. Oh, that's crazy. Right. One of my good friends actually, we went out for dinner and he started telling me, yeah, I just, I just started working for this software company. And our other good friend that we grew up with, you know, they got this whole thing kicked off and started it. And he was working in tech sports. So his name is Hugh, Hugh Dorn. Um, he does. Okay. He's on our QA team now. He's like testing everything in the background. He's a wizard. Yeah. And I was like, dang, like that sounds so cool. Like I had experience and web design and everything before that I've used like every website builder out there. Um, I was working in automations and more of like a security field kind of thing. And I was like, Hey, like, I didn't even know that our friends like took it to this level. Let's like, can I get in on this? And he told me like, yeah, like just submit an application here and see what happens. So I got in, um, my interview went awesome. I actually interviewed with Brent co-peters back then. He was interviewing people and got in tech support, just ground floor of tech support. I was working two other jobs. I was working for the Ottawa senators. That's just like security. Um, and I was working for a government, like security automations company. But it's doing both of those at the same time. Where we are a Swiss army knife. He is a Canadian army knife. So I was working at those two jobs during the day and then I would get home and just like jump on my computer and start doing tech support. So I was taking a lot of questions just like, it was early days of click funnels. Hold on backup though. You were doing actual security. Like if things got out of hand, you'd have to use your jujitsu to handle it. Yes. Sometimes just like crazy hockey fans. This guy, Greg is also a killer martial artist too. You want to talk about like the jack of all trades? Keep going. I don't mean to interrupt, but I like to add the color commentary sometimes. Well, and we all know Canadian hockey fans can get a little rowdy. It was crazy for some of the games. So I took the job purely just to watch hockey games for free. I'll be honest, but we were in Ottawa. So we're right in between Montreal and Toronto. So those are two of the bigger markets in hockey and it's cheaper for their fans to travel to Ottawa and get seats at that arena than it is to go to a game in their own city. Yeah. So they're based. It's basically like their second home games, plus some raging like local fans that actually want to go through that tournament of having the other team take over their building. So it was just like nonstop fights for those games. All the other ones very relaxed. You get to watch free hockey. Those games, it was chaos. I love it. So then you start in click funnels, you get the gig and tech support. And I want to hear the different positions that you've had. And then I also want to hear a little bit about currently what you're doing. Yeah, especially tech support to being like an official face. Like, you are now like you are a face of click funnels. So this is an interesting trajectory. Tell us about it. Yeah. So starting tech support and we were just like, like a lot of people on the team, like click phones was so new. We're just like figuring out things as tickets were coming in. Like it was it was crazy, but it was just something that I really enjoyed doing. And within a few months, I interviewed for a team lead position. So I ended up having my own team of tech support agents under me. And then my job was just like, make sure that they're learning, they're getting better and our team is performing well, just like cranking out tickets. So I did that for quite a while. Then I interviewed and got on for a position as the at the time they were calling it the assistant director of technical support. So basically white shrewd. Exactly. That that joke came up so many times when we announced that I got that position, literally we had Dwight Giff's while we were doing the announcement. But I did that for probably over a year. And then Brent reached out to me and asked if I was interested in something called the virtual hackathons. Yeah. This was this was huge. Yes. That like above anything made me an expert in all things click funnels. So for that position, we were at one point three times a day. Eventually it became two times a day going live for anyone that had a click phone account that wanted to jump under our sessions. And we were just building a funnel start to finish. There weren't always the prettiest funnel, but start to finish. We were building a funnel with follow up funnels and everything instead of click phones classic. So I had two other people help me run that. But it was just every single day at go time. You had to be ready and you just had to build that funnel and answer all the questions live as they were coming in. You know what I loved about this? The very first funnel that I built. I don't know if you remember this, Greg, I messaged you and was like, hey, I watched this one. Can you send me the recording of it? And what I did is I watched, I paused and then I built and then I paused and built, paused and built. And it was fascinating. Like that's how I got to learn how to use click funnels. So I know a lot of other people that came in the community leaned on this big time. People were starting to build funnels. They'd come in and ask you every question and literally build with you. That's so cool. It was it was like going from tech support, though, like being behind your computer to suddenly like being on lives. Like, did you feel like you were ready for it? Like, did it take some warming up? Like, you know, at the time, it didn't feel that crazy. Like I was going live for our entire tech support team all the time, which was like at that time, like it's not as many now. At that time, it was like almost 200 support agents. So it didn't feel that weird at the time. But I have recordings of the first virtual hackathon I did. And I'm watching back is very hard to watch. It's like Russell's video. Who wants a piece of that? Exactly. And your official title now is. Yes. And now I am the manager of the Fundamental Builder Certification Program. So did the virtual hackathon for almost two years. We were almost doing that every day. And then I actually started helping out to CCX. I was a coach in CCX while still doing some virtual hackathon stuff. And then I was at the office one day for, I believe it was the webinar funnel hackathon. I got to actually sit down with Chris and Russell and everyone and found out that there was a plan for the certification program. And they wanted me to help out with it. So jumped at that opportunity like 100 percent. And we have built out what I think is the best funnel building and training program. Tell us about that. Tell us about what that that entails. I mean, first off, before you answer that, you have to understand that the experience that Greg has had doing this, he is the ideal member of the team. To do this. And I'm so excited for the people who are certifying under this because it's going to help our entire community. We talk a lot about the who, not the how. Like if you get stuck and you're running, running, running, you have momentum in your business and then you go, oh, crud, I need to build a funnel. Some people are wired that way. Maybe they're the attractive character. They're not the person that gets into the weeds or would get on the virtual hackathon and they need somebody to help them do this rather than stop and learn. There are people that Greg is training, that ClickFunnels is training to become certified in these funnel builds that you can just go and hire. And so maybe you can tell us like how you get involved with that a little bit more about the program. But that's how you keep the momentum. Sometimes it's finding that who, not the how. Yeah, 100%. So the certification program, it's more than just me, really. Like I'm just managing it. But if you sign up for the certification program, you're getting training from Russell. So Russell is teaching you the strategy behind all the funnels. I'll tell you guys more about that in a moment. You get me showing you the tactics, which is just going into ClickFunnels, showing you exactly what to do to get that end result of the funnel that you want to get certified in. We have Jim Edwards teaching you the copywriting. Awesome. Right. So like who better to teach you the copy for all of the different types of funnels that you could possibly do. And the unicorn himself. Right. And then we also have Ben Moot in there teaching us like all the funnel. I got another powerhouse. Sharing an insane amount of wealth of his experience of like we all love Ben types of things and like selling these types of services who have him on board. We have Jason, the kind of meaties doing. Oh, yeah. Training for our members. So like you get certified in a specific type of funnel. That's great. But then what do you do once you have that? Right? Like how do you start marketing yourself? How do you start selling that as a service? They start getting clients. So Jason doing live calls all the time, like sharing his experiences with that, giving insane advice. The fun Jedi. The fun Jedi himself. He's on board with us. And then we're bringing in different experts all the time to share what's working, what's not working, different experiences that they've had. It is like it is a community as well. Like all of these experts are in there, but then all the people that are going through it are in our community and sharing with each other as well. It's been so so awesome to just watch it grow. But and I have to say it is such a fun group of people. Like I've had the pleasure of getting to know some of them, both virtually and at Funnel Hacking Live and just some of them being ambassadors. They all have such great personalities. They all get along so well. And I've never met a better group of people who are just like so pumped to help everyone else. Like they do such a great job in our community. Like they're amazing. They're not just educating people, but they like love connecting with everyone. It's such a fun group. It's insane. Like it's it's a very vast group, too. Like we have people that have been in the game forever, like even longer than I have that are in there getting certified. And helping each other out with people that have within the like the last few months got started, got certified, are getting clients and sharing those experiences of going from like no idea what they're doing to now having paid clients. Some of them even will get into this beating Russell Brunson's Funnels in competitions. Come back to that. Yes, let's talk about that a little bit. Right. But at this time right now, there is there's 12 core funnels that you can get certified in. And then there's five bonus certifications, like conversions and follow up funnels and all these bonus certifications that you can get as well. And once you get all those certifications, you can actually win this nice award. That's over my shoulder. Right. I think we had most 30 people walk the stage last year. Oh, I'm alive and first year. It's the first you're doing it. First year. Awesome. And then beyond that, right? We have training to help you start selling those services once you learn how to build these funnels. So it's not just like, you know, there's certification programs that there were literally you can sign up and within five minutes have your first certification. Like, oh, yeah, it's a program where you're learning how to build these funnels, but you're submitting your work to my team. My team is actually reviewing, making sure that you're the person that's doing it, making sure that you know how to do it. Like, someone who gets this award has done the work and they have earned their seal of approval by the program and by ClickFunnels. And so that they can, you know, be agents or make money themselves. And then you set them up for success. Like, they know how to build funnels for people and not just find loopholes and work around. It's like, they're really going through the trenches with everybody. But I'm curious. I know because you mentioned it's like 12 official like funnel certifications in the program with, and then there's that like bonus ones. Do you have people in the program that get like really competitive and like want to race others like to the finish line? So how does that work? Like when they have to submit things for approval and to make sure that, you know, everything was done the right way, like what what's the average timeframe for becoming certified in a certain funnel? So it varies, right? Like we have people that can come in and within a few days have one of the easier sort of key like not that it's easier, just a smaller funnel, like a lead squeeze funnel. It's two pages, right? That's a lot less work than like a VSL funnel. Yeah. And maybe they came in with a little experience, too. That might fast track them. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Right. So someone who's been building for a while already knows what the funnel is. Just they just need to go in and do the work. Probably a few days. They have to submit their first assignment. So their first assignment is to rebuild the funnel that I've built, actually. They'll submit that it'll get reviewed and then it'll come back to them. Like, hey, you passed, you can move on to the next assignment. And that is to rebuild their own version of that funnel. So we're building everything based off of Russell's control. So the very first thing that Russell teaches everyone is the strategy and he shows them the control version of that funnel, which is like. It's like the brainchild of all the tests that he has done over all the years. So we're using that as our starting point for like all of our funnels. The stuff that works. Right. So they build that version and then they're certified. We send them digital certifications. They get listed in the funnel builder marketplace with premium listings. And they're they're then able to go and tell the world and market themselves as a certified funnel builder and whichever type that they receive. I love this. I want to talk to you about this funnel builder marketplace. Yeah, it's hard. We talked, like I said, about the who and the how. But I know a lot of you listening to you've been hit up in Facebook groups from somebody who maybe lives on the moon. I don't know where they live. You know, they maybe don't speak your language or whatever. And or five or right. You maybe have a bad experience where somebody says, oh, yeah, I can do that. And and maybe it's fake reviews. One thing that is really cool about getting somebody who's certified is they just like Greg said, they have the stamp of approval from ClickFunnels, Russell, Greg and the team. So you can know that this is somebody who knows what they're doing. So talk to us maybe about where they go find somebody like that. And if how they feel confident, I mean, is their scoring system, like, how does this work? Refuse. Yeah. So yeah. So it's super easy to go to funnelbuilder.com and on funnelbuilder.com, you have two options, which is like, in a sense, like you don't normally do with funnels, but it makes sense for what we're doing. Right. So you have two options. You come up, become a funnel builder or hire a funnel. So if you want to join the certification program, that option's there. If you're just looking to hire someone to do it for you, that's already gone through it. You click the button, it takes you to the marketplace where everyone's listed. There's a section you can go to if you want to see just the certified funnel builders that's in there, but you can actually break down by, OK, I want to see certified funnel builders who are certified in VSL funnels. You choose your little filter filters and it shows you all the people that have been served by the program and have active listing in our marketplace. Then on top of that, they get scored based on reviews. So if they've done work with other people and they left them a good review, it all shows up on there. I think it's star ratings, but you can actually click on it and see the comments from people that have worked with them in the past. Yeah, that's awesome. Then the other side you say is if you want to become a funnel builder. Who's the ideal person for that? I mean, I think sometimes people start there. Start their online marketing journey one of two ways. One is often affiliate marketing. And then this might be another way is going and building funnels for other people. So who's this for? How do they get involved? Yeah, so I'd say like anyone who's in this world like has gotten at least somewhat interested in online marketing and has at least, you know, thought about building a funnel before for a lot of people, like taking that leap of creating their own like business is like crazy to them. But if they go through this program, they learn how to build the funnels that in their work, building their own business, they end up having to learn anyways. Yeah, they learn how to build the funnel, but they also learn how to basically create a business with the funnels that they're learning how to build. So I'd say, especially for anyone like. I think that's a really key point, too. When people are like, do I want to become a funnel builder? Do I want to build funnels for other people? And then it's like, oh, wait a minute, by learning these funnels, you're actually creating your own business. Like you are an entrepreneur now. Like there this is a career path as a way to work independently for yourself and have incredible clients. Like there's so much potential in it. It's so cool to see. We're going to talk about this thing called funnel games, which just happened recently and the person who won the funnel games literally just like, I think it was like six months ago signed up for this program. Yeah, we do these like little internal competitions called designathons and the first designathon, they didn't even like place and they took the experience that they got from that, entered our next designathon, got in, I think they actually won the designathon, then joined the funnel games and was the first ever winner of the funnel games all within six months. I was like insane. My clients now is just like absolutely. It's so cool to see. And we have lots of people that are having experiences like that. It's exciting. And it's also just it's motivating. Like I was inspired watching it, getting to be a part of it a little bit. Like it was a lot of fun. So for those of you listening that don't know about it, we recently did with the funnel build, our certified funnel builders and Greg helped lead what we called the funnel games. And they are certified funnel builders got to basically compete against Russell's funnel. They created a funnel that we ended up like the top was the top 10. I think we ended up paying for traffic. Like we sent traffic to those funnels to actually see in real time what was converting like this wasn't just judge base. This was what is converting like this is how we see what wins. So tell us a little bit about the funnel games. Yeah. So this was two weeks ago now. What is even the day? Yeah, two weeks ago. And probably even later when this thing actually drops. True, right. But we had almost 100 certified funnel builders sign up to compete against each other. So when Laura asked earlier, like, do they get competitive? Yes, they get competitive, but they still all love each other and still all help each other out in some amazing community. But, you know, Russell said, hey, I'm going to show you. I'm going to give you guys my funnel. I want you guys to beat my funnel. So it was the No BS sales letter via cell funnel. They all got that funnel and create your own version of this. And we're going to choose top 10. We're going to run $10,000 a day in traffic to a split test. Everyone's going to get an equal amount of views on their page. And just the general traffic is going to decide who wins. So they started with 10. It got whittled down to, I think it was five. And then they did the top three. And then they did the final two. And then there was just one winner. So that was it was kind of agency versus individual. Like it ended up being that way. Yes. And we had some people that were just like solo funnel builders just doing it all on their own. Some people who like established agencies that have their, you know, all their funnel builders certified. So they were working on it as a team. And actually, yeah. So it came down to Brick Jiro, who is amazing, amazing affiliate as well. Amazing member of our program and agency coach, Mike Schmidt and AJ Rivera. Like everyone knows who they are, right? From funnel hubs, their team competing against Brooke on her own. No way. Isn't that crazy? Brooke crushed it. And she's really program. She was just getting her feet wet in these designathons. And what I love is that you guys have come up with really fun ways to like get people to be a little bit competitive, to use their skills to like gamify this to be more competitive and challenge each other a little bit, which I think helps everybody and to be able to like see that stuff in the community. It inspires others. It's really cool. So then we had these funnel games and I'm just hoping that now that we've we've gotten one of these under our belt and we saw how fun and exciting and engaged everyone was that we can do more stuff like this in the future. So do you know if there's any plans to do stuff like this again soon? I can't confirm or deny anything right now, but I will say I am I am on the side of let's do another one. That was amazing. It was a crazy week for the team and everyone who was chaos for a week, but it was so fun and brought so much awareness to the program and so much awareness to the actual builders themselves. I know Brooke is launching like a masterclass this week or something. Like they are so busy. I know the marketplace has lit up like, yeah, I can't see us not doing it again, but fingers crossed. Now, OK, you're saying that the final numbers that that Brooke ended up beating Russell's control, do you have any of those numbers? Like was this like by a lot was she just edging out? I mean, you have the best, arguably the best funabler of all time. And sure, he gave no, no, we have to give credit where credit to do. Like he built that core funnel for her to kind of go and tweak off of. But do you have any like numbers? Is that something that Russell is going to use moving forward now as since it was since it was beating? So I'd say like the number one takeaway that we had, which mostly came from Brooks's submission and in just. All the submissions in general and just the numbers that we saw is congruency from the ads to the landing page of the funnel really, really matters. So Brooks submission was actually quite different than Russell's funnel because she started from the ad. She looked at the ad, the colors, the design, everything was like, hey, this is actually quite a bit different than the landing page. So smart. Like the colors, everything was different. It was like really bright, really fun. Bright green, which is like not very magnetic marketing red. Yeah, not really on brand. Yeah. But it was also a breath of fresh air to see something so different. Yeah. It was fun. Um, I don't know if I'm not allowed to say this, edit this out, but it actually was like a almost 50 percent improvement for opt-ins compared to the original. Now, it wasn't the winner for sales, but they didn't edit the order form page. So the order form page was still red and black and everything. Right. So they probably got thrown off once they got there. Whereas I think if she had done the whole funnel or had that chance to do the whole funnel, she may have even outsold the control as well. Now this I want to I want to break this down a little bit because I'm seeing so much genius in this. And I don't know if Russell or you, Greg, like saw how genius this was from start to finish, because there's so many components that go into this one. Like, hey, let's see if anybody can beat ours and then we'll use it. I mean, that's that's amazing. And then to, you know, you're bringing more awareness, but you're also then getting more people involved. And you're basically getting free split testing. Sure, we put ads and everything into it. But I think that's just genius from so many levels to just say, hey, let's see if we can prove this funnel and let's crowdsource it. That's a genius. I don't know if it's kind of winning. Yeah, it's just win win win win win win win for everybody. Yeah, I thought that was so cool for Brooke, especially as a solo funnel builder to be able to build a page and get ten thousand dollars a day and ad spend being sent to it. Like, yeah, which is something that we wouldn't be able to get that. Yeah, you wouldn't be able to do that regularly. You're not going to build a funnel and be like, let me just spend ten thousand dollars a day. What a cool opportunity. What a great way to see how successful you are as a funnel builder. Like this was it from start to finish. It was just really cool to see that. And what we've got to do. Maybe we should change our order form if we haven't done that too. That's what I keep saying. You know, we should probably do Laura is we should probably have Brooke on like a follow up episode because that'd be fun to hear her her perspective and her side of this. So we'll have to do that. Yeah, and one amazing story. That's so cool. I do. I do really want to hear from her. She did such a great job. And I know that she did like some recaps like she went on and did like Facebook reels and kind of talked a little bit about the journey with it. And, you know, how all of this was still like still fresh and new for her, which is cool. But what I love too about the process of the funnel games is how I think it was like on the second or third day, Russell jumped in and he was like, hey, I got to take a look at some of these. And it was, you know, unbeknownst to everyone in the funnel builder certification program who had submitted entries that he was going to come in and say, like, I looked at some of these, I have a little bit of feedback. Here's what I think you guys can do to actually improve. So before we start spending the money, there's some minor tweaks that you guys can start to make. And he really gave feedback on how people can optimize their funnels a little bit more so that they could be more competitive. And I thought that that was really cool, that he got to go in and start kind of like testing them out, looking at them, seeing like, oh, this is interesting. But if they did this, I think it would work better. And I think some of that feedback was specific enough where people were like, oh, I think that probably has to do with mine, or I can take that and really improve mine so that I can get in the top 10. It was so cool. It's like, again, like someone like Brooke and, and, you know, he looked at a lot of them, not just the top 10, right? So some people that have just started building funnels to get Russell Branson's eyes on your funnel just now. What people make tens of thousands of dollars for that, like inner circle, you know, when Russell shows up in your room or something, you're getting like, boom. So him for him to do that is awesome. Um, I want to know what advice you have, Greg, for people who are just getting started and says, you know what, I like building funnels. What's your advice for them? I mean, you can you talk to us about pricing? Like, how does this work? How does somebody get involved? Say, maybe the funnel builder certification is the path for me. Yeah. I mean, my advice is jump in this program. I can't tell you how many examples we have of someone who, you know, was interested in this for like, maybe I'm not tech savvy enough. Maybe I don't have the time. Like we have so many examples of people that were having those same thoughts as you that like just went for it. They saw the guarantee and everything. They just, they went for it and are now just in the community thriving, having so much fun, now getting in the top 10 of the funnel games, getting clients. Like it's crazy. So it's a $10,000 investment to join the program. And what that gets you actually is two years access to the program. Oh, two years. Yeah, which is crazy. You get a ton of bonuses. You get a year of ClickFunnels 2.0, your ClickFunnels Classic. You get a bunch of bonus softwares that are going to help you and all the things we're going to teach you. And then after that two years to stay in the program, which we are constantly adding more exciting things to just $500 a year to stay in and keep all of your certifications active. No kidding. The best deal ever. And we also have payment plans as well. And on top of that, we have a 30 day money back guarantee. So if you're like, if you think it is somewhat interesting to you, take that chance, try it for 30 days. If it's not right for you, let us know before that 30 days is up. Send your money back and I can tell you, like most people aren't doing that because they start having success with this program. So it's, it's really, really cool. In clients. Yeah. Very cool. Exactly. For those of you who don't know, ClickFunnels 2.0, $297 a month, ClickFunnels Classic on the platinum is $297. I'm just doing math here. Right. Yeah. Like that's almost the whole price tag right there, not to mention the certification and getting one client, two clients. I mean, I don't know what you charge or anything, but sounds to me like. Expert funnel builders live every single day of the week. Literally Saturday and Sunday, we have team members live there for you. Wow. Stuck on anything like literally every single day, something is happening. Yeah. And I wanted to ask that because I know that there's a lot of access to different things and they have coaching and they'll have all of the resources they need at their fingertips every single day. But is this like, is it self guided? Do people feel like, you know, if they don't have as much time as others, like, are they going to feel like they can still succeed? Oh yeah. So it's all do it at your own pace. Um, and we actually have like, we have, so we have these, they're called big domino accountability calls. We do these accountability sessions every single day. And we actually have them grouped up. So until you get your first certification, you're in one accountability group. And then once you have a certification or two, you're in a second accountability group. So the first one is all about like getting that first certification, like getting started, like doing the steps in order. And, you know, some people get through that really quickly. Some don't, but that's okay. You're always surrounded by other people that are working on the same thing as you. And then that second group is, okay, we have a certification. Now what do we do? How do we start marketing ourselves? How do we get our first client? So we have that all thought, thought of already, like we make it so that it's super easy for anyone to go through it at their own pace, whatever that paces for them. Yeah. I love it. And there's really nobody better for this because you came from the very beginning being in tech support. And it's funny because I find myself, you know, I have a lot of different teams under me, one of them being education. So I have them as a great resource for when I have questions about software, but you get so many of the best answers or the quickest answers that you need effectively from people in or that have been in tech support. So the fact that you started there, you've had so many different seats here. You're leading, you know, the funnel builder certification program. Like, do you, do you feel like you found your groove? Like you're in your happy place now? Oh yeah. This is like what I've always wanted to do at ClipFunnels. Like even before we started this, when I was doing the virtual hacktons, I was like, Hey guys, like we should do a certification program. I'm kind of doing that. We just need to give them some ribbons at the end. So yeah, it's like, it's what I've always wanted to do. It just, it feels so right. And I will add too, Laura, like what you're saying, like having someone who's been in tech support being important, like almost every other member of our team, with the exception of Jason, who came in like from the outside world, the funnel everyone else was in at some point, at some point in tech support and like thriving in tech support. Yeah. Every single team member on our team is an absolute wizard with all the tech stuff. Yeah. And it was such a long way, knowing the, the fundamentals and the foundational stuff that started this software so that you can build and on top of that help others. And I see what you're doing in the, in the community and in the group. And it's exciting to see. It's awesome. And it's great to have you on the podcast talking about this.
