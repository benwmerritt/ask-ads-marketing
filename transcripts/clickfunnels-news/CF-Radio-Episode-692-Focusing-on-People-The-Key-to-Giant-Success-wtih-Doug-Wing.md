Laura, how are you today? Hello, hello, hello. I'm doing great today. Thanks, Chris. Well, I am very excited for our guest. This is maybe something that has not been nearly as traditional for us here at ClickFunnels and at ClickFunnels Radio. I want to introduce Doug Wing. This guy for 45 years worked at Little Giant as a VP of sales. This guy was also an owner. It's actually kind of a family business. His story is fascinating, but this company has done, they really grew to like 200 million in annual revenue, making them the third largest ladder company, but has since retired. He's now living in Phoenix area. He recently founded this investment group for real estate, real estate property management called Boar's Investment Group. He also has a book called Giant Success and his newest book is called The Giver. It's exciting because he's engaged to Heidi. I want to say her name right. Why don't you just say that for me, Doug? It's pronounced ballad high. This is exciting and she's actually coming to the States tomorrow. This is going to be really, really cool, but hey, welcome out, Doug. It's so good to see you, my friend. Chris, Laura, thank you. It's a real honor to be on this program. I really appreciate it. Thanks for joining us. You've done so much. A lot of times we'll have coaches. We're going to have experts on here and people want to talk about landing pages, but your expertise has been growing a very, very large, not only physical company, e-commerce company, but it's a huge business. How many employees did you have at the top? Like, what were the most employees that you guys had? Right around 400. It's a massive company. 200 million a year with a physical product and it's based out of Springville, Utah. That's the manufacturing and everything else. Well, okay, you also did a lot of sales. So we may dive into that a little bit, but I want to kind of know one of the first things I want to know is your dad founded this company and he has a legacy and that's really kind of what this book, Giant Success, is all about. I want to know maybe some of the pros and cons about a family business. Can you talk to me a little bit about that? How's it working with your dad, maybe with your brothers? What's that like, especially when it's such a large business? Yeah, and try to remember in the beginning, it was very small, the company was. My dad started it. We had a couple of people in manufacturing. We had a couple of people in sales and then you have a 10-year-old Doug and a 12-year-old brother, my brother. Honestly, we started at the very bottom. My dad was super smart. I mean, he was kind of old school, kind of a little hardcore, but we started out sweeping the shop, cleaning bathrooms, and then gradually we would work into manufacturing. One thing I really admire and appreciate my dad for was that we weren't just given everything. We started at the bottom. We learned every part of the company and especially manufacturing. We did that for years and years during our school years and junior high and high school and even going through college and different things like that. That really served us well because when we got into sales and we met with customers, we knew exactly how the products were built. That was the first thing. We had to explain it to people, but it also gave us an appreciation for our employees who worked so hard for us year after year building these products. That was hard work. It really gave me an appreciation of these people that busted their rear ends for us year after year. It helps you to appreciate what they do for you as your employees. I loved reading this book. I think I listened to it on a playwright. It's a quick read. It's awesome. I knew some things about your dad. I grew up here locally in Utah. Your dad not only was the owner of this business, ran the business, but he also did a lot in the community. From your perspective, there's a lot of business owners that listen to this. What would you say to somebody? This guy was the mayor of Springville. How did he and how did you continue to balance this work life community church? How do you balance all of that at the same time? One thing about my dad that was really impressive that I talked to people about is when he passed away, he was good friends with Gary Herbert, who was the governor of Utah. He actually spoke at this event. He said, how wing always told people that he was in the latter business, but that's not true. How wing was in the people business. My dad just loved people. He cared about them so much. He as an employer, he really loved his people. That made a huge difference. They knew he cared about them. He knew every person, all 400 people by name. He could walk through the shop. He could walk through the office. He knew something about every one of them. He took an interest in them. He really loved them. I'm telling you, our employees knew that my father loved them and cared about them. I know that they worked extra hard for him. In fact, Jerry Jessen, one of the employees that retired from our company, he said, I knew your dad loved me so much. It made me work even so much harder because I didn't want to disappoint him. He just loved people. A lot of people don't know. It sounds like he was the dad to everyone. Yeah. A lot of people don't know that he was a big giver. That second book was written about his philanthropic efforts and what he did. He did a lot of things in secret. I didn't find out about a lot of them until I wrote Giant Success because I interviewed almost 40 people. People came up to me and in these interviews, they'd say, your dad did this for me. He did this. I was like, what the heck? I didn't even know. Anyway, he just was incredible. Really he built people. There's a plaque on the front of Little Giant. You've probably seen Chris that says, if you concentrate on building the business and not the man, you will not succeed. If you concentrate on building the man, you achieve both. He really was a builder of people. He took extra interest in people who were down on their luck, people who came out of prison. No one would give him a chance. My dad, I think he was an underdog growing up. He was short. He had really bad acne when he was growing up and he got teased a lot. He looked out for other people who were a little down on their luck. From a personal perspective, and some of those who know me may know this, that my brother and Doug actually worked together for a while. My brother did some telecom sales at Little Giant for years. These guys were on the road. One story that he told me, Doug, is he was in a meeting or something like that and he said, how walked by and went in and said, Ted, come with me. You guys all walked out to the back and he said, we're going dirt bike ride because he knew Ted loved to go dirt bike ride. He said, Ted, you know, he was going to do something that he would do after work or sometimes during work with you guys. So I want to say thank you because I know from personal experience, you know, the type of culture that you have there at Little Giant. That's pretty fascinating. One thing that I want to ask though, okay, and we're going to get into the business side of this a little bit more is you're a physical manufacturing company. You get these big companies, you know, where you sell a lot of ladders to, I don't know, AT&T or to Home Depot. How did this, how did you kind of navigate technology through the years? We have a lot of people who are online and I know you did some of the stuff where you do even demos online. How did you guys harness technology over the years into what and what and how you're using it today? Well, the answer to that question is we had a lot of really smart people working for us and that's one thing that my dad was really good at is he knew that he wasn't the smartest at everything. And so he got smart people to, you know, to do marketing, to do manufacturing, to do engineering, to do all these things. And so he would surround himself with talented people. We knew we had great products. We had the best products in the world. We spent a lot of money on innovation and quality and that really helped us pay dividends, but of course you have to get the word out as well. And so really what made the company hugely successful and a lot of people don't know this, but when we launched our infomercial, Little Giant was, we were almost out of business. I mean, we kind of been, you know, sitting on our laurels for several years. We had renewed our patents, but we were kind of one trick pony type of company. And that, when those patents expired and when other competitors came out at half the price of ours, it really made us become a better company. And the start of that was the infomercial. And so here you got these companies that came out and knocked us off for half the price out of Asia and everybody was panicking. People were leaving and the one person that never panicked was Hal Wing. He said, Hey, this product sells well at trade shows at fairs by doing a demonstration, you know, by being in front of people. And so we decided, and the interesting story about the infomercial is Little Giant did not have enough money to do an infomercial. At that time it was a million dollars. And, you know, right around that price and my dad leveraged his farm. This is the kind of confidence that how we had in his ability and also in the company and the employees and the products, he went and leveraged his farm, got the money to do this and it was a huge success. Now, I think one of the reasons why it was a huge success was number one, the products were great, but number two, Hal Wing was on the infomercial and he had such passion for the company that it made it hugely successful. But what Little Giant did after that, kind of to answer your question is, is we went into innovation. We, we learned from our mistakes and we took the money. You got to remember we doubled our, we four times our sales in one year. Wow. And then next year we forced times our sales again. And so we had this huge amazing experience where we were building ladders 24 hours a day, six days a week, three shifts. So we took a lot of that money, reinvested it back in the company and innovation and in new products. And from there, you know, we went out and grew the business. And so, but, but again, as it got, you know, as things changed in the business world and people didn't go to trade shows anymore, then we started doing more video marketing and online selling and different things like that. But, and that really helped us. We went into COVID because COVID, everything was shut down and we had, we built this huge studio and called it little giant live and did a lot of our meetings and different things like that over zoom and different things, you know, like that. So we really, I mean, we involved, we evolved from big time from what we were. Yeah. Massive, super massive growth. And I love that your journey started by focusing on the people, putting people first, which grew your business. And then with your business growth came advancements in technology. It was kind of like an organic path that probably happened very rapidly. Yeah. And the one thing about, you know, a lot of people say, how did you guys do what you did? How did you grow the company selling at two or three times, sometimes the price of your competitors? And the way that we did that was growing it through building relationships with people and then listening to what they needed, what their why was. And then we built products to help them be more successful and more safer because ladders, ladders are dangerous, right? People fall off ladders and they get hurt or killed, you know, all the time. And so we, we listened to our customers and built them what they needed. And then we built quality and we did that through patents and all that stuff. And that really helped the company grow. But I always say, you know, I, I never felt like I was a salesman. I felt like I was more like an advisor and we would go to customers and say, what do you need, you know? And what do you, you know, what are your, what are your pain points? And they would tell you, and there were times that we didn't have a product that they had and I would go out and try to source a product, even if we didn't make it. And so people appreciated that, that you weren't just trying to sell them something, but you were there to help them be more safe and more successful. Yeah. Were there times where you had, for example, somebody who said, hey, this is my pain point, were you able to go and create the solution for them with little giant products? Did you take something and say, all right, this is what the industry needs. And I've heard it five or 10 times and then go and create a product and fill that. Great question. Yes. And that's where your brother came in and work and I worked together. So what happened was, is we were invited, we were at a trade show and we had three individuals that worked for big cable companies, Charter, Comcast and another one, and they were safety directors, even though they were competitors, they worked together and their number one and number two issues they had were like Comcast people crash into vans, right? Back and into people, back and into buildings, back and into poles or crashing. And then the other one was people were falling off ladders and they were hurting, also hurting their shoulders and backs because the ladders were a hundred pounds that they were using. And so we had these three gentlemen come up to us at the show and they said, is there any way you guys could take an extension ladder, a 28 foot ladder from a hundred pounds down to 50? And I was sitting there thinking that. Cut in half. Yeah. And there's no way we can do anything like this. These were fiberglass ladders. We didn't even make them at the time. And Ryan Moss, our CEO, looked at these three gentlemen and he says, yes, we will do it. And they walked off. We got their cards and everything and we gave them our cards. I looked at Ryan, I said, Ryan, we don't even have anything like this. And he says, we're going to make it. And what had happened is they went to Warner Ladder Company, Louisville Ladder, Bauer, all these companies, and they said, yes, we will make them. And then they just lied and didn't build them. And those gentlemen later became my friends and they said, when you guys told us, you could build those ladders. We walked off and said, these guys are a bunch of liars, too. Well, Ryan went back to work with, you know, all the engineers. And I think like three months later, we had a ladder, we had a prototype. And we called these people up and they go, yeah, what do you want? We go, we've got your ladders. Where do we send them? And they're like, you got to be kidding. Three months. Yeah. So what happened was is they said, well, we're having this big meeting with all the cable companies, all the safety people, ship them out there, bring them out there, show them to us. And so we brought the ladders out and their minds were blown away. I'm kidding. And so we, you know, they said, well, could you build us like 15 or 20 of these? And we'll test them out in the field with all our technicians. And so what happened was they loved the ladders so much that they were supposed to take them, the techs were supposed to give them to other techs after a couple of weeks and then let them try them. But people would almost get in fights over these like Comcast. They would be like, this is my ladder. And so what happened was it reduced their accidents hugely. And they were like, at first they were like, you know what, we're just going to replace all these ladders, you know, as they break and wear out. But they saved so much money. They saved millions of dollars in workman's comp claims that they went and bought all of the ladders. They just said, this is worth it. We're going to sell or give away or trash our old ladders. We literally took over the cable market within one or two years. And the other ladder companies didn't have, we just nailed them. I mean, we, they were so surprised. We took it over. I remember being at a trade show and the guy, the CEO of Warner Ladder walked up and he goes, man, you didn't just take some of the business. You took it all. And I thought to myself, we did it by listening. And Warner was one of the ones that they were so mad about because they just lied and said, yeah, we'll do it. And they didn't do it. Well, by that time they started to try to copy the ladder, you know, and figure out they were like, they were behind the eight ball already. And they could never figure out how we got the ladder as light as we did. And they never, you know, we just kept the business. And so again, it was just listening to the customer, building what they want. Stay with quality. And, you know, we were able to sell, gosh, in five years to the cable business, it was, you know, probably 150 to $180 million in ladders that we sold to these guys. And we still have all the business. It was just incredible. And Ted was part of that, your brother. That's awesome. That's so cool. In fact, I was, I was planning to ask you some questions about sales, but really, I, it's funny that there's this underlying theme of like simplicity, right? What do you, what do you want to sell your customers? In fact, why don't you just turn around and ask them, like, what is it that you need? And when you have an established business like that and you just listen to what, what it is that they're requesting and you deliver on that success happens. Like it's, it's quite simple, but I think so many people actually struggle to do that. Yeah, you're exactly right. Like if you walk into buy a car today, I mean, things are a little bit different now with COVID and everything, but man, car salesmen are the worst. They just, all they do is just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. They don't listen, right? They just try to be so pushing aggressive and you don't need to do that. You know, you have one mouth and two ears. Just listen to people and see what their needs are. Take care of them, you know, provide a quality product. But so many salespeople are just terrible. I mean, it's just, you know, they just, they're just too aggressive. They don't listen and they don't build a relationship. I mean, I'm best friends with the guy at Charter that was the safety guy, the guy at Comcast that was the safety guy. The guy is a time warner. You know, a lot of these guys are retired now, but we're still friends. And so we develop a relationship first and people buy from people that they like and trust, okay? And so you do that first and then, you know, you, as you build a relationship and let people know, hey, this guy is a nice guy. He's a good guy and he's got our best interests, you know, in mind. Then, then you go, you know, and help them. Yeah. I want to go back a little bit too, because I have a question about the family business that Chris touched on earlier. And I'm very curious about the contrast of, you know, being a part of a family business and the legacy that your dad built with the company. What are some things that you kind of carry in that legacy that you want to continue on or, you know, things that he did? And then on the reverse of that, what things do you think you do quite differently? Uh, you know, that's, that's a pretty interesting question. I mean, you know, I'm involved in another company right now and, um, we really try to treat our employees, you know, in a special way and, you know, let them know that they're important and that they're loved and cared about. Um, you know, our culture at Little Giant was so interesting. Um, every meeting we had, and I know this blows people's minds, but every meeting we had, we had prayer before these meetings. I remember this. Um, I remember this one couple came from back east and they were not of our faith, which is great. I mean, a lot of people pray, right? Of course, and they believe in God. And, but, um, this guy, he comes up to me and he goes, I've never been in a meeting like this before. You know, he goes, this is, this is just unbelievable. You know, I can't believe it. And so, but it was just a short period of time. And then him and his wife, they were, you know, saying the prayers before our meetings. But, you know, just things like that. Um, we had real Christmas parties where my dad would read out of loop to the story of Christ and, and share his feelings about that. And, and, um, you know, not everybody there was a believer, but he didn't, you know, parameter down people's throats, but, uh, just, you know, I'll give you a quick story about my dad. Like we had a, I don't know, we have limited time, but we had an employee that got themselves in really bad financial, um, trouble. And, you know, we're in a meeting, the management team, my brother, um, and I, and the CFO and the CEO of the company were, were in this meeting and my dad pops in and, and, um, you know, he would just, my dad was kind of, he was retired then, but he's like, Hey, what's going on guys? And our CEO, Ryan said, Hey, we've got an employee that kind of got himself in trouble and he's actually going to lose his house. And man, he just, you know, he's kind of down on his luck and I just wish we could do something. And my dad goes, well, isn't he on a quarterly bonus? And, um, Ryan said, yeah, he's on a quarterly bonus. And my dad goes, does he make his bonuses? And we're like, yeah, he gets his bonus every time. This was like about 70 or $80,000 that he needed. My dad goes, give him the money. He'll pay us back. And so we actually gave him the money. He was able to keep his house and he got his bonuses every time and he paid us back. Now that employee is still working there. A little giant. And I'm telling you, if, if my dad called that guy at one in the morning and said, I need your help, he would be there, but he was so loyal to us. But, but how many bosses do that? Right. Right. Nobody does it. And so, you know, these, like I said, in the beginning, our employees knew that we loved them, we cared about them. I mean, we, every month we would, uh, you know, sign birthday cards for every employee, you know, the management team would, and every employee at little giant got their birthday off with pay. So we did little things like that that just, you know, just, they just were so loyal to you because they knew, gosh, these guys care about us. We're valued and, um, they would bust their backs for you. And, and it was, it was really neat to see that. Now, I don't know how I'm any different. I can go back and answer your question. I mean, the, the, the two partners I have right now in our new business, um, we do a lot of the same things. Um, we only have probably 120 employees now, but, but we try to help people who, you know, are a little down on their luck sometimes and give them opportunities. And we try to do the little things to help them and to let them know that we love and care about them. That's really beautiful. And I love that there, there doesn't have to be many differences in how you do business together, especially with the way that he ran his business and building trust both ways and how you carry that on into your businesses. Now, I think that that's really beautiful. I want to back up. Yeah. I want to back up for a second. If I could, I mean, I love that we talk about this connection. We talk about people because I'm a firm believer in that too. Um, how has that been? We also talked about innovation. You know, now you're oftentimes you've got the, you know, and I know you, you're not a little giant anymore, but I kind of want to continue to dive into this. How did you handle those relationships when you're doing like a live on zoom? How could you create that same connection? Was that a struggle? What did you do to try to make sure that that, that wasn't lost? I wasn't there, um, when they, you know, during the COVID, when we did a lot of that, but I'm, I'm sure that, um, they had relationships, you know, maybe it was different a little bit in that we weren't doing face to face, but nobody was doing a lot of the face to face. But, um, they still managed to find out people's wise and then, um, they would do those video, you know, the zooms and things. They would get that information before and then be prepared when they were doing their meetings to, okay, here's their pain points. This is what they're doing, but I'm sure that our sales guys, I know they, I know quite a few of them that were still there. And of course they would keep in contact with them through the phone, through, you know, um, they had good relationships and they kept those relationships. The best way they could through texting, phone, video chat and zoom and all that stuff. Were they doing like live demos? I mean, is that what you did? You built a studio where people could come in and maybe the board could jump on and watch somebody like you go in and actually demo the ladder. Yeah. So what happened is it's a beautiful facility. They have their sense. We were doing like over 300 trade shows and our guys were going on. Man, that's a ton. I mean, our guys were going out every other week. So you look at the money that we were spending on travel and hotels and all that stuff. And so they took that money and invested it into the studio because everything died when, you know, when COVID came in, it just shut down. So they took all that money and they were able to, you know, pay cash for this beautiful and they called them the hawing studio and it's really beautiful. And, um, I mean, we were doing, we could do stuff for QVC or, you know, Lowe's or Costco or any of those people, you know, we could train big companies like big construction companies. Cape Ted was doing stuff on cable. You know, they would say, okay, we're going to do this Southeast regional thing for Comcast and then people would zoom, you know, would go on the zoom and Ted would go through all the new innovations that we had for people. So it worked out really well. I love it. I'd also love another thing that you do, Doug, that people don't know about as you give back in the community in a big, big way. I know that you've done the honoring, you're honoring heroes foundation. And I've, I've had the opportunity a number of times to go on this motorcycle ride and it's fun. I mean, this is cool because we'll get the highway troll and all these local chapters that will like seriously, um, you know, block off intersections and lights. And we have a bunch of fun. Um, I'll tell you a funny story of my wife when she was going to go with me. She said, so, okay, so we're doing this Halloween ride, but it's in July. Am I supposed to wear like a cat outfit or something? I'm like, no, no, no, Jen, it's Halloween Memorial ride. This is not a Halloween ride. It does sound like it. Now that you say it, like, I know, anyways, we did this, we, we've do it every year that we can. And it's, it's, it's just a lot of fun. So talk to me a little bit about some of the other things that you're doing. Maybe even that foundation, how you're giving back to the community and why that's important. Well, that was one thing that we learned from both my mom and my dad is that my dad would always say the money I have, the things I've been blessed with are not mine, but they are kind of on loan to me throughout my life. And he would say someday I'm going to have to give an accounting. Hey, I really blessed you. What are you, what did you do with all these things? Did you, did you just, you know, spend it on yourself or did you help other people? And that was one of really one of the neat things I learned about my dad when he was gone and, and my parents is, man, some of the things they did were incredible. Of course they were in private. Little things, you know, like, I interviewed a guy named Steve Curtis and he goes, I was kind of your dad's, like guy that did all these special projects. He goes, I remember the first time I came to work for your dad, he called me and said, meet me out in front of this guy's house. And he goes, I, we showed up, I met your dad and your dad said, Hey, I want to put a new roof on this guy's house. He's kind of down on his luck. He goes, ring his doorbell and tell him we're going to put a new roof on this house and my dad leaves. And Steve's like, I didn't know what to do. He goes, I'm like, is this for real? And so he goes, I ring the guy's doorbell and the guy, the guy comes to his door and he's like, Hey, I know this sounds weird, but there's a guy in the community. He doesn't want me to use his name. He wants me, he wants me to tell you that we're going to re-roof your house. And, and, and the guy's like, is this a joke? Is this some kind of a undercover TV thing? But the thing I like about my dad was who goes around or who find, I don't know how my dad found out, but how do people, how did he go around and look, you know, for needs and stuff for people? But I think my dad really was aware of those types of things. Um, and he just always kind of looked out, Hey, who can I help today? Who's, who's live? Can I bless or lives? Can I bless? And so that's kind of what one thing I do is as I go throughout my day, I'm like, okay, you know, I'll, I'll say my prayers in the morning. I'll say, you know, is if there's anybody I can help today, kind of guide me to them, you know, lead me to them. And it works. I mean, I, I end up finding people that I can help it. But I think that's one thing my parents were so good. There were such good examples at doing that. Um, and, and they just had integrity. Um, one of my, if we have time, I'll tell you this amazing story that's going to be in my new book. I'm writing this new book about integrity and the stories are all about my life and my dad's life and my mom's life. And, um, so I'm writing, I'm writing the first book and I'm interviewing, uh, a guy whose name is Curtis Bennett. And he used to be the, he used to run the, he was the general manager, OC Tanner, jewelers in Salt Lake. My dad really loved jewelry, you know, and he, he enjoyed wearing nice jewelry. And, but my mom was the one he would spoil her. And she just, you know, she was, she was Mrs. Wing, but she was also Mrs. Bling, you know, anyway. So here's a story that's going to be in the new book that's incredible. That's it. That's just a story of integrity. These people come into my dad's office a couple. They are down on their luck. They are going to lose their home. They're going to lose everything. And people would come into my dad and some would ask for money, but some would just say, cause you know, what can you do for us? But this couple comes in and they've got this trunk. It's a, it's a pretty good size trunk. And they walk into his office and they said, Hey, we're, we're a little down on our luck and, well, we have this jewelry. Can we show it to you? And my dad's like, sure. You know, and so they bring this trunk and they set it on his desk and they open it up and it's just full of like these family heirlooms and beautiful jewelry that they had inherited from their, from, I guess, from their parents or grandparents. And they said, Hey, we don't know what this jewelry is worth, but you know, we think it's worth this. And they said to my dad, if you'll give us a hundred thousand dollars, we'll give you this jewelry. And my dad looks at this jewelry and he says, I think your jewelry is worth a lot more money than a hundred thousand dollars. Would you let me make a phone call to my friend, Curtis Bennett? And you, you know, in Salt Lake and see if he could come up and you could show him your jewelry. So he calls right there when they're in the office and he says, Oh, yeah, send him up. So this couple goes up to see him and it's beautiful jewelry. And I never knew the story. And Curtis says, it took me about two years to sell this jewelry for them. But he goes, I ended up selling it all for two and a half million dollars. Whoa. Whoa. And he said, here's the cool story. About your dad. He goes, your dad knew exactly what that was worth. And he could have easily written a check for a hundred thousand dollars and take advantage of these people and said, Oh, I'm helping them. But no, that's not what how we did. The best part of this story is after all the jewelry was sold, that couple came back to my dad with a check for a hundred thousand dollars. My dad wouldn't, he wouldn't take it. Wow. I love that. That's with phones from that story. That's so sweet. Yeah. That's the kind of man that Halloween was and the kind of person too, you know, that my mother was, is they were just so full of integrity and goodness. And so growing up in this family, again, we weren't perfect. There were times when I was younger and I was working and I didn't like my dad because I had to do the same monotonous jobs. But it sounds like you definitely instilled the value of hard work in your family, which is, it's amazing. It's something that not everybody does anymore. But to grow up with that, it's such a life lesson. Yeah. One of my favorite things you would tell the salespeople is you can tell the customer anything you want to, as long as it's the truth. And so he's had these little one-liners that are in this, that are in my book giants just in the back, you know, that, yeah, he would say things like, don't lie, don't steal and don't be lazy. You know, just the basics of, you know, be a good person. And do the right thing. So they were great. I love how you honor to your parents. I mean, that is something that happens less and less. And you know, it's really interesting. And I don't know if you caught this, Laura, every time we're asking Doug about him, he's talking about where he learned all of this stuff. And, you know, I love too is, is here's the book. The book is Giant Success. Go check it out. GiantSuccess.com. I loved reading it. There's so many principles that does not matter what type of business you're in, what type of relationships you have. All of these things apply across the board. Well, maybe before we let you go, Doug, maybe you can tell us just a brief little thing about what you're doing now, what's getting you excited in business and then tell everybody where they can go to kind of learn more about you. Yeah, right now. So I, I had this friend who is, he's really big into apartments. And we surfed together in some church stuff. And one night he said to me, you and I are going to be partners together sometime. And I was like, I don't, there's no way I'm ever going to be doing something with him, you know. And so interestingly enough, interestingly enough, I ended up going through a divorce and I had to pay dearly for this divorce. You know, it was, it was, it was, you know, I was married a long time. And, and I lost all of my savings. I mean, I was all the money I had in 401k was pretty much wiped out. And then, you know, things. And then as I ended up selling the business, he came, this friend of mine came back to me and he said, Hey, you know, we should, you should get involved with us in, in multifamily housing and real estate and property management. And it actually worked out really good because again, as I mentioned, my savings is gone. And so I ended up becoming involved in it. You know, we started a new company, born investment group. And we have a bunch of different apartments, multifamily housing, property management, we do some Airbnb stuff, but mostly, you know, monthly around colleges and different things like that. And it has been a huge blessing in my life because the income that, you know, that's generated from, from these properties will just go on and on even after I'm dead and gone, you know. And so it's, it was a real big blessing and I'm involved with two awesome men that are just so, they're just like my dad. They're so honest. They have integrity. And so it's been a really fun blessing in my life. I don't really do a lot. These guys are the experts. You know, I don't really do a lot of the day to day operations of the company, but we're also able to help, you know, other people and employ people. And, and it's been, it's been great. But the main thing I've really been doing the last couple of years is working on books and doing a little speaking, working as I mentioned, I'm working on my third book and my first publisher was out of Texas, but now I'm involved. I don't know if you've ever heard of Mark Victor Hansen, but he's one of the most successful. You can sue for the soul. Yeah. He's a co-creator along with Jack Cantfield. But anyway, I went to dinner with him one night in Scottsdale, Arizona. And he's like, tell me about your first book. He goes, I've heard of your dad before I know about Little Giant. And I tell him some stories. And he's like, I want to sign you to a publishing contract with our company. And I was like, what the heck? And he says, this book is going to be called The Giver. And believe me, Doug, it's going to be a bestseller. And I kind of laughed, you know, and it was. And that was exciting. But my first book, too, I had a buddy named Jeffrey Gittimer. He's like a big, big time sales trainer. He did. Yeah. He did the foreword for it. Yeah. He's he's written this. This is the most successful sales book ever written, the Little Red Book of Selling. But yeah. And anyway, he told me after I told him these stories about Little Giant, he goes, you're going to write this book and it's going to be a bestseller. And I laughed at him and he's like, do it. And so anyway, I didn't see it. It was right. Yeah. Both of these men were right. And so, you know, one thing I really enjoyed is I learned a new talent, right? I learned how to do something. And it's been a lot of fun. I'm working on number three. And I do a little bit of speaking. One thing I really like, I've done a few companies, but I really love it. I've spoken to several schools and I love it. The kids just need to stuff up. And, you know, if I can make a difference in some kids' life, because I when it was a sophomore in high school, my I had an English teacher in front of the whole class. She told me I was stupid and I never amount to anything. Oh, man. I've been trying to find this teacher for a while. She's alive. Oh, man. And as youth, you carry that stuff with you. Yeah. But I knew I wasn't because I had an amazing mom and dad who had super confidence in themselves. But I'm looking for this lady all the time and I want to take her to lunch and say, I did OK, you know. Yeah. Wow. Wow. And you can have such an impact on youth. So being able to speak to students like grade school students must be so impactful, so cool. Yeah. I went and did like it. I swear it was like a second or third grade. These little kids and they read the book as a class and. Oh, I love it. And the teacher said, what are some of the things you learned from the book? And a little girl raised her hand. She goes, patience is a waste of time. That's what my dad used to say. Holy cow, these kids, these kids are so hard. And, you know, my dad wasn't very patient. And, you know, he was, yeah, he was like, let's get it going. Let's get it done. You know, key takeaway. Yeah, we can talk to you all day to Doug. Listen, key takeaway, speaking of that, like, oh, my gosh, really focusing on what people need. People matter, whether they're employees, whether they're the customers. Where's the best place for people to go and learn more about you? You want them to go to giant success.com? Is that the best place? Yeah, giant success.com is great because it talks about, you know, there's a lot of things on there about how and and about, you know, my training and my speaking and the books and everything like that. That's where you can find all the information. So perfect. We appreciate you being on. I'm loving this episode, one of my favorites. And we'll talk to you soon. Thanks so much, Doug. Thanks so much, Doug. This is great. In an honor. Thank you. I hope it's been OK. Yes. Thank you.
