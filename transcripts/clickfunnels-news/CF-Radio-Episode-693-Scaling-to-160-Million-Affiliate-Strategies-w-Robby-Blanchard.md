Hey welcome back to click funnels radio my name is Chris Cameron and this is pretty special episode because we are live at an event here in Orlando, Florida which is super exciting because we're really close to our guest. Like geographically which is really really cool and wanted also bring on our new VP of partnerships to Ben Harris who we're super excited to have back is kind of been full circle for you been a percent so it's been really good to come back sink my teeth in a couple things and including just kind of being the sidekick here so I'm I love it. Yeah, I love it. I mean you're going to be handling partnerships and getting affiliate stuff and so what is really cool about that is one of our most consistent all-time affiliates we have with us who's just up the road in orman we're down here in Orlando with the Ritz Carlton for webinar con and Robbie's also sponsoring so I'd like to welcome on Robbie Blanchard so Chris how you guys doing something that's up man doing awesome and this is exciting to have you here. I think it's really interesting as we talk about especially you coming on and you as an affiliate. There's a lot of different ways to do partnerships there's a lot of ways like we're out here sponsoring an event and I think sometimes you know if you get the right events and you do the right things you can are why an event. Yeah, but sometimes that's really hard like you put money in and that's not direct money that comes back out for sure like how do you best successfully sponsored event and see that ROI. Well I think the way the best way to do it is you have to play a long game always. I think if you're expecting to get an ROI like on day one it's I mean I'm running a Facebook ad you know it's a sponsored event so so for me it's it's getting in the room network of people gives another reason to have those conversations with people you wouldn't otherwise have. And for me is about building a relationship first right if you can build a relationship then down the line you do some business afterwards but but we had good luck and before I come back on it's been good. Another event we sponsored so you know because we're able to network of people and for me I'm always like a you know kind of a go-giver first like how can I help you first and that's always helped me you know to have success with it you know. So what are you what are you actually sharing with people here you're going to speak tomorrow. Yeah. What is the result you want people to take from here because I mean obviously doing commission here and I'll get in all that. Yeah. But yeah so so pretty much you know I with commission here I teach people how to make money affiliate marketing but the people here are running you know online courses and businesses themselves so so what I'm teaching tomorrow is basically 7 things that I've done in my business to grow commission hero to where it is and so that's really been what I want to share because it's like you know I can go on stage and just talk about you know the promotions I have but that's that there's no value there right so it's like how can I help people have more success so I'm actually sharing stuff that's working in my business right now to scale up commission hero as a business that can help people in the in the in the audience. Yeah. Maybe give the listeners who don't know who you are or don't know about commission hero give them like a brief overview beyond what you just said of like what kind of an opportunity that is. Yeah. So so basically my background I started an affiliate marketing back in 2015 I was a gym owner I owned across the gym for a while and I wanted to make more you know make money and online and know how to do it try all these different things and found affiliate marketing specifically was click bank at the time I started running Facebook ads to click bank offers got so good at it that actually became the number one affiliate on click bank out of everybody else which is was pretty crazy. I took that success and I said you know what like if I can become number one and I can I can I can teach people how to do this and so I created commission hero back in 2019 and you know when I launched commission here I thought maybe you know 100 people join that be pretty cool right and now we're over 15,000 people and growing yeah and students have done over 160 million on click bank and keeps on growing so yeah it's pretty cool. Robby this is crazy because I think you get to a point where you know you've done so much as far as success on your own but it's just like Russell or click funnels like that where we start to really feel like the purpose is not only our own success, yeah, but the success of others so what was that number how many million. Yeah, so our students have done over 160 on that you know about that I know about more yeah, that's not including other networks right like that and so I think that's the most to me that's most rewarding thing because you know having your own success is cool and it's great to you know be successful yourself, but the thing that gets me up in the morning is seeing other people like start to win as well. I think that's that's that to me is the coolest thing you know because we help other people win. I'm a big believer like the more you can help people have success more success you'll have to you know. Oh, amen. I love the term that used to go give her like yeah in this industry you'll find people who are uniquely go givers and you can spot them. You can spot the people who are out for themselves. Etc and you're definitely not that person. I appreciate that appreciate that it's unique and you guys have known each other like yeah, different stuff you know like how did you guys first meet. Clickfunnels. Robby lifetime is probably what top 3 grossing affiliate that we have at Clickfunnels probably number 2 or one actually we probably look that up. Yeah, I'll stop my head but even right now we you know to this date we've launched a course together on click bank. We've promoted commission here before and anyway done amazing things together and become good good buddies and horrible golfers or I guess. But yeah, you guys shouldn't take me. Yeah, I'll be the entertainment. Yeah, wrong ways but with us talking about partnerships right webinar con you mentioned your go giver you know relate it's a relationship oriented business talk about the impact that partners have made on your business as a top offer owner. Yeah, so I think it's it's super important to establish those relationships and you really having people be able to help and promote you know my offer as well and you're promoting them that's that's always helpful as well. I mean you know you guys have always been awesome with supporting and whether it's indirectly directly and I think it it's all about the relationships once again it's like you know I never look at you know if I'm promoting somebody as you know for their offer. I'm never like I sent you this may still you guys send me that may still is like it's never about that it's always a long game because it makes a difference because in this industry like once you start to you know kind of get into it and you start to you know have your own course or product and you kind of get into the affiliate space where you're having other people promote your stuff. It's a small circle right and it's like it's and it gets and it gets smaller and smaller that the bigger and bigger you get and so you have to realize that and like you should you should ever burn British you always you know lead first and with helping people out and that's that's kind of how we've been able to continue to grow and I think honestly the other the other way to really kind of grow your course or business is make sure your students again results. It's so funny because the marketer a lot of times people think that's like a secondary thing. Like they're just thinking about getting as many sales as possible for the course but like well the way you get more sales is just get results for your students and like that's the best one marketing you do for your course or program you know. You brought up one thing like you go and do these like promotions right we're here at Webinarcon and this is a good event. Yeah. But sometimes truly there's duds. Yeah. 100% you don't want to burn bridges because that gets around but there's also names that maybe you've done stuff on the we're not going to name names but my point is what happens when you go and pour your heart let's say that it's JV swap you go and you do an awesome promotion for these people you get a lot you say well I'm not the guy has to match but what happens when you like hey you know alright scratch my back and you get 3 people that show up on your Webinar how do you handle something like that. Because it happens. Yeah. Yeah. Oh it does I've been through it a couple times that more than a couple times and I mean just kind of you just got to handle it like a professional I mean I can't control what other people are doing I can only control myself right and I'm always like I'm a big believer in like you know extreme ownership or your success whether you succeed or fail it's always going to be your fault and I think that I can't control what anyone else does like I just make sure I can always bring you know bring as much thunder the table as I can as a as a partner a JV partner and but yeah you run into situations and a lot of times like for me like I'll go back and have a conversation that person say hey didn't work out like let's figure out why didn't work out you know it probably wasn't malicious it probably wasn't something that you know you can always lead that way. And try to figure out what happened like sometimes I mean you know we've had promotions even internally where like something breaks with you know maybe Facebook wasn't behaving or maybe you know things happen so it's like how can you just figure out and dissect it and kind of do a postmortem and go from there but yeah it is frustrating what happens but once again like I've had times where you know maybe a JV partner didn't come through that I thought they were going to and then but you keep that relationship going and they end up coming out with new offer a couple years later and then they end up coming in and killing it for you know. Well and everybody's at different phases right. Yeah. Three years later might be different. Plus if you've done a few of these you kind of know how to navigate the space or their warning signs or there's certain questions that you ask leading up like if if you're going to jump into a partnership you know Chris Cammy you know Ben Harris. What are some of the like main questions you'd ask like it's easy to say OK what's your list size. But man all lists are not created equal like what are some of the main things that you're looking for when you go do a promotion or a partnership like a JV. Yeah so first thing I ask is is you know who is your audience. I think it's a big one. Your audience is. Yeah alignment. Yeah. And so and I think that any offer can if done right you can tailor any offer to any any type of list or audience you know. I mean like we promoted for example like crypto offers or offers that are personal branding offers that really have nothing to do with affiliate marketing space. But we can angle it that way right. And so that's the first thing. Second thing is you know I can care less about the list size is more about like hey how many people on average you typically get on a webinar. Yeah you would go straight for the result. Yeah because I mean you can have you have a million people on your on your thing and only have you know 50 people show up for your webinar. You know it's it all depends how active it is. You know I've had people with like a list of you know 10 thousand people and they get 600 people on you know because it's so much more engaged. You know that's super high by the way if you don't. Yeah exactly. So those are a couple of things to look at and then and then also you know I have to talk strategy as well because you know when I can talk about and kind of get some insight into how they actually promote offers. I can I can usually tell you know pretty quickly my spuddy sense will go off whether it's yeah it's legit or not. You know. Yeah we're at Webinarcon like if you're going to run a promotion do you usually have like a metric like OK if I'm going to go and promote this I'm going to take my time and we can get into auto webinars etc. But if you're going to go do a live webinar give like a floor like is it 100 people 150 people. What is it usually like you're OK that I know I can win with. Yeah. So so for so the way I approach it nowadays is in order for me to do a live webinar I need to have at least like 200 people on you know anything less than that we're going to do so like live type of webinar you know automated webinar basically. You know just because it's one of those things where for two reasons number one as a live presenter in a webinar if you're doing it and you know you want to have high energy need to be you know bring the thunder and if you pop into the Webinar room and there's you know 10 people there three people like as as as professional as you are and as good as you've done this for a long time like it's going to bring your energy down. Totally this which is lower your conversions and so totally and even if you have 70 people on like that's why if you do like live where you get the recording nailed down right. It doesn't matter people on like you can still still convert really well you know I also think too like. I don't get discouraged when the number of people on the Webinar is lower nowadays to because show up rates are always trickier nowadays and you have to it's all in the follow up to you like so many people you know what all times replays will will clean up more sales than than the actual live Webinar itself. Yeah OK so with replays and you had something. Now it's a good point I do have a question if we want to go back I mean not back but on the partnership realm right now where you said you could pick up the phone and pretty much call anybody when you have a launch coming up for example let's say this March commission here. I look it up but when you were coming up so someone who's watching this is looking too fine partners for the JV launch what did you do to get on the radar of someone like an onyx and gole how did you make those connections. Yeah so so pretty much the way I would do it a couple ways number one I would if they had an event or something I would pay to go to it. I mean that's one of the things I've learned in my journey is you pay to play sometimes. And so if an event is you know five grand to go to it. Well OK here you go. I'm paying five grand I'm going to introduce myself and that's I'm going to get in the room talk to you. You know that's one thing. The other thing too is like just offering more and more help and support for people. So I've done things where you know for example with Onyx or other people where I've literally you know I would just I would like have a craft a whole email or it's just like hey man I was I was looking at your sales thing and I noticed that you don't do this like here's what I do maybe it's helpful that I so I literally just like share information and go give her. Yeah yeah. That's a great example. Hey this is working for me and that helps a lot too. And honestly though like the best thing you do to get partners attention is have a really good offer to convert. I know that also sounds kind of you know obvious but it's true like if you have if you have a really good offer that converts like you should not have an issue with that with affiliates getting affiliates on board. What's what's a good conversion percentage. You get a hundred people on a webinar. OK let's just use that because it's easy math. What's a good conversion out of that like percentage. Yeah so I mean kind of what you're shooting for is at least 10% on the webinar conversion. You know if you got something above 10% if you're hitting you know 12 15% I mean you got you got a solid offer. You know and that's that's kind of where you want to shoot for. And I think the other thing too is like I've also done stuff when I first started with JB partners where you know normally like on a high ticket webinar you're going to 50 50 Commission something like that in order for me to get people to promote an offer like I'll give them all the commission. I'll give them 75% commission. You know it's like like hey can you do you mind falling on the sword for me so to speak to test this out for me like I'll give you this much more commission so you're taking care of like I just need those stats and that data that I can now go to bigger and bigger fish and have them promote you know and so smart. So I think sometimes like people like what's going to play in the long game right. It's like you know you got to sometimes you got to have someone falling the sword for you and that's that's one way to do it. Is is there. OK so lots of different ways you can have an hour. We're kind of going down that vein because we're a webinar on but yeah. Is there a price point where you're like OK I think and I can tell you kind of like what I've experienced I've done hundreds of these like for Russell and other things. I kind of feel like 2000 3000 bucks beyond that maybe the webinar is not like a direct call to action to pay that maybe it's a book to call like what would you think is kind of like that threshold. I think it depends on on the traffic source or who those you know how those people come in right. I think I think you pay traffic on a webinar. I think you're in that thousand to you know 2500 maybe $3000 range. Yeah it's good webinar. If you're if it's like current members that you have or current buyers for sure you can do a 3 to 5 K on the webinar. I think if you if you craft it right you can do a higher ticket but I also think that a lot of times that people want to have that conversation on a phone call to like to kind of go over those things. So so like for us on our end like for our 10 K and up offers like we schedule a call and get people on there that way. So that's probably the way I would do it. But yeah as far as like you know cold traffic you know 1000 to 3000 is kind of where you're at. Yeah I agree with you. What's interesting it was so we've been diving in at Click Funnels like Russell's doing this whole linchpin thing which is absolutely genius. And one of the things that he always talks about is is Buddy David Fry said yeah if you don't have continuity you don't have a business and we're talking about these JV partnerships. We're talking about webinars and maybe maybe or maybe not you're selling continuity within this. But a lot of times I think what struggles with people in partnerships is they're going after the next promotion. OK now that happened. They checked out they checked a stripe account. They had this huge you know burst or they got a big affiliate commission. Yeah. But then they got to go to the next promo. Yeah they got on the next promo. What I love about what you've done is within commission here you've created a continuity but also how you built for example Click Funnels. Yeah. You know you now have built this baked it into the cake with Commission Hero. How is that different than jumping from promotion to promotion. Well I think it's I think initially you got to do what you got to do to get the ball rolling. But I think for sure I mean continuity. So like for us we have you know we have Click Funnels baked into the offer so we recommend all our students use Click Funnels. The only reason I do that is because I use it personally. Right. And so it makes it makes it a very easy offer and it's very very frictionless for people to join and do it. And then from there it was like you know we had things like OK well you know how do I find like winning ads to model. So OK then we started to create a software called Spy Hero which you know now people pay a continuity on that. And then we have there's a tracking software partner with and some other stuff you know. So I think that's one big part of it. And then also we do we do reoccurring memberships for our inner circle program as well. So we actually have that direct upsell off the Webinar. So which is like a two ninety seven a month reoccurring. So those are different ways we've kind of built up the continuity on that end. But I also think integration. Yeah exactly exactly. You know and I think that and I also think too like continuity doesn't necessarily have to be like like a membership kind of thing as well. It can also continue. It also plays into like relationships as well. Right. Like like so for us for example like every year we do a launch we always do it in the same same time of year. Right. We're always like already you know kind of plant the seed on the next the next year. So you have that continuity of partners as well. Yeah. And then also also continuity I think as well as I think is on the front end in terms of your paid traffic. Like if you're an affiliate just relying on if you're an offer owner around affiliates like you're going to have highs and lows and stuff like that. I mean one of the things we've done really well is like just we have our paid traffic running 24 seven and that and that is our bread and butter and then the affiliate stuff is kind of like that. You know that that nice dessert you get at the Ritz. Yeah. That's right. That's right. Yeah. So a little bit more on this launch if you're doing this every year you do it usually. I think you were telling me like like Easter is a little bit different this year. So yeah bumping it up a little bit. What do you have going on then with with the launch coming up. Yeah. Yeah. So so this is our fifth launch in five years because Miss Universe has been around for five years. So can we watch Lacey's. Yeah. I appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's pretty cool because I don't see a lot of you know you see a lot of people they create an offer and then they moved to another offer another offer. Yeah. And we've done something a little bit different. We've actually just kind of built a business. And so so this year in in 2024 we're doing Commission Hero AI. So basically what I've done is taken all the all the awesomeness that we have a Commission Hero and then we basically kind of sat down on my team and said hey what are like the manual stuff people have to do still like you know writing their copy or creating images or running their ads or and what can we do to really kind of help automate that process. So it makes it even easier and even lower barrier of entry for people to have success. And so we created a whole software suite you know with all types of AI stuff to help help that happen. So that's what that's what Commission Hero AI is about. And so we built that up. We've integrated with more networks and more stuff. And so it's going to be pretty cool. So you know we've helped 160 million you know in sales for our students. And so I want to man I want to get to get a half a billion on that. That'd be that'd be the goal. Oh yeah. That's awesome. Well all right. Another question. It's 2023. Yeah. You're running into another awesome launch in 2024. What would 2023 Robbie older wiser better looking. What would he what would he tell 2019 scrappy Robbie just starting Commission Hero like what would you do different if you get in the DeLorean times you can go back like what would old Robbie tell young Robbie. I would have told him lose some weight. But no I think I mean honestly. It's a good question but I would say I would tell him just just keep doing what you're doing. But the one thing I would tell him is like any time there's more and any time there's momentum in your business like you need to lean into that as heavily as possible. That's great. And I think that's something where I've done a pretty good job with that. But there's times I look back and I'm like man I left some I left some meat on the bone here. Like I could I could have leaned in this a little bit heavier harder. And I think that a lot of the thing is like when you have a good offer you have an offer that works. It's almost like it's like catching lightning in a bottle right. And sometimes you know we everybody thinks in absolutes right when things are really bad they think they're always going to be bad right. Or when things are really good you think they're always going to be good right. And that's neither one is true. And so when things something's really good for your offer and like you got that wind at your back like you need to double down on it not build new stuff like focus on one thing and scale it up you know. That would be my advice for 2019 Robbie because that would I think we could be a little bit we could have gotten to where we are now a lot faster you know. Right. I mean is that the same advice you'd give to somebody I mean obviously going into affiliate marketing is probably the best way to cut your teeth as far as being an Internet marketer. Yeah. Is that the same type of advice you'd give somebody just starting out. 100% I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't do affiliate marketing and specifically run paid ads to it. You know I think that it's the easiest and lowest barrier to entry versus organic versus organic 100% you know like I would never have become number one on click bank with organic or email or it was paid traffic that did that for me. Does that mean ignore organic. I mean I would say not necessarily but if you want to make money you know and a good amount of money if you want to make a couple bucks here and there organics fine it's a long game but most people when they first start online they're pretty impatient they want to see that money come in. I was impatient when I first started and so you know one thing for me I loved about Facebook and Facebook ads is you know I could put 20 bucks in get 40 bucks out and I'm like wow like okay let me do more of that. Yeah yeah so and I think as in a you know when you first start out I think that's that's the great thing because being an affiliate marketer specifically like with you know click bank type offers you learn to you learn psychology because your ads have to be really good you learn persuasion because now you're trying to get people to click because of curiosity and then you also learn media buying right and like I mean those three skills there nowadays are like are huge. High paying too. I mean I remember when I first started I remember I joined a mastermind this is 2015 and everybody was doing email right and I remember I had created a product it was a crossfit product at the time I put on click bank and I try to get people to promote it and nobody would promote my product because they're all it was all weight loss focused emails you know about two years later they're all coming to me trying to figure out how to run their paid ads you know because email can only scale so much for them right and so I think having the ability to run paid paid media and that can change sometimes maybe it's tick tock comes next thing maybe it's whatever but but learning that paid media as an affiliate is like is a game changer you know and then afterwards you can do whatever you want because a lot of people will talk about like I want to be because you know the game yeah exactly and people will be like I want to do something like I'm passionate about well I always tell my students will make money first and do something you're passionate about you know that's good and that's because like sometimes you got to you got to you got to make money online first that's the whole point like you know and I think for me like affiliate marketing like one of the purest forms of having online business because you know you always see that like someone on the laptop on the beach you know kicking back and laxin and then and then you're like I'm going to create my own product and then like you know you're like slaving away at the desk like you're not going to sleep you got people you know they're working for you and it's and for me affiliate marketing spending like that pure form because you can do it on your own you can do it anywhere in the world. Somebody else already has the headache of the product. Yeah exactly. You're just in the game of marketing. Same thing with like ClickFunnels being an affiliate for ClickFunnels like you know I don't want to sleep I don't want to build like a whole freaking you know. Yeah don't. You know you know like that's a lot of work you know I'd rather just get the commission and do my thing you know. Absolutely. And so I think you know as an affiliate whatever you go start there and the cool thing is to you can start there and a lot of people think you have to move on to something else like you don't like you can you can be an affiliate and make a ton of money too you know so that's the nice thing about it is it gives you options to go from. Well that leads into what you're doing too like if for sure people are wondering how to do this I mean obviously commission here is a great way and if you go through commission here you're going to say hey here's how you can do affiliate stuff for ClickFunnels too. But in your role like what would you tell somebody who wants to get in the marketing game how can they go like promote ClickFunnels. Sure and even you know I've heard affiliate marketing is the gateway drug into entrepreneurship because you were learning all the skills that it would take to when you do have an idea like commission here and expertise like yourself you knew what to do you know how to market it you knew paid media and even when learning it from the ground up to your question Chris and I learned it from you you had said when you were learning media buying specifically Facebook ads like I don't have this yet one thing I'm going to do is just try one new thing a day that's not going to overwhelm myself I'm going to put my head down because you underestimate what could happen over a year's time when you are learning and just implementing something new because you're like what I'm doing right now is not working right so I'm one step closer to figuring it out to cracking that code whether it's you know find an offer that works for you you know finding that vein of gold throughout the you know web of Facebook but even learning that how that can work into click funnels and what makes I guess you know according to our affiliates our doctor our offer attractive is getting that recurring commission on a monthly basis for customer service you don't have to worry about you have no inventory needs to live on we're handling all of that you create that continuity right there. 100% and it's super sticky yeah exactly right people say especially having an offer like yourself they're coming into click funnels learning how to use that as their landing page successfully promoting click bank offers as the bridge page that's by a stick as you can make it right if you are successfully putting click bank products you need a bridge page to send them from let's say Facebook or Google however you're running paid traffic click funnels over to the high converting offer yeah and I actually have a question around the launch but I do it as an affiliate marketer affiliate marketer affiliates are lazy right we can cut it and dry kind of like how they are no way yeah and with running a very successful launch like you've done for 5 years running what are you doing to prepare for the affiliates are you preparing certain assets for them awareness what's what goes into that type of how we ask your question so in the beginning we would know any better I'd say OK like here you know you guys will set up things on your end nowadays we don't do that like we literally say hey we will literally set up everything for you so we set up the webinars we write the email swipes for them we do it I mean we literally set up everything all they have to do is just you just want to traffic just want to traffic just hit send it will figure it out for you know and so like I think our last our launch last year I think a one at one and one day we had over like 400 when I was running you know it was like that's 100 yeah it was the same yeah I was the same and one day in the one day that was just one day. And so and we were able to do that because you know some of the stuff we use but that has been the game changer where it just takes the friction out of someone saying yes to promoting that's like you know because you know people are nice about it but the people always want to promote somebody else's offer and not really like you do it because you know obviously build a relationship since great and everything but but you know you want to work on your own stuff right and but someone come to you say hey listen like you know if you can promote all literally have the copy didn't done all schedule the webinars for you I'll have my support team at you know dropping the links and there for you like we'll do everything for you all you got to do is just hit send you know and that makes it so much easier for them to want to promote so that's been like the most important thing is like you said you know Philly's is my nature. Yeah yeah I think you assume that they know the drill they know how to do it big or small yeah but taking away any of that friction like if you're going to write an email send an email copy go and actually put their specific link into it and then send it to him and Google Doc or whatever like yeah literally hit send exactly and and also by setting things up everything for them. It's a great way to get a guilt trip them into make sure they promote to. Yeah in a nice way because what happens is like you know we've got people they were kind of on the ball but I'm a do like we we just we literally set up all these webinars for you we put this together for you like yeah my team's like side about this and you know so they stick with it right and don't have fast it right as so that's something that it's kind of a side side tip. Yeah that's actually a ninja hack right here for sure. Yeah because then I mean people feel obligated to you talk about this being a small circle like sometimes people will just promote you because they're like well crud I know I might need Robbie to kind of reciprocate at some point yeah and so I'll do it and especially since he's done that work it's a great point like yeah they'll probably come in and push for you a little bit at least to ascend or to right. Yeah absolutely and yeah like I said you always play the long game I've had partners where like I've learned promoted them three times. I don't ask anything they say oh we don't do reciprocals we don't do this. Okay cool I'll just keep sending for you and then you know then down the line you get the reciprocal back but you have to play that long game I think that's the most important thing like if you just because I think people will understand that eventually and they'll appreciate that from you a lot more because you know everyone's so take take take a lot of times and it can be in this industry and if you're if you just give more than you take like it always comes back to you. Yeah and even back to underestimation common I made you sometimes overlooking not you personally just in general overlook what one partnership can do how big of a needle mover that can make so with bringing in that goodwill without expecting any kind of reciprocation pays off tenfold the long run because you do get that one partner that promotes commission hero and it's millions for you. Oh yeah and you never like you never you know judge anybody where they're at currently you know my dad will always tell me like you know the people you meet on the way up or the same people you meet on the way down so you know you always want to like you know I've talked to people before they like at events where they're just just getting going and other people are ignoring them and you have a conversation with them a year later like they're just I mean they're making millions per month you know it's like and they they remember that right there remember the people that took care of them and remember the people that the treatment wrongly right so you always want to just you know be nice to everybody and and always comes back to you be nice and general be nice and don't expect anything back that's basically it you know and and the funny thing is when you do that lost up comes back and yeah that's so true well listen we can talk to you all day yeah if somebody wanted to get in touch with you specifically maybe it's commission hero AI or whatever like how do they want I'd love love for them to know how to get involved with what you're doing yeah and then to have people promoted that would love to promote yeah how are they promoting the the the launch and mark yeah yeah so if you're interested in learning what we do inside a commission here and you want to you know do affiliate marketing yourself and you know just go to commission hero dot com and and check that out if you want to get into the front of the date of the launch just go to commission hero dot com for slash save dash the dash date that it will put it which is the easiest year-old remember so or just scan the bar code.
