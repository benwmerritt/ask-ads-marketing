Today we have Josh Forty in the house. Well virtually he's in the house with us and I'm really excited about this conversation. I've been wanting to chat with him for a while. So Josh Forty if you don't already know who he is as an entrepreneur in podcast hosts he has generated over 20 million dollars in revenue grown 10 million plus followers on Instagram and has generated 1.5 million dollars plus or 1.5 million plus downloads on his podcast.

I'm so pumped to be here on click funnels radio click funnels the greatest software company on the face of the earth. Yeah brother. That's where we start with this. This has been so much fun because Josh I've known you for a long time. I want to say the first time you and I met rewind offer mine Stephen Larson Boise. It's probably first time we met but our paths have crossed so many times because you are such a go giver in this click funnels community whether it's you know in the master minds or FHL. I'm going to start though like one of my favorite memories. Okay. I'm going to take you back in time. I was at HQ and Russell says he goes I'm going to call Josh 40 right now and tell him he's speaking at funnel hacking live. So I'm over in the back. I come around the corner and I'm just filming a little bit and I'm watching Russell call you and I could see as he's telling you this you are doing everything in your power to harness this excitement and not like run around the room. And I know Russell was waiting for you just to like pop your top and just lose it. Anyways it was so cool. I sent that to you later and it's cool man. Gosh I might you up at funnel hacking live and like crazy crazy. You are just awesome. So here's my question. Okay. You've been in this community for such a long time and I've watched you like so many other entrepreneurs take this path of discovery. Okay. And get really really scrappy and really really good at a number of things. One for example is like your YouTube channel podcasting the master story like method right that whole thing in that brand but tell me kind of what you're doing what you're excited about now because I've seen you kind of shift and make these little adjustments as you go to find maybe that ultimate purpose. Tell us where you are on that path and kind of like what's exciting you now and what's led you to that. Yeah for sure. Well I appreciate it and yes I have been in the ClickFunnels community. It feels like since I started entrepreneurship it wasn't quite but ever since I've been online dot com secrets right. I read that book and it was like. Oh my gosh this is amazing. Right. I think as entrepreneurs particularly online coaching space called Salting Space Info Product what have you. You know as we jump from thing to thing to thing I think a lot of people think oh someone's changing their mind over and over and over again. And in a way in a way potentially that might be true but I think when you actually look at business and when you look at what actually drives that I think it primarily comes down to the fact that like if you can't get in front of customers or if you don't know how to get your customers if you don't have customers coming in you don't have a business. And so I think when people jump from thing to thing I think what actually happens a lot of times is people figure out either a new way to get a customer or they have to pivot because their current way of getting a customer is no longer there. Right. And so they have to change or else they go out of business. Does that make sense. Totally. And so for me when I started in kind of the social media space and grew our big agency and stuff online we had a bunch of bunch of followers bunch of bunch of people but I didn't know how to make money. Right. And then I found Russell and then I read the book and I was like OK now I know how to make money and we grew up that business and then I found this new way of getting clients and I'm like OK but if I get it this way and that doesn't work and so I'm going to change over to this and then I'm going to change over to that. And I would go through these evolutions of figuring out OK I want to get better at this particular skill because I know that I need to get better at that. But then when it would change the way that I would get a customer would change. Does that make sense. Totally. I think a lot of times this evolution is what's happening though and people from the external go hold on. What's Josh 40 doing. Like he's doing this. Now he's the he's the master of this but he's a master of this. Yeah. But people don't see that evolution that's happening behind the scenes. And so for somebody to get involved with Josh 40 today versus four years ago they're getting a much more complete package. Yeah I would say much more complete package for sure. I would also say that if you were to go and talk to my highest level people the people that have paid me the most amount of money right. And I deal with I sell high ticket. And when I say high ticket I'm just going to throw a couple rocks here some people. I don't mean two grand or five grand right. I mean like twenty five thousand dollars is the start of high ticket right. And then you know are my biggest deals a quarter million. Right. I think if you were to actually go and talk to the people that have paid twenty five fifty or a hundred thousand dollars over the course of the past three years I mostly delivered the same thing to all of them even over the course of three years. But what got them interested in that thing front facing evolved. And so I you know I did a podcast on that I was like hey people are like Josh you're all over the place. And I'm like I'm all over the place from outside perception because I am going through and trying this thing and this thing and this thing to try to figure out one core problem. And because I was not good maybe good is not the right word because I wasn't effective at communicating that all the way through it looked like I was jumping from 25 different things. In a sense. Yeah totally. But it was it was the core problem. And my core problem for me was I was like hey I want to build and this sounds cheesy but understand every this is very intentional. I want to build a business that allows me to solve problems and get paid in alignment with who I am. Right. Like and when I say that I mean like I don't actually have a business. I have a skill set that I've learned how to sell for lots of money. Right. Yeah. And so for me like you know you can't really see the two comic club awards there but like we've made the millions of dollars but like I don't have a real business and I'm OK with that. I have a skill set that I've learned how to sell for lots and lots of money. And so the problem would be was that I would learn one element of how to sell something or one element of how to do something and I would get really really excited about that. And so I'd be all about that thing and that play that piece fit into a bigger picture of what I was trying to do which was I wanted to be free. Right. And I would watch people in the online world or in the business world that would build multi multi multi million dollar companies seven figures eight figures even nine figures. But when I would talk to them they would tell me that they did not have the freedom that they wanted. And I was like I don't want that. Right. I want to actually be free. I want to actually have time to spend with my wife and now daughter. We I just had it. Congratulations. I was going to mention that you just had a baby girl a couple of weeks ago. Two and a half weeks ago. Right. So precious. But I want to actually have time freedom and I don't want just money. I want the freedom of it. So I would find one piece where I'm like cool. Oh my gosh. I know how to build a funnel or oh my gosh. I know how to do this. And it would solve one piece of it. And so I'd be talk about that one thing because I'm a Russell fanboy. I'm a I'm a model of Russell Russell gets excited about stuff. I get excited about stuff. Right. Sure. And then I would go into that this far and I'd be like OK. Wait a second. In order for this piece to work into my bigger model like I also need this piece over here and so then I would go study this piece over here. I didn't stop doing this piece. I just stopped talking about it because now I'm doing this over here. Does that make sense. Yeah. And so for three or four years I would go through and I would figure out OK. There's the funnel piece and there's the traffic piece. There's the sales conversion process piece. There's the the offer piece. There's this piece. A lot high ticket low ticket traffic. And then the death of my brother is in there and me getting married is in there. And like all then life happens. And so there's been this three or four year culmination of putting all these pieces together. And then earlier this year I hired Dan Henry paid him a ridiculous amount of money to go down and spend two days with him because I'm like Dan. I'm at a point now. I've rededicated my life to Christ. I know where I'm going. I know I have all the pieces. I've got the results. I've got the client testimonials. We've done tens of millions of dollars in sales. I know it's all here. Help me put it all together. Right. And he's like OK. Pay me a hundred dollars and come down to my house for two days. And I'm like I don't exactly like him when you say that. I just I was with him at Webinar Con and watching by the way the evolution of Dan Henry is amazing to like love Dan. Yeah. He's so cool. He really really is. And I think he's wildly misunderstood. But. Oh agreed. Agreed. Neither here nor there. He's very good at what he does. So I paid him the money and I I flew down to his house in Costa Rica and it's you know the grand entrance. We take the helicopter into a private pad and do it in its insanity. Right. But when we got down there he's just like Josh take your emotions out of it. Just look at data. Like look at what worked. Let's put these things together. And through this process of going through and looking at the podcast that did you know a million and a half downloads all organically and that you know the 10 million followers on social and the 20 million for client like putting all those things together and like looking at all the pieces. We came up with this thing that's called the golden mic method. Right. And the golden mic method very simply put is how do you build up? How do you have a microphone that's worth its weight in gold. But I believe that for me going back to you know where we kind of started this conversation and for many many many entrepreneurs is the number one problem bar none that I hear people have in the online space today in business period is how do I get more leads. How do I get more clients. How do I get more customers traffic traffic traffic right. If there's three buckets if there's the offer there's the sales conversion process and then there's the traffic piece right. Like huge 80 percent of the people like 80 percent of the problem is traffic. Yeah. But the problem is though not one traffic piece solves every like different traffic is better for different types of sales conversions which is better for different types of offers. So you can't just be like Facebook ads are it or you can't just be like you know YouTube ads or it can't just be like JVs or affiliates. It's like well no because it depends upon the other pieces right. And so the golden mic method is how I built my I mean whole business really for the last three to four years. Once again like I said I didn't I didn't do different things. I talked about different things but I was building one thing right. And so the golden mic method has allowed me to go and build relationships with people like Russell Brunson has allowed me to get JV partners has allowed me to invest in real estate without any of my own money has allowed me to get traffic has allowed me to get quarter million dollar contracts has allowed me to get right. But because it itself solves the problem of getting in front of what I just define as wealthy clients. What would you rather sell to somebody. You want to sell the broke people. Huh. You don't want to sell the broke people. Well and the analogy I always use is and Laura I'm going to talk to you for a second here. Okay I imagine imagine you were a cook right. And you were going to go and you were going to make this meal for somebody and you had two clients and the first client was an average client. You go to their house. They've got a small kitchen and it's a birthday party or whatever and they've got a few ingredients and you know but you're a really really good cook. That's client number one. Client number two wants to hire you to come cook at their house but they live in a mansion and they're throwing this massive party and they have three kitchens and every oven gadget and every ingredient and everything you could possibly think of all the different things you could possibly do. Which person could you get a better result for one or two. Absolutely number two. Yeah and oh by the way their team is probably going to come in and clean up after you right. Yeah. Could you charge more or less for the second person. Such a good analogy. Like 10 times more but it took you the same amount of time and work as it did the first or the second one. You're going to make more it's going to be easier for you. You're going to deliver a better result and you're not going to have to clean up afterwards. Yeah. Why would you ever sell to a broke person. Exactly. And the reason is because most people myself included for most of my career most people have no idea how to get in front of wealthy people. I also think Josh though what about this. What about those and it's imposter syndrome all these other things. What people say I've got to absolutely sell to the poor people and the people that will buy from me for a very small price tag to make sure I have the skill set to go on because if Laura goes and she's like I know that I'm a good chef or whatever but feels like she's not worthy to go get that. How do you handle that. Okay. There absolutely is a worthy piece but I'm going to I want to address the first question part of that first which is if you were a complete beginner like and you let's say not a complete if you had never sold your cooking service before but you had cooked for years at home but you had never sold it before. What percentage of likeliness would it be easier for you to get a result with the person that paid you lots of money with lots of resources or the person that paid you a little bit of money with a little bit of resources. Still the second still the second. So I whatever people tell me hey I need to start charging low ticket. I go I believe it is and I use this word very carefully right. I believe that for most people it is a ethically better option for them to sell high ticket than low ticket to begin with. And here's why with the one caveat that you're committed because the caveat because here's why if I need let's say $5,000 a month to come into my life every single month for me to pay my bills right. And I sell a tick our client for $1,000. Right. I bought one fifth of my month but I have to go get four more in order to go and cover my bills for the month. Yeah. If something goes wrong right during that time do I have time to go figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. No and that kind of also applies to the whole like you are limiting you are no longer able to serve the people that you were called to serve if you're not doing what you were meant to do. And if you are financially strapped and struggling you're not able to provide those services. You're so concerned about your own finances and how you're going to take care of yourself that you're not serving the people you were called to serve. Exactly. Now let's say instead of charging $1,000 you charge $10,000. And let's say you charge $10,000 for this person and you get started with them and everything goes wrong. All of it. You're two weeks in and it all goes wrong. That's never happened. It's never happened. But it does sometimes. Yeah, yeah. I know. It's never that bad, right? Yeah. But let's say it all goes wrong. Now if you're two weeks in how much more time like if you dedicated your full time and attention eight hours a day, seven days or six days a week do you think you could figure out the problem and being able to go and solve it? Yeah, 100% you could. But now you have $10,000. You've bought two months of your time. Exactly. So if something goes wrong, you don't have to go out and find another client next week because your bills are paid for, you're taking care of. You can deliver a better service and better result. Right? Yeah. And so this this this issue of going through and and like not being able to get in front of a wealthy clientele is a bit really big issue. And I apologize. My phone is turned things. It's a really big issue. And so I believe very like very, very much so that it is ethically better as long as you're committed to get what you do, right? To sell these higher level people. Now we can talk about the whole being worthy or not. That's a big, big internal battle. We do work a lot with that. But I also believe that if you build relationships with people and you get around the right people and you commit to solving specific, not broad problems. Right? Like I don't have to feel that great about myself. I want to key in on that for a second. Well, I want to key in on that for a second because there is so much power in somebody handing you a mic. Here's what I mean in giving you some authority. You've been so good about, like I said before, being a go-giver and click funnels so much so in providing so much value that Russell decided that you were worthy of a microphone when you step on stage. Does anybody have to go research? Oh, wait, I've never heard of Josh 40, but Russell gave him the mic. Yeah. Yes. So much difference. Yeah. A hundred percent it is, but that's external validation. That's external worthiness. Interesting. Okay. Russell Russell Russell decided that, oh, Josh was worthy of the mic. I decided I was worthy of the mic way before Russell did. Great point. Right. Yep. And and and I will I will touch on that. I mean, I spent a hundred thousand dollars on Katie Richardson to work on me for a year and a half and all we did was work on identity and self worth, right? But that that concept of worth comes from who I am. I determined my self worth, but also actions are always going to follow identity, right? So if I want to become worthy of charging $25,000, then what would somebody that charge $25,000 do? Well, they wouldn't focus on 98 percent of what everybody else does. They would focus on one thing, right? And I'm happy to get back to that. But I do think if I finish off the gold mic method, it actually circles back to this. Yes. So the concept of selling and getting in front of your high tech client, most people don't know how to do that. But if I were to tell you, hey, you have three people, you only have three leads. And if you blow it on these three leads, you're screwed. You're done. You're out of business. You freak out. But if I were to tell you, who cares, you could just keep messing up and you have more wealthy people to pitch over and over and over again. Would you have any concern? Well, no, of course not. Right. You just zero and you keep trying and you keep trying. That's the golden mic method. And the golden mic method is the premise of using a podcast, but an interview style podcast, a golden mic podcast, using the new style of podcasting to go and build relationships with and get in front of wealthy clientele and then position yourself as the person that can solve that, solve their problem for them. I want to pause really quick because there's so much to unpack there, but I just want to point a couple of things out. Number one, I said, build a relationship with and number two, I said, solve a problem. I did not say try to sell them something. I did not say pitch. Right. Big difference. Okay. Second thing is we're going to do, Chris, we're going to do a little experiment. Okay. Let's do it. When I say the old versus new model of podcasting, the golden mic method is a fundamentally different approach to podcasting that is specifically built for entrepreneurs. It is for entrepreneurs because the traditional model of podcasting doesn't work. Okay. The financial system doesn't work for entrepreneurs. The school system doesn't work for entrepreneurs. Oh, yeah. The job system doesn't work for entrepreneurs. So we built our own. So why do we try to apply the old model of podcasting to entrepreneurs? Here's what I mean. So hold on. Hold on. Chris, the old model of podcasting is what? I'm going to go start a podcast and what's my primary goal with the podcast? You're trying to get in front of an audience. You're trying to talk about you. I'm trying to build a big audience. Right. Okay. So I'm Joe Rogan. I'm going to go and I'm going to build a big audience. Where am I going to make money in the traditional model of podcasting? You're going to try to get some sponsors or some type of advertising. Right. So I'm going to sell to an advertiser. Okay. So if my product then is my audience, yes or no? Yeah. So my listener is not my buyer. My listener is my product. And so in order to build this audience, I'm going to go and interview who? Anybody, anybody that you can with an audience. Right. Experts, interesting people, because I want a big audience so that I can sell to advertisers because advertisers are my buyer. Bingo. Now that's the old model of podcast. This is a mainstream model. Yeah. And then entrepreneurs are like, I don't want to start a podcast because Russell Bronson said start a podcast. Right. And we go and here's what they try to do. I'm going to try to build a big what? Audience. Audience. And then I'm going to do that by bringing on experts. Yep. Let me ask you. Who is the buyer for the entrepreneur? Do we have advertisers? No, it's going to be the end user. We want to sell something. Hold on though. But is it though? Because let me ask you this. Here's what most entrepreneurs do. I'm a marketer. So I'm going to build an audience. I'm going to position myself as an expert on marketing. So what's the topic of my podcast going to be about? Well, it's going to be about being an entrepreneur, being an expert. I'm a marketer. So it's going to be about marketing and entrepreneurship. Right. And then because I'm going to interview people, I'm going to bring on other experts. And because the podcast is about marketing and entrepreneurship, what are those experts going to be an expert at? Marketing and entrepreneurship. So now I am building an audience of people trying to position myself as an expert. And I'm going to tell the entire people of my entire listener base that I am not the expert you should not buy from me. You should buy from who? From the expert. Experts that I am bringing on. So now you're not going to make money from an advertiser because you don't have them and you're not going to make money from your audience because now you're building an audience, telling them to other people. Yeah. Now let me ask you the only other way or other person that you could interact with is the person you're interviewing. And if you're an expert on marketing and they're an expert on marketing, do they have the problem that you solve? Yeah. No, they don't have the problem that you use. You. You're a marketer. Oh, no, they're solving that problem. Yeah, they don't have the problem that you solve. You're good at marketing. They're good at marketing. Exactly. So you can't sell to the people you interview. You don't have advertisers and the people that are listening, you're talking to buy from somebody else. And then we wonder as entrepreneurs, why most people don't make money from podcasts. Interesting. Like what? That's so true. So true. We're doing here, right? That's wild to think about when you when you spell it out that way. But this is so people don't think that deep about it, Josh. Right. At all. But I'm like, yo, let's use you to some logic here. And then people look at me and they go, Josh, you made millions of two million dollars from your podcast. And I'm go like, wow. And I'm like, I'm asking people if they've ever done psychedelic drugs, what they think of God, what they think of Donald Trump. And then three days later, they're paying me $50,000 for marketing packages. Wow. It makes no sense. Right. Why? Or does it? Or does it? Because I all of a sudden went, wait a second, my purpose with the podcast is I did not start a podcast to go build a big audience. Do you know why Josh started a podcast? Josh started a podcast because I was broken and because I was confused and because I was broke and because I kept hearing that mindset is the key to success and getting around successful people is the key to success. And I thought if I could just get around successful people, if I could just interview successful people, if I could just interview people with money, then maybe I could learn from them. And so rather than trying to create a podcast that was focused on the listener, I said, Hey, wait a second, what if I create a podcast that my ideal client, someone with a buttload of money, someone that is successful, that they would want to come talk to me? Well, something that they would be interested in. And so I, every other marketer, and I sold marketing services, why every other marketer was out there having a marketing podcast or an entrepreneurship podcast, I went, what if I created a place that we talked for two hours long, we could be wildly controversial. I would ask them questions that nobody else asked them and I would take any of the heat if we got too controversial. That's awesome. An entrepreneur that's successful doesn't want to talk about that. I love that. And now when Russell Brunson is. How did it start? Like you, you talk about your, your client's problem is like getting in front of the people that they need to be getting in front of. How did it start for you? Because you are organically, I think really great at having these types of conversations and you knew the type of podcasts you wanted to build. And in this journey of self exploration of like, I didn't do this because this is where I want to be. Like, I didn't though. I didn't, I just knew that I knew what I, all I knew was that I wanted to get in front of successful people. I wasn't planning on selling them anything. I wasn't trying to pitch them anything. I was like, I just got to get around you. And so I was like, what do they want to talk about? And I would, I want to talk about what is they, what would, what would Russell Brunson say? Yes. So coming and talking about, what would practically, what was your step one to making that happen? I literally sat down and was like, how do I create this place where my ideal app, like what they would want to come talk about? How could I ask them better questions? And I realized that every other podcast out there was asking them, but boring marketing questions about marketing. And I was like, what if I just ask them about something other than marketing? And I looked at Joe Rogan's podcast and I was like, it'll work for me. So long, which is a great model for what you're trying to do. Questions to a market that's not doing it. Start. And what happened was is the first 20 episodes, I didn't make any money. I wasn't trying to, but an episode like, I don't remember which episode it was, but I interview a guy by the name of Brad Gibb. And I don't know if you know Brad Gibb, but he let me tell you, that guy is impossible to get a hold of. That guy runs three companies. He's very, very wealthy, has money. He's impossible to get a hold of. But guess what? He said yesterday coming on my podcast, because somebody introduced me. And then I interviewed him for two hours about money. I asked him really, really good questions. And then afterwards he goes, Hey, I like you. You're really cool. That was the best podcast episode I've ever done. I want to hire you. And I know you do social media stuff. Was this one of your first interactions with Brad? Because I know you and Brad go way back. My podcast started four years ago. Yeah. Wow. That was your first interaction with him. That's awesome. This was my first interaction with him, but this was my first business interaction with him. Wow. And so we chat and he's like, Hey, send me over this. Send me over a proposal of what you want to do. And I'm like, I don't like me. Are you sure? Like I sell $5,000 packages. Like, are you? And so I put together a Google Doc. This is after my brother had died right before I'm getting ready to go on this world trip, right? And I send Brad over a proposal for like 30 grand. This is the most money I've ever asked for ever before ever. But I was like, if I'm going to do this, why I'm traveling after processing the death of my brother, I might as well make it big. And like three days later, he's like, sounds good. Pays me the invoice. And I'm like, no sales call, no funnel, no ads. No. And I'm like, you ever have those moments where you're like, I don't know what just happened, but I got to figure out what just did. Because like, I got to do more of that. Yeah, yeah. That happened. And I realized, wait a second, I have an ability here to solve a problem that most people have no idea how to do, which is all of a sudden I can get in front of people with money. That's a pivot point right there. Right. So now I had to go figure out the rest of it. I had to go figure out how to sell it. I had to go figure out how to build high ticket. But I had solved the traffic problem. And so I'm building the podcast in the background. I figured all this, see what I'm saying? So the golden mic method is a method of a podcast where you build a podcast. I call it an amplification of yourself, which is how do, and this comes back to you being worthy, how do I create a place where by me being my powerful self, my BB being me, I create a place where my ideal client, maybe that's your GV partners, maybe those are investors, maybe those are, maybe it's your actual client's how, where that type of person wants to come talk to me, not that they're willing to come talk to me. And I'm going to use Russell as an example. Did I reach out to Russell and be like, yo, you should come on my show. No, Russell wanted to come talk about what? First episode we did, Atlas shrugged. And there was no other place for Russell to go talk about Atlas shrug. He was diving deep into it. Massively passionate about it. Right. He's like, I need a platform to come talk about it. Hey, Josh, three and a half hours. Click, at ClickFunnels HQ. I want to come talk about this. I didn't have to beg. Right. And so when you create a platform with a podcast, it's a new model. It's literally a new model of podcasting built for entrepreneurs. Doesn't work if you don't have an offer, right? Yeah. You create a place where you go, hey, where does my ideal client, the people that I'm trying to build relationships with, where did they want to come hang out? Where did they want to come talk? And then instead of me going, I have something to sell you. I go, hey, you have such and such of a problem. Like, how are you guys solving that? Now, does every single person I interview, do I lend them as clients? Oh, I don't even pitch. I don't pitch Russell, but there's, you know, 30, 40, 50% of the people that I interview that either have a problem that I know how to solve or they know someone that has a problem that I know how to solve. I don't pitch them. I just go, hey, let me show you how to solve this problem. I put together a Google Doc. We use Google Docs for everything. Put together a Google Doc that outlines it. And I say, by the way, if you want help, here's what it might look like. Let me know. It's amazing. And like, that's the golden mic method. And so when it comes back to this whole concept of worthy or, you know, am I worthy or not? The more worthy you become, the more you work on yourself, the better the goal of mic method will be. And I think it's been a hundred thousand dollars, a hundred grand to work on me. And I kept looking at other business models and going, that business model does not allow me to be the best person to myself and keep winning. What's a model that I can use to where if I get better, I make more money. And this is the model. Would you say, would you say that worthiness moment for you external? Was maybe that Brad Gibb $30,000 transaction like, oh, wait a minute. I can charge this amount. Was that maybe that worthy, the worthiness moment for you? Um, that was the moment that I realized that I had solved the problem. I don't think the worthiest moment came until probably four or five clients later because I still had crazy self doubt because I still made a lot of errors and a lot of mistakes in how I was selling. I think the worthiness moment came when I had a client one time, I would sell these $30,000 packages and I would promise the world. And this is a huge problem. Right. I would prompt like 30,000. I was making as much as that seven $5,000 packages, right? Right. I had a $30,000 launch package and a client introduced me to one of his friends. I was like, please don't introduce me. I don't have time. I don't have time. He's like, just, just please go and just please let me introduce you. So he introduces me and I was like, I'll just show you what I do. And I outlined it. He's like, this is amazing. Send me a proposal. And so I went and I took the $30,000 package and I put $100,000 on it. Everything else stayed the same because I didn't have time. So I went a hundred thousand bucks, nothing else changed. And I sent him it and the next day he emailed me back over and said, sounds good, send me the invoice. Wow. And I was like, oh, wait a second. I am worthy of something here because I have something like people want to work with me, not just they could get this from anybody. Somebody else is selling the same thing for way less. They want to work with me because of who I am and the integrity and this thing that I bring to the table. So I think that was the moment. Yeah, that's really powerful thing when you know that it's about who you are as an individual too. Yeah. No, that's really. And I know that we talked about validation, like external validation and internal validation and, you know, when people give you the opportunity or the microphone or the stage to speak on, what do you think it was internally in you that helped you get the confidence to like, not only speak on stage and sell clients, but just like have these really powerful and sometimes controversial conversations with people, like what kind of gets you to that point where you're like, let's chat, let's get a little controversial. Like, I mean, there has to be a level of confidence in that too. And I think that you are a very engaging conversationalist. Like, where do you think that comes from? Of my parents, for sure. Um, my, my mom and dad taught me very early on that nothing mattered except for truth and to be relentlessly committed to pursuing truth. And so the fact that I am willing to have controversial conversations. And I think one of the things you mentioned is either before the call or like, right when we hopped on it was like, you know, I do it in such a way where it's not malicious, so it's not, you know, I'm not trying to attack people. And like, I'm not, I never am. I'm like, if you have, if you have an opinion on something and you hold that very strongly, guess who also has an opinion on something and I hold it very strongly and I am, I am not trying to prove you wrong. I am not trying to gotcha. I just want to understand if you're so certain of it. And so am I, what do you know that I don't? Because either A, you know something that I don't know and I need to update my, my belief or B, I actually know something that's way stronger than you. You actually haven't thought through it and I'm going to confront you on it because it's wrong, right? And so I'm not trying to like gotcha, but my relentless pursuit of I'm not trying to be right. I'm trying to know what the truth is. And I think that most people have opinions on things and they, they have opinions, but it's not based in anything. They haven't thought through anything. They haven't, it's based on reading the back cover of the book, like, oh, no, or the headline of the article, right? Or, or what everybody else in the marketplace is thinking, oh, you know, this company did this and I'm like, okay, did you actually go and try it? Okay. Or Christianity is terrible or, you know, Trump is this or, you know, this and I'm like, okay, cool, but like how let's dive into that further. And there's no substance and I'm willing to look like a fool if I'm wrong. Because if I look like a fool, I will update like that fast. I don't care. I've actually just thought about my belief system. Because at the end of it, you've wronged the truth. Show me I'm wrong because I want to be wrong then so I can update it. And when you come up from that approach, I don't think you have much to hide at that point, right? Like, you don't, people can be like, oh, you're so controversial. I'm like, well, then the truth is controversial. So be it. But I like that though, because I've seen you. Nothing else is more important than the truth. I've seen interviews with you where it's like, I am so for all the things that you're saying, I'm like, I agree with this. I agree with this. And then on the other end of it, with a different interview, I'll be like, okay, I probably disagree with what you're saying, but you're so eloquent in the way that you have those like challenging conversations with people that it's almost, we could use more of that. I'll just say in the political landscape where like you can have a debate, but you're doing it out of the goodness of your own heart and what you truly believe. And not because you are trying to trick people or just get a bunch of people to believe you blindly, because you genuinely care about the topic at his. I was going to say the same thing and I'll second that too, Josh. I think you have a real knack and a talent for people know that you're not trying to do the gotcha thing. You're actually doing this in a loving way, trying to understand, and people can see that about you. So other people who try to pull that off can't. And so there has to be, you know, in a building. Many people cannot. Yeah, exactly. And you're good at it. So huge. If I can make one comment on that, which is I think that that skill will make you. Outrageous amounts of money when you apply it to the entrepreneur model, because I believe that what I'm actually doing, because I've studied this a lot, I believe that what I'm actually doing is I'm trying to have a conversation based on values. And when you look at powerful relationships, there's the three, the cycle, everything I do is based on psychology, because if it's not, if there's not a principle in a psychology behind it, then it's a tactic and it will be washed away when under pressure. But when you look at the golden mic method and when you look at powerful relationships, there's three things that have to happen. The reason Russell Brunson and I have a relationship or you and I have a relationship or Dan Henry and I have a relationship. Number one, a relationship of any capacity starts on shared values. If we do not have any shared value in general, like at all, like it's not going to work. Second, you can't even have friendships that way. You can't write. So in business, it's like, what are our shared values? Second is in order for a powerful relationship to happen and to grow, it must be mutually beneficial to both parties. Both parties have to get better. Yeah. Right. And third is there has to be consistency over time. So I'm very good at having conversations with people based on values because I want to understand why you believe what you believe in all those things. And when you apply that to a business conversation and I figure out, oh, Russell Brunson and I or, you know, Laura and I or, you know, Chris and I or Dan Henry and I or Brad, whoever we connect on family values and faith values and integrity and this and oh, by the way, that's step one. Now let me go and say, Hey, Chris, if you and I are going to have a better relationship in the business sector and both of our lives need to get better. What's the currency of getting better in business? Money. Yeah, it's money. So either I have to give you a lot of money or you've got to give me a lot of money. One of the two, because if you give me a lot of money and I make your life better, then my life gets better, your life gets better. Yeah, value. It's all you all around. Right. And so when you start to apply that principle out and you go, OK, the interview, the podcast that I'm built or that I've created, it's there to connect on values. It's there to have these deep conversations. I don't care if you like Starbucks or not. And for me, like politics is important to me, but it's not a values conversation. I am friends with people that like that's a level two. It's substance. They're surface substance values, right? To me, politics is substance, right? I have deep conversations with people that hate Trump, right? And I'm like, cool. I also do business with them. Do you know why? Because that's a substance, not a value. My value is, do we treat people right? My value is, is like, are we ethical and do we are we honest? And when we connect over those values, now I go, cool. You have a business that's aligned there. So do I. Hey, do you need help with marketing? And then I go, yeah, and I go, I can help you solve that problem. And now they pay me money. I make their life better. And so when you just play that out. So when you yeah, when you. Also, presidents will come and go. Your values will stay the same. Right. Right. Exactly. Like what I think about a political who cares? But for some people, some people, their values are based in politics. Yeah, mine aren't. So it's like, cool. If we're not going to connect there, maybe we don't do business together, right? So the podcast becomes this place. The reason I think different theory was so successful. The reason the show is so successful is it becomes the place where I can build powerful relationships with people. And when I structure it in such a way that my ideal client. Someone with money, someone that's successful, they want to come talk to me. Yeah. Now we can sit down. We can build a conversation or have a conversation and build a relationship based on values. Now, Chris, if you and I are homies and you're in business and I'm in business, and we connect on values, don't say if we are homies. OK, but if we were, OK, we are, but we want to do business together, right? Yeah. Now it's not a matter of, oh, you're going to try to sell me something. It's like, I want to do business with you. How do we make this happen? How do we do something together? Right. And you go, well, what problem do you have? Exactly. Oh, and then people wonder how sales is not complicated. Right. It's not. It is if you try to sell, if you try to pitch, if you try to pressure, it starts to get pretty complicated and messy. But I don't. I never sell anything. I learned that from Myron Goldin. It feels so organic. And I love that you articulated basically like the perfect mission statement or purpose of a business by talking about, you know, the different levels of values and how to build relationships. And really, it's about people. Like if you put people first in what their needs are, like the selling will come naturally. Yeah. Yeah. I put values first, but yeah, but people. Yes. Yes. Yes. Then people then sell. I guess people, I guess people in the sense of I won't work with certain people. Like some people are like people first and I'm like, the values, the values have to align. I want to find people I align with and then put them first. Yes. Because we align on values, but I don't want to put someone that doesn't align on values with me first. I want them to go lose. I want to be the person who shares your values and you want to. Yeah. For sure. 100 percent. I know for the sales. Let's put those. Those of you out there right now who share the same values as Josh, where do they go to find more out about this gold mic method? How do they get in touch with you and get involved? I got to give you that opportunity. All right. Go follow Russell to the ends of the earth. That's how you go and do. OK. Like you'll see I will be at FHL. I'm in inner circle.
