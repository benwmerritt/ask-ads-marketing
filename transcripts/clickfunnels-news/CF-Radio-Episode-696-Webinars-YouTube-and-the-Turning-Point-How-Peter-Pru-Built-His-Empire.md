Here are your hosts, Laura Demetrius and Chris Cameron. Welcome back to ClickFunnels Radio. My name is Chris Cameron and joined with me as always is my awesome, phenomenal, incredible co-host Laura Demetrius. Aw, thanks Chris. Do you like my Taco Bell headset? You guys who are listening right now, you can't see my awesome Taco Bell headset because I'm actually traveling and I didn't bring my, you know, my regular microphone. We are super excited to have Peter Pru on today. Peter has built and grown and scaled multiple seven and eight figure businesses online across multiple industries. Matter of fact, he actually has, he's one of, not that many. I mean, we have, gosh, it's probably 300, something like that, two comic club X winners. This is people who have made over $10 million in a funnel. He's the founder of Ecommerce Empire Builders, which a lot of you are familiar with, where he shares his tactics and strategies for building wildly like profitable e-commerce businesses. He's also the founder of storefunnels.net, untapped focus supplements and Ecommerce Empire Ventures. Peter, what is up? Just a few things. Just a few things. And now another one and we'll be, I don't know what, what it's called now that two CCC, CCCC, whatever, whatever that it was. There you go. Hopefully soon. I don't even know where I'd put that. There's just a lot. Not in the long run. I bet you can make room. Well, you know, it's funny. I'm looking in your background and I'm just going to start with something that we didn't even like, you know, plan on talking about, but you have a two comma club X, which is like an eight figure award. But I also see in the back, you have one of these kind of elusive trophies. It's the dream car winners, the steering wheel, which one was harder to get? Two CCX for sure. Was it really? Yeah, for sure. For sure. But yeah, the award system I love, right? Like we even did it for our own programs and clients and stuff like that and displaying that. How Russell introduced that whole thing. It was just so genius, right? Like it is like, it's arbitrary, but it is so nice to like be, you know, to get work towards something, right? But then you hit it. You hit that goal. Like I was just like, oh, I just want to hit two comma club. And then it's like, no, you don't, then, you know, I have a closet full of them now. All right. So it's like, you know, so it's, you know, it's just like, you know, we joke about this. I don't know how appropriate this is to say, but you know, internally we see two CCXs and you teach two comma club awards. Yeah. Right. Like so we, yeah. So we look at that. Like that's like a baseline. Now that's awesome. I mean, look at all the people that, you know, you click funnels has changed the lives of. So it's, it's wild. And you know what we were just talking to before we hit record. You were on ClickFunnels radio. Well, it used to be called Funnel Hacker Radio with Dave Woodward. And you were mentioning that he's the one who actually got you into funnels and got you into ClickFunnels. Tell us a little bit about that. Yeah. So, you know, some of you that know my story would know this because I do bring this up. I was in a mastermind group over 10 years or whatever, ClickFunnels, about 10 years, right? It had to have been. And you know, I was just building just my e-commerce businesses the traditional way on Amazon or, you know, a WooCommerce platform. Didn't know anything about direct response marketing. Didn't know what that was. I actually read Dan Kennedy books back then and I was like, what is he talking about? What is that? It really was so confusing. I would go like halfway through and it makes no sense. And now I pick it up and I go, this is like all common sense. It's weird how it works like that. Because I didn't understand the new pages all upselling and collecting leads. Why do I want leads? Like what do I want emails for? Right. And I remembered Dave and I think it was with somebody else, but I don't remember who that was. And they were just demoing the ClickFunnels software. Oh, like, hey, here's how you can use this for e-commerce. And they were trying to explain to a bunch of Amazon people how, you know, this will work for an e-commerce business too. And like ever since then, like my mind just completely shifted on how to build e-commerce businesses. I mean, just like do, you know, one of the big things that we started doing at that time was like free plus shipping offers. Right. We still do the same exact thing from 10 years ago to this day. A lot of these principles just stay the same, but, you know, I've never understood it before, you know, he, he came on there and demonstrated it. A lot of people in that mastermind didn't see the power of it. And I was just like, like the light has, I know the answer now. I know why my business isn't as profitable as it could be. I was, you know, early stages of running my fishing subscription box business at that time. And I always was trying to sell like the subscription on the front end, right? And, and, and the front end subscription sucks because it's like signing up to pay bills, right? Like people just don't want to do that. Yeah. It's, it's just difficult, right? So at that point I was like, wow, like learning that I could still sell this. I just got to sell it a different way. So what we started doing is we were doing like free plus shipping on like fishing lures and then order bombs, upsells, you know, selling more of the same thing on the upsells and then having the subscription in the actual upsells. Right. And that made a world of a difference because we were getting on some cases, depends if it was like a trial or like a full price thing. There were times where we were getting like 20, 30% of people that came through the funnel signing up for the subscription. Right. So it just made an absolute world of a difference. Ran that for, for years. I was in another mastermind group where it was just only subscription box business owners. So they didn't, they surely didn't know like marketing very well. They were very just obsessed about the product, which is important. They'll get me wrong. They're just very, you know, they were so into just the product and the design and stuff. And every month I would go in there and I would post pictures of like our stacks of boxes, you know, going out with our fishing lures and we were growing like 300 new members every single month at that time. And then one, one of the, you know, there was always a ton of comments and a ton of engagement for me in that group because they kind of started, you know, I started making a name for myself. Probably mostly being, how did you do that? Yeah, exactly. Right. How did, how did you do this? I was like, I'm just going to explain it in text form and like, Hey, I'm using funnels or what's a funnel like, and it's like, you know, down the rabbit hole. So I started at that point it was called subscription empire builders. I like thinking of very long domain names. This is like my stress, which is, which is actually very long domain names. Cause that's exactly what you, Laura, you were asking about was like continuity, right? Yeah. You know, it's fascinating because you, you jumped into this and I have, that's where I had like the most questions that I went. Yeah. Sorry. I told you I can rant. I know this is great. We always love when people can chat our ears off. That's the best. But, you know, as most, most of our listeners know, Russell introduced the whole linchpin idea and the framework for building funnels and, you know, having a continuity business and you talked about subscriptions and, you know, when you try to sell it on the front end and how it's like asking people to pay bills. So true. So when you learned, especially I love the full circle moment that you had with like Dave Woodward introducing you to this world and now it's kind of second nature for you and people in the subscription business probably are like, wow, what, like give us your insight and your perspective on this because there's a new way to do business. What was that like aha moment switch? Was it when you decided to kind of re-engineer the way you did funnels? Because like that, as Russell tells everybody now is like the continuity business is like that's the sustainable thing. Like that's the route to go. So like, what did you learn from all of that? And what would you tell people? Yeah. I don't know why, but like kind of like, I'll kind of briefly kind of go back for a second. I had an Amazon business was doing like $80,000 per month, lost that business because somebody made like false IP claims on me. There was nothing there, but Amazon basically shut us down and made the two sellers work it out because they're not, you know, legal, right? Amazon's again involved in it. And that happens pretty often. All the time. All the time. So, you know, I learned a tough lesson there. Don't sell on Amazon like primarily as your like main sales. At that point, when I lost that business, like a year or two went by and I was like, you know, just blaming everybody but myself about my problems. And I had all this inventory at Amazon and, you know, I kind of got back into it and I said, Hey, then if I'm going to go back into this, I want to make sure I'm building something sustainable. I'm building something I have full control of. And you know, I did try a bunch of different niches and products get involved in, but, and this is me saying this, you could take this. I always was in a frame of mind with building my business. I wanted to get some into something I was passionate about, like whether I lose or win, I'm going to just have fun doing this and fishing is just something I love to do. So I was like, you know what, screw it. Let's just go in this. And during that time, like, I guess subscription boxes were becoming like a popular thing. There was a really big one at that time in the fishing space that was like brand new. It was called like mystery tackle box. And I was like, wait, like I'm subscribed to them. Like why don't I, being a business owner, like create my own subscription box. So I don't know like why I did it, but I just, I always thought my back of my bed is like, I don't want to start the month at zero every month. Like that was always my thing. Like why do I have to always fight for new customers? Why can't I, you know, have new customers and have this reoccurring aspect of my business? I mean, 100% like it is the most important part, especially if you ever want to sell your company as well, right? Your values more, you sleep better at night. Like, you know, like it was so, even if you have a crappy month of sales, like that subscription can save you, right? Even the business that I run now, like all of them, I, I'm always thinking, how can we add, you know, reoccurring to it? I mean, it's so, so key. But as far as like the different kinds, I mean, obviously I've done subscription boxes with physical, physical products. You could do like subscribe and save stuff. That's what we do with like supplements. Like people need them anyway. So you might as well just let them get a better deal. And then obviously digital members areas are really nice. We have a few of those in our, in our digital product business. So it's like basically like a webinar, they get access to every single week and like a member weird question. Do you ever combine the two? Cause I'll have some people who like, Hey, why would I ever build like a membership site if I'm selling physical products? Is there ever a time where you would merge those? Like maybe as a bonus material? Yeah. So what we'll do now is like, Hey, if we're doing a physical product, we'll always add in digital products into that. So, so like for example, when I was running my fishing business, what I did is they did have a members area and in that members area, it would teach them how to use the products that they got every single month. So I basically found this guy in West Virginia paid him $500 a month because he based. So this is how I find people to be like, if you don't, if you're scared to create content for yourself or you don't even know what, you know, you don't want to be the face of your brand based. I found this guy on YouTube. He had like a hundred subscribers, but he's been posting videos every day for like three years and he gets like 20, 30 views and he's like my perfect person. He's like, on his kayak fishing and I hit him up and I was like, Hey, I'll pay you. All I need you to do is, you know, shoot like four videos for me a month. You know, I'm going to send you products for free. You review it and like it was awesome. I mean, and this is still to this day, what I tell people to do, especially if you want to do like some sort of continuity and stuff, leverage other people's expertise or and stuff like that. But yeah, basically he would review, he would create a tutorial video for each of the lures because fishing is complicated. It might not like sound it to somebody's not in it, but like once you're in the hobby, like depending on the water color, depending if it's sunny out, if it's, you know, cloudy out, the temperature of the water is so much involved in fishing. Yeah. So there was a lot of digital products available for us. So we didn't sell like courses and stuff, but we did have this digital members area part of the continuity. So yeah, but this is behind a login. So this isn't just like, hey, you know what, you buy this and we'll send you, you just go to this guy's YouTube channel. You still make it. Oh yeah. People have to log in. It was part of the offer. It was part of the offer. I love it. For sure. That's such a cool way to combine that too. And it's great because yeah, we would have like a Q. So we'd have like an insert card in our subscription box as well that always reminded them like, hey, go to this URL. I think we eventually when like QR codes came out, like we were like, oh, just scan it. It'll go to the, you know, create your account. Make sure you use the one you purchased with. So you actually see the content. Yeah, it's great. And it creates a more community aspect with these subscription boxes. And it has a ton of value. Yeah. You want to create the community because, you know, it's the subscribe and save is kind of like the cheat code of it. Cause if they really like your thing, like they'll just subscribe and save to it. But if you want to do like a subscription box, you kind of need to create a community around it. Otherwise they'll just like kind of cancel on you. You know, you look at like FabFitFun, that's a massive box and they've done extremely well, right? Like creating a community around their, around their products. And then also just this is key as well. Like the value needs to obviously be there in these physical subscription box. Like if they can just go out and just like buy the same product for like even equal value, they're not going to, they're not going to stay on. So you want to, I think that exclusivity is like a really key point of that too. It's like, you know, you mentioned being a part, like it's a membership program and you're redirecting them and telling them to go back to be a part of that membership, which is also huge for brand. Like it's brand recognition. It's people feel like they're a part of something and they love that you're kind of like you utilize that influencer marketing perspective of like you're getting people who are creating content for you and acting as influencers and creating testimonials and tutorials and all of that. Like that's exactly what gets people to feel like they're a part of something really special. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And you, you know, you can. So what we would do as well, man, like this is like bringing back old memories. I'm like, yeah, I missed this business. But so we would, we would create this angler of the month. Anglers basically like a full term for a fisherman, right? And basically they would have to to get become angler of the month. You'd get like six, I don't remember what we did, six months or a year of free boxes. Like you'd get that. And then there were like different rules that we had to like enter, but basically it'd be like tag us on social media. You have to catch a fish with this fishing lure, you know, and like all these bunch of stipulations and a bunch of content from your customers. Yeah. Yeah. Basically it was a hack to get a bunch of content from our customers. And then we would put them like on our insert card, like on the whole back. Like the picture with the fish they caught and it would be cool because they'd hold on to that thing forever. Who's going to throw that out? Right. You talk about these, you know, the awards and everything else. People want to be highlighted. They want to see that they did stuff. Status. Yeah. That's exactly right. But you know what I was just thinking as you're going through this, Stuart McLaren, like in one of our two comic club ex coaching program thing, he has a module that we use and he's talking about like the subscription stuff. And one of the things that he mentioned was, you know, tie the month club. And a lot of times, you know, if you have something that's going subscription wise, there's a number of reasons why people may unsubscribe. For example, like with the, right? It's like, oh man, well, I'm not at that many occasions where I'm wearing ties, you know, all the time. So maybe I get like 50 ties and I feel guilty that I'm not using them. So my point is like even, you know, the tackle box thing, like all this stuff. If you have a subscription box, is there something key to keep people to stick? Like what do you do in this where it's just like, OK, well, I got some, you know, three more lures. Maybe they're maybe they are fishing enough to use all those different ones. But there's something you do to make sure that these people are sticky for a long time. Yeah. So this is tough, right? Like with ties, I would need to go like research this to figure this out. Yeah. Because yeah, I'm with you like just like high level. It's like, yeah, like I haven't wore a tie and I don't even know the last time. Status is a big one. And I'm sure you could say this from your perspective. I can say it as a consumer because like, listen, I like I am the consumer. If there's a subscription box out there where like one product looks attractive to me or it's like aesthetically appealing or I feel like it's just something fun and different that I can't buy on Amazon. I will sign up for that subscription box. And the thing that gets me to stay every single time is like it's like rewards or it's like a VIP status. I use rent the runway all the time. And if I if they offer like, you know, after six months of being a member, you get an extra item in your box or you get early access to our products or you get to start to curate your own things like that stuff is key for the consumer. And this is like, so I'll tell you what we did that kept people on. This is tough, right? It's hard to speak just to a general audience about this because it's like your situation is going to be completely different than everybody else. I hate that answer because that's what people told me, but you will figure it out. If you just like a merchant, this is what I say. Be passionate about your niche and love it because this stuff is so much easier. So me, when I was running this business, I was like, Hey, okay, I'm not going to be able to compete with this venture backed mystery tackle box company because they're getting the fishing lures mad cheap, right? They like best pro shops, Walmart. They literally their box was $60 of value and they were given it to people for $20 a month. There's no way I have those connections or anything. So I knew like I couldn't compete on that. Like there's just no way I can overvalue them. So what I did is I my big angle was you are getting. So I'm trying to phrase this right way, but like every like a lot of bass fishermen have like their favorite baits that they use, right? Like that's like their go to their having a shitty day, but they're going to switch to their favorite fishing lure and use it. So my angle was, Hey, try other favorite anglers baits. And we would only work with small bait shops that don't have the worst online stores known to man. Firstly, you like it's a pain in the butt to order them. And I would find them and they would usually have like an Instagram following and stuff like that, but all the baits that they made were custom made baits. Right. Like fully custom, not like China, nothing like that. They were all custom made. Can't get it anywhere else. You couldn't get it anywhere else unless you literally like, like the way communicating with them was like, they had a Gmail account and like, I had to order it that way. Like that was it was a pain in the butt. And but they also gave us value too, because we would create stickers for their brand and we, we wouldn't even charge them for it. So like I gave value to this brand that's going to be featured in the box that month and it would only be them. When you look at all the other guys, they were featuring 20 different brands and a bunch of products in a box with ours. It was like, no, to this. So it was a win-win. There were some months. Is the brand. Yeah. This is the brand of this month. Right. Um, and there would be, there were some months where some of them, this didn't happen that often. So don't bank on it, but they would just be like, okay, no problem. We'll give you the stuff for free because they're like, you're going out to 3,000 people, right advertising for it's free advertising. We're creating them stickers. They're, you know, they're going to get a ton of content from our people, uh, created around this. So yeah, you have to be a little bit experiential too. And like if you're working with, you know, artisans or people who are creating a very specific type of bait or tackle, they feel like, Hey, this is something I can't get anywhere else. That feels really cool. Or, you know, they're really great fishermen. Maybe they're not an influencer and they don't have a giant following, but they can provide you with the experience that they've had using this bait and tackle to say like, Hey, use what this person uses. Here's how they found success using it. And those people are going to feel like I'm getting something that you can't get anywhere else. This isn't like wholesale stuff. This is like, it feels very nation, very special. And it was so cool. Like the, the photographs of some of these lures, like they were insane. Like some of the designs on like the plastic worms and baits and like the lizard looking things, like they were like, wow, this is, these are works of art. Like these are, and again, as a consumer, I want to have something that nobody else. Yes. Yeah. And one other thing that I also added into this, it's not a requirement, but I think it definitely helped us. We had like a charity aspect of this business as well. Always. Yeah. Especially in subscription. So basically it was like getting kids to go fishing, like in underprivileged neighborhoods as well as special needs kids. So amazing, but also amazing for the business because then when these people would go host events, they would have like banners of our business out there. I would have a table out there with all our stuff. I wasn't there physically because it was, they were all over the country, but like there would be like somebody there, like manning a table, handing out like pamphlets of our becomes like guerrilla marketing too, on top of it. Yeah. Yeah. Now we didn't, we were by no means a massive business compared to like a mystery tackle box where I think they had like hundreds of thousands of subscribers. But at our peak, we had about 4,000 people, which is massive, you know, for us, you know, and they're all paying like 20 to $40 a month. So Russell, it's continuity. It's black and white. It's clear numbers. No. Russell, Russell talks about that in a linchpin too. He said his buddy, David Fry, taught him this and he repeats it all the time. If you don't have continuity, you don't have a business. And just like you said, Peter, like starting over every single month, you know, is absolutely wild. You know, beyond subscription boxes. Okay. I mean, people talk about, you know, discounts, that type of thing. Subscription boxes makes a lot of sense. How else could you have continuity with physical products? Yeah. The, you know, like, for example, like fitness is an easy one, right? Like you, I like to think of it like, hey, when you sell somebody a product, you're introducing a whole new set of problems to them, right? Because it's something to sell somebody something. You then need to sell that person on using. I got six pack abs, but I need seven pack abs. Yeah. Right. That's the new problem. Yeah. So it depends on, you know, obviously the physical products. But usually I always look, I, I always like to start with digital, if possible, because you're, you're a hundred percent margin, basically. Like, you know, there's a lot more in there. One hack that I've used, and I think this will be helpful to like total beginners is this is why I choose my niches wisely that I get involved in. Like I wouldn't go into something and then try to figure out the subscription. Like I'm looking at the niche if it's even possible. So I only really involve myself in with hobby niches. Only. And the reason for that is because there's always physical products. Yeah. And guess what? People that have like hobbies, they're usually trying to get better at it in some ways, shape or form, some goals where their discretionary income goes to. Yeah. And there's always a lot of digital products, right? Education. Yeah. Yeah. So like anybody that does any hobby, like I just picked up Jiu-Jitsu like two months ago, now I'm getting bombarded with all these information products and physical products. I didn't even know these things existed. Yeah. And before like being in the niche. So you got to kind of like choose your niche wisely, but also why I love hobby niches. And this is kind of like the secret sauce, especially when we're doing the stuff for clients and stuff. Is there's always new people coming into this hobby, right? Like there's always people getting into gardening. There's always people getting into fishing. Golf. Yeah. Golf. There's always people coming into it that we'll see. And guess what? When do you spend the most money when you are kind of getting into something right at the beginning? Right? Yeah. Like you're buying like, you know, your gardening tools. You're buying some books, your ebooks, of course, on how to grow a veggie garden. Like you're doing all these things, right? And that's when you're most excited about it. And that's the perfect time for them to see your ads. Right? Like it's like to tie into this. That's a great point. I never really thought about it that way, but as a hobbyist, you know, it's not even a very specific demographic all the time either. Like anybody could get involved. I mean, I could be an angler, you know, like there's so many people that are just looking for something new. And as an Enneagram 7, I talk about this with my friends and family all the time about how like I'm just very like, I'll jump into whatever, whatever's like, sounds exciting to me. If I have some free time, I'll take a dance class or I'll learn a new language. And this so applies to so many different types of people that are just looking for something new, especially in the new year, which is interesting timing because everyone's looking for something new hobby to do, something to feel. It's to have conversation around and, you know, this being in the hobby business, it's really fascinating to think it could technically apply to anybody. Yeah. And there's so many, there's literally thousands of hobbies. You wouldn't even believe what people are, you know, enjoying. You know, one of our very successful funnels that we're currently running is in the sewing niche. The sewing niche. All right. There's so many digital products in there, so many physical products and consumable products as well. So, you know, it really is. If your niche matters, because like it would be tough for me to like think of a subscription, I don't know, for like a random niche like that, you know, isn't really a hobby. You really want to position it because like, again, with hobbies, people are trying to get better at it, increasing their status, right? Whether they're, you know, doing something with other people, like with my fishing business, you know, our always our kind of like biggest hook was, like catch your next personal best, right? Catch your next personal best. Oh, that's good. All right. So that was always, that was always kind of like, you know, you want something like that. You want them to strive to the next level because I'm when they hit that level, they go to the next level. Like, and that's how. Two comma club X, two comma club C, right? Exactly. There's never an end. And with hobbies, there's never an end, really. You just keep doing the thing and you get better at the thing. But yeah, I recommend if you need an edge, get into one of those because those are usually the easier ones. And plus you can document your journey while you do it and build up your own personal brand at the same time because people love watching other people kind of get involved. And, you know, I personally recommend if you can be your own face for your brand. Funny that you say that because this is not, you know, we're talking about these subscription boxes. This is not where you made the two comma club X and all these things. It was by teaching other people to do this. And I know you're kind of like, OK, that's on autopilot. That's kind of running, you know, but now you're into something new and kind of starting something else. What are you excited about now that you're working on that you can tell us about? Yeah. So, you know, obviously I have a couple different companies that I that I run from e-commerce to physical, obviously to to our digital products. And, you know, the one that I'm kind of getting involved in right now is more so sharing how how we grew our business, how we grew our e-commerce empire builders business to now close to the $25 million mark, which is insane. So awesome, Peter. Like when I think about that, I'm like, I don't even believe it because, right? Mind you, I never finished that story. I started it as a hobby. Like I started e-commerce because I was posting in that subscription group. So what I was doing and then I needed a place to upload some tutorial videos. And then somebody hit me up a month after I was like, Pete, I have no idea what you're talking about. Can I just pay you 500 bucks to build me a funnel? And I was like, holy crap, it was like discovering funnels for the first time. I was like, you're going to pay me? Which that feels like the most like authentic, organic journey of growing a business, especially with it starting with something that you love. Like I just I don't think there's any better way to grow business than do that way. I was just and it's like Russell says, right? And this this piece of advice from him changed my life. I do a webinar every single week for a year. I was crazy enough to do it and I did do it and it changed my life. But I would add to that as well to the craziness is create a YouTube video every single day for a year and you will not have any problems, you will not have any more problems. Right. So like you just have to this is what I always stress. Be passionate about like what you're doing because you'll never you'll never stick with it, you know, long enough. Right. It's nice to say all these numbers right now, but like there's still I'm dealing with issues every single day. Right. Like it's not, you know, it's not all easy. But yeah, I launched a new one called Digital Empire Builders. Play on. We have a book, right? We have the we have a book to Ecommerce Empire. So that was been like the number one best seller on Amazon for e-commerce since we launched it about two years ago now. Congrats, man. So there's a lot that we're doing now. But like it all hinders on like just being like I said, being a rationally passionate talk about the if you're willing to talk about the same thing to the rest of your life. Like there's no reason you can't make that a career, right? Or start a business around it. You can you just got to get over that hurdle, right? Of being scared. That's one of the big points that I say in this new kind of like YouTube channel. So I have nothing to sell there. By the way, it's not even a business. It's just me uploading some content about how we're built, how we've built. Documenting the journey. Yeah, I'm just exactly. I'm just talking about the journey, right? I'm doing the same exact thing. If somebody, you know, if it comes into a business, awesome, but I really have no plans for that. But I'm willing to, you know, put my face out there, talk about it and you don't know what's going to happen. Right. And you want to you want to do the same thing for your business. And in that channel, I set that expectation. The digital product business, in my opinion, is extremely difficult. It is the most financially rewarding, but it is the most difficult business model, right? Because with physical products, which I think is the easier business model, you have that like Santa Claus effect. I push a button on computer and something comes in the mail. I got it. It's a thing you're selling in tangibles with digital products, right? You're solving problems now, right? You're not that you're not solving problems with physical stuff. You are, but you're like somebody buys your ebook, right? They're obviously in pain, right? They're trying to figure out a solution to them. They buy your course, they buy your high ticket service, whatever it might be. So number one, you're marked. You got to be a good marketer, right? If you're going to do digital products, right? You have to. But yeah, it's that's why I like to kind of like mix physical and digital, like at least. Yeah, I think that's right. Like, but yeah, that's such a cool takeaway, too, is, you know, we're doing this one fun only challenge. I facilitate a lot of these trainings and that's one of the questions to people like, Hey, all right, now go in. We're going to go to the app and we're going to start building out your membership. People like, I sell physical products. I don't need that. And so I love this connection too. It's like, Hey, as a bonus or, you know, increasing that perceived value or tutorials, you mentioned, you know, these digital products. That's one of the tough things about digital products is people may get something that is a trainer course. They actually have to do something with it with a physical product. They get the thing, whether they use it or not, they at least got the. They at least got the thing. You know what I mean? Yeah. And they may have the training, but are they going to go through it? That's where they're going to see the value where, you know, Hey, these lures can even be a piece of art. And it's it's pretty crazy. Well, if people wanted to find you right now and follow you, where do you want to send people like, what's the best place to see and get older? Just Peter prude.com is probably easiest. You can learn more about, you know, our companies. You can check out e-commerce empire builders, you know, what we're what we're doing there. Yeah, Peter prude.com. You're amazing. I loved this conversation. In fact, I know probably a little bit different direction than we planned. I mean, I had all these different questions for you, but I loved that we really dove into continuity and talking about the subscription boxes and like, you know, having a hobby business and it really turns into something so much bigger when you start it because you love it. And I think there's such there's a lot of value in that. One thing that I did want to ask though, before we wrap is it's just kind of a little sidetrack that we took and you talk about like trusting the process and documenting the journey. What would you say in terms of advice or just to give people a little preview of, you know, you said you were one of the crazy ones that did a webinar every week and you created YouTube content every day? At what point? What was the turning point where you actually saw results from that? Because I know that's not just an overnight success and it takes a lot of dedication and a lot of patience. What was that for you? So now kind of like starting over with a different kind of like new YouTube channel that I'm not promoting really, like cross promoting, trying to build that audience when I started that e-commerce empire builder channel, right? I didn't think about selling stuff. Like I, that is the secret. I like everybody wants to, I'm telling you, just go out to people, even if you don't have anything, you don't have a website. It doesn't matter if they like you and you're providing value. They will find a way to give you money just like that first person that gave me money to build their funnel and then he retained me for a bunch of other work. So I basically was running that channel for about two or three months. And I was just getting a lot of emails. So I started building out my funnel, right? I was like, okay, what should I do? Right. And then I signed up for Russell's program. I think it was around that time. It was called like two CCX coaching, but it wasn't like, it was a digital product. It wasn't like the one where you actually meet up and stuff. And that was the most amazing course I've ever, you guys need to resell that. Cause it was basically when dot com, not dot com expert secrets came out. It was like a course version of it. Walking you through your webinar slides, every single one. So basically I just started doing that. I was like, all these people are asking me for stuff. I don't really want to do done for you full circle. I do done for you now. Like all that's like our main business. Whatever. But I created the webinar, right? I understood the customer so much better because I've been engaging with them for through many, many months, right? But even more so, I started putting the webinar together. I started doing content obviously every single day. And I started putting a webinar in there every single week. And I ran ads to it, right? And these live webinars are amazing, right? But they are disheartening at times, right? They I would still do the same thing to this day, just being like, hey, live webinar coming up this Thursday. You learn everything you need to know. You learn so much about yourself. When you start a presentation, there is zero people on that. And you don't pretend like there's a thousand people. Oh yeah. It hurts. That's a humbling experience. I've done hundreds of them. I know exactly what you're saying. I try and I try and re kind of chase the nostalgia of it. And it's sad because you can never get that same feeling back. And it's like the worst, right? Because it's like you want to feel that again, but you just can't. You just have this memory. And I remember like I did like my first webinar or like my second or whatever. And nothing like there was nothing happening. Everyone's like, talking, oh, I got 13,000 my first launch. This stuff didn't work like that for me guys. Like at all. Like I was very I'm a slow and steady. But I remember it was like Saturday night, me and my wife or not even my wife at that time sitting on the couch, we're watching Netflix and my phone buzzes. And it was a thousand dollar course sale. And it was like. Changes everything yet. Like it was amazing. And like that feeling is just awesome. Like I would do anything to have that again. So like I'm jealous in ways of people I get to experience that because it's like, holy shit, it's like a first kiss. Yes. Yes. But it is a bit of adrenaline. It's when you're the hungriest, right? Yes. Yes. Now you lose it a little bit over time. Like I've lost that a little bit because I've now I throw money at my problems, which is nice because I'm like, I look for the who, not the how, right? You guys know. Yeah. Um, I don't want to figure out how to build this funnel here. Let's get him. He's he's on our team. He builds funnels. So they look a million times better than mine. Let's just get him to do it. Right. So you kind of lose a little bit of that along the way. And that's normal, right? Cause as you build your business, your CEO, you're looking at more of the direction. You're not so involved in like fulfillment and the day to day stuff anymore. Yeah. But it's as Benjamin Hardy says too, and you mentioned who not how is, you know, always measure backwards and knowing where you are now is because you went through that phase. And all of the people who are able to throw money on the games have been there themselves too. And I'm sure they, you know, they value that, that distant memory of, of feeling that as well, which is, I think really, really cool. And you just enjoy it. Right. I just wish I could turn back time. I hate when people say this to me, like, oh, just enjoy the process. Like, cause it is, it's like stressful at that time. It's like, you just spent $1,000 this week to get people on a webinar. No one shows up and you're stressing, right? Like, but like in ways, it's awesome. It's awesome. That's inspiring. Well, this was awesome. Thank you, Peter. I love this conversation. Thank you for, for giving us your insights and talking about your past. And I love that this all seemed full circle in some way and how you were introduced to this and with Dave, I had a blast. So I appreciate it. Thank you. Yes. Yes. We'll have to have you on again to, so Laura can ask the rest of those questions. But I hope that we're all six years. Hopefully last six years. Yeah, that sounds like a plan. We'll do it. Well, for now, go to PeterPrew.com to learn more about Peter. And again, thanks so much for being a part of the show today.
