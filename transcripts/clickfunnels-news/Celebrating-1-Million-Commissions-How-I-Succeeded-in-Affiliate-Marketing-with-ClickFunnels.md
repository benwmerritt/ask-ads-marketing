## Transcript
Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels, and today I'm joined by Camila Markson. Camila is an ex-nanny, an expert marketer who started her business because she was tired of trying to find a job that could provide her with financial freedom. She decided to learn all about digital marketing and has since launched her own business, where she teaches others how to create funnels, offers, inexpensive leads for affiliate marketing using YouTube, TikTok, Facebook groups, email marketing, and much more. She has the financial freedom that she's always dreamed of now, and she's joining me today. Thanks for being with me, Camila. It's so great to talk to you. Hi, Laura. Thank you so much. I feel very honored to be here and sharing this with you. It's a great thing for me, for my journey. Well, I'm excited to learn more about you. I've been following you on social for a while, and I'm seeing all of your success and how exciting things have been working as a digital marketer. So can you start off by just telling me about how you got into digital marketing? Yeah. So I'm from Brazil. I came to United States, I think, in 2016. And I worked as a nanny for a long time, although I love kids, but I never wanted to be nanny for the rest of my life. So I tried to apply for the jobs, but my English wasn't great at that time. Like, it's still not great anyways. But I didn't have much experience, and I was struggling to find something else. Like, I didn't know what I could do instead. So I started looking like ways to make money online and things. I tried some side hustles that we see online. Like, I tried drop shipping, for example. And it was in 2019, 2021, that I found out about affiliate marketing. And it was when the key changed, you know, like it turned, and it started growing. Yeah, it's just been an amazing journey. And that's how it started. Yeah. Well, it's really cool. It's inspiring because seeing the content that you put out there, especially as a woman in this space, and with English being your second language, I find it so inspiring what you were able to do in such a short amount of time that your message certainly resonates with me. I can only imagine it resonates with so many other entrepreneurs who want to get started, or people who are maybe thinking about quitting their day job because they're just not happy with it. They want to look for more freedom. They want to do some things and consider other options. And I think you talking about that and sharing it on social media is just really inspiring to so many people. Thank you so much. What was it that brought you to ClickFunnels? Why did you decide that this is where you're going to build Funnels? So I tried a couple of the websites that you can build Funnels. But for me, just ClickFunnels was the easiest, the best for beginners. When I started, I had no idea what Funnels is. I had no idea how to build one. So ClickFunnels was the best one for me. It was the easiest one to understand and very intuitive. And the atmosphere, the community, and all these things. And also, I don't know, it's just like, I think the energy that also Russell brings to the company and everything. And how easy it was for me as a beginner to build something. And then I just stick to it. Yeah. And you mentioned Russell. And I know a lot of people that I've spoken with have said the same thing about Russell's teachings and his book and his energy and just his overall expertise and what he's willing to share has brought so many people in. That's what brings a lot of people to ClickFunnels. We also have an incredible community. I'd love to know what happened for you. Like, what came first for you? Was it the affiliate marketing in the funnel building? Or were you already pretty well-versed in social media or email marketing? Like, what kind of started all of it? I started everything from zero. Like, I had no idea. Of course, I always loved Instagram or TikTok. Like, just watching the girls talking about makeup, things like that. I always loved to watch that. But I didn't have any followers. I didn't have any experience. Like, I didn't know about ClickFunnels. So I started everything from scratch. And yeah. Wow. That's really inspiring. And it's only been the past few years, you said? Yeah. With affiliate marketing, I started in August 2021. And yeah, this Sunday, it was like one of my biggest days, like, milestone. I just hit 1 million in commissions with one of the companies that I promote. So it's, like, huge for me to think about. That's like, in so, like, in short period of time, I accomplished so much. Like, just blowing my mind. I honestly, I have goosebumps just thinking about that, what you've achieved in such a short time. And that's just one company that you promote for us. Yeah. And a million. And that's amazing. That's so inspiring. And I'm sure a lot of people are like, how do I get started? So what's the first thing I should do? You know, I think we try to doubt ourselves a lot. Like, think that we are not capable of. And at the beginning, I said to myself, I am not going to do anything. Like, I'm not capable. I'm not like a camera person. You know, like, I'm shy. I'm not like an extrovert person. And my English is not being so. I had a lot of excuses to put me out there. You know? So I think it's something that a lot of people maybe struggle with is just like, put yourself out there. Don't be afraid to try something new. And yeah. Yeah. I think that's true with a lot of things in a lot of different industries as people are so afraid of getting started because they have so much self doubt or even with authors having like imposter syndrome. Like, you know, who am I to talk about this? How are people going to listen to what I'm saying when there's so many other experts out there? What do you think it was that kind of gave you the courage to go out and do it? I just like, I didn't want to be an Amy. Like, I really didn't. And I couldn't find anything else. You know, so like for me, like I didn't have option. I put myself, I don't have this option. Like I keep seeing people having success online, you know, doing all sorts of like different things. Like if they, if they are doing like, let me try. I like, let me, you know, I don't have nothing to lose. And I know what I don't want for my life. So I had to like do it. Yeah. Yes. And, and sometimes it just comes down to cutting off ties with the finances or the stream of income that you had before so that you are fully investing in yourself and you're making no excuses. Like you have to make it work. There are no options. And it sounds like that's exactly what you did. You definitely made it work. Yeah. And it's like, if you can work like 40 hours a week or or whatever week, whatever hours you put in your, your regular job from making someone else like reach, you know, for like making someone else, I don't know, money, why you can't work? Take like some time to work for yourself, like to, to work on something that's yours. You know, That's so true. Yeah. And, and most of the time people do have free time. They just don't realize it or they're not doing something valuable or productive with it and take those couple of hours that you have at the end of a work day or early in the morning. I mean, you're living proof that, you know, things can change. You can build a business. Yeah. So back to starting with affiliate marketing. And you said that you were new to all of it from building funnels and social media and all of that. What type of funnel did you get started with? Was it just like a typical lead gen funnel? Yeah. They like, I'm not like, I'm not even an expert with the funnels. So I don't know what's going on. So different funnels that we have. I just know that like I was offering some lead magnet, magnetic. Okay. So in exchange to the email, so I could build my email list. Like I know I had a like a chain and bridge page. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. I mean, that's, that's inspirational in and of itself because so many people that are like, I don't know about this funnel stuff. I don't know about the tech stuff. I don't want to get too in depth with the software. You know, for somebody who doesn't even know all of the language or all of the different types of funnels, you started with something basic, like a lead magnet and an exchange for an email address. You're giving people something valuable or a piece of content to do lead gen. You created a lead gen funnel without even really knowing that you were creating a funnel and look at you. You, I mean, you've made over a million dollars and as an affiliate marketer already. So that speaks volumes that like you don't really need to know all of it. You need to care about a very specific part and just hone in on that craft, which is what you've done. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. You're never going to be like fully know everything, you know, feel really like, where did you start anything? So like it starts with, what do you know? Whatever you, what do you can? And that's, I think, yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm certainly so inspired by your story. I've been following you. I get your emails. I think that what you do is you, you send out a message in such an approachable way that it feels like anybody can achieve that. And I think that you're offering something that so many other people in the space aren't doing by saying like, Hey, like I, I wasn't an expert. I just wanted to leave a job that wasn't fulfilling for me anymore. And I just got started. I put one foot in front of the other. And I look at that as like, wow, like you really do kind of break it down so that it's not overwhelming and it's an approachable framework to follow. And I think a lot of people can resonate with that. Yeah. And essentially, like, I'm so passionate about all this digital marketing world because it truly changed my life. And like for me, I feel like an example that if I can do that, do that, you know, anybody can like, I didn't have experience. I didn't have the perfect English. I didn't have, you know, I didn't know anything about this tech stuff. You know, so like it's achievable and it's like we are living in like a great world like that you just need a laptop, you know, and the wife to start like a business to like, it's just amazing to me. Yeah. I think really the biggest obstacle is everybody is just getting in their own way. And if you just start and you get it done and it's not perfect, but you're brave enough to put yourself out there, then, you know, things can happen. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's it's so inspirational. I love what you're doing. I love following you. Where can people go to learn more about you and your business and what you're doing online? Oh, my Instagram is my main, my main platform that I'm on. And I like to connect to these people there. It's like Mila Maxson official. Okay. And we'll include that in the description as well. So people can check that out. And then just last piece of advice or something that you want to leave everybody with, what can you share with us today? And I just don't be afraid to, to put yourself out there. And when you start in this, like, don't ever compare yourself with anyone. Be consistent because like, I think it's the most important thing. Like people want sometimes like to see results, to see results very fast or to understand very fast, you know, show up every single day. That's the most important thing in any business, I think is be consistent, you know, and yeah, I think that's it. That's great advice. And again, Mila, you are living proof that making that stuff happen really does create an impact and especially with, you know, your background and using English being your second language, it really just proves to the rest of us that like, there are no excuses. Like if you really, really, really care about making a change in your financial freedom, all of the possibilities and the tools are there, you just have to work for it. So thank you for being my guest today. I look forward to hoping, hopefully seeing you in person. Will you be at Funnel Hacking Live this year? Yes, I will. I would suggest that they do a common thing. That yeah. Wonderful. Well, thank you so much for being my guest and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Thanks so much, Laura. It was a pleasure. Thank you.
