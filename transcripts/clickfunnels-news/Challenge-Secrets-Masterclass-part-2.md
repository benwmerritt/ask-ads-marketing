Let's talk about Yesterday so over the last week we've been talking about the challenge secrets masterclass. Okay Russell and Pedro Adele have been going live mostly Pedro and Yesterday we've talked about day one and day two already Yesterday was day three and on day three Pedro was able to take the stage Pedro talked about all these other things He invited a couple special guests You I think you might pay more attention to it than I did I definitely took notes, but what should happen to you Susan? Yeah, okay, so One of the things that people struggle with when they are launching He was revealed yesterday. I think he revealed like they've been kind of Surveying the audience of who's going through this masterclass and most of the people are are saying that they're wanting to launch something right there they are a little bit new in their journey and It's hard to know like okay, what am I gonna make my challenge about so that was what a lot of day three was about was like coming up with the the one thing right and So he brought on Sarah petty was guest number one. She just brought the house down It was so awesome to watch. She basically told her story of Because she's done so many challenges. She that is her business model that she's been doing I think she said since 2017 is when she did the first one But there were a lot of failures and so she just went through and showed examples She was literally like this was the first challenge I did it didn't work because of this and or it didn't work as well as we wanted it to right She actually said that since 2017 they've been profitable and all of the challenges that they've done But some didn't land well as as well as others and so she's just walking through showing I love when people show examples of like this is what I did and this is what we did next because we learned from this one So that's what she's doing and she goes through a lot of their iterations of challenges of like here's how we improved And that's obviously what we want people to do when their first launching is like it's not gonna necessarily work the first time Here's how you like what it looks like to continuously improve Then second person that was the guest yesterday was Russell Russell runs in the fun stage and he did his thing I think he was talking a lot about hook story offer But he went in a little bit and more into how it applies to the challenge model So that was awesome We're talking about hook story and offer just the day before Yeah So he went up there taught everybody, you know a lot of a lot of us that have been around a while We know these frameworks from Russell the people that are coming in new aren't as familiar with it So he's got to like make sure everyone's on the same page like know what the hook story offer framework is And so he talked a lot about that And so like one of the cool things that I took away is Pedro like created this framework in order to make sure that your Your launch is super super like Attractive like how do you actually grab people's attention with the name if you look at all the challenges that he's been helpful with but Dean Graziosi's Tony Robbins With the stuff that Russell's done They've always had a really attractive hooks a mechanism that brings you in and it's what is that what is your one funnel away? Is it your your one live away? Is it your one tick tock away like what is your thing and do you use that framing mechanism or can you use something different? And he gave five different ways for you to be able to break this down and I loved it because it was a cool It's a cool graphic. I liked it But then he also like talked about how how you can look at the problems this the the The desires what approach you're doing. What is your most sexy stuff? There's there's different steps and he breaks it all down that was That was really crazy to me and I missed Sarah petty and so I was That hurt. Oh But if you've missed anything the replays are available Like the replays are available all week long And so if you only have one day left to be able to dive in and to be able to catch up So make sure you're doing that over at challenge Secrets masterclass calm go ahead and register and you can find all of the videos inside of the inside of the Facebook group Everything is in there so that what you guys can catch up including what happened today? Because today was okay before you get into today. Oh, you can totally roll the video I was just gonna remind everybody like if you're watching with us right now Tell us what were your biggest takeaways since the last time we met on Tuesday, right? Put them in the comments Yesterday today like what did you guys take away? What's that? What are you gonna go implement? So okay? All right Okay, comment down below Today was a different day today was about traffic And so we talked about how to make traffic work and then talked about how to make traffic work for your biggest Like what is the number one thing that you need to be able to adjust or to be able to grow? Like what is the biggest thing that they could give us in order support? So we talked about traffic and Pedro talked he did a quick recap of everything talk about how guys Why did they give away today yesterday? yesterday they gave away I Forgot what they gave away yesterday. I should know It's a year zoom account. That's what it was. Yeah, that's what it was They gave away a zoom account for a year so that way you can run your five-day challenge inside of zoom and it's free It's taken care of so they've given away an iPhone and iPad and now it was zoom today They gave away his intensive program and it was crazy So if you haven't registered that they're giving away another prize tomorrow Go to prices.challengesecrets.com in order to be able to get all the details on that Cool thing that I have loved every single time he does this is he they take the homework that everybody does when you submit it They literally print it out and they talk through like what are people's biggest issues? What are the answers that people are giving and actually get you is you feel like you are very Tangibly a part of the entire thing by the way, this is Holly Holly is spectacular It was her birthday just a couple days ago and she was here doing all of this on her birthday So he recaps all the previous days including Sarah Petty And what are the things that you need to know in order to make sure that you're able to keep moving forward? And the biggest issue that most people have is traffic So he breaks down three different types of traffic. How do you get them? How do you how can you control it and how do you make sure that it works? He talks about the traffic that he's used most for the past five years He's only used one source for traffic out of the three. He's only used one And he's like I'm about to diversify and I want to introduce you to the person that is teaching me how to be able to diversify and So there's am I missing anything so far like no It's awesome and One of the things that blew me away before you get into like the person that he that he brought on He did like he kept calling in a menu, right? He's like I'm gonna give you the menu of all the different traffic options that you could choose and Just listen like I was listening to that part just audio I wasn't even watching the video and I was like, oh my gosh She's still going like he kept giving idea after idea after idea after idea. I'm like, oh, I never thought about that for traffic These are ideas that he's only shared privately like in his inner circle Like this is not things that he talked about talks about regularly and so like everyone's heard of other people's money Like if you're if you're in the real estate world and you're gonna do that Like you go when you buy this without other people's money they talk about that But then there's organic paid an affiliate and how do you use affiliate appropriately using other people's lists? other people's products other people's like it took it to a whole other level that No one really talks about in this kind of a place. It was So good and I'm like my gosh people don't know what kind of like reigning of gold is being Rained down on them. It was so so cool. So and the person that he brought on was Richard did did you know Richard before this? Oh Richmond Thank you. No actually wait. He was in Whoo, I got it. Oh, yeah Yeah, yeah, that's where I saw him. I'm like was it that one that I saw yeah, so that was my first introduction to him And yeah, it was awesome. I took so many notes. So yeah, you guys like being able to watch him during this challenge for free What a treat like he's amazing. Yeah, and richman's richman's out in was it Australia? He's in Australia, right? It's not it's not I'm getting trouble so Australia And so he was out in Australia. He zoomed in I can't imagine what time it was for him But he went and talked about all the process about how he got traffic for his first challenges and what massively works now There's we all know Everyone's DMs always get exploded with spam all the time I'm afraid to add people who are friends if you guys are asking to be friends of mine And I don't add you for a while is because I'm afraid of the DMs I don't want to answer all the crazy DMs of hey, have you been looking for a VA? Hey, da da da da all that jazz There's a way to do this ethically a way to do it well and that is how Richmond talks through the process. He teaches you that full process and it was it was really really cool today One of the things that thought was interesting was he was like a lot of people post their posts about how well they do Something they're like, I'm a great coach so that must be a coaching post on your social media He says tweak it just a little bit and allow yourself to be human Just allow yourself to be a human being post the things that are normal if you have not read traffic secrets Russell talks about the JK5 JK5 is a great way of understanding what topics you should be rotating through inside of your social media And he shows you how to be able to do that and so that is an excellent resource But Richmond talks about it in great detail. It was spectacular. So oh my gosh and then They dropped an offer and It's good It is so good It's one of those offers like Pedro was like look if you bought even all of my training on how to do this You should buy this like this is ridiculously well stacked the price is jaw dropping like It was so good and if you're VIP you need to watch the VIP replay especially because the VIP replay especially Pedro brought Russell on and they talked back and forth about how to make this such an amazing offer and what goes into that and it was a Really cool dynamic and a little bit different than I think I've ever seen in a VIP format One of the strategies in VIP is a lot of people in VIP Usually are those people who actually like Scale up to the next level And so what do you do in order to be able to take care of them and help them understand? Why moving up is valuable and so it was it was a genius move It was an excellent playlist and I'm like oh my gosh I need to add that to the next time like this is part of the blueprint of how you do a challenge So if you've missed it Go to challenge secrets masterclass.com make sure you're registered and go and watch all the replays in the facebook group because they are gold All right Did I miss anything? I don't think so. I did just have one thought though Because this is the last you guys are going to hear from us this week about challenge secrets masterclass so I had one more like kind of personal takeaway that I wanted to share And that was I actually have I think I've gotten more out of this week of watching what they're doing Versus the actual content that's being shared to me And it probably is because of of just the knowledge I already have and the place that I'm at in my business But if if you're like, I'm not launching a challenge Um, or I'm not you know, I'm not beginner like I'm more or further ahead like even just going through and watching what they're doing I've gotten so many ideas and if you're a funnel builder and you help clients do this stuff I was I was like writing down and I was like, oh, I have a client that could use this Um, so just watching what they're doing has been amazing. Just watching how Pedro like What his questions are what he tells everybody to type into the into the chat bot or into the chat He's like type this into the chat and if you look at it like If you structure what it is that he's having people do it's Preframing galore. It is so good If you're not yeah, if you're advanced watch it. It's pay attention. Oh That makes me want to watch it again With with that perspective, right? Oh my gosh My friends, I hope you've enjoyed make sure that you jump in like there's only one day left in order for you to be able to get all the Details Please jump in you're absolutely gonna love it and I I guarantee you're gonna love it like whether or not you are a beginner and you're trying to figure all this out for yourself Or you're the advanced person. You're like, how can I break all this down? This is something you don't want to miss you do not get to see Russell Brunson and Pedro Dale putting their heads together for a challenge to just to define all the challenges so Definitely go don't miss it And we'll see you again next week guys Bye My name is Russell Brunson and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started And we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite You see we have products and services and things that we know Changed people's lives because we're fighting against the big brands people with literally unlimited budgets We have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money We have to be profitable in day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you that what we are doing is impossible To get it happening every single day and it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking It's not really something that I can explain to you It's something I have to show you these stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you We have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories
