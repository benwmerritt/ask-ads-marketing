We need to make sure that you have access to it and we're good to go. Let's roll the intro and get into it. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. What's up everybody?

So let's go ahead and dive into our Trivia and Treasures question. Today... Okay, so I know it's still technically summertime. But here in Boise, we've been having chillier mornings and I've been needing like a sweatshirt when I'm out in the mornings. So we're giving away a ClickFunnels sweatshirt. It's like a zip up. It's like a lighter one. And the question today is the... Okay, the concept of the Dream 100 works for which type of business? Is it A. Coaches, B. Funnel Builders, C. E. Com, like physical products, or D. All businesses? And if you don't know what the Dream 100 is, Thressel talks about it, I think in all three books, but he talks about it a lot in Traffic Secrets, which I am reading currently. And Dream 100 is like a traffic strategy. So if you know the answer, put it in the comments, A, B, C, or D. And we'll pull it up a little bit later too before we reveal the answer. And then one of you will win our sweatshirt. You won the sweatshirt. I'm so excited. All right. So yeah, we'll bring that up a couple of times for you guys. And really quick, let's go into funnel hacking live news. Because there's some crazy stuff going on and there's stuff leaving today, like today. And so really quick, before we actually share the whole thing with you guys, what I want to do is there's a trailer that we dropped for this. This is an hour and a half long thing. It's only available for the next... Let me go see. 11 hours. Okay. So by the end of today, tic-tac, tic-tac, tiu, it's gone. So I wanted to show you this because it's just so cool. So let's roll the trailer and then we'll show you everything that's leaving. You guys believe it's like been another year since last year and we're here again? Funnel hacking live started as the ClickFunnels user conference, I guess you would say. People kept asking me finally, I was like, all right, let's go for it. Let's do the men. We sat down and said, if we are going to do this, it's not what everyone else is doing. We have to do something that's better. People deserve something more. To put on an event like this, it takes an army of amazing people. Whiteboard, room, whiteboard, whiteboard, whiteboard. These are all maxed out and none of my six presentations are done. Who would be the ideal person? Who's that dream person we want to get? Our goal and mission was to make it your best experience for every single attendee. The goal to be the pattern interrupt, to bring the magic every single day. And the goal for us is to be an example, like this would look possible. What's the end result you're trying to get for your customers coming to the event? What is the thing that they're looking for? And so your event is a vehicle to get them there. How does it do that? That's what you've got to figure out. The funnel hack in live documentary is coming down tonight. So that's just a trailer. And I was like, oh my gosh, these trailers are so good. There's another one. If you guys want to, we'll show the other one as we keep going because it's good too. There's nobody who makes these FOMO videos like the Russes team. So it's just absolute. So good. So good. So here's the deal. Let's go ahead and share my screen really quick. If you guys have not seen it, Russell has been dropping emails to you in your inbox about something called the funnel hacking live documentary. This is an hour and a half presentation that goes in depth on the strategies of how you build an event like funnel hacking live. How do you actually do this for yourself? What goes into funnel hacking live? What are all the pieces that work? All the madness that's behind the scenes as well as all the genius. And you guys get to see it all up front plus how it changes lives. So if you guys want to see the behind the scenes, you need to go and check that out. You can also check it out. If you haven't gone to your email and clicked on that, you can also go to FHLstory.com. You can opt in and get it. But just remember this goes away in 11 hours, four to three minutes and 23, 22, 21 seconds. All right. So you guys need to be there. You need to watch it. It is. It's absolutely glorious. Like I'm just going to click through to a couple of places. It goes all the way through like the prep work to how everything's going as they're getting ready to getting all the speakers in line to his presentations, like, until like the experience and what it works like and why it's structured the way it's structured. It is an absolutely brilliant documentary. If you guys have not seen it, it's a must see it comes down tonight. So this is like do it. All right. Because it's going away. And so I wanted to hit on that really quick because it's going away. It's Funnel Hiking Live and Funnel Hiking Live is what 27, 26 days away. So yes. So exciting. Okay. I still have to go watch it. I'm doing that. It's like in my calendar. Go watch it this afternoon. You can even do it tonight when you're going to sit down and watch some Netflix, turn this on instead. It's great for the family. Like Funnel Hiking Live is a family friendly event. All except for one presentation usually. And so it and we'll let you know who that is. But if you guys jump in and watch this like this is something you can watch around Netflix with the family too. And you go, oh, are you going to that mom? Are you going to that dad? So it's good stuff. Then they'll understand why you're going and where you're going and what's going on. What's the thing that you go to every year? They might come with you. I mean, it's right next to Disney World. Awesome. So good. Okay. Make sure you guys go watch that. We do have some water cooler moments. Yes. You talk about the most recent podcast that Russell's dropped on the marketing secrets podcast is actually one that like I had to go listen to it as soon as I saw it drop. Because there's been so much buzz. And like my Facebook has been filled with people talking about Alex Hermozzi's launch that he just did for his book. So Russell actually recorded his episode about this and Russell has a unique perspective because he knows Alex personally. Alex was part of Russell's inner circle for many, many years and he tells the story in this episode. And Russell even was in Nevada, in Vegas, in Vegas where the launch happened and like toward the location like the night before, before his event. So like he was like involved. He was knew what was happening. And so he has a perspective on it is really actually interesting because this isn't a podcast episode where he's just talking about the launch itself. But he's talking about it in a way of like, Oh, here's what Alex did from the perspective of an outsider watching. Yeah. And here's what I may have done a little bit differently or he did it for this reason, but I would have done it this way. So if you want Russell's take on how he would have done this launch. It's so awesome to listen to. Yeah. I love, I love how he also like there's at one point where he talks about how you can like, why is Alex doing it this way versus why like why do we do it the way we do it like why do we structure these things differently. And he talks about that and how you get it right. And it's, it's all about. I'm not going to. It's so good. It is like the one thing that he talks about here. I you know, joke. It has to deal with you guys. And it's, it's how we support you and what our goals are for you and how we help you move forward and what we create in order to make that happen. And so go and listen. This is gold. It also drops a really couple of really cool gold nuggets from Pirates Cove while he was there. It's, this is a great episode. I'm going to zoom in and zoom out a couple times like you guys need to go listen. You know, one of the, one of the things that he talks about is because I mean the title is called the controversial Hormose leads book launch, right. And I was watching all of the posts pop up during the whole thing and like, okay, I need to go get that book because I loved his first book. I'm going to go get a second book. When I saw this title, I was like, what was controversial about it? Like I wasn't in on what was the controversy. So that's why I wanted to listen to this and I'm not going to tell you what it is because you guys got to go listen to it too. But I was like, oh, that's what it was. Like people are really thinking that. So again, kind of what you said then of like, well, this is why Alex chose to do it this way because this is his business strategy. If your business strategy doesn't match his business strategy, then you wouldn't do it this way. So yeah, it was really good to listen to. It was short, 20 minutes long. Go check it out. Yeah, it's a great listen. And you kind of get to get into Russell's mind. Now, here's the thing. If you listen to this one today, tomorrow Russell's next one is dropping. And he cheeses a couple of other things that are going on as he's preparing. So guys, check out both podcasts. They're going to be great. That was last week's and tomorrow's drops tomorrow morning. So it'll be good stuff. Cool. All right. One other thing of FOMO or of what's going on in the community. Shall we talk about this real quick? Yeah. Yeah, so I don't know. I was going to say, I don't know how many of you know, in the certification program for funnel builders, there's actually contests. That happened. And it's really fun to see everybody's designs. And there's a winner that gets picked. Yep. And we just picked the winner. So here's the deal. They put out a post. If you guys are following the community, you need to be following the community. If you're not getting posts, come over here and say that you want to get all the notifications. Just click Manage notifications. So you want all posts. Okay. Make sure that you're getting all the notifications possible in here because we're giving you a ton of value. If you guys aren't seeing all the value, that may be one reason. Okay. There's a lot that's going on in here. We are filling this up with all the best things we can possibly for you. But we did a giveaway. So we highlighted five different people who had built application funnels. And we had you vote. You went and voted on these people and said, who do you want to win? And so the winners came out in third place is Malia Bertram. And so you can go see Malia's. You can actually see her. We tag her in here so you guys can see her if you're looking for a funnel builder. And if you want to see her funnel, her funnel is right here. You guys can go and see her funnel that she built. All right. The second place winner is Pooja Misra. And so you guys can see Pooja's funnel over here as well. You can see the top five. So you can see all the museum, our shallows and Joseph as well. The number one first place winner is Brooke. And we are so excited for Brooke. Brooke is spectacular. I do calls with the funnel builder certification folks every single week. I get to chat with them. I get to see like what's new and kind of support them in any way that I can. They are getting so much constant support. It is crazy. But Brooke is always been on the call. She's always been spectacular. And she is somebody who is in the know. If you guys are looking for a funnel builder who can design great. Brooke is wonderful and come and check out all of the designs from the entire team because all these guys are spectacular. That's what our job is. And if you want to be able to come and see like all their profiles, if you're looking for a funnel builder, go to funnelbuilder.com. There might be this ability for you to hire a funnel builder. We are collecting everyone who's certified for you so that way you can come in here and find somebody who's going to work for you. So you can get a recommendation. You can enter the marketplace and see everyone in here and you can go through their profiles. So lots of cool stuff. But congratulations to the winners. We're so excited for you. Awesome. It's so good to see every race designs and even if you're trying to be a funnel builder yourself, you can go funnel hack their designs. Yeah. So I don't know if I'm allowed to mention this, but my little sister has asked if she can start to learn how to build funnels. And so I shot a little video for her and give her access to my ClickFunnels account. And she was like, did you know you could like right click Chrome and inspect and I can see the spacing between things. She just graduated high school. I'm like, how did you figure this out? Like you just randomly did it. There's so many cool things that you guys learned in the funnel builder certification program. That's like my next goal is to get her interested there. And so she doesn't watch these. I don't think so. I think we're good. It's so cool guys. Check out the funnel builder certification program. So so so cool. Cool. Okay. I just realized I'm like missing there's so many of you watching and I was missing your comments. I just got pulled up on my phone so I can see that. Yes. All right. Okay. Let's do trivia really quick. Yeah. Okay. All right. We'll pull that question back up. So trivia we're giving away a sweatshirt. It's starting to get chilly in the morning. So concept of the dream 100 works for which type of business a coaches be funnel builders see ecom or D all businesses. What is your answer put it in the comments. We'll pick one of you to win a sweatshirt. Yes. All right. Let's talk about some hacker heroes. Shall we we want to highlight a couple of you. There are people winning and there are people that are giving out the things that they're winning. They're sharing all the gold and we want to make sure you don't miss those because there's some really good posts out there. So first off thank you to everybody who posts who comments who supports everybody. This is our community. We're so excited to have you. The first point we want to cheer is somebody that's on the team actually they finally got their two comic club award. We're so excited for them. Who is it. All right. OK. So this person is like heading up the ClickFunnels ambassadors. He posted this. When was it. If you want to pull up my screen. We can have August 24th. When he posted this. Danny Walsh got his two comic of award. So well deserved. And so this is his post. You can go check it out. But just just all of his thanks. And I like to this part this award is representative of years of hard work and sacrifice building up our own community and generating over three million in revenue from a really hard niche over here in the UK. So like you guys you guys can do this. He's doing it across the ocean from here. He is. It took years of hard work like you just got to keep at it right. And that's the cool thing like your two comic club award can be multiple years in the making. It doesn't have to be you make it. You make a million dollars in through a funnel in a year. You can build up to this. This can be something you continually grow into. And that's what Danny did. He did a lot of funnels to promote that one funnel and make it grow. And this is just excited. That's by the way that's him and his beautiful bride. Yes. Yes. Yes. Congratulations to you both. Yes. Okay. All right. The next person I wanted to highlight is right here. Stockton Walbeck. This this post is actually kind of old but I just found it like in the funnels post. So this was for May 6. But he shared I loved this because he shared he shared his results from launching a funnel. But he highlights here that he was selling. So they were selling a 97 of course but he decided to sell a $27 offer upfront. But he says the real secret behind the $27 offer wasn't the $27 product at all. Only 40% of their revenue came from the $27 purchases. The other 60% came entirely from upsells downsells and order bumps and he kind of breaks down what their what their numbers were there. But I mean like how many of us are launching funnels and we're forgetting like oh we should put an upsell in here. Oh we should put an order bump in here. And a downsell I think downsells get forgotten a lot. Just like how you can increase your revenue that you're you're already sending people through there. Just stick some more offers in front of them. They're already buying chances are some of them are going to buy your other stuff too. Yeah. It's so cool and it's be able to see the breakdown. A lot of people give us that kind of behind the scenes breakdown and like give us all the staff. You got really broken down. Check out his post. And then we got a lot of you that were commenting and sharing some stuff in the comments too so definitely go check out this post if you missed it like I did. Stockton Waubeck and congratulations Stockton on that success and realizing that information is good for future launches too. Absolutely. No we're all you know it's funny I was sitting so I had just gotten into college and I was sitting with a whole bunch of people and I recognized some people that were in college with me they were the people I looked up to when I was a freshman they were the cool soccer team like back in the day and I saw them and like I saw these and I saw people that I was like oh my gosh like I feel weird being here. But then I had conversations with them and learned and realized we're all on that same path. Life is just a path. And so long as you're on the path and moving forward with the same group of people you're in that community with the people the same people and they will want to help and support you every single step of the way it's not all they got a two comic club all they've made this much it's we're all on that journey together you're on your way maybe you are 10x this and you get to celebrate that win each time we celebrate these wins. And we're all on the path to support our future growth so guys thank you so much congratulations. And thanks for sharing yeah thanks for coming back and sharing in the wind to. Yes yes thank you. All right, I figured we would do something special today so we would do a 2.0 moment I want to share with you guys, click funnels 2.0, there's some really cool stuff happening so let's do a 2.0 moment shall we and today's 2.0 moment. Let's go get everybody on this is cool so in the past like if you guys are following we have somebody who goes live almost every single week dropping what is brand new in 2.0 his name is Tim and I wanted to highlight Tim today because Tim and you rock I love your videos are always fun they're always creative and he goes over everything that's happened in 2.0 if you guys are like I don't know what's going on check this out this is good. What is up funnel hacker so last week we had some really cool updates and click funnels 2.0 that I really really think are going to take your business to the next level. So first we made it very very easy to actually preview a website theme and in case you didn't know there are actually several website themes that you could actually download and use for your website each team has a collection of pages that you may need for your website such as you know funnel hub pages home pages blog pages customer center pages and a ton of other ones at first you could actually click on a theme and get a preview of the home page so you could decide if that's the theme you wanted to go with however now if you click on it actually gives you a preview of every single page just in the theme so it makes your selection much easier now this next update the developer team has been working on it like crazy what is it now you could actually have a funnel on a root domain you're asking what the heck is that Tim alright let me back up a little bit most websites will display a home page when you click on their root domain in other words let's say you click on I don't know marketing with Susan dot com for example will you expect it to take you to a home page but you funnel hackers of course are a little more sophisticated am I right and normal conventions just don't stand in your way and many funnel hackers want to have their root domain point to their funnel instead and now you can just configure your root domain first then in your funnel settings go to the funnel path URL simply leave a forward slash in there click save and you are all set and finally there's been a really cool update to broadcast email previously you want to send a broadcast email you could choose between 30 minute windows so for example if I want to send an email I could send one at the top of the hour and then another one 30 minutes later however now we're starting to add 15 minute windows so if I want to send one 15 minutes after that I could do so as well now of course don't go crazy with this nobody likes to be emailed every 15 minutes it's very annoying however as funnel hackers we do want to have that ability just in case you want to send like a reminder maybe your your cards closing soon or your webinar starting soon or anything like that any kind of custom approach you want to take now you can do it well that's it for me everyone if you're enjoying these updates or maybe you have a really cool feature you want to request let us know in the comments or also go to clickfunnels.com slash post let us know there and I'll see you next week Tim you rock we absolutely love you man we appreciate you so with if though it was helpful guys let us know in the comments and we will go ahead and like bring Tim on more and be able to highlight some of his videos but if you ever want to check them out just go to the click funnels Facebook page and he posts all the time and they're along with us and all the updates that you guys need Tim does it there and I believe you might be able to actually find it inside there's like a folder in in the Facebook click funnels group as well so go check him out Tim is absolutely awesome and there's so much gold there so Tim thank you we absolutely love you really quick before we go into FOMO let's talk about one thing really let's let's do trivia one last time trivia one last time really quick so that way you guys all have the option to be able to win answer this question if you want to clickfunnels hoodie

we've got over 4000 people they're coming they're going to walk in and they're going to see incredible branding everywhere it's a 60 foot wide about 16 feet tall LED wall that first 15 minutes sets the tone for everything I think a funnel hacking live every year like in my head it's a rock concert it's what we get excited for it's our showcase to the world how are you a software company that has this rabid following I always tell my staff the very first day it's like look this is going to be a long week for us we're going to be sore and tired we lose our voices events are hard for long days you know you're lucky if you're only working 16 hours so the question is how much of an impact do you want to have on your audience in the end our goal is to bring people to a live event to learn and to be able to take information and take it back into their life or their business and the next year they come back they're sitting in a different spot because they've won an award or they're telling their story of that past year here's the deal go to funnel or go to fhlstory.com if you guys want to see the full documentary it leaves in 11 hours it is an hour and a half long it is just so good
