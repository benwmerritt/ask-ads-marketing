What was it like when you finally realized that ClickFunnels was going to work well for your business? It's more than just the soft. Yes, the software's amazing, but I love the community. I think the tool was an excuse for why we gather, right? And that's my number one reason why I'm sticking around. ClickFunnels provided everything that I needed. I need worse. ClickFunnels is the backbone of my business and it has been the number one thing to help my business scaling grow. I really felt called to go to ClickFunnels and that probably sounds crazy, but I'm a woman of faith. So I said, you know what? I'm just going to make this switch. It literally has changed my life. I've been able to quadruple my corporate salary just from learning this stuff, implementing it and getting access to the people in the community. I can reach all over the world 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And I've already started making money and I'm excited to see what I can do on a platform. Using ClickFunnels obviously paid for itself. Our refund rate went from 20% to like 4%. With ClickFunnels, you can grow that impact like exponentially. And we've done about 13 million dollars at ClickFunnels. And I went all in with my online business and since then I haven't looked back.
