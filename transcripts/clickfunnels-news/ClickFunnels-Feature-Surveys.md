If you've been using ClickFunnels to create surveys, you're gonna love what we've been working on. We've been super charging the Survey Workflow app with some incredible new features that make it easier than ever to collect data, engage your audience, and automate your workflows. These updates are gonna take your surveys to the next level, and I'm super excited to walk you through all of these new updates that we've added recently. Let's jump in. All right, survey updates. First, let's talk about the ability to add new question types to surveys. New question types include email, phone number, and contact information. So when a user fills out these fields, their answers will be automatically mapped to their contacts and ClickFunnels. The email and phone number question type captures the info independently, and then the contact information allows you to capture both with additional detail. Additionally, we've added the ability to clone a question, allowing you to duplicate a question with one click, and this is useful for copying, formatting, or just keeping consistent styling. Next up, we have the contact filter rules update. This is really powerful because it allows you to trigger different scenarios based on the answers given. In my example here, we have a question about workout experience, and depending on the answer, I may want some different scenarios to occur. This can be really useful for things like targeting specific demographics, filtering based on behavior data, creating custom segmentation or testing new campaigns, really just so much to do, and a very powerful update. I'm really excited about this one. Diving deeper here, I can even add scoring, and we can segment the user into different scenarios based on their final score, so really cool updates added in here. Another powerful feature added is the survey actions, and with survey actions, you can do things like setting internal notes to a contact, you can set up a specific action to notify a team member after a user finishes a specific step, you can even trigger an entire workflow, so so many actions you can set up here, be sure to jump into a survey and check out actions in more detail. Next up is the survey image choices update, and this allows you to add image question types. You'll be able to do things like poll users for their favorite color or style of a product, or just add images to make surveys more engaging versus standard text-only forms. And then last up here is the export survey submissions to CSV update, and this update is exactly how it sounds. We have the ability to export our surveys as a CSV file, but we can also see that there's a history of exports with the ability to download any of those as well. All right, that wraps up all of the new features for the Survey Workflow app in ClickFunnels, and these updates are designed to make your surveys more powerful, efficient, and engaging than ever before. So if you haven't explored these features yet, dive in and start experimenting.
