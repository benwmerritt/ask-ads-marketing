## Transcript
So over the holidays, our developer team has been mainly focused on updating some of the newest major features we released last year. For example, to make our community feature even better, now you could actually go in and like a comment or a post or do actually both of them at the same time. We actually have 17 of these smaller updates that we released just last week. And 17 updates per week is actually quite normal around here, by the way. Alright, so for the next one, we added very clear alerts that there's ever any type of CVV errors. So like this, there's absolutely no confusion for any of your customers if they enter their credit card information incorrectly. And finally, navigation on mobile devices such as your phone is easier than ever. We absolutely understand that having your pages optimized for mobile devices is absolutely crucial, because we want to have all your customers having a great experience when they're browsing through your pages with absolutely no errors. That's all for this week, Funnel Hackers. If you want to see all these other updates, go to ClickFunnels.com slash Pulse, and we'll see you next week.
