What's up funnel hackers 10 pits and bar here with the click funnels community outreach team and just a couple of months ago we had recently released our community feature inside of click funnels 2.0 and it's been really cool to see people beginning to use it. Now personally one of my favorite things about community is that since it's technically your own community, everyone within it feels a lot more safer and a lot more comfortable perhaps sharing their ideas. And sometimes when you share an idea, you know a lot of people will confirm hey this is amazing, launch it and sometimes you may think man my idea is amazing and then when you share it you get some honest feedback that maybe didn't make a lot of sense. You tweak it and just improve your product overall. 60% of the time it works every time. That doesn't make sense. However what I really wanted to highlight is an improvement that we recently made to the feature itself. When community was first released in order to add someone as a moderator, you would actually have to go in and add them as a team member in your account settings which a lot of us weren't a fan of so we went ahead and improved it and just made it way easier. Now you can simply go to any contact you have and simply make them a moderator right there. And boy do I wish we had the ability to add a moderator doing Thanksgiving dinner because Uncle Peter and his politics could sure use some moderation. Maybe I'm Uncle Peter. Our next update is an improvement to share funnels. For anyone who may not know, ClickFunnels 2.0 gives you the ability to actually share your funnel with someone else and they could go ahead and upload it and add it into their own account. Well now we made it to where if you have any type of calendar events hooked to your funnel, when you go ahead and share it, it actually goes along with it. So if you're using a countdown timer for example with your funnel, when you share it with somebody else it will still work perfectly in their account as well. Okay and lastly if you ever needed the ability to actually pause a broadcast as it's going out, we added the ability to do exactly that. So let's say you send out a broadcast to announce to your list your new amazing launch of your new product and then you get to shiver down your spine because you realize you forgot to include a link to it. Or perhaps you did something wrong with a merge tag and now you're going to reach out to your list and say to absolutely everybody, hello first name. Well no worries now you could actually pause the broadcast, fix anything that needs to be fixed and resume sending it whenever you're ready. Alright that's all for this week if you have any cool ideas, any suggestions, as a quick reminder you could let us know by going at clickfunnels.com slash post and submitting it there. Take care funnel hackers.
