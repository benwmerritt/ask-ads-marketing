What is up, funnel hackers? Tim Pitsenbarger here with the ClickFunnels Community Outreach Team. And man, what a year it's been. Dude, stop it already, man. Seriously, weren't you supposed to leave like yesterday? It's over, done. Well, you're being annoying, man. I'm so sorry. I'll be right back. I'm so sorry about that. But anyway, yeah, it's been an amazing year both at ClickFunnels and even in my life personally because we just received the newest member to our family, our new little girl, Amy. And now that makes me a father of two girls, which is pretty wild. But we're very happy about it. So this week, our developers went ahead and focused on making improvements to a lot of the features that were released at Funnel Hacking Live back in September. So I'm sure you've already heard that we added the ability to add communities to your membership areas. And now we made it very easy for you to receive notifications anytime someone likes or comments on a post that you've engaged with. So now when you're logged in as an admin or even as a regular member and someone likes or comments or replies to maybe one of your posts, you're going to see a little bell on the upper right corner with a little red dot to let you know you have new notifications. Next I would like to share with you an update that we did to the collaborator settings. Once you add some... Dude, I'm pretty sure you're in the shot. Even if you're acting all still like no one saw you literally crawl up, walk there and sit down. One second. Sorry about that. I don't think he should be popping up anytime soon. Anyway once you add a member, you can actually go to your workspace, go to settings, then go to collaborator and get this. Once you're in there, you could actually assign different permissions and different roles to each collaborator. You see so basically you get to pick and choose what each collaborator gets to see in the app. Meaning let's say if you hire someone as a funnel builder, well they're only going to see the things they need to build a funnel. Or let's say you added a VA to help out with support, well they're going to only have access to the things they need in order to do that. However, if you want to give them multiple roles, you could do that as well. You could even make them an admin if you choose to so they could have access to a lot of the other permissions. Next up, we went ahead and improved the process of how we import contacts into ClickFunnels 2.0. As you may know, a lot of people have been hearing about all the updates and tools inside of ClickFunnels 2.0 and they've been making the decision of moving from another platform over to ClickFunnels 2.0 and the first thing they always do is, well, export their contacts from the previous platform into a CSV file and then import them over to ClickFunnels 2.0. Well, sometimes if you have just the slightest little itty-bitty error in your CSV file, it produces an error which could be really frustrating. However, now we made it to where if you have previously successfully uploaded a file before, the system is going to recognize the fields and still successfully upload it without any hassle. Alright, for one last quick update, this is going to make you artsy people very very happy. Basically previously when you used to upload an image into an image element, ClickFunnels would automatically compress that image in order to allow pages to load faster. However, sometimes that would sacrifice the quality of an image and whom the world wants a blurry image. I know I don't. So anyway, we went ahead and fixed that to where that's no longer an issue so you could upload as high quality images as you want and they would not be compromised. Nice. Hey everyone, we truly hope you're having an amazing holiday season. We want to personally thank you for absolutely everything. If it wasn't for you amazing funnel hackers, ClickFunnels just wouldn't be what it is today. It wouldn't even exist. It wouldn't have a reason to exist. So we truly truly truly appreciate you and we just want to let you know that we hope you had a very merry Christmas and we truly wish you a very very happy new year. Take care. Dude, leave. Well dude, you can't just be budding in here all the time like this. I know you're excited because you get to go on a 11 month vacation starting I guess tonight. I thought you were leaving this morning and I wouldn't have to see you again. Not saying anything but you could be kind of annoying. Really, my job and you're making fun of my job, dude. You appear once a year to leave chocolate kisses on the floor. So poor kids, thank you. It's nasty. It's not even funny. Dude, in all honesty, I prefer Jack Skeleton. He's cool. He's a cool Christmas character. Dude, I'm honestly wearing this jacket just to get on your nerves. A matter of fact, Santa Claus personally called me and told me to put on this jacket and let you know that he was referring to you. That's the only reason I'm wearing it. I don't wear white. I'm always in black, you know, like Jack Skeleton. Oh, dude. Dude, stop. It's cool. You lasted a whole month making people, you know, move you around all the time. Even though you're capable of doing it yourself clearly. Whatever.
