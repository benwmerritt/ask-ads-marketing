## Transcript
We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hello everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. So excited to have you guys here. My name is Ben Moot. Susan Lennerson is out today. If you guys are on her profile, you know her. Say hello to her. We absolutely love and appreciate every time she's able to be on. She's out for the day. We hope to have her back as soon as possible. So reach out, say hello to her and let her know that you missed her in the comments. If you guys are watching live, give a hashtag live. You're watching as a replay, hashtag replay, all that stuff. Just let us know that you're here. That's the entire goal. Give the reactions. Let us know. Funnel Hacker TV, the entire goal is just to have nerds talk about all the cool things that are happening inside of ClickFunnels. Russell can't be here for all the things. We're going to talk about where he is in a minute because he is off doing the spectacular. And we're going to talk about that. But he's not able to do all this all the time. He's like leading the business. And there are so many things that have changed ever since Funnel Hacker TV began. So my suggestion for you, number one, if you don't know what Funnel Hacker TV is, go to funnelhacker.tv. We have all the old episodes there. We have all the new episodes listed there. You'll be able to do all that. So check it all out. Funnel Hacker TV also, if you want to get notifications before we go live, I believe I got a notification. I did. I got a notification right here from Russell Brunson. Boom. Letting us know that we're going live. If you want a notification from Russell right before we go live for these, go ahead and text FHTV to 208-231-3797. It's all the details down here. All right. Go ahead and text that number to 208 or those digits to 208-231-3797. And you guys can get notifications when we're ready to go live. Okay. So because we don't have Susan here, I need somebody to play off with. So eventually I'm going to let you know who our special guest is. We bring on a special guest as often as we possibly can. Today's special guest, you've seen this person around the community. You've seen them doing stuff. Let me know who you think it is in the comments. Who do you think is hopping on today? We're going to be bringing him on. So super excited to be able to do that. But before we introduce him, okay, let's talk about what we're going to talk about today. So first off, I want to talk about wrestling with Russell. What in the world is going on? Russell just like left Boise, which he never does. He's gone out of Boise and he is in Vegas wrestling. He needed to lose 15 pounds. He's wrestling in multiple tournaments. I didn't know it was multiple. Like there's one and then another one starts today. I didn't realize that. So we're going to follow his journey just a little bit. The next step that I want to do is I want to talk about what happens when you go traveling and you accidentally forget to bring like the nice clothes and all you do is you bring your click funnel swag. Like right now I'm wearing the stranger funnels. It's like stranger things, but it's a stranger funnel shirt. What happens when all you do is you bring your swag and you have to be you. What do you do? Okay. So really cool from the community. Absolutely going to love this. Next, we're going to talk about what you do. Like what is the work that you need to do that's absolutely worthwhile to help you grow and help you be able to find that. We're going to highlight a couple of people from the community who are doing just that. And then what's up with all the emails? If you guys gotten all these emails from Russell, like they are just day losing. What is this all about? I want to be able to talk about that really quick because there's some things behind the scenes kind of water cooler talk that you may not know about that Russell is having me do and the team do. And I want to talk to you about that and kind of give you an idea of what in the world that is cause it's just cool. Then a couple of other things really quick. We're going to use do a user spotlight to talk about that. And then what do you do when you feel like there's backlash? A lot of us put our faces out there in our businesses. We are following what Russell talks about with attractive character. When you get out there and you feel like there's backlash, that may not really be backlash, but if you feel like there's backlash, how, what is the appropriate way to react to that? I want to tell you a story about that. And then we're going to talk about community. We're going to talk about this group and everything that's happening inside this group and things that are changing, which is cool. So not an announcement per se, but an announcement, but not an announcement. T. So let's call it a T. So there's some things that are coming. Let us know in the comments what things are you interested in? What do you want to hear about during Final Hacker TV? This is your time to tell us. You feed us the information. We will do all of this for you. That's the entire goal. So without further ado, I would like to introduce you to today's guests. Today we have with us, who do you think it is? Let's go ahead and bring them up. One, two, three. And drum roll. Danny Walsh. Hey buddy, how you doing? Doing good. How you doing Danny? It's a pleasure to be here Ben. I'm so amazed to be inside the community and people thinking, what's Danny doing here? What's Danny here? Well, everyone's been trying to figure out like, wait, is Danny an admin now? Like what's going on with Danny? There's a lot going on with Danny guys. Danny's been helping us out a lot of things in the background and we haven't said a thing. And we're not going to, right? Maybe a little bit, right? Maybe a little bit. Cool. All right. So really quick, I met Danny Walsh at Funnel Hacking Live. Was it 2016? No, 2017 was. 2017, back in Dallas. Ah, that's what it was. Yes. And we got the comics. Yes. We got the comics. Ah, so yeah, we were so crazy. Funnel Hacking Live, there's a lot going on and then you all leave and you're walking past. We're like, I know this person. I know this person and I literally just walked past Danny and I believe it was your girlfriend at the time. And, uh, or I don't have no idea. I walked past and I'm like, I have no idea. And I was like, and I was like, Danny and you were like, yeah, I'm like, hi Ben. I think over the last few weeks and months or we've certainly rekindled that relationship and got things moving because there's so much exciting, cool stuff going on inside of ClickFunnels. So much cool stuff. I can't wait to get into this. Hey, everyone's saying, oh my gosh, it's Danny. This is cool. Hey. Good stuff. I was just going crazy. Yes. I think quick, um, everyone kind of knows my back to her. If you guys been watching Funnel Hacker TV, you know when I come into the community, things that I've done, Danny, let us know. Like you disappeared from the ClickFunnels community for a while. Like where did you go? What have you been doing? Yeah. So around 2016, 2017, 18 was all around the world and it was full of life and then working with people all over the place. And I know we're going to talk a little bit, um, as, as we move. But I decided that, you know, I needed to build a business for myself rather than helping folks to build their business. And the thing about helping folks to build their business is some people will do it and some people might not. And I really wanted to do that myself. So I love fishing and we built a fishing business and we use ClickFunnels and a big bunch of stuff and we've done that for quite a while. And a couple of years ago, it's like, man, I really miss the ClickFunnels community and I really want to sort of come back and kind of miss working with people. And I've sort of started to make those steps to return, return to us, right? Is this like return to us? Yeah. Yeah. So I've made the steps to sort of come back, but throughout all of that time and look, we've made a bunch of money and we've had a great time and we've had a great life. But there's always been that, I really miss the ClickFunnels community and I really want to get back in and you know, what are these guys doing? What are these guys doing? Of course, we've always used ClickFunnels. We wouldn't have made any money if it wasn't for ClickFunnels. Beware of cheap imitations, right? Because ClickFunnels, the teachings, you know, I've never, never left, but I've just not been as active in the community. And you can put your head down and you did. And it was an e-commerce business, right? Is that what you're focused on? Yeah, we did a big bunch of e-commerce stuff, but we've actually built a community using the teachings. So this stuff works. Folks might have seen the spotlight interview that I did and it's on YouTube right now with Laura and you know, I've used and practiced and sort of got into this stuff. Perfect webinar, free plus shipping, fishbowl funnels, which are amazing. Just lived and breathed this stuff for even longer. So I've never been away from the practices, but I've actually done it for myself and I've learned a lot along the way. It's kind of like I've been back to college, I've been back to school, to funnel school, right? I've come back equipped with not only that, the sort of theory, but the hands on what happens if you press this kind of thing as well. So it's been, as they say, being emotional. I mean, it's been a cool thing to be the guy on campus who's the cool kid on campus because you know everything that's going on on campus. But then to have left actually done the thing and come back. It's like, I know the real world, like this is actually true, this is it. And to be able to come back, like you want to have this return to the community where the community is this powerful place where we're sharing our wins, where we're celebrating each other. It doesn't matter what level you're at, we're on the exact same journey, whether you've got your two comical decks, two comical decks, this is a community where we're all talking and we're all able to be able to have a conversation on the same level. That's a beautiful thing and I miss it. I think communities, I've always been involved in community stuff, always done stuff online, finding click-for-moles was again, changing for me, for my business, to be able to be back and even more involved in this stuff than I ever thought possible is amazing. So there's some cool stuff coming, right? Right. OK, so just as a note, guys, every time we bring on a special guest for Funnel Hacker TV, we're not doing an interview style. We're not going through and kind of discussing all the things. What we're doing is I want you to imagine CNN. I want you to imagine ESPN or maybe not CNN or maybe not Fox or whatever. But ESPN or SNL, where you have your special guest and they come in, they're topping out all the talking about all the topics with us. So Danny's here. I want to talk about Danny with all the topic and things that are going on. So first off, have you been watching what Russell's been doing? Oh, man, I think some people would have given up. Right. Some people would have given up. But definitely, definitely the man, he's been doing some interesting things, shall we say. Crazy stuff. So let me pull it and pull this up really quick, guys. Russell has been in Las Vegas and he is wrestling right now. He's in a wrestling tournament. And I don't know if you've been following along with the Journey V. Can we pull that up really quick? He has been on the journey and he's been cutting weight. He was cutting weight down to 15 pounds. If you guys missed all the reels, he talked about how he did it. How did he cut all 15 pounds? He was like not sleeping at night. He was doing stuff that I would never recommend to anybody to lose weight. It's not like a full weight loss that you keep forever. He actually at the end of like one of the recent ones that he's done today talked about how much weight he's actually gained back, which is really, really funny. But it's it's a weight cutting thing that you do for wrestling. So he talks to you through the whole journey. And he did lose 15 pounds like to the dot. Like he got the exact number that he needed in order to weigh in in order to do exactly what he wants. So celebration there. I can announce that because it's not on other reels anymore. Why does Facebook and Instagram not keep reels longer? Hmm. So he went through crazy amounts in order to do it. Like sauna is in the middle of the night with showers and all this stuff. But after he made that happen, he then took it to the next level. He went and he wrestled and he placed fourth in his division. And apparently now there's another tournament starting. So if you're not falling along with Russell, like, Danny, you and I both know like the business is the business. And we like are full in on the business. But every once in a while, there's that thing on the side that gives you that passion to keep the business moving forward. It's it's that other piece of success. Right. Absolutely. Absolutely. And, you know, especially on social media, right? We talk about how social is your media. Yeah. And we're all guilty as business owners, trying to push the business. I know I've done stories and a big bunch of crazy stuff. And one of my sort of highest rated posts over the last few days has been a picture of like this, this burger that I put up on there. And that's absolutely nothing to do with my business. Apart from I use AI to make it. But being social in your media is very important. And showing the other side of your life is one of those things that gets people interested, right? And to see Russell sharing behind the scenes, what he's up to, it's so inspiring. And there's a big message that you've got to take from that. Oh, there is. So Carlos, absolutely. Watching his weight loss was crazy. Like this was not easy. Like every time he went to weigh in, he was above weight. He's like, I'm going to make weight. And the lengths that he went to is like, well, the body is like exhausted. Like it won't give anymore. And so I have to push beyond. I don't know if he slept at all. And it's funny because as you hear somebody said to me the other day, he's like, watch as he's cutting for weight, his his cheekbones are going to get really, really tight and his voice is actually going to get higher. And like his eyes are going to start looking funny. Like just watch because the transformation is crazy. The amount that you have to go through, this is not for dabblers. And I think being able to do this is just a recharge to be like, look, I do this in business, but when you do it in life and it's like real hitting the ground, it just keeps the fire going. Well, like we said, people would have quit and you if you've got the goal and that is the goal, this is what we have to achieve. Yeah. And people say, well, what what will you put into that? It's like whatever it takes. Yeah. And clearly, and it's been successful with that. It is spectacular. It is spectacular. So guys, go into your him on as he's going into the second part. If you're not already following along the journey, just wanted to highlight Russell really quick because it's cool stuff. It's really cool stuff. There's so much going on like next week, there's events and all this stuff. So I'm actually flying back out. We're going to be doing events and stuff and I'll be able to share with you what's going on behind the scenes because there's cool stuff. But for now, enjoy. All right. So step number two, what would have happened if Russell had to wrestle inside of his click funnel swag? Can't want you to imagine that you travel all the way across the country. You're doing all this stuff and you didn't bring the right shirt like you. You just performed this guy. This is she may she may Bruno Morris was supposed to go dancing. And he looked at his all the stuff that he brought in order for travels. He forgot his Latin stuff. So he went and Latin dance. And what is this? That's click funnel swag, my friends. That's click funnel swag. Look at that right there. We're going to pause it. I build funnels. It's amazing. That is really cool. It's so crazy. And the funny part is so he did a post on in the group. I don't know if you guys have seen it. If you have, love it up. It's absolutely awesome. She knew you were wonderful. We should definitely tag him in the comments and be like, thank you. You're spectacular. The crazy thing is not only does he have great moves and did a wonderful job, but he also got three high ticket clients because he was wearing the swag. It's crazy. A lot of us like I've been in the talking to the funnel builder certification program about how do you get customers and things like that? Like there have been conversations and like, what are the all the strategies sometimes just representing? So go and check out the post because it is it's super, super good. I love, I love the swag. The swag is part of the culture. You need the swag, right? And if you got to fun like in live, you just need to scoop as much of this stuff as you can while you see it in person. The stalls are amazing where they have all of these different things, the caps. And yeah. So clearly it's, it's worked, doesn't it? It has worked funnel hiking lives like a swag drop, right? You just walk home and you're like, just bring extra room in your, in all of your like, in your backpack and in your, and your carry on because you're going to be bringing home more than you brought every time. Every time. Cool. Yeah. So you may not know you're buying swag during the event. The swag just comes and then there's also swag that you can buy and she's, oh my gosh. Just the community explodes in this spectacular. So you're going to want it. They'll give it to you for free, but you can also get some paid stuff. It's yeah. You need to grab, grab the swag. You will want it. So you need the swag. Get the swag. You need the swag. Need the swag. And you never know when you're going to use it. All right. One other thing that I want to call out from the community. This, my friends, this is Kevin Jones Jr. Now, a lot of us talk about the journey like a lot of us are on the journey in order to do this thing. He's like, from one year from now, I want to master funnel building. And this is what I'm going to use. How many of you have these books? How many of you like this is the doctor and this is the way this is the process? How many of you like, yeah, Danny's point at his bookshelf. I'll point at my bookshelf and the other bookshelf. And like, this is how you do it. This is the process. You get the books and you follow them to a T. So I just wanted to, you guys already like massively reacted to it. That's why we saw it. And so thank you. But also like this is the process to follow. So Kevin Jones Jr. Yes. How would you recommend going through those books, Danny? I think, and I know we've had a little chat about this over the over the last few weeks, there are differences, obviously, in the books and dot com secrets clearly was the first to arrive on the scene. And we know the story how it's gone through. Expert secrets is almost like the doing part. Dot com secrets is like the theory. Clearly the traffic and there are all the other smaller books, the cookbook, with 30 days book and a big bunch of other stuff that's come out from that. But for me, it's very, very important that people just start. And we always sort of see in the community, people asking, do I start with this book? Do I start with that book? Starting the order that they came out, read them from cover to cover, read them again from cover to cover, write notes in these things. What I found is if you go and grab a copy on Amazon or you use the screen reader, you can actually highlight stuff on the screen reader as well, which you can take that mobile, which is kind of cool. But I would say that you need to kind of read them in the order that they appeared on the scene. That's a word for me. If you buy them all at one time, I can't remember if he had them up or not. If Kevin had bought them all at once, but they comes with this when you buy them all together. This is so helpful just as a playbook. Like the people who were the most successful with Russell and Russell still sales sales to this day are the best implementers were Kevin and Brandon Poole. And they learned something, they paused, they did. They learned something, they paused, they did. The dot com secrets book, and inside of the case that holds it, the dot com secrets is the framework. You've already said this, the expert secrets is the fire, the traffic secrets is the fuel, and you can follow the entire playbook and get it done. But once you learn the frameworks of funnels to build out your business, expert secrets is the way. Expert secrets is the way to be able to get your message out there. There's actually this little thing that I've got sort of stuck inside of expert secrets right here. And this thing, I mean, you see that that is the perfect webinar. Right. Yep. And if you, if you talk to Russell, he's kind of like, do what Russell says. And do what Russell does because this thing is the way that things are promoted and sold. Well, it's funny. Yeah. I've used this to sell a lot of stuff. Oh, it's ridiculous. And even in e-commerce, like it works every single time. And I don't know if you, if you ever go to funnel hacking live, the event is set up this way. It's just, it's brilliant. Actually, he's adjusting a lot of the things this year, but it's going to follow the format one way or another. So I'm like really excited to see, he keeps teasing me. He's the king of open loops. So like, I figured out funnel hacking. I'm like, what's happening? He's like, I'll tell you later. I'm like, but if you could only read one thing in expert secrets, understand this. That is, that is the way to sell. A lot of us just don't, don't focus on selling enough. So yeah, amen. Amen. So Kevin, congratulations. Way to keep going. Way to go. That this is the way we love it. So really quick. Um, a lot of you guys are getting some massive emails and I wanted to talk about what they are really quick. The emails actually sent to this video here. Let me go ahead and pull that up really quick. This is a video from Russell where he talks about why funnels fail and what they do in order to make sure that those funnels don't fail. Okay. And so we talked about the full process. And one of the things that he talks about is this secret little thing that I want to talk to you about in a minute, because it's actually a tool that we're using in the office. So if you haven't seen the video yet, go back to the emails, click on it. Because Russell specifically talking about a certain software called Giru. And Giru is a software that allows you to be able to map out your funnels step by step, so you can see it, but even more powerful, it lets you simulate everything. So I'm able to go in there. The other day, like I was in there last week and he's running out of the office on Friday to go hang out with his family. I think he was going to go see Super Mario with his daughter or something like that. And he's running out. He's like, oh, Ben, I just had an idea. Go simulate this on Giru. I'm like, okay, fine. So I went and I simulated it and we're voxing back and forth. The idea is this is such an amazing tool and we use it in office. This isn't something that we're just like, oh, yeah, this might be a good idea. We're just going to go back and forth and kick it out the door. There's a reason why. Russell actually talks about why he wanted the software at the beginning, where he wanted to present it to everybody and why it's so ridiculously valuable and why we even bought it in the first place. So if you guys haven't seen it, go to the emails because the emails will have links to everything and you'll be 100% taken care of. Go check out the emails and the emails will tell you exactly what's going on with Giru and all that stuff. You're using Giru, right? And I think for people who don't understand exactly what it is, go and check the email. But this allows you to simulate what might happen if you spend so much on traffic, so much per click, how that will simulate through your funnel and based on different conversion rates, what the outcome might be. So you can literally say, hey, if this thing converts at 5% or 10% and I spend this much per click, what will the end result be? In terms of money and in terms of leads. To do that in the past, you've kind of like a bit of paper or spreadsheets or you're doing it in Google or whatever you're trying to do. That isn't giving you that visual representation of what it is that you're trying to do. So you can put a sales page, an upsell page, a downsell page and you're like, what happened if I just tweaked this thing? Oh, yeah. And so like, what if we adjusted the upsell? I was just having a conversation with some other marketers, like I've asked a whole bunch of people all the time. And one of them was like, what if we change the upsell? So right now it's charging this. What if we charge this number instead? Because then all of our costs make sense. And you know what? I'm going to change it right now and simulate this stuff. It helps. It lets you know a bottom line. This actually kills. This is what's the differentiator and helps you understand the idea of a funnel audible. Where do you need to change and how do you know which you need to change? Absolutely. And one little thing we figured out is if you go to a downsell, but what happens if you put a return to upsell button on the downsell? So you know where people kind of like press yes and no. So they press no to the up to the upsell and then they go to the downsell and you style the video in a way that makes them think, hang on. I just want to go and get that big thing that is just off it. And you actually have a return to. What? You have an infinite loop funnel? It's not. You know, I said, don't go back, don't go back to a band relationship. But if you want somebody to go back to your upsell and make more money, then by all means, but that little tweak on a few funnels has worked really well. And looking at the data and kind of understanding what your funnel might pan out like helps you to kind of visualize and make those decisions. Amen. Go get it. Yeah, go get it. Yeah, go check out the email. If nothing, it's a really cool video by Russell, where he talks about why we how what the process was to buy it, why you buy it, why if you're looking for a business to buy what you should be looking for. So it's it's just it's cool. Check it out. Numbers are important. Now, really quick, we brought Danny on for a user spotlight previously, but we've done another user spotlight and I want to be able to highlight it. So let's go ahead and pull up the that really quick. These are if you guys are on the ClickFunnels YouTube channel. See, there's Danny right there. I see the beard. I see the beautiful beard. Yes. This is a user spotlight that we have done just recently with Trina Felber. And so you guys are able to watch the entire thing. Let's go ahead really quick. She's going to talk about what funnels work and all those things like what's working for her business, all the steps. It's really, really cool, really clean. I absolutely love it. So this is just part of her funnel that I went and found because I'm a funnel hacker. I wanted to go and see it. But really quick, let's watch just a clip from this because it's really cool to be able to see where everybody's going. What kind of funnel would you say? Yeah, go ahead. Let's go ahead and watch it. What kind of funnel would you say is the most effective for your business? Are you using it mostly to generate leads, to just sell your physical products? Are you using multiple funnels? We sell it's primarily to sell our products to get in front of audiences that normally wouldn't be looking for us, particularly. And it's a way we use all of our affiliate traffic, all of our affiliate traffic goes through the funnel because the problem with our website and I'm sure many companies feel this way. Like you want to send people to your website because you want to see want them to see how amazing you are, how many products you have. But the minute you send them there, they get lost and they start adding things to their car because I do this when I'm shopping. I know, like I'm on a new website and I start adding. I'm like, I want this, I want this, I want this. All of a sudden I get 10 things in my cart and I'm like, I can't. I can't even decide right now. So I put it away and I sometimes go back to it and I sometimes don't. And it gets too confusing. So we use our funnels for all of our affiliate traffic. We have probably four to five funnels that we regularly send our affiliate traffic through and it prevents that confusion. So it's narrowed down, it's focused. They can't get lost in a in a website. They go through the funnel and they decide whether they are in and want to buy that product or they're not. And then, of course, there's the retargeting and all that other stuff that you can do. But that's the main reason. If we send to our website, they're they're overwhelmed. So what kind of that? That's just a clip of Trina talking about Primalife organics and how they're using funnels inside of their successful e-commerce business. This whole user spotlight thing was part of your idea. Was it not Danny? It came a little bit before my time. OK, all right. I wonder. It was definitely something that I've been watching with intrigue over the last few few weeks and then to actually be invited on this thing and have the time with Laura, amazing. And like we said earlier, spotlighting. And, you know, we've got folks dancing in the swag. We've got people who were just starting out on the journey, reading the books. You've got people who are going crazy, making millions of dollars and winning awards wherever you are on that journey. I think it's important to have that celebrated, right? And that spotlight is not just about the folks who are crushing it right now. I think it's about the folks who are making the most of click funnels and using it in the business wherever they are. And the stories are so important. It's the inspire people. Right. And that's what it's about for me. It's amazing. Well, we all we all hit a wall at some point. And it's it's how do we get over that wall? Right. And a lot of the times what gets over that wall is the community. It's every supporting rising up, holding each other accountable and just saying, you know what, this is where I'm struggling with and everybody gathers around. This is that place and building it to be to remind people that this is the place where we can do that is there's so much fun stuff coming down the pipeline. I'm so excited. If you guys but make this a home, make it part of your home because we're trying to make this into something. Trastically different and super empowering to everybody on every level. It's important. One of the stories I want to share really quick before, Danny, I kind of want to talk about something that we may or may not be playing with here in the future before we do that. Yeah. I was building a webinar with Russell and I thought like we were going to hit a wall. So Russell was creating a webinar for the funnel builder certification program, which is a ridiculously cool certification webinar program. Everything the webinar itself is glorious. Like it is so good. So if you haven't watched it yet, you should look it up. But if you go over there and watch, at one point they throw up this meme and he used it because it was fun. And then I started doing research and I'm like, he might be making fun of you. Like this person might be making fun of you, Russell. And he was like, if they're making fun of me, then now they're making me money. And it was just that easy little twist. I mean, of all these things, like I understand this isn't something really big. But for me, I'm like, we can't use this. What if it's negative? What if? And he's like, no, no, no. It'll make us money. It's fine. It's not an issue as public domain. We're fine. But this is how I'm going to spin it. This is how I'm going to use it. A lot of the times we perceive that something has hit us negatively. We get that negative impact of what? What do I do with my face is so out there? I'm so prominent. I don't know. And we get that one person who comments and you perceive it as negative, whether or not it is. And you go, oh, and it just kills the wings and hit a wall. Danny, you know that. It's kind of like what they describe as taking the wind out of your sail. So you're busy sailing along on your on your nice blue wash of the winds in your sail. Right. And then look, the internet is full of people who will go out of their way to take the wind out of your sail and they will say things to benefit them. And whether that gives them some feeling inside that, you know, whether they're happy with that or it means that they make more money or whatever it is. It's like somebody said, hey, you need to shave that beard off before you could ever make any money. And I'm like, you need to shave off that mindset. Like that's important. And what you find and again, linking back to the community is the people who lift you up. They're not on that level. And I guess that's why Russell with his mindset would have just said, we're going to roll with this. But that is a skill. And, you know, I've had the wind taken out of my sail. And I think everybody makes mistakes. You can hold up your hand if you make mistakes and people always try and move forward. But there's nothing worse if you if you brand new to something and you open up your email or you open up your inbox and somebody has gone out of their way to put that wall in front of you. That's, you know, there are people out there. And I guess the thing to do is to come back to the community, share that with friends, people who are close to you and overcome that barrier sooner rather than later. Oh, and it's funny because some of these times like there's not even it's not real. Like they're not actually saying something negative. So if we can pull that up one more time, this particular thing is from Rachel K. Albers. And it's her hook. It's her hook that brings people in and she teaches what funnels are afterwards. It's a positive thing, but you all depends on how you perceive it. So it's really, really cool. Like just pay attention to how you react to things. Every once in a while, your reactions are overreacting and you don't need to. And you can underreact and be absolutely fine. So with that stated, what are some of the things that we're playing with? Oh, there's some crazy stuff coming out. And you may or may not have noticed that, like you said at the beginning, that I've been a little bit more active in the community. And over the last few months, we've been working on something exciting behind the scenes, and it's been a pleasure to be involved in this. And some amazing people who have met and actually been given the admin rights to the Facebook group as well, which has allowed me to dig real deep into some of the things that go on inside this community. And I think without giving away too much, I know we're possibly going to give away more than we should do on this show, without giving away too much, there is some really exciting stuff coming for the community, because as a team, we are seeing and hearing what ClickFunnels users at large are asking for what they need. And you'll notice that the header we've got, you know, we're going to have the pulse, we've got Funnel Hacker TV, we've got the spotlight. There's things that are happening to communicate more effectively with the community at large, to give people like we've been doing, just now shining a light on amazing stories, talking about the things that are going on behind the scenes. But it'd be cool if we could do a little bit more and trying to give the community the tools and I guess the voice that it kind of we've missed it right then. We've missed. Oh, no. It'd be so cool if there were some type of like program where they could do something where, you know, like we really have. Oh, are we supposed to drop that? Well, look at that. Ah, put it down. The clue was in the name, right? You'll have to you'll have to go back on replay and if you missed that. Well, you might have to. Yeah, if you missed it, that's it. That's what it is. The clues in the name and there are things happening at all levels within ClickFunnels and like I said, it's an honour to be involved in this stuff and to be able to get involved behind the scenes and see what's going on and dig into some of the data. But when I said it was kind of like return to us for me coming back to us, we all remember that movie. Maybe we do. And when Dorothy's returned to us, it wasn't how she left it. It's a Disney nightmare. And the movie ended up in a very nice place. Yes, it was a beautiful ending. We talk we talk about heroes and journeys all the time. But I think in this community, we've got some some heroes. And I think we need to do more than just shine the little lamp on people. I think some people deserve a little bit more than that. And if you want to if you want to jump into the craziness, return to Oz, she returns to Oz only to find out that our four favourite character, three favourite characters, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Lion are gone. They've been removed. And so it's her journey to try to bring them back and to sweep out everything from this other witch that's shown up. And so it's it's a really crazy story. It's not something like if you're doing nothing, you should be like reading the books and implementing. Take some take some time out with the kids or whatever it is. And put this thing on. But to see some of the things that have was so embarrassing in this community, no longer here and to see maybe one or two big bad witches lurking around in the shadows and actually digging around in in, you know, analytics and data and seeing how people are posting some amazing stuff. And it's it's not getting the the limelight that it deserves. Things are being buried in there that really need to be lifted up. Community is huge now. It's huge. It's huge. How many people do we even have in this? Two hundred and eighty plus thousand. There's more people in the community than there are in most towns. Right. It's crazy. No, oh my gosh. Yes, that's very true. You're going to be some digging around and typing how many people in your town in terms of everywhere I grew up. And I'm like, oh my gosh, population was 60,000 population. Oh, trouble. Yeah, there's a lot of a lot of folks. I think, you know, I've got experience of building large communities. You will always get desirable stuff and undesirable stuff. Well, surely this is ClickFunnels. This is the place where we want the ClickFunnels stuff. And we only really want the desirable stuff, right? And I don't want to say too much, but there's there's things happening that's going to make a lot of people smile. There's some cool stuff. If you guys have any suggestions or thoughts, we're watching all these like a hawk. If you want to move Funnel Hacker TV in a certain direction, if you want to move the community in a certain direction, comment, please, please comment, be a part of the community. More than likely, if you didn't get the notification, type FHTV, text that over to 208-231-3797. That way you can be involved and you can be here every single time. We'll get Susan back and we'll keep doing guest spotlights. And if you haven't, if you want to watch the replays from all these, go to funnelhacker.tv. And we'll also I'm going to be writing up the email recap right after this of what everything has happened this week. So if you've missed something, definitely go over there, put in your email and we can go ahead and capture that and you can get the email that recaps everything that happened this week with links and summaries and all the goodness. So what I became the cool, what I became the cool is. What does community actually mean? What does the ClickFunnels community actually mean to the guys who are watching, whether you comment or you go and spin off a little post and we'll try and get that approved in the group. But what does this community actually mean to ClickFunnels users? Because I know what it means to me and I'm clear from being here with you and spending time with the team. I know what it means to the team and what it means to certain people. But what does it mean to funnel hackers at large? That would be some great insight. That'd be really cool because I think we all come at this. We all look at a little bit different. We all get different value from it. And so guys, if you guys are here, thank you for being here. You are all spectacular. We're going to let you go. This has been, I think, our longest funnel hack or TV we've done yet. So every 2-0 rate, 2-3-1-3-7-9-7. Guys, thank you for being here. And if you are not following the process, do it and have a wonderful time. We'll all share in the journey. See you all. Bye everybody. Bye. My name is Russell Brunston and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started and we don't even have gold to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. But because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
