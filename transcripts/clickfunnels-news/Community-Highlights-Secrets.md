Some crazy cool stuff happening at ClickFunnels HQ. We want to highlight some of you and maybe give away some swag if you guys are OK with that. When you guys join us, give us hashtag, laugh hashtag replay. See you in a second. Let's roll the intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey, hey, everybody. Welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. I'm Susan Lennardsen. This is Ben Moot. Yeah, and we are back. We are going to be talking about so many fun things today. But first, OK, and also like Ben Teased it already. We're doing it. We might be doing a giveaway. You'll have to put your thinking caps on, though, to get a chance to win the giveaway. So but before we jump into everything, make sure that you're signed up for the text messages. So you know exactly when we're going live. You just have to text FHTV to the number below 2082313797. And you can catch all of the past episodes of Funnel Hacker TV at funnelhacker.tv. There's also some really cool things on there. Russell videos. So go check out that site as well. And OK, Ben, you have like something you wanted to share first before we dive into it. OK, so a lot of us like I wanted to share like a lot of us are in this world where we love ClickFunnels. We love Russell. We love everything that's being put out. And I just want to have these moments where we're just able to touch base and you guys know like we feel the same thing that you guys feel. And so I was going through all of the marketing secrets podcasts. I don't know if you guys know on if you guys download the marketing secrets podcast. There are over 600 episodes now. And I just about lost it going, oh my gosh, I started scrolling through them all because I wanted to see stats. And I want to just I want to nerd out for a little bit. And as I started to go through them, I realized all the times that I had plugged in in order to get that little bit of fire. Like every once in a while, we kind of lose the fire. Every once in a while, we're like, oh my gosh, I have my idea. I want to change the world. And we just kind of get exhausted on the path. And I remembered all the times that I let Russell reignite my fire and help like push me forward by plugging into the podcast. And so I just wanted to I just saw all these things. And I just had like this flashback moment of all the things that have brought me here and are fueling me to go to the next space. And I wanted to be able to bring that up to you guys. Just to remind you, we're doing everything in our part of you to give you that fire. But that fire is something that we treasure. It's something that we hold very, very close. And we want to take care of. So my friends, fuel the fire. I hope you're feeling that. I hope you're living in it, immersing yourself in it. This is something that you get involved in and you stay involved in because it just keeps building on itself. And as you build the fire, you build your momentum and you build your message. And it just starts to take off. So my friends, keep the fire going. It was just, it's just a cool moment for me. So just wanted to say hi. And we see you keep living on the fire. And if you want to listen to the 602nd episode, it's dropping on Friday. Awesome. Awesome. I love that. Thanks for sharing that, Ben. That's it's so true of like even with stuff that I've been going through lately, it's almost easy to come easy as it could be, right? To come back and just like plug back in and still have that energy and motivation to keep going. And it has a lot to do with what you just said. It's really, really cool. OK, well, if you guys are watching, I know that you guys are because I was just pulling it up on my phone, say hello, drop a hashtag live, drop a hashtag replay if you want to do that when you're watching later. And let us know and stick around. We have actually right now, right now, we have a trivia question for you guys and a chance to win some ClickFunnels swag. And hope you like it. You need to comment in order to do it. Now I'm a little worried because the video is not working. So OK, hold on. We're going to go ahead and try it one more time. Let's try it one more time. Yeah. And if not, I can share my screen. Why are your videos failing? OK, it's OK. Let's go to the Challenge Secrets Master Class that you want to talk about next, Ben. And we'll come back to trivia. So if you guys want the chance to be able to do this, go ahead and comment down below. We'll go ahead and do that. Let's go ahead and talk about Challenge Secrets Master Class really quick. And the videos are going to have a hard time pulling up. So we're just going to ignore videos for the time being a luscious talk. For those of you who know, all last week was Challenge Secrets Master Class Madness. It was ridiculously cool. Had a wonderful time being able to spend time with Pedro and with Russell, and then be able to see all the behind the scenes and be able to share that with you guys. But what we've done is everything is, I don't know if replays are up right now, but I will tell you that there was an offer made at the very end of the Challenge Secrets Master Class, and I don't want you to miss it. Being one of the funnel nerds, knowing that I have access to everything that Russell's ever done, I went and I bought that. I'm like, I need to jump in on this. And so my suggestion is go and don't miss the offer. This offer is gold. It is spectacular. I highly recommend that you get a screen share working. Highly recommend going in and checking out the offer because I believe the offer is gone tonight. And Pedro's talked about multiple times how this offer is something that is going to expire. It's something that they're going to be increasing in price. And it's not just the false scarcity. He's like, this is like a $6,000 offer that we've provided. And it's extremely valuable. So guys, if you have missed it, go to challengesecretsmasterclass.com. Follow the replays. If they're there, it'll take you over to the offer. You can see the offer. You can see what's in it. The bonus list is massive of all the things that they just kept adding. Russell's like, oh, I'm going to throw this in. And Pedro's like, well, I'm going to throw this in. And Russell's like, well, I'm going to throw in every time that Pedro like did a consultation with our members on their challenges in the 2CCX program. And I'm going to throw in. And it was madness. So my friends, get in. It's gold. It's spectacular. Go and check it out. And do not miss it. It expires tonight. And it's one of those FOMO moments where I just I couldn't handle it so I went and I jumped in. It is awesome. And I'm going to be diving into it too. It's amazing. OK, so forgive the technical difficulties today, but I do have the trivia question. Apparently, ads to stream, ads are right to stream. All right, this is the question. Here, and you guys get a chance to win this awesome click funnel swag T-shirt. But the question is, Russell Brunson popularized the concept of the value ladder in which of his books? Is it a.com secrets, B. Expert secrets, C. Traffic secrets, or D. Funnel Hackers Cookbook? So you guys can put your answers in the comments below. And we will reveal the answer at the end. And we will choose somebody who wins a T-shirt, which is awesome. The only way you can win is by answering down below. So make sure you answer because we want to give away stuff. It's something that just gets stuff away. We're like, OK, so we're throwing it at you guys. We want you guys to be able to have access. So put in your answer. All right. All right, what's coming up next? Oh, we've got community highlights. So I might have to do this via screen share too if our videos are not working. Let's give it a shot, though. The first person. Oh, my goodness. All the videos. Not working. OK, that's OK. I haven't pulled up. Let's see. And maybe I'll just click on the video here on my screen and share it that way. Let's do this. The first one I wanted to talk about is Jordan Lee. Let's see. Sorry. Give me one second. We're going to share right here. Jordan Lee. OK. Jordan Lee recently posted. It was just a May 2nd. He posted in the ClickFunnels, this group, the official group, and he won his Two Comma Club Award. He earned it. And that's so awesome. We wanted to celebrate him. He dropped this post in there giving a little bit of his background. And he started from nothing, guys. He started. He's like, I had zero experience. And now I've got my Two Comma Club Award. And he just wanted to give a shout out to Russell Brunson and the ClickFunnels team for his first inspiring and sparking the motivation in me that day. So go read his post. Super short. Go give him some love on his post and congratulate him. But we wanted to congratulate Jordan as well right here. All right. Our second one. This is a little bit different than what we've done before. Let me get it pulled up. OK. This one is someone who's actually asking a question in the community, Matt Goldberg. So he actually, and a lot of you probably saw this, look at this post, Rach, 13 and 1 1⁄2,000 of you saw this. So he asked, how do you stop attracting broke people? My audience is so broke, the ducks throw bread at them. And a lot of people thought that was hilarious. But I wanted to highlight this because there's a lot of different responses in the comments. And you might think one thing, somebody else might think another thing. But I wanted to highlight this is an opportunity to help educate not only people that are asking questions in the group, but there's so many people that are going to go through and they're going to be experiencing the same thing or having the same mindset. And it's such a great opportunity that if you've had experience in this thing and you were able to overcome it and you have something valuable to give, some advice to give, one awesome opportunity to teach thousands of people. So I have pulled a couple of comments from the comment thread of this post. And I know it's probably a little bit tricky to see. But one of them was like, are you selling to the pain of your ideal customer that they have now? And so there was an example of two different ways that you could throw a hook out there. Make your first dollar online or how to take your company public, like are two completely different hooks. So your hooks matter. Russell's always talking about hook story and offer. If you're not attracting the right people, it's probably your hook. A couple others that I pulled out here, we have the amazing. Let's see if it gets a little bit faster here. Yeah, there we go. Dan Henry, he's all about the mindset of stop believing your audience is broke. That's one way to fix it, right? Another person said, wrong question. Ask a better question. What do I need to do to attract my ideal paying customer? And then I really, really loved this example here, where it's kind of this three-step process of how this person, Ro Hubbard, was able to accomplish exactly what Matt's trying to accomplish, right? So this was awesome to see the support and love. There's like 154 comments on this thing. And so if you were also experiencing that problem, maybe go check out those comments. And we just wanted to highlight this is like what the community is for. If you haven't had a problem experiencing an issue, ask it. And you're going to have people that want to jump in and support you. And that's the crazy thing. You don't have to just share value by posting. A lot of us want to post. And you're like, well, I don't have anything I really want to celebrate. I don't have any really unique ideas. That's fine. Everyone else is asking questions. One of the best ways to give value is to give value. Don't ask for the DM. Just give value. When we do that, we're going to make this place much, much, much safer, more comfortable, and much more powerful place where we keep that fire burning so that we can get stuff done right. Even if you're having issues logging into ClickFunnels, all you have to do is do forget password or go through the process, reach out to support. It's going to be all right. We're here to help. That's the process. Awesome. Can I highlight something that's really, really cool, by the way? So ClickFunnels 2.0, we have tons of integrations. And they're constantly being added. Like we're adding new integrations all of the time. They're always being dropped. But somebody integrated with us. And I wanted to highlight them really quick, guys. This is HiRose. Does anybody know who HiRose is? HiRose is a company that tracks. They do extremely good ad tracking. They track all the way through your entire funnel, through info products, if you're doing application processes. It does a lot. It helps feed the AI. So that way, Facebook ads, Google ads, they all perform better. So they reached out and they asked, hey, can we have access to API? API is not available yet. They said, fine. We're going to make this work with what is available. And so they went in and made sure that you could integrate your web hooks into ClickFunnels 2.0 in order to get moving. So this is up and live. If you are HiRose users, if you guys like to be able to have all the crazy amount of visibility, that is now available just for you. So we wanted to be able to highlight that, be able to say, thank you to them. We really appreciate them taking the time to be able to work with us. And at the same time, be able to work with us as we are making 2.0 that much better to be able to start working and bridging those gaps. So so excited to have HiRose connecting with us. If you guys are using it, connect it. Like if this is not a sign that ClickFunnels 2.0 is like, where you should be building, build. There is so much good stuff happening in ClickFunnels 2.0. It's so cool. And there's more happening. Like we're putting together pulses right now. I have a list of eight different topics that I would love to talk about on a pulse. So pulses are coming. Things are coming. It's going to be cool. It's so exciting. There's stuff happening every day, every week. It's really exciting. All right, you have another thing, right, Ben? Yes. So it's almost more like a water cooler moment than it is what's coming. And so I just kind of wanted to share this with you guys. When I started to work in the office at ClickFunnels, and I got invited to do so. Remember, we asked the trivia question. You need to keep answering that down below. We need to be here in order for us to be able to give it to you. So when I got there, one of the coolest things that was there is the ability to be able to just hear Russell kind of go off on idea, kind of walk and be like, what if we did this? Or people sitting around or Miles coming out and talking about the next event or all these different things. It's so cool. Every time I love going to the office, just to be able to be that insider, that fly on the wall that we all wish we could be, right? And so this last time when I was in the office, we're all sitting down. And Russell starts to talk about Funnel Hacking Live and his plans for Funnel Hacking Live 2023. And it just, I started to freak out. And I started to want to recommend to people who could be speakers like, oh my gosh, could this person be a speaker? Could this? And it was a blast. And guys, if you have not checked out Funnel Hacking Live, go and watch the new trailer. Things are dropping. It's going to be so ridiculously cool. And so just FYI, you are now an insider. There are things that are going to be dropping for Funnel Hacking Live. You're going to want to pay attention to it. Watch your emails, watch the social posts. Funnel Hacking Live 2023 is happening. It's going to be, if you guys went mastermind in paradise, you got a small tease. It's going to be so good. I'm going to shut up now. I'm not about to say anything. They're going to come to me with this model. I'd already be too much, Ben. You'll be done. But it's going to be good. All right. So my friends, keep an eye open. There are some really cool stuff coming. So awesome. And also, stay tuned into Funnel Hacker TV, because we're going to be highlighting that stuff as it comes out as well, which is going to be so fun to go through.

We're going to show the trivia question one more time. I think that's up to me again. Yep. I'm sure you are just picking out a little bit. Hold on. Hopefully we're going to hang in there a few more minutes. OK, here's the trivia question. One more time. This is your last chance. Get your answers into the comments to have a chance to win this awesome ClickFunnels swag t-shirt. Russell Branson popularized the concept of the value ladder in which of his books, ABC or D, drop it in the comments. Well, I get the answer ready. That is how much time you have to get your answer in. And then, Ben, you want to say, oh, oh, he's there. Is it in dot com secrets? Is it in X for secrets? I just had them all handy. So I figured while you're pulling it out. I just go nerd-like. Is it in traffic secrets? Or is it in the Funnel Hacker cookbook? Guys, this is a shirt that I have not grabbed yet. And I am a swag-aholic. So do you want the shirt answered down below? And let's go ahead and do it. You ready? All right. We are ready. See the sea coming. Let me get the right thing shared. Got it. Our videos. OK, here we go. Ready? Drum roll. Hopefully I got the right answer. All right. So those of you who have answered correctly in the comments, we will, should we do it right now? Should we do it last time? Yeah, we can do it right now. Pick a number and we'll. One, two, three. I've got three people that I see answered. Four. Asma, I got five Meg. All right. So I've got between. All right. We got some that are slowly popping up. I see it. So we have six people that answered. Pick a number between one and six, Susan. OK, and I haven't looked at any of the comments, any of the answers. I don't know who's who or what's what. So I'm going to go with number four. Number four. All right, that is. And we're going to do this every single time. Ben, count slow. All right. We have one, two, three. You said four. Number four. Who is it? Number four is Meg Davidson. Meg Davidson. Congratulations. Congratulations. Meg, we're reaching out and getting sizes and locations and all that stuff. You just got the shirt that I don't have yet. Who's that in the comments? Oh, Dan Havy, he says, if I win, I'll donate my shirt to Ben. Oh. Awesome. And your chicken. Oh, my friends, for those of you who are affiliates for the Challenge Secrets Masterclass, you can still promote to the end of the day. And I know that some of you who are commenting are in the runnings for top of the affiliates. So just FYI, a good push is not a bad idea. So there's some really cool stuff. A lot of, a lot of all, like not all, a lot of the magic happens, a lot of the sales happen in the like the last 24 hours. So there's still time, still time. Absolutely. And if you guys are not affiliates and you want to be, go to the ClickFunnels affiliate group, the ClickFunnels Avengers affiliates, and you can get all the details on everything you need to do so that way next time there's promotion, something crazy going on, you're in the loop and you can join the affiliates. But it's an amazing program. I already bought it. I've already been going through it. So it's spectacular. Don't do it. Awesome. Great. Congratulations. I think we're good to go. Yeah. Thanks for joining us, guys. One more time to get text messages when we are going live. Next, we're live on Thursday, this same time. And 208-231-3797, just text FHTV. And then you'll be able to catch the full replay of this right after we're done recording, but also funnelhacker.tv for all the other ones too. So we will see you guys Thursday. See you then. My name is Russell Brunson. And I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started. And we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnelhacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way. I use the funnelhacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
