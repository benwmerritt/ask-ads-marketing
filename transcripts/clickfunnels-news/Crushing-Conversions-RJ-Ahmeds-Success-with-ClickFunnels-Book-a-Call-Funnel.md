I'm Laura with ClickFunnels. And today I'm joined by RJ Ahmed. RJ runs a Done for You podcasting agency and is also the host of a podcast show called Interviews with Entrepreneurs. Thanks so much for joining me today, RJ. Hey, Laura. Super excited to be here. I'm excited to learn about you. So can you tell me a little bit about your business and how you got started in this space? Yeah. So I actually started like back in around 2018. I got to know about dropshipping in the first place because I thought about that is a great business to be in because I didn't got myself admission in the university. So I had nothing to do apart from that. So I found like that was an amazing business just to go in. But during the time back in 2018, I was hearing a lot about funnels. All the marketers were talking about funnels, funnels this and that. And I was thinking about is funnel is like filling up water tank, oil tank, like what that actually is. And there's a code by Steve Jobs, right? You cannot connect the dots moving forward. You can always connect it moving backward. So coincidentally, during that time, I saw a post on Instagram, which was like, this guy have made $3 million in 90 minutes, Russell Brunson, co-founder of ClickFunnels. I remember I was telling my mother, like, this guy have made $3 million in 90 minutes on stage. Like, isn't it amazing and all of that? But fast forward when I got to know about ClickFunnels, et cetera, I just, you know, took the leap of faith and started to work on more about like funnels, how that is, how it can be profitable for me. And even though I was starting out in the beginning, it was challenging for me personally. But I felt like it can do wonders for me if I can do it right. So that actually gave me the motivation or that inspiration just to get in. And even the drop shipping didn't quite work out well for me just because of a lot of different factors and variables. But the kickstart for me was definitely, you know, one funnel away challenge of paying the back in the background. That actually gave me my first sale as an affiliate of 100 bucks, which led me to have that belief that it is possible and broken the four minute mile for me. So that's kind of like a brief backstory, like how everything started for me. Very cool. And how quickly did you learn that like the drop shipping thing was going to be a little bit more challenging? And then when you started learning about funnels that, you know, like this framework, everything that Russell's teaching works, like, did you completely shift everything right away? Yeah. So technically it took me six months to get my first sale from October to March. I was figuring out drop shipping stuff like that, but I was still trying other things. So I was trying to do like multiple things, but I started to think about like drop shipping is not going to work for me because it requires more budget. And I was living in Pakistan. So Stripe and PayPal wasn't here. I actually sold equity of my company to some of my friends just to gain more funds so that I can form company in US as an LLC and then get Stripe and PayPal, etc. So it just got me the realization that it's going to require more investment, stuff like that. And it requires more testing, more patients. It's not like turn on the ad and, you know, money start pouring in. So I started to have these reality checks. So then I was like, I feel like affiliate marketing in the beginning is going to be the best model for me. It's more friendly, easy to promote, especially if you know what you're endorsing. It just works. So that's how I just then shifted my whole focus to affiliate marketing in general. Okay. So then you went to affiliate marketing and used the one funnel away challenge. What brought you to where you are now with podcasting? Yeah. I mean, the biggest concept from one funnel away in the first place, what I learned was the concept of dream 100, right? Even though like, you know, early on like jet homes actually kind of like introduce the process, but I learned it from Russell in the first place, especially when they were talking about in the one funnel away challenge. So I thought about that. Isn't it so fascinating that you get to talk with these people that you admire, you follow, but just having something like that as an interview show, et cetera. So it was so fascinating for me. And I was so attracted to that that I was like, you know, I have to figure out a way so that I can like do something like that. And there were so many roadblocks. I'm from Pakistan. English is not my first language. I didn't have proper lighting, my camera, et cetera. And nothing, but what I've analyzed a word I've learned from Russell is you have to lead by example. If I cannot do that myself, it's not possible for me to teach it to my students later on. So I had to demonstrate that myself first. That actually gave me that sort of motivation of like, okay, if I really want to connect with these people using the process of dream 100, et cetera, I have to do it, I have to take the leap of faith. So that's how I actually launched my own podcast just because of that learning that I took from the dream 100 concept first talking about in the one for a way challenge, which was a game, ginger stuff for me. Interesting. Very cool that you, you know, decided to really go for it considering, you know, the hurdles that you had to overcome being in Pakistan and English as a second language and playing around with affiliate marketing too, is as a way to really get your feet wet with funnels. I think it's like one of the best that you can do and a great way to learn. So can you tell me a little bit about like what in terms of playing with funnels, what has been the most successful or have you seen the most conversions with? Like what sort of funnels? Yeah, I would say two funnels that worked quite well for me, apart from the affiliate one, because affiliate is obviously like, it's definitely selling other people's product and it's great just because you're incentivizing people with the bonuses and showcase them what your offer is. But two of the most amazing funnels that I've used personally was one, definitely book a call funnel because like people can book a call and then after that they can see my showcase of either results case studies or authority before jumping on a call. So I just don't need to explain my personal authority to them or what I have to offer. It just helps a lot and removes a lot of friction. Second was definitely a course funnel or a membership one because ClickFunnels really had a great, you know, it was removing barriers for people to create their own memberships, etc. With ClickFunnels, I was like, hey, you know, I was having a plan of put up a course. Well, let's go with ClickFunnels itself. So the most profitable for me personally was definitely a book a call funnel, which was amazing. And then selling my digital course using the membership funnel inside of ClickFunnels because then you can customize it accordingly how you want. Yeah. You know, it's really interesting. A lot of the people that I've spoken with, I would say of the people who have established businesses and probably 80 to 90% of them have the same answer, which is kind of surprising because you'd think most people would say anything like a regular like lead magnet or something, but it's the established businesses that don't really have a lead problem. They want to grow their businesses. And the best way to do that is a simple book a call funnel. Like they have the leads. Now they're just trying to book the call and it's establishing like a even better one on one relationship with them. Whereas 15 or 30 minute call with that person, they're closing them like crazy. Exactly. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Very cool. So what are your goals with your business? Or, you know, if you plan to expand or do something different, what are your goals in the next several years? Yeah, definitely. My personal goal is to be more of a connector. So my goal, what I've learned is never burn your bridges. Always stay connected with the people out there that can either help you out or push yourself to grow stuff like that. My future goal is definitely to be a connector in some shape or format. Definitely right now podcast is the way to connect with the people with having conversations with people, et cetera. That actually got me again, what we were talking about early on was got me the opportunity to talk with Russell on the podcast on a hundredth episode. Right. It won't be possible at all if I didn't have the podcast just to get that through. Right. It's not that easy. So my goal personally is in the next couple of years just to stay on a networking level so that I can think about, I can connect with these people out there. I can build good relationship, maintain that and move forward with that in business perspective as well. So that would be the whole goal. Very cool. And congratulations on the success of your podcast. That sounds really exciting. Can you tell me why you chose of, you know, all of the platforms out there, why ClickFunnels was right for you? I mean, it's so easy. Yeah, the best way to describe it, even in the early on when, when I joined ClickFunnels, my whole ClickFunnels stuff, like when I started to use, it was probably like January 2019 when I started to have my own ClickFunnels account, et cetera. When I started to use that, I was like, the editor is so easy to use in the first place and it wasn't intimidating at all. Right. Because that time it was like ClickFunnels classic as well, which is amazing. So the editor was so easy to use. The whole dashboard was so, you know, the UI was amazing. So it was pleasing to the eye and also easy to use interface. That was definitely one of the amazing reason why I chose ClickFunnels because I was trying other things, but I was like, so hard, you know, not good in designs, et cetera. So that's definitely the main reason why I chose. And then obviously after Russell's own learning that actually kept me there because I'm like, if I can learn from Russell, like implement into my funnels, like that's the most important reason why I should stick with it. So yeah, that's definitely the reason. I feel like that's a common thread as well. People come to ClickFunnels for the ease of use because as a solopreneur, like you don't want to be bogged down with all the tech. You don't have to worry about design and all of these extra things. Like you can play with an editor, you can change your fonts, your headlines, your all of your elements are easy to use. But what keeps them here is that constant education and training and the community support that they get. And, you know, being able to learn from Russell when he'll just post a webinar or jump in the community or show a tutorial, like that's the stuff that gets people to stay. They use ClickFunnels, they built their funnels, they have them in there, but that training and education just continues on and it's so sustainable. Absolutely. 100%. Awesome. So what piece of advice would you give to a fellow entrepreneur that is maybe just thinking about getting started in online business? Yeah, I think the biggest advice I would like to give them is don't compare themselves with other people. I've recently heard about it that comparison is a thief of joy. Because when you get into the space, yeah, for sure, there are so many helping people that are willing to give the helping hands. But the thing is, as soon as you get in, you start to compare with the people who are level 20, et cetera. You're like, oh, you know, that's on next level. I don't think so. Like I'm even able to like go there. And you're not even like thinking about your next step, essentially. So it's like stop comparing yourself. I heard it from Steve Larsen like once, like it's you versus you or you were versus yesterday, right? So I think that would be my biggest advice. So that's the most important one. That's great. I love that. Really, really applicable to any entrepreneur in the space, especially online, you know, when people are fighting for attention on social media. It's one of those things where, you know, you can seek inspiration from others, but you don't have to compare. Correct. Absolutely. Love that. Well, thanks so much, RJ.
