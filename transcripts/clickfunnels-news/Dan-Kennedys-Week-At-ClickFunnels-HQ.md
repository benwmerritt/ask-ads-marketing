## Transcript
We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey guys, how's it going? Welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. My name is Ben Moot. We have... Susan Lennon-Ernsen. Yes, we are back. We are... the dynamic duo has returned. Yes. We get to be able to talk about everything that's going on in the office. We actually stole... We're actually in a new place. Never guess where we are. Can you guess? No. We're in Russell's office right now. And it's kind of freaky. They were like, you can do it at Russell's desk. I'm like, no. No, we can't. It's holy place. We're on like a little table and we're not disturbing anything in the room. Nothing. We'll be able to get out and nobody will know we're here. So it's really cool. So we went really behind the scenes with you. There's a lot of stuff going on. If you guys watched Funnel Hacker TV last time, you'll know there are massive amounts of events happening here at HQ. And right now, Dan Kennedy has been talking for almost three days straight. This is his last day. So we want to talk to you. Can I give you an inside view? Because you have to pay $25,000 to be in that room. So would you like the inside view? Let us know if you guys are here. Give us the hashtag live, hashtag replay. And if you want to get all the announcements and everything, make sure that you text, you'll get all the information down below. Text FHTV. Oh yeah, we're here. There. There. Text FHTV to 208-231-3797. You'll get text reminders right before we go live. And with that, how's it been? So this is my, well, we're in day two for me. Yes. It's day three for Dan. My first experience of Dan Kennedy, though, was at FHL that first year that he came. I totally thought he was Dan. When he came back from the dead. And that was awesome. It is fun being back here and actually in Clickbuttals headquarters and Dan is back and it's more intimate. There's only what, like 20 people in that room. Yes. So it was really awesome. And I think that, I think everyone in there is just like excited. Like it's just fun to see like the conversations that are happening between everybody and the excitement. And like, and you were, and they don't get this. Like normally it's online. It's like you were saying audio. I'm listening to Dan Kennedy. One guy in there was even like, my first introduction to Dan Kennedy was on my way to this event. I was binging all of the, all of the, all of the content. Like that was my first, and he's like here in the room. So you've got like everybody you've got, this is not just Dan Kennedy people. These are, it's almost like half Russell, half Dan. And so you've got people who come in here like, we crittered our Mifkey funnel to follow the linchpin and all this stuff. But I, and so we've got a whole bunch of people in the room. It's quite a diverse audience and they're all having a blast. They're all getting swag. So they all got a shirt. They all got, they all got a little figurine of Dan Kennedy sitting on a, on a bowl. Actually during affiliate days, somebody said, why is this like, what do you call it? Call it a bison or something like that. He goes, it's a bowl for no BS. Oh, sorry. Yeah. So affiliate day, Russell or Dan Kennedy was able to talk to everybody who'd never really been inside of the marketing space and are inside of like his space. They're just affiliate online nerds. Now he gets to talk to real businesses and it's different, but I don't think anyone's happier than Russell is. I think Russell's pretty excited that Dan Kennedy is in the office. And I don't know if you guys saw on Instagram, I think we have it here. I think it's the other one. Yeah. So on Instagram, this got posted and you can just see Russell's, your excitement that Dan Kennedy is in the office. Oh my gosh. And it's, you need to find somebody who looks at you the way that Russell looks at Dan Kennedy. It's, it's, it's been so fun to be able to watch Russell. I absolutely love having Dan out because Dan will come in in the mornings and we'll be able to like talk with him. And he came in in the first morning. We didn't pull up that other first video really quick. And then we were, uh, Dan walked into the office and we're like, hello, and nobody was there to talk to him. So I stepped up like, I'm just going to go talk to Dan Kennedy. And so I stepped up to start talking and we started talking about his horses. You guys don't know he races horses. That's where his money goes. And, uh, he buys oats. That's what all the millions do. They buy oats. Um, and so he races horses and he was talking about what he does afterwards, the rest of the work that he does with the horses afterwards and how he makes sure that they're taken care of. It was so cool to kind of have a personal touch point because if you guys are involved with magnetic marketing at all, you know, there is tons of audio of Dan Kennedy. You're able to listen to the courses, the news, letters, all the things that come out, but to be able to just have that more personal, it was really cool. That's awesome. So let's talk affiliate day. Really cool. Yeah, you were there. I was not. Yeah. Okay. So three days ago now, Dan Kennedy started his first day talking to all the online nerds, people who did not know who Dan Kennedy was. Like, uh, some of the staff were like, this is like bringing fire to a caveman teaching these people who are online, how marketing works. Like you can do direct marketing with mail and it does work dramatically. And these people's brains just popped. It was so much fun to watch. And they're like, how do we get a day with you? Like, what do we do? How much do you cost? It was just the realization. And I think a lot of people don't get that with Dan Kennedy and we have him. I don't know for how much longer, but be able to have him here and be able to get that information from him one-on-one was just stellar. Couple of insights from it because I'm unorganized and I took some notes, but a couple of the things that he talked about, that's the Renegade. He talked a lot about continuity. How do you actually build out that continuity? So it works because a lot of the, a lot of the things that we learned from Russell, Russell learned from Dan. And he watered, he didn't water it down. He made it simpler. He, he frameworked it. He's seen all the doodles, right? And so going back to the source on all of this stuff was just crazy. He talked about the things that you need to do. There's one, uh, one of the quotes that was just absolutely brilliant was, and there's a rule for their Renegade millionaire mastermind that we didn't have to follow this. So I can quote this. Uh, he said, breaking even on acquisition is putting yourself in a straight jacket. So if you're trying to put your break even on acquisition, you're killing yourself. He says that all, every direct marketing company, um, that grows ends up breaking free from all the break even requirements. They don't look at the break even numbers in the first seven days, 90 days. Uh, they, they know that their entire business is set up correctly. It's all about acquiring that customer and ner nurturing that customer, having all doors open no matter what the cost is. And that was, that was a breakthrough idea. It was. Yeah. And that's, that's such a, it like puts meaning to the, the idea of like, you got to spend money to make money, but people don't know, like they go wild with that idea. Right. So take what Dan is saying about it. That's what it means is you got to be okay with not breaking even losing a little bit of money, right? On the front end, cause you know, it's going to come back 10 fold, 100 fold on the back exactly. And that's why Russell created the whole linchpin strategy. Like every time he's created a strategy and presented it in front of us, it's because it's what's breaking even it's what's working. It's what all the momentum behind click funnels is that because other systems just aren't working. So when you follow Russell, when you follow the curve, you're on the cusp of doing what's closest to break evens that way you have that scalability. Yeah. Whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wings. That's it. Right. All right. So let's get into the renovating. Okay. So yesterday, today is renegade mastermind. This is, it's been really awesome to sit in on it. Cause I'm like, I'm like writing all the notes. Um, but it's really been cool to see, uh, I think even before then, okay. So I'm going to back up a little bit. So I got here first thing yesterday morning, seeing everything happen before the event starts. And it was just fun to see Dan interacting with people and introductions. So they did like formal introductions too. During the first, like that's the first thing that they did. Like, okay, everybody go around and tell us who you are, what you do. And so even during that exchange, Dan was like giving people quick advice, like 30 seconds, memorizing names and businesses. Yeah. And, and like he would, people that have been to multiple events. Um, he knew who they were right here. And, uh, but like he would, he would drop like, Oh, go get this book. Yeah. Oh, don't get this book, but this title is like all the information you need. And for the guy who had driven up, uh, and he'd never heard of anything Dan Kennedy until he was driving up. He's like, all right child, you need to recognize this is going to be different from the audio because, and like it's, it's so cool. Yeah. So, but there is a role. We're not allowed to tell you exactly what happens in that room. So we're going to talk about some of the basic framework stuff. And it's really powerful, all the same. Yeah. So, um, well, okay. One of the things that I noticed, just listening. Okay. So we, we brought this up a little bit where Dan tells stories. He tells stories to teach the principle that you need to know. And sometimes when he is talking about this principle, he, like he starts off talking about it and then he very quickly gets into story mode because that is what he does. And it, for me, it takes a little bit of time to know where that story is going. And sometimes you start questioning, like, did he forget what the question was? But it always comes back. He doesn't forget. He knows what he's doing. And it always comes background. It loops background and it just ends the powerful, like he teaches the principle with them, within the story. And then what Russell does is puts frameworks to those principles. So it is easier to recall. So when I'm sitting in that room listening to these stories and the answers, cause a lot of the days have been hot seats and him answering people's questions to story, I'm sitting there like, Oh, that's Russell's framework, but it's not Russell's framework. It's Russell's framework, but he, it's principle comes from Dan Kennedy. And so it's like, Oh, I've heard that before. Oh, it's this framework from Russell. Oh, I've heard that before. Oh, it's this because I'm much more familiar with Russell's frameworks than I am with Dan Kennedy's teachings, but it's really awesome to hear the stories that Russell probably also heard when he created the frameworks. These stories have been used for years. Every time we get new skin in the game, it's just fun to be able to see everyone else's minds go, Oh, fire to a caveman. But at the same time, it's, there's a way that he teaches. And so if you've listened to anything, like he does the story, you don't know where it's going to end up. And it does magically answer the question every time. And it's, it's been really cool being in the room with the hot seats because number one, he's usually the person that goes over. Like he's the reason that the time goes longer. He's like, everyone has 20 minutes, but he's like, do we have time for a quick story? That's going to be like the quote that I'm going to use forever. It's the Kennedyism, but it's, it's cool. Like he's always giving. He always wants to make sure that you get the thing that you absolutely need. And if like people come up with a question, if they're like looking for this, like, now let's ask her, let's talk about this for a second. And he'll have a really honest moment where they will go deep into what's actually working. So it's Dan Kennedy, just FYI, it's Dan Kennedy and Marty Fort. And Marty Fort is the attractive character. So when Dan Kennedy isn't able to fly out to Boise, then Marty Fort is the person whose face is out there. He's the one who's presenting, who's doing all the things and will break away to something that Dan Kennedy taught and Marty Fort does it. I didn't recognize how much Marty Fort had done in the business. Yeah. Like Marty Fort, he started listing out all the things that he has in his business. And it's not just a brick and mortar. It's not just online. It's not just coaching. It's not just licensing. It's not just patents. It's not just, it's ridiculous how he's built it all up and he's followed everything Dan Kennedy teaches to a team. And so being able to see that and then be able to hear both of their, both of their takeaways to every person was really cool. Yeah. Yeah. Should we talk about, okay, we can't talk about what the framework is, but it's in the name. It's in the name. Yeah. So Dan did, Dan and Marty both went into what is the framework for being a renegade? It is called the renegade master. Yeah. Millionaire mastermind. Millionaire, thank you. I'm like, I'm forgetting a word and it threw me off. The renegade millionaire mastermind and there is a framework to being a renegade. And that framework is eerily similar to another framework, but it is. It's a little similar, but it's awesome. Like, so if you guys ever, if you were ever like interested in joining the actual like page, Russell brings out the renegade millionaire box. It's sitting right there because we're in his office and sitting there and along with some other things that Russell's been giving away as gifts. And so it's just, it's really, really cool. Other things, the framework teachings have been really cool because he'll teach a hot seat for a little while and then he'll switch and go teach a piece of the framework. And it's almost like the get started guide. The minute that you join the mastermind, these are the things you need to know. Now the mastermind also has coaching. So you have the people who are coaching and running the business who are also here. So Dan, we'll turn it go. Darcy, what did that from? Or who is that person? And she knows like on the dot. Like people who've been in this business have been this business for a long time. And the wisdom is just, it's crazy. Yeah. It's cool to be in a home. I think for me, the last like takeaway that I can give that we can't really give is that everything that was, has been taught so far. And I was taking a lot of notes, but I went back through and was looking at like, okay, what's the common theme between these? And it didn't fit for all of the things that I could notice right away. But most of the principles that are being taught here boils down to how can you do things faster? How can you get paid faster in your business? And it was like doing things fast, like doing things within your business faster, getting your offers in front of people faster. Like how can you get money coming in faster? And that's like the heart of everything. Repeated, it's changing your audience to get it faster, changing your marketing medium to do it faster, tapping on these different things that you've never done before. We have, you don't understand, we have businesses here who are selling physical goods out of like Australia or like dog goods or like, it's not just the online folks, we have people who are extremely successful in real estate, different types of real estate, CPAs and all of them are like just, it's, it's gold. It's really, really good. It's really cool. So Russell was excited. And so at the very end, Russell gave away a really special gift and it was the first time anyone had ever seen any of this. And so he's giving everybody a gift right now. And he released a new like introduction to it. It's, at some point you'll know about it. It's so good. But it was, it was really, really cool. Russell's having a great time. Everyone's, I think everyone's mind is blown. I don't know. The people who've been Dan Kennedy, OGs, who've been around for a really long time, they know the value. Like we have people here who've been with Dan Kennedy for 20 years. Dan Kennedy brings 50 years of knowledge in this industry. Plus, like it's the ability to be able to ask a question, to be able to get answers that aren't always what you need to adjust your hook story offer. You need to do it just this. It's, it's, it's so much more in depth and powerful. And it's, I don't know if it can be replaced. It's very specific to each one of them. It's true. But he knows the industry like that. And any of the industries that come up, he, yeah, he knows it and he'll just pull this story out of his pocket and teach exactly what they need. And it's like, it's just all in his head. Yeah. So if you guys aren't following on social media, make sure you're doing it. Make sure you're following Magnetic Marketing. Make sure you're following Russell. They're dropping all the socials and all the behind the scenes stuff. So if you're missing it, don't miss it. Keep following along. If you guys aren't subscribed to the podcast or the newsletter, get inside. I've been helping like going through all of Dan Kennedy stuff for the last year. It is ridiculously valuable and it is all there for you. So with that said, don't miss the next. Or TV. So the next episode, I'm flying back to Georgia. We'll be back on Tuesday. Yeah, we'll be back in our home offices, but we'll continue our our regular water cooler moments highlighting people in the community. And if you guys want to know something, if you guys are seeing posts in the community that you want highlighted, let us know in the comments below. This is your place to be able to help create the community. We want to build out, make this place that place where you feel comfortable sharing and giving and we highlight those that are doing that. So make sure that you're doing that. We want to hear from you and then make sure to get notifications by texting FHTV to two zero eight two three one three seven nine seven information right here. OK, go and do that. And then you can all see all the recaps and get email recaps by going to funnel hacker dot TV. Anything else? I think that's it. Sweet. We'll see you guys next week. See you guys later. My name is Russell Brugson. And I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started. And we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you that what we are doing is impossible to get us happening every single day. And it's happened through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you. It's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you. So if a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way, I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
