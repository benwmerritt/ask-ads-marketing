## Transcript
Hi, my name is David Neumann and this is my 2.club story. For three years, my business partner and I are running a marketing agency in Bielefeld, Germany. Our mission is to help care companies to find suitable professionals with the help of social media. Before ClickFundance, we had problems to manage our many clients effectively at the same time. Our goal was to manage more clients at the same time so we can grow our company faster. Before ClickFundance, it was a big effort to build that many funnels. ClickFundance allows us to build many funnels at the same time, faster and more effective. This allows us to onboard all of our clients faster and easier. So the result is that our agency grows faster every day and today we are a team of 10 people and we are still hiring. You have a marketing agency and you're not sure to use ClickFundance? If you want to grow faster and make many processes easier, then I really recommend ClickFundance 100%.
