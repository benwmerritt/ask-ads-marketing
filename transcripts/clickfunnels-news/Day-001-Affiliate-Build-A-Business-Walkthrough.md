Music Alright we're back again. That countdown always gets me a little nervous and excited at the same time but we're gonna have a great time today so welcome to the Build a Business series. My name is Andy. I'm also here with Danny and we have a couple others. We're gonna introduce them in just a second but you might already know them especially because we are actually streaming live in the ClickFunnels official group and also in the ClickFunnels affiliates group because today what we're gonna talk about is we are going to talk about how to build your business and offer as an affiliate of ClickFunnels 2.0 so how can you do the most as an affiliate of ClickFunnels? That's what we're gonna do today and we have Turner and Tyler in the affiliate team. How you guys in today? Doing awesome. Yeah it's great. Awesome. We're gonna have a great time. Yes definitely. So Danny what are we gonna talk about specifically today? So we've got a bunch of stuff. This is normally five across five days but this week we're across four days right and we've got a bunch of stuff that we want to kind of get through and we've got some of our ambassadors are gonna be joining us as we move through the week and we've also got a big bunch of expertise in the room depending on which group you're in and you're watching on right now and you will probably know some of us by the end of the week you'll probably know all of us and like Andy said ClickFunnels has got an affiliate program but we're also linking this back to the previous two build a business series that have run in the main community right so if you in the ClickFunnels official group at the top in the featured section we've already done like two weeks building businesses from scratch and this is week three right so if you need to catch up on this stuff you can go and find it in the featured section of the ClickFunnels official community and we created an avatar customer called Susan and a couple of weeks ago Susan came into the office and was like hey I'm working in a photography group and I recognize that I can help people in this group to do more online so they can go out there they can sell their photography work they can sell their photographs and she wanted to start building funnels for folks so she did some webinars and she started putting out little sales pages and we did all that in week one last week she came back and she's like whoa this is really working I'm gonna think about setting up an agency so last week we got Susan rocking and she's like she's got this agency now and she's got all of these sales pages and webinars and a big bunch of stuff and now she's back in the office and she's like I realize that every time I get an agency client they have to use ClickFunnels right because I'm designing in ClickFunnels and we'll be like but Susan did you not know about the affiliate program for ClickFunnels and she's like tell me more so we've kind of arrived at this point where our Susan is doing great in business you know fast forward over a while you know over a few months maybe into a year and she's like well I'm building funnels for people I've got customers and I realize that I'm recommending software I'm recommending ClickFunnels and I think there might be something in this and we're like you didn't know so we've brought Tyler Turner and the affiliate guys on and we've also got some of our ambassadors who do very well with affiliate marketing in general to kind of give everybody a picture of what affiliate marketing kind of looks like the principles that run sort of through this and also the ClickFunnels affiliate program right because if you don't know about this thing you're possibly missing a trick and if you are already engaging with clients engaging with customers you're definitely missing something right so this week we kind of want to cover the principles understanding it the ClickFunnels program how to promote some of this stuff how to enhance your offer and look a little bit about how we can use ClickFunnels 2.0 to build out what we call a bridge page understand bonuses how do you create a bonus right how to be an ethical affiliate and then at the end of the week we'll have a question and answer so today we just want to cover the like the foundation and even if you are I guess a diehard affiliate and you're one of the guys out there crushing it I'm confident that you're still gonna learn some stuff by the end of this presentation right so if you've got any comments any questions drop them in the in the comments box and we'll do our best to answer them as we move but this is kind of where we want to focus and I really want to bring it back on the if we can to just the foundation of affiliate marketing and the principles and throw this out to the room because sometimes we need to get back to the back to the basics to understand how does this work you're not only with other things but as a standalone business because there's people out there who just that is their business right affiliate marketing is all they do and they make a big bunch of money and they have a big impact on people's lives so this that's kind of what we're doing and hopefully everyone's following that replays will be available in both groups but if we throw this out to Tyler to turn it just let's come back to the to the foundation the the sort of principles of affiliate marketing and and what do people need to know what does Susan need to know because she's here like guys talk to me well I'd like to jump in if that's okay I was in Russell Brunson's linchpin training was it last Thursday or Friday he was Friday and it was awesome all of the inner circle members really wanted to incorporate affiliate marketing into their business Russell he talked about hey what if what if Facebook goes away what if we don't want to worry about you know ad costs things like that and so everyone was like yes I want to do affiliates I want to do more affiliate marketing so if you're wondering if affiliate marketing is dead or people actually use it yes it's in crazy it's crazy right now it's incredible how how much people are making with affiliate marketing and if you're not making money with affiliate marketing with with whatever it is you need to start whether you're promoting a software your favorites protein bar that you like whatever it may be if you love it you might as well talk about it you might as well promote it right so it's huge I just invited a bunch of our affiliates into the into the video I just did it at everyone with our group so if you were an affiliate marketer with click funnels or whatever let us know in the comments give me a hashtag affiliate if you're from the affiliate group would love to see you represent but Danny could you pull up that slide one more time yeah absolutely and while I do that we're actually joined by one of our ambassadors who's also an affiliate marketer and there we go and there's your slide okay perfect yeah so let's kind of let's cover this here so affiliate marketing principles if you're not if you've never done affiliate marketing join us in the group we'll make sure that we have the group in there we got a bunch more our affiliates representing with a hashtag affiliate but affiliate marketing principles are very simple right you want to start building your list as soon as possible as an affiliate you're going to be talking often to some audience right start building that audience today okay and you want to start building that trust as soon as possible as well if you're just you know a business owner whatever you've got to start building that audience and it sounds like Danny is and Andy I've kind of talked about that already which is awesome building that audience that email audience and list as well but if you want to understand affiliate marketing just start today okay and understanding that is building your list as soon as possible and helping other people to you know sign up with that link or that that code or whatever and Tyler and I we talked to a bunch of affiliates often and we want to make sure as you're promoting that product or whatever that software you love that software okay if you're in the the ClickFunnels community you love ClickFunnels right you love our community and you talk about it often okay so that's a big part of it you want to talk about that in your emails in your videos whatever it may be and make that a part of your your framework and what you do Tyler and I we talked to a lot of affiliates and the top ones make a ClickFunnels a part of everything they do and they talked about it often right how anything to add to that no I think I think that was a great great intro and kind of a good way to get them into it and yeah something that I always really harp on people about as far as affiliate marketing principles with ClickFunnels is the number one thing you need to identify is like who's your target market what problem do they have that ClickFunnels can help them solve and how can you communicate that to them that's kind of like where to start with this right because if you're just blasting out links on your social media to random people and hey my my target market is entrepreneurs well yeah you and everybody else right you got to niche it down and identify who those people are and kind of learn to speak to them so that's just backing off of that Dan Havy is an amazing affiliate because I'm gonna just throw this at him right here he he's an amazing affiliate because he absolutely knows ClickFunnels right and he if there's something that he doesn't know he he figures it out right not a lot they doesn't know but but he figures it out so that that's amazing he he has the the ClickFunnels stuff in his background he talks about it often he's made videos things like that if I had a question about ClickFunnels I wasn't working for ClickFunnels probably asked Dan Havy right like you want to make that known to just about everyone and if there was something to come out the ClickFunnels put out I'd probably set it for Dan right because he knows this stuff and he's probably gonna help me if I ask him questions so that trust factor is very important for affiliate marketing well now I'll add to that real quickly is that is pretty much how I've gotten the affiliates that I have had I'm not a great affiliate marketer if I was I'd have a lot more affiliates underneath me however you are right about the one thing is I do a lot of videos I teach a lot about ClickFunnels I've built a number of courses around ClickFunnels and so whenever there's a big promotion I take one of those courses and I basically give it away for free so if I have a thousand dollar course I'll say okay I know you're an existing ClickFunnels person because you're interested in me you know me you've seen some of my videos you see maybe some of my training here's a here's a thousand dollar product if you sign up underneath me and also if you got a $2,000 sale on there depending on your commission split you know 30 40 percent whatever you know I get at least half of what I probably wouldn't have got anyway because they probably want to bought my program anyway so that's the way I look at it is I do that as a giveaway however there's a downfall to the way I've done it and why I'm changing it going forward is I don't have anything right now going to the masses my people are for the most part existing ClickFunnels people so that has really limited my ability to get a lot of enrollments underneath me and so I'm starting to look at okay how can I reach out to a much much bigger audience to be able to bring in a lot more people and then also be able to train them and give them really good assets. This is this is very good stuff and Andy's going to jump in in a second but Susan is in our office our client and she's like 40% ClickFunnels build a list all this stuff and she's like falling off the chair right now because we've just it just hit you with all of this crazy stuff and she's like explain this break this down. So what I'm hearing is if you are a business owner or somebody who's actively using ClickFunnels if you are using this thing there's a good chance that you could sell this thing right because you know it inside out that's what I'm getting from this and it kind of makes sense to offer people who show interest because you're going to do it anyway right he's like hey what's this thing that you're using or yours ClickFunnels you might as well get paid right and this is what affiliate marketing is all about it's about taking somebody else's product you don't have to handle the support you don't have to handle the selling you don't have to handle anything other than putting it in front of a person who you know is interested and if you have the skills and the knowledge and the enthusiasm for that product are we right in thinking that this is possibly going to be one of the easiest sales you can make in business because you're just saying look this thing's amazing I use it all the time and like Dan said if you take this from me and you sign up and use it to I will give you something of mine like a bonus is that like possibly the coolest business model in the whole world like I don't know what you guys think but that's that's kind of what Susan's hearing correct me if I'm wrong or are we on the right track well and I would add to that the best thing that I think ClickFunnels has done from an affiliate standpoint I don't know maybe others do this as well is the ability to have the share funnels so you bring somebody into your world and they see what you're doing and they're going my god I want to do what you're doing and you go oh well okay here's the share funnel and when they click on the link it opens up a new account for them and they get a 14-day trial on that and then if they continue to pay that's when you start getting commissions basically 45 days later is when you see your first mission because there's always a 30-day delay on it but it's a great way to be able to get people in and that's what I'm seeing the guys who are really crushing it in the affiliate program that's what they're doing they're giving away the share funnels in conjunction with a lot of additional training support and holding maybe even weekly calls or something like that in order to be able to entice people to come into the program yeah and amazing I'll just to cover with that too I think one of the days we will cover share funnels right so we'll hit on that big time that's such a Tyler and I always say once someone takes 2.0 and uses share funnels they're just gonna blow this thing up it's gonna be insane so we're gonna hit that hard one of the days this week it's gonna be awesome as Susan is coming in and you know creative juices are running like oh I'm gonna do all this want to make sure that she starts the basics so I put in the link in the comments for the way to sign up to be an affiliate so very going very basics if you're brand new give me a hashtag new in the comments so we can see who's kind of new being brand new is awesome it's great so let me know who's new give me hashtag new there I did put the sign up link there so you'll see click funnels.com slash affiliate dash program so go ahead and click on that if you are wanting to be just like Susan to be an affiliate as well Tyler and I will make sure that you get approved today we'll make sure that we go through all the the deals there to make sure that you are approved or the settings there sweet I'm seeing a few hashtag news love it so go ahead and jump into our affiliate program just like Susan's gonna do and then from there we want to show this actually we actually put everybody that is new into our quick start call so let's kind of walk the steps of that if that's okay Danny I can talk about it bring that up and I'll show the screen perfect and while we're bringing this up affiliate marketing is is something that you can do in lots and lots and lots of different areas so you've got click funnels now you might find things that complement it always look for an affiliate program that you can think well hey we need this thing or these fonts or whatever you might be able to get affiliate programs for things like fonts or other crazy little softwares that you can use to make videos or AI things or whatever it is and you can quite quickly start to be able to build an offer right and a business around other people's products using click funnels out the core but the thing with click funnels is you've got so much learning education you've got these guys you've got expertise of people like Dan who've been out there and doing it we've got the ambassadors in the group we've got all of this training and all these things lined up to help you be successful right because that's that's a big thing about an affiliate you can start off this thing you think oh man I'm just not getting it I'm just not understanding it we've got a big support mechanism that runs beneath this to get you going and get you started and what turn has brought up now I think Susan just fell off the chair right what's that number right I think this has actually gone up ever since this is from a few months ago so this is probably even more which is awesome so does Susan have a last name we didn't go that far I put in her stuff here Susan Susan gmail.com we're gonna call her Susan is awesome sorry I just threw that in there and then we threw in a fake phone number I'm just I'll take this out later but yeah so when someone comes in here they go ahead and apply and then we do send an email that will go to them so that that way you can confirm the email and then from here that brand new affiliate sees that we're paying out 30% commissions to everybody comes in and then we talked about the dream car program you know everyone gets people signed up and get at least a hundred people sign up with your link then we give you 500 bucks a month and then when you get 200 people signed up we give you a thousand bucks a month now if that car is new if that car is awesome we're gonna approve it right so you gotta get approved by us but then we can go ahead and start paying that thing out we do have over 35 dream car winners at right now they'll be on stage at Funnel Hacking Live we're gonna get presented the dream car trophy with Russell Brunson and Todd Dickerson which is gonna be so fun now if I could just take a second or two on this the dream car program is amazing the dream car trophy I would say is the hardest trophy to get right because I can go ahead and make a million bucks that is freaking awesome you know the two comma club award but with the dream car people come and go right so you got to make sure that thing is building and building and building so that's that's the thing I don't want to say it's hard it's very doable right but as long as you have over a hundred by Funnel Hacking Live that we did to present you with that trophy super cool so yeah so everyone that comes in can see this page here see our new offers and then once they go ahead and read all that awesome and they get this in the invite so once that goes through then Tyler and I can see that name then we go and approve them if everything's good and then this is really cool this is a kind of an ethical PDF that everyone gets so you can kind of see hey these are the guidelines that we go with we don't want you bidding against our keywords all that good stuff we want to make sure everything's safe and then you go ahead and get that best practices and then from actually one more thing on this page to this is actually really cool you have to sign it for the quick start call which is right should be on your Tyler my it might be once they I think they have to verify their email address that's what it is I know it was missing you can't do it because Susan's a fake yeah once we get her through once we get her approved in everything then she gets to go to the confirmation page where there is a sign up for the quick start call so that's what I wanted to talk about so that's a call that we do every Monday and Friday there in the mornings and we've got just our new people on there we talk about where to get your links where you can see the Facebook page question and answer where you can see the assets page things like that so then Susan would be taken care of really well we would just give her a tour of everything so she can see everything and we also help her to know like hey we are your guys Tyler and Turner your affiliate managers if you have any questions at all we're here for you hit us up on Facebook Messenger and that sort of thing so that way she's taken care of kind of go through the step so and then we then hand her off say hey our our Facebook group is where you get all the good information we'll make sure we put that in the chat there check out our Facebook group we go live every Tuesday at 9 a.m. Mount Sander time and then every Thursday at 2 p.m. Mount Sander time to where they can go for more help so that's all the beginner sense sorry sorry Turner it sounds to me like like this is a really really easy program to get into there's lots of help available once you get started as an affiliate so many resources and just kind of a path for you to to get started and to be successful but let me let me kind of back up and I'm going to pretend like Susan is telling me for the first time I don't even know I have a vague idea of what an affiliate program I've heard of Amazon affiliates and you know people will get the link and they'll put it on their blog and things like that and if you want to buy that thing that they use you just click and then they get like you know a few bucks right what what really if I'm understanding correctly the benefit of being an affiliate is that you get residual income right it keeps coming all the time and I know that we're going to get into some some of the more details of the of the clip funnels affiliate program but is that the reason that people should want to become an affiliate yeah totally it's kind of kind of like the linchpin right if you're only if you're only making a commission one time it's not it's not I mean that's cool right but if you're if you're getting that continuity right getting those monthly occurring commissions that's the best right so if you have someone sign up with their click funnels link they go through the trial and then they're then paying you that month the occurring revenue every month right up to a hundred bucks per person every month so Dan gets these commission checks right they're awesome right that's that's good money especially if you got you know 10 20 50 100 people signed up that's fantastic monthly occurring revenue coming in some of some affiliates some affiliate programs only give you know a one-time payment or a certain commission but with the amount of instruction and education that click funnels gives and making sure that we get you know someone building the funnel right off the bat making sure they get their domain making sure they get their email sending started and everything really helps them to stick and so you as the affiliate marketer or Susan this is a great affiliate program to get into because click funnels takes care of the customers and so it's like okay you can always trust us if you're you know promoting getting people into us and we'll help you out from there right so yeah definitely that monthly occurring revenue is awesome that 30% I've heard of people getting like maybe you have to like a thousand dollars two thousand dollars every month right is that is that something that they you know somebody can do once they start maybe offering a course or offering some help in exchange for that person joining through their link yeah Dan you want to talk about kind of some bonuses like that well yeah I was just thinking of a particular person who if I said their name most of us well was set in this call certainly would know him but he I was talking to him a couple years ago already and he said oh yeah I make enough money on the affiliate commission to make my house payment every month and I know he's won a couple where he's been up high in a few affiliate contests since then so he's probably making his house payment our payment his second house payment his boat payment you know he's he's got his expenses covered I have no doubt and then there's you know the guys who are really really really killing it they're buying mansions with the money but obviously disclaimer disclaimer you will not start doing that on day one it's work I mean that's not kid ourselves either of us here it's also work because it's not only an issue they said that people come and go off of the car off the dream car list well there's a reason why you get people in and if they're not using the software if they're not doing something with it they're gonna go away and some people just naturally will okay I'm gonna give it a try you know try it out for a couple months and they go this really isn't for me I'm gonna go back to my regular job or whatever but on the other hand if you can help them out if you can give them ongoing support and coaching and like I said there's one guy that I know in particular down in Australia he's got a weekly call and what he does is he just gets his affiliates in he does a weekly call with them does coaching and you know helps them build their funnels and all that kind of stuff so it's an ongoing thing but it's also an ongoing paycheck if you can be bringing in a couple thousand bucks a month it might be worth a couple hours a week to actually do something well let's just ask the question right so in the chat if you could bring in an extra couple of thousand dollars for a couple of hours a week work and that like kind of cool but again full like disclaimer this might not work you you've got to actually do some stuff and there's a bunch of terms and conditions and things that go along with this and you've kind of got to be ethical as an affiliate right but if you go out there and focus on the people and not the money knowing that you can promote whatever it is that you're promoting and ClickFunnels is the best affiliate program ever right but there's a gazillion things out there that you could go and find but the key to this is actually understanding so Susan she's already building some funnels she could give away these share funnels because she can build them she knows inside the software so she could help people how do you fix this thing how do you you know change the color of this headline whatever it is how do you build a funnel so she's got something to offer that is going to keep people on the program is going to keep people signed up to ClickFunnels right and if you can get those things working for you then yeah you could be paying your mobile form bill you could be paying for your groceries you could be paying for your house and that's like might seem that that's out of some folks reach right now but I know personally affiliates and I also know that I've had some fun with ClickFunnels classic and I do a little bit with with two point all right I'm doing all these lives and crazy stuff as well but there's always somebody reaching out to you when you're visible in that space right there's people message people and say hey hey Dan I saw your comment in the in the ClickFunnels group before and that was really interesting and Dan goes hey are you are you a ClickFunnels member and they go no I'm just interested well that's an opportunity for an affiliate to go well there's a link there's some help there's a little bit of time there's some bonuses and that person potentially if you get that part right and let's stick around with you for a long time that's month on month commission but you've got to do it the right way and this week we really want to try and get under that process and kind of show you guys some stuff that you can do that's hopefully how much do you get if you get five recurring trials or you get five ten people recurring on clickfunnels you get twenty you're heading towards that car quite quickly once you get in the groove you know Tyler and Turner they're your best friends right you see these guys all the time because you like whoa it's moving but you I guess you've got one you've got one well even that even I think you know 30% the very lowest commission you get is like you know it's called 30 bucks so you get five that's $150 well I mean is that paying your phone bills that you're paying your electric bill not here in Arizona it's not paying your electric bill I can guarantee you that but you know it's paying it's paying a bill so you just got a bill taken off your back and you could take that extra money and you could throw it towards your credit cards and get your credit cards paid off you know it's just it's just extra money but again it's gonna take a little bit of work I mean occasionally you get the just dropping your lap which those are the those are the ones you love but for the most part you gotta do something to earn them yeah without a doubt and real quick I'm thinking I know I know we'll get into like some tips and tricks but just think about your audience right maybe Susan as she's starting out she's pondering ideas right hey man I've got my email list that we that's starting out does Susan have an email list yet? Yep she's got a she's got a list and she's got a few folks who she's building funnels for so she's kind of a little bit further along but I guess we could really bring this back to the foundation how do you just go and get you first? Yeah. Person to sign up. So Susan's already got an email list right so maybe Susan here's like she's learning about click funnels even more she really like Russell Brunson everything he's teaching maybe she's learning a little bit more about Lynchpin maybe she has a newsletter or go something going after email list maybe once a month once every every quarter whatever it may be maybe Susan saying hey Russell Brunson is my new mentor I'm learning a ton from him so she goes to her email list and says hey everybody I'm learning from my new mentor and he's absolutely amazing he's teaching me about this Lynchpin model it's amazing continuity wow it's crazy and you know if you don't have continuity you don't have a business right and she's teaching this to her audience and maybe she wants to say hey audience if you want to learn about Russell Brunson too you need to he's amazing the software he he's been able to come up with with Todd Dickerson absolutely crazy it's pulling my mind right now do you want to learn about it too and she just puts her email or her affiliate link in her email and people just go ahead and check it out right there too right that's a great way to push it to your audience and you know it's it's very very easy right make it very your audience loves you your email list loves you whatever right so they may just go ahead and sign up and go ahead and check it out from there from there and you never know right if you get you know one or two sign ups maybe 10 12 sign ups that's that's a great you're paying for Dan's AC bill right so you never know push out to your audience see what they think and maybe that's maybe that's Susan's first step in this whole affiliate journey without a doubt without a doubt and I think not be afraid of signing up and I see there's some questions coming in and we're quite getting quite a few questions some people I think saying earlier that they've signed up and they had trouble with links and things like that reach out turn it to you guys are reading through the comments as well but do our best to make sure that everybody is on there and we don't approve everybody right sometimes is like it might be a case that some people got have a discussion with but on the on the whole you should be able to get in and often with any affiliate program they often want to know how are you promoting this stuff like so if you turn up and like hey I just bought a list of a billion names I'm just going to spam the hell out of everybody then probably you're not a good fit if you're going to build your list from the foundation your own list you're going to look after your people and you're going to do things ethically which we will get into and you saw the link earlier you can sign it you can get that ethical affiliate guide then there's no reason why you shouldn't be going out there and start getting that first contact that first sale and just talking to people about click funnels you probably click funnels crazy anyway you've got the cap you've got the books you're doing this stuff anyway you've got to start somewhere right yeah 100% I'm seeing a bunch of questions on share funnels maybe we'll bring in Ben janky tomorrow or within this timeline so maybe when Susan wants to start building that sure funnel with some time this week we can have been janky just show us the whole process so give us a hashtag share funnel if you want to learn about share funnel hashtag sure funnel in the comments there because we can bring Ben on he can show us the whole kind of roadmap of how to build a share funnel because I'm telling you once you start voting with share funnels you are going to have just money you know no claims here but I predict you have a ton of money flowing to your bank account once you start building those share funnels so yeah that might be fun to have him in here to kind of show us that process what other questions that we see in so we're seeing what would a beginner create to make an irresistible offer for 2.0 and build that email list I guess that does bring it back to kind of question that Susan would ask right just a raw beginner how could you make this irresistible and scott's asking that question where did you start down I don't I don't I think I started basically where I said I started earlier was you know I started years ago just putting up all kinds of training videos on on click funnels and again my thought was oh I'm gonna put up all this training videos on click funnels people are gonna come to me and they're gonna want to buy click funnels through my link and I it took me a few years to realize that that's not happening because I was targeting the people who are watching my videos already click funnels users so you have to find the market that you're working in or that you have affinity with or that you can put something in front of that's going to bring in outside people because it doesn't do you a whole lot of good I've got a list of click funnels users essentially so again when there's a big promotion of some sort I can put a bonus out in front of them and they'll say okay I'll sign up under your link I mean I I've actually had people you know message me and say um hey if I sign up or if I switch over to this other program using your link they're already a user if I switch over and I buy this other thing what's your bonus you're gonna give me to which my response usually is what do you want because I got so much stuff do you want this this this this or does I don't care take pick one you can have now I'll give you all of them it doesn't matter but um the question is is as a complete newbie and you're not in click funnels and you haven't shot a whole bunch of videos the question is is who who's your audience and how can you get them interested in funnel building and I think in some businesses it's going to be a stretch now Scott in particular I see him him doing this he's more in the weight loss niche and also the cooking niche how can he and I'll bounce this out to you guys how can somebody in the weight loss or cooking niche giving them recipes teaching them how to barbecue or things like that how can they pull in click funnels users that's a question I have for you guys sorry what say it one more time well like I said in Scott's case here he's in the weight loss cooking barbecue niche he basically teaches people how to cook using their barbecues in order to lose weight he lost like 120 pounds himself doing this and so that's what he's teaching people so how can he with that's his target market is can you guys think of any way that he can be bringing in click funnel signups definitely and I know I we've talked this uh about this a few times uh about share funnels it's going to be massive to start building a share funnel on that uh talk to your audience hey I've built this awesome page in a funnel where I've been selling my products do you guys want this page too I've made like a million dollars doing this yeah I want this and so we'll show you how to build that share funnel you know very soon whether you're selling a pyrrole you know barbecue spices whatever it may be so building that share phone is going to be huge also starting a youtube channel is going to be huge as well making click funnels 2.0 tutorials what I was doing uh right there when when Dan was talking what you can do as well is you can go over to chat gbt and you can say hat chat gbt uh let's see can you present that there we go um so you can say hey chat gbt give me 50 questions uh that people are asking me about click funnels 2.0 and so I just did that and there's 30 here so far and more so you can start putting videos um you know whatever questions people are asking about 2.0 and then just start making videos on these and what I would do is be like hey I'm not an expert I'm learning but I'm going to start uh I'm going to start making videos on click funnels 2.0 and SEO and then just start making that and uh on your youtube video within click funnels 2.0 and then be like hey I'm going to see how I can split test different things within click funnel 2.0 and then make a video on that because odds are people are going to go in youtube and just start asking these questions and then it's going to shoot right over to your your video um as that video ranks and so this is a great way to do that too and so you know as a beginner your strengths may not be the same as Dan Havy may not be the strengths as me Tyler uh Andy and Danny so find what your strength is if you're not sure what your strength is well start now right so whatever your strength may be if it's SEO if it's youtube if it's uh facebook groups um if it's if you're an author whatever it may be start doing that thing and uh figure out what your bonuses are from that it's weight loss um make a make a weight loss ebook and then give that away with your click funnels right hey if you sign up for click funnels 2.0 I'll give you my fitness ebook for free just go ahead and sign up for that and then I'll you know get you an email list from there so I always say not every email or not every affiliate is molded the same way but everyone can find their superpower and build off of that you see that's the same here right people Danny jumps in here I was going to say in Scott's case here I know that he is he's building funnels to give stuff away that's one of his things he's also building funnels to sell stuff he's building funnels to present his offer to have a membership site to do all these things so at some point as you build up that list you can also say hey um you guys have noticed all those marketing stuff I've been doing if you're at all interested I'm going to have a special you know call special call on Thursday afternoon at three o'clock why don't you guys jump on there and I'll teach you everything I know about what how I'm doing this and how am I making money off of doing this Danny do I still hear thunder no not at all because the the the fundamental of all of this is you've already got an advantage now Scott in that you are a click funnels user right so you're using this thing and you're in this thing and you are building stuff right so you're building your giveaway funnel you're building your landing page you're building out maybe you've got a blog on there right so as you go around and you're doing this stuff anyway you could have the screen share thing running right you could just be talking to yourself as you do that going hey now we're going to go and click on this thing and now we're going to add a headline and now we're going to click on this thing and now we're going to add a photograph see how we do it and look it sometimes gives you an advantage if you are a beginner because like I could come on here now and you've seen the these crazy demos we do and we build a funnel and it's all singing or dancing and people like can you just slow down Dan goes and does some CSS code and some crazy thing and there's animations and stuff spinning around I saw this thing that he did for his recent entry to the to a competition we were running and it's like you could do that into a 2.0 for people watching Scott who's just kind of they're like whoa you can add a headline to a page and this guy's maybe made a few mistakes and you've had a little laugh and a joke with them they're like this guy's really cool I wonder what other videos he's got right so don't underestimate your ability the very fact that you're using click funnels right now gives you an opportunity to start building up little videos I've got a video on YouTube that's like 95 000 views and that made me a big bunch of money while it was active as a click funnels affiliate right and it's not on there anymore it's like a little bit dated because it was one of the earlier videos they had an insane amount of views and people would literally click the link to the original click funnels webinar right see what I mean it's like it's out of date that the webinar doesn't even exist anymore from like six years ago they click on this thing and I get sales because the next advantage you've got as a beginner is you just need to introduce people and show them that it's kind of cool you've got the best sales guy in the world doing the selling that's the next cool thing about click funnels so just start I think is the message and won't be afraid to record what you're doing even if you think you you're a man I'm a beginner what who you know who cares what I think it's like people care and people want to like see you do this stuff it doesn't really matter what space you're in either you could be in weight loss you could be in fishing you could be whatever you're still talking to people and these people all are running their small businesses or they know people were running small business or they got kids they want to they want to get rid of the business or the job that they have and they want to start something else or they're currently using WordPress or some other software and they go okay what are you guys doing here what would I mean that's how I discovered click funnels was I was talking to Ed Dale and he was telling me about a site he was building with some guy and he sent me a link to it I looked at it I looked at the code I saw click funnels I google click funnels I said Russell Brunson I said I know Russell Brunson from the Kennedy days I'm in that's how I got into click funnels and so yeah I mean I was using WordPress at the time I'd never heard of click funnels and as soon as I saw it I was like I'm getting rid of WordPress now so I mean you know you're you know just because somebody wants to lose 100 pounds doesn't mean that they don't also need some software too without doubt one of the things that one of the stories that I love from Russell is where he talks about a person that started teaching at a university and he wasn't even a professor he snuck in right and he taught a whole semester and then later they they found out they were like how did you do you're not even an expert how did you how were you able to teach a whole semester right and and what happens is he this person said that I just read a chapter or a couple of chapters ahead of the rest of the class right so even if you're a beginner you may not have all of the answers you may not be an expert yet but you have the software and you're using it right and if people see your site and they're like oh okay wow this is pretty cool even if you're a weight loss you know expert there's people in other niches kind of like what what Dan was saying there's there's going to be people that need the software so so what you can easily do is you can send out an email every once in a while that says hey guess what I'm still kind of new at this software but I'm going to be doing a class on on Monday and we're going to show you how I've been you know creating pages on this on this platform so it's just as easy as that and you can also say hey and if you want to watch and if you need this software and if you want to get into what I'm doing here's the link it's easy as that really cool really cool in the fishing thing we actually did a thing called make money while you fish and linked it back to click for another affiliate program so people need like they go fishing and then they can get out the phone and they can do a little bit of affiliate marketing and make money while they fish so make money while you grill right nice yeah creative so um I think we've covered a lot of stuff there and we really want to get into some stuff and if we can look at share funnels this week definitely because I kind of missed those off this slide and our Dan's got some things I'm sure that he'll share I've got some little interesting sort of tips that I can certainly share with folks but if we go back to our slides Susan's like super excited she's like whoa I understand that this thing I need to share links and as long as I'm passionate about this thing and I can sell it with conviction it's like this click for those things amazing it's helping me build my business I can even make money while I fish or while I grill do you want to know more about it he's kind of coming together and we know that we've got like literally two of the coolest guys in the internet world right here on the screen um who are just going to help you through this process with the group where they look after you and you've got folks like you know Dan, myself, Andy and we're in the groups we're everywhere we've got the ambassadors who were cheering you along and we're more than happy to share tips as long as you sign up under our links that's right that's another way to do it right but an ethical bribe an ethical bribe right and and follow what Russell Brunson's teaching because things like perfect webinar or you know challenges or any of the stuff you're reading expert secrets dot com secrets the the clauses that go along with things the way that people sell you can set little bits of that and use that in your promotional efforts so there's a lot to it but if you just start and maybe just start filming what you're doing in click funnels right now with a little bit of a narration you're already on your way doesn't mean you have to start firing off links tomorrow it means you're building that foundation and if you've got a bit of a list there's been some great suggestions how you can tag things onto your existing emails if you're not even in that sort of entrepreneur niche and you know oh man i don't even know any business owners you probably do you just not noticing it right now ah i just like when i go and start promoting click for us 2.0 and what are some i guess we've got like 10 minutes left what are some other questions that we might have in the in the comments what are some other sort of like beginner questions that susan might be answering is there anything else you guys want to ask we were watching let us know in the chat and then we'll kind of explain what's coming next over the next three or four days well one thing i would add in here because i've seen the question in the group just recently a couple different times and people are like where can you get a good beginner email you know like a good seven day sequence so somebody joins your list where's a good seven day sequence and every person and i did this myself i would say go to russell's five day lead challenge i think it's called i think it's fivedayleadchallenge.com turner or tyler if you guys can pull that up maybe in there on day four oh gal by the name of his yada golden i think her name is russell interviews her as she goes through this whole process of how she does a seven day seven day email to to launch it out to her people and it's basically telling your story your origin story a lot of stuff about yourself well jim edwards in funnel scripts put that in there so he has a whole thing where you walk through and it asks you all the questions and you fill it out and it makes incredible emails when you're done and all of that is given away for free in the five day lead challenge the the free version of funnel scripts all the scripts for this they also have a really cool thing in there that helps you build out lead pages and i was going through some old stuff i built a couple years ago and i was looking at it i got one man i totally forgot about that lead page builder because you go in there and you basically tell it a little bit about your avatar and it spits out all the headlines all the subhead line lays out the entire thing for you you basically have to copy and paste it into your click funnels account and you have just built a lead magnet funnel it is it is the coolest thing in the world and i mean writing these emails is not easy but i'll tell you it's a lot easier than if you had to sit down with a pen and a piece of paper and just start writing these things out on your own because they got all the prompts in there and i've had a lot of people compliment me on my first seven emails and i give all the compliments right over to jim and yada because they're the ones who did this not me boom grand tips yeah and with that too uh danny can go present that down at the bottom there i think uh here in the next few days we might be talking about more of click funnels links that you can promote as well as well as your funnels um you can definitely talk about those very soon but i want to make sure we all have this link for you as well i can put this into the comments but tyler and i we always talk about the assets page this is massive so if you are promoting click funnels 2.0 your first funnel challenge plr funnels funnels and templates and again we'll talk about these this week um but for example if you're promoting funnels and templates you'll see that we've got all these image assets here so you can just come in and download these and we give you these because hey these are the images we want you to use we don't want you to use anything else really because these are just like these are not um it's not going to get you in trouble with compliance or anything these are in here ready for you to use and you can download these tons of them here for you and then you also have these email swipe files um so we're going to do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and get just give you these emails and you can put in your name and your affiliate id boom it's ready to go you also throw these in chat gpt and say hit chat gpt make me 15 more emails just like this and then you have a whole kind of sequence there for you that you can send out that makes it really nice and easy so we want you to use these right there these are assets we're going to give you these um so really easy is i'll put these in the the comments as well so you can go ahead and use these and then when we talk more about links you can promote um uh tomorrow or whatever we'll we'll kind of break down each of these links so you know exactly what you're promoting and then when you're doing your emails the one thing that ross will definitely suggest doing is so like on day one with your email you want to you know give them a link to something free and on day two you want to give them a link to something three but maybe by day three or four that's when you start going oh and hey come on over and take a look at my thing and so and then you give them a couple more freebies and then you have another link that sends them to something you're selling or promoting because it doesn't have to be your own products you could be building out this entire string here just selling click follows products you know if we go back to the old system too you know one of the 10 15 different things you could be promoting and other people's products so anything you believe in and again going back to scott um you know you can be promoting different rubs and different books and you know whatever it is so don't don't think it just has to be one thing but you have to be giving value in your email sequence and also pitching at the same time 100 percent 100 percent we are coming towards the end but I think Susan's like you even write the emails for me you give me the graphics it's like there's all these offers and and some of these offers are best around a free trial or a free challenge or something that's like like a dollar or something that people can just try and once they're in there the company does the selling right click follows does the selling the other emails that go out and you don't lose the lead because it you kind of get this person what we call cookied right and they don't mean you come with a the tasty cookies it means that people are attached to you for a period of time and every affiliate program is different but you only need to refer people and if they start watching videos and go in their own little path you still get paid eventually when they sign up right so it's definitely worth doing definitely worth exploring and if you are using click funnels even if you're just starting to use click funnels record some videos document your journey that is a bonus so you document your first week of being a click funnels user and you go and publish that with a little video on youtube and people are curious they want to go and find that whoa obviously you don't you don't go in there and do anything that's that's negative you hopefully you have a great first week with click funnels you go out there and you promote it in a positive light you tell them how awesome it is how it's helped your business move forward you was able to get rid of all of these other things and people like that kind of makes sense and if you do that in a fun cool way that's interesting and engaging and you show that you you're passionate about that whatever you're promoting people will sign up you're right you got to be positive about if you put up a video and you talk about how much you hate click funnels it's going to be really hard to sell it not it's not okay right yeah i think that goes without saying even though i mean how many times have we all clicked on something that you know it says you know russell brentz and socks or click funnel socks that you get there and they're pitching click funnels and it's like come on i never i never understood those but apparently they work because the guys still doing them yeah we probably get shut down real quick though because i think it's in the like the ethical guide that everybody needs to read and we want to make sure that everybody's going out there and doing the the good job because click funnels is great it made you a big bunch of money and it is changing people's lives across the board you only need to look at the you know funnel like a live website you see all the folks on there collecting two comic club awards and the dream car award that we saw earlier i believe before we go we actually have had a few is it a few people who've got the two comic club award through being affiliates or am i wrong made more than a million dollars as click funnels affiliates oh there's there's plenty that have made over a million oh yeah well susan's like running around the office right now like what do i do maybe that's a good to go to sign up and then we'll be back tomorrow show you how to get started with this in a little bit more detail love it love it but where do we need to go where do we need to go to sign up if anybody's just joining us yeah we'll put it in the comments there so if you're okay with this danie and you talk about the different links to promote click funnels and then we'll talk we'll go through the the different funnels kind of explain what audience would want each link and then if it's okay as well we could bring on ben janky and he can go through the whole share funnel process and that's going to just blow your mind and if you start promoting your share funnels and start making a ton of money i'm just gonna fly to wherever you're making all this money give you the biggest hug ever and it's gonna be awesome because you're gonna be gonna be doing well so it's gonna be awesome so make sure you're here with us tomorrow what time it's what noon mountain time right same time on the yet yeah yeah same time uh so same time that we did we started today it's for me it's a noon central time but i think actually i'm in a different country so my central time is different from the us central time it's confusing but yeah same time that we started today we'll see you tomorrow and thank you guys so much for for this information i mean susan is ready to go like now and she needs to get started within affiliate program so
