Music All right, we are live again. My name is Andy Ortega. We're also joined by Danny Walsh and Carlos Ries. Really excited to be here with you guys. How's it going? Happy Monday. Happy Monday. Happy Monday, guys. How are you? Awesome, awesome. Really excited for this week. What we're going to do is we're going to continue our Build a Business series. So if you were with us a couple of weeks ago, what we did is we built an entire business from scratch on ClickFunnels 2.0. Now, let me just make sure, let me back up a little bit. Building an entire business does take a lot of work and a lot of time. Now, you can do it in pieces. And what we're actually doing is that's exactly what we're doing. We're taking all of the pieces, all of the foundations of building a business and breaking them apart every day. So today we're going to, we'll get into that in just a second. But before we jump in, let me tell you how you can get support if you are struggling or if you have any questions related to ClickFunnels 2.0 or even ClickFunnels Classic. Super easy to get help. All you gotta do is send an email to support at clickfunnels.com. That's gonna be the fastest way for you to get help. Another way, if you like reading articles, watching videos and things like that, I usually prefer to do that before I send an email. You can go to our Knowledge Center and you can find that at help.myclickfunnels.com. Help.myclickfunnels.com, just go there and you'll find, you can just do a search just like on Google and you'll be able to find help articles on pretty much anything related to ClickFunnels technical stuff. Awesome, okay Danny. So we are starting a new series this week and what are we going to be doing this week? So this week we've got something kinda cool, right? So, hey, we've even got slides for this week, right? So it's like, whoa, we have slides. So this week we're building a business, right? Again, but we're taking the previous work to like the next stage. And following on from this sort of original week that we did, we created the avatar of Susan and Susan kinda walks into the office and she's like, hey, I'm in this niche group and I want to help photographers and eventually I want to start selling these guys funnels so they can go out there and build their own businesses. And we showed Susan how to go from helping folks with their logos in the early stages to then offering them a little bit of a recurring membership site so they could join her program and they could kind of learn more about graphics and things like that. And what she did is she started to filter people through or funnel people through to the point where she realized some of her audience were ready to start their own business. And then she started building funnels and before you know it, she's putting up offers and sales pages and really starting to help people. And if you fast forward a little bit now, Susan's got to a point where she's like, I've got a lot of demand for these funnels and for people wanting online presence. So not only do they want funnels, they want ads running and things like that. And she's realizing, well, she possibly can't do it all on her own and she's had this idea, would it be possible to start her own agency? So maybe she could have a few folks working with her and she could offer the right services to these folks without like going crazy in the process or being overwhelmed and trying to take on too much work. So she's back in the office and she's like, hey, this is going really well. I've got some clients and I've got a lot of prospective clients, people who want to do this work with me, what do you think about me setting up an agency? And that's kind of where we're at with this right now. So anybody who wants to watch those previous replays, you can do so on the featured section of the group, right? So you can go up there and if you check the group at the time of recording this, there might be another way you can get those videos as well, but we'll what mention that till the end and all the replays are in the featured section. But imagine that Susan's back in the office, she's had a great bunch of success. She's ready to move to this sort of next stage in her business, but now she's like, do I start an agency? That's kind of where we're at with it. That's pretty exciting because I know tons of people, well, first of all, there's tons of agencies that are in the ClickFunnels group. Now, one thing I do want to say is that if you are ever looking for an agency or looking for help, first thing that you should do is we actually have a website dedicated specifically for that. If you go to marketplace.funnelbuilder.com, marketplace.funnelbuilder.com, that's where you can actually hire experts in ClickFunnels, experts on video editing, experts on copywriting, all kinds of stuff. So you can just go there and you can hire somebody, but what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk about somebody that decides to take on a new adventure and they're going to start their own marketing agency. And that's really exciting to me because I have friends that have their own marketing agency. And it's pretty exciting because there is, it is, you can make a lot of money in a marketing agency. If you learn how to scale your business and you learn how to work with a team and offer your services, there is a lot of profit available in that niche. So yeah, I'm excited. Yeah, I'm gonna take this to the next stage hopefully for Susan and we've got Carlos here as well. We've also got some ambassadors waiting in the wings. I do believe Andy as well. So hopefully we can bring those on in a sec, but we just wanna kind of set the scene a little bit because man, people are thinking, well, last week we was just working on the chorus and things like that. We've laid out in the graphic that went up into the group last week what we're hoping to cover in this five days, right? It's five short days and clearly like Andy said, we can't cover like every minute detail, but if we give you the overarching sort of blueprint for this from our experience, from where ClickFunnels comes in, like you said, the marketplace and then Lee's gonna be joining us at some point as well during the week and our ambassadors are gonna be joining between all of us and all of the insight we can give you. This might just be enough for you to go out there and do your research like Susan and kind of real, make the decision, is this gonna be the right way to go for you? And then you know how ClickFunnels is kind of able to support you with that, especially from the software point of view. So why might you start your agency, understand how to create your offer and where does a funnel hub come into that? Discover how to find some clients and like what funnels you would use, like is that different to what we was talking about last week? And learn about scaling your offer and your business and have a chance to get some asking questions and get some help with it as well. So this is kind of what we're gonna do over the next few days. And hopefully whether you're watching live or on the replay, we should be able to answer questions and should be able to give you that valuable insight as well. So that's kind of like the plan. Is there anything you guys wanna add to that? Because we wanna sort of get into the discussion, right? Yeah, I want to add something real quick. So if you are an agency or you offer funnel building services or website services or profit services or copywriting or everything that Andy mentioned, you can sign up to be in the marketplace advertising your stuff. It's completely free. Lee will help you. Lee Shappan, Rossi marketplace and he will help you set up and everything. So you can be in the form there. So there's a quick betting process that you will go through and you will be able to be there, you know, promoting your services, which is always a question we get here in the Facebook. So yeah, that's it for me. Yeah. From a click funnel's perspective, we want you to be successful, right? And we've not only have got the software, we've also got various training and mechanisms that you can use to go out there and actually get clients and we're hoping that by the end of this week, you'll have discovered some of that stuff as well. So it's not just about, hey, build this stuff and customers will come. There's a whole bunch of things that go on behind the scenes that you might not know about, right? So if you're watching live, you're on the replay, let us know in the comments. I know there's quite a few people on. We are going to kind of get into this and sort of look at where we're up to starting from afresh, Susan's walks into the office, she's like, guys, this is awesome. And I want to get moving with this. So let's get into some of the questions that, you know, Susan's asking us. And if we can sort of work through these, we're also able to bring on our ambassadors as well, a few of our ambassadors, right? So I will make that happen. And Andy, maybe you want to start with the questions and we can get into this stuff. Sure, sure, sure. Okay, cool. So we got a lot of really good questions. We're going to try to cover this and really form a foundation for Susan's business. And yeah, the first question is starting an agency. Why would somebody won't even want to do that? What does it take? I mean, my goodness, like I said, I have friends and I know people that have an agency. I know it's a lot of work. So where do you even start? Well, it's for me, it's definitely something that you don't start immediately, right? So if you're just in this to, you know, sell your own product and maybe you're just building funnels, you know, on a very small one-to-one scale, it's not something that you should try and go out there and build the infrastructure of an agency, right? But if you're starting to see a steady influx of work and you're starting to see people coming to you all the time saying, hey, I urge you build funnels or I can see examples of your work or send me your portfolio, you might be at the point, look at your revenue, look at what the kind of money that you're making, look at the kind of clients that you're attracting work. This would be the best decision for you from not only a business standpoint, but also from like a legal standpoint as well and how you structure your business. And ultimately you would be able to bring in staff as well to, you know, manage the workload, right? Is that, that kind of makes sense, right? So it's not something you should rush into, but it's certainly something you should consider when you start to see a volume of work steadily increasing. And I guess with that question in mind, if it's all right, we can bring in a couple of our amazing ambassadors who might just also be able to offer some insight. So let's see who's joining us on the stream today. And we do have... Hey! Hey! The original Susan, not our avatar Susan. We're probably familiar with and we've also got the amazing Andrea who happened to have a business very similar to what our avatar Susan is. It's like, did he do that by design? That's not confusing at all. Maybe it's a popular name, right? So we won't confuse our Susan's. We've got the original in the place right now. Between us, hopefully we can help folks understand, you know, they've been going out there, they've been selling some funnels, they've been building some stuff for clients. They've got to this point where they're like, man, I'm getting quite a bit of work coming in here, right? And now I'm thinking, well, ah, I could do this full time and I could start to generate some real income and maybe I could get some staff and I could take this to this next stage. What's your thoughts on this, right? Because everybody starts somewhere and it'd be awesome to kind of hear your thoughts on this process and we can hopefully, Susan can lead the office happy. Both Susan will lead the supply. I normally, it was interesting when Susan and I first started this season, first started, we, she had an agency, I was a little bit behind her in the whole like, hey, are we an agency? And what was so fascinating to me in all the conversations that we had, most of the people, they define agency as this like big thing, right? Where it's like, I have this huge infrastructure and I have all these clients and I'm making a lot of money. And I would encourage people to basically have a way more loose definition of agency that if you're providing a service, any kind of service in the funnel community, you are an agency, just step into it. That is what you are. And I think the more that you can use that language, the more people are understanding like, oh, that's me. And then I think that the only other thing that I would say when you're first getting started is, choose what type of agency you want to be. And I think that there's three types of agencies. So the first type of agency is what I call an order taker agency. So it means that you usually have lower price points. It's very much like they give you their order, right? I want this, this and this, I want a sales page, I wanna, right? And you basically say, okay, I just need these pieces, give me your order, I'm gonna go do it, and then I'm gonna give it back to you. I think the benefit of an order taker agency is that you're usually super fast. You usually have a good price point that's pretty competitive. It's really good if you're just starting, right? Because you don't have to put a lot of like, your expertise on the line necessarily. It's just a very clean and crisp exchange. So that's an order taker agency. I think the second type of agency is what I call a genius design agency. And so where this is like, you have deep expertise and you don't typically like collaborating with people. Your expertise is one where you take the requirements and then you go and you be brilliant and you make something brilliant and then you bring it back to people, right? This usually is a little bit further along in your career unless you've had a first career, right? Where you have a deep expertise, but it's, you can usually go higher price point. It usually takes longer. And the way that you establish it with the client is like, I need this, I'm gonna go be brilliant and I'll bring it back to you. And maybe I have a couple of iterations, right? So that's the second type. And then I think the third type of agency is what Susan and I run and geek out and that's what we call a co-creation agency. So we have expertise in funnel design, funnel strategy, linchpin strategy, right? And our clients have expertise in who they serve and their expertise and what they do. And it's like two wings of a bird that are coming together and it's a co-creation process. So we are deep in your business. You are deep with us. Our goal is to have lifelong clients and we're co-creating on everything. So it's regular meetings. It's usually kind of middle to higher price point wise and your goal is for long-term retention clients in that model. So I would say pick the model that works best for you and how you wanna actually work with people and where your zone of genius is and run with that. So Andrea, tell me if this is correct. If you're doing an order taking agency, a lot of people start out with that because it's easier, right? Because you can just say, well, I do this only. And then you get hired and you complete the project and then it's usually done, right? So I think there's pros and cons to each type of business and when you're first starting out, it's perfect. The order taking business is perfect for you because you can jump in, there's not a long-term commitment, you do your thing and then that's it. Now the drawback would be that you have to keep hunting, right? For customers. And then for the middle tier, tell me again what was the middle? It's like what Susan and I run. So it's what we call co-creation agency. So it is. How's the third? What's the second one? What's different? The genius design. Is that what you're thinking, Andy? Okay, cool. So the genius design, so that's where you, it's right in the middle of those two because it's a longer commitment. You're gonna spend a lot of time with that company for months. But then again, you're done, right? After that. And then the third one, that's where you have lifelong customers. That's kind of the best place to be because they're gonna keep coming back to you and it's almost like a constant, consistent work that you have. Is that correct? It's funny you mentioned that, Andy. I don't know if it's the best because I think having that lifelong commitment means you're in it as an agency long-term, right? Like you're playing a long game. I know a lot of really successful agency owners though that they don't want to be in somebody's business that deeply. Like they want to just be able to come in and over a three day, like charge a 30K product or project where I'm just like helping you and your team do the thing, teach them the thing. Let's just get you a jumpstart and then I'm out. So I think that the decision between that kind of more genius design, do a project versus like a long-term co-creation process really depends on just how you want, do you want lifelong clients that you're really deep in their business or do you want it to be more like, I have a strong expertise and like I'm in and I'm out in a shorter timeframe. It's still a nice high price point, but I'm not looking for like lifelong clients. Gotcha, gotcha. Yeah, so I guess you could do a little bit of all three, right? But you and Susan and your agency, you guys focus on the third one. Yeah. Which is where you spend more time and get in deep with the client. Okay, gotcha. Digital transparency, I think the reason we choose the third one is because we have poor scope management. So we're like, cause it's like we pulled the thread, you know, it's like, wait, that part of your business isn't figured out. Well, let us help you with that. Wait, that part of your business isn't figured out. Let's help you with that, right? So like it's just the nature of how we tend to work with people and we just are leaning into like choosing to see that as a strength and making a business model around that instead of embracing like, are we gonna try to like square peg, round hole? You know what I mean with that skill set? So I think from that Andrea and maybe Susan, you jump in on this as well. What you're saying to help our wonderful client is that as you start to work with your clients, it might be more than just, hey, I need this magic thing on the internet that's called a funnel. And you realize, they haven't got this thing set up and they haven't got this thing. And actually none of this would ever work unless you did this, this, this and this. Is that kind of what I'm hearing? Yes, absolutely. Good to hear you. Yeah, so I'll just, I'll jump in for a minute if I've been said a word. So my journey may be similar to the Avatar Susan, but started out as order taker, right? Order taker, you can, when you're starting, you probably don't have the confidence. Like I didn't. I didn't have the confidence to be anything, but of like, yeah, tell me what you want and I'll go make it for you. Like I had confidence in my ability to give them what they were asking for. I didn't have confidence in my ability to guide them or give them strategy, right? So that's where I hung out until I realized like, okay, I'm ready for more. I know I can serve clients better than when I'm currently serving them. And I wanted more. Like I think the three different options that Andrea was talking about, like there isn't anything wrong with any of them. I think it's just like, what do you prefer? How do you want your business to look? And I wanted to branch out more, make it more of like, well, I was starting to see a theme of like, oh, well this person came back to me again because I actually dove in a little bit more into like helping them with the strategy versus like handing something over and saying, see ya, good luck. And I was seeing that and I wanted more of that. That was what was giving me fulfillment. And then that landed into our third category. I would also say like currently in our agency, we do operate in that third like whole creation space, but also there's only so much time in the day, right? There's only so much room for clients like that. So we are actually starting to see like, well, maybe we need to bring in a few more clients that are more of that like middle ground. Let's do a big project with them and train their team on how to take over it. And if they come back for another big project, great. But more of a insert ourselves and then send them off and then kind of be there in the background if they need help, but we're not so active in their business. So I think like Andy was at you who said like kind of you could have a little bit of all. I would say we've left category one, right? We're not order takers anymore, but we live in the third group and then we kind of are bringing ourselves a little bit more into that second group for the sake of like client flow and cash flow, right? It's really good insight to get that from you guys because I think for our, you know, client sat in the office right now thinking, is this the right step for me? You might just think that an agency is an agency and you've just got to go out there and do everything for everybody or just do one thing. You've really given that spectrum of opportunity, I think where somebody looking at this is now is right. I'm going to go and just be the order taker. And then I know that there's a progression route for me because on our little slide that we had running a second ago and I know Andy and Carlos jumping as well. But there's a question, the second question, which is pretty much why is this something you might want to do, right? And you're not just in this for the money. To be fair, there might be easier ways to go out there and make money, who knows, right? But you're not just in this for the money. That's like what I'm kind of gathering. What's thoughts on this from the room, I guess? Yeah, so I think, yeah, that's a really good question because why would you want to start an agency, right? It could be one person or it could be five people or 20 people, but I think the main reason that people start an agency is because first of all, they have a passion for helping people. They love this funnel stuff and they're a little geeky and they just love this kind of stuff, right? Just like us. So that's one. But also because it's a very lucrative business. If you get into offering services for people, this could be very lucrative. You can work with many, many different companies and it's scalable. It's a scalable business. For example, if you went to go, if you started, if you opened a restaurant, right? Physical restaurant, there's a lot of limitations as to how much you can scale. It's hard to scale, but something like an agency, let's say that you're working on a project and then you got a little bit of time, so you take on another project, but it starts to get a little bit complicated. You can always hire somebody else out to help you with that, make sure that you manage the project well and then that's how you can actually scale your business. So that's what kind of gets me excited about an agency is that there's lots of room for growth and you can move it, you can make it smaller, you can put it on the back burner in case you decide to go on vacation into Haiti or something like that, but that's what's exciting for me is would you say that that's one of the benefits? I'll say something to that. One of the main reasons that Andrea and I partnered together to create the agency that we have now is to play to each other's strengths. We've recognized in each other, like, oh, you're really good at that. I could learn full transparency. Andrea's amazing at customer experience, customer journeys, and I was mentoring under her for like, what, like almost two years, Andrea, before we even thought of the idea of like we should just join together. But even though I was learning from her, I was never gonna be able to perform that skill to the level that she does. And then I'm sure that she saw something in me of why would she partner with me, right? And so, but also we're not the only two in our agency. We have a designer, we have, you guys know Dan Havy and other ambassador. We decided to create the agency that we have because we recognized that there's other people that have amazing skills and talents and we wanted to bring them together. We wanted, like, I was doing full-time funnel design in my agency before we formed an agency and now we have a full-time, like, she's amazing. Nicole on our team who does full-time, like that's all she does is design. And so I've stepped away from the design and do more of the strategy, which is something that I really shied away from when I was first starting. And so it's fun to see like how you progress and what your strengths actually are and then go out and find people that compliment those strengths, whether you actually form a full-blown agency and business together with them or like you partner with them on some projects, right? It can be whatever you want it to be. Yeah, yeah, I would definitely say first of all, Susan's incredible at execution and that was like such a great partnership plus she is a master at strategy, which I really appreciated the funnel strategy part. So, and I would say Andy and Susan, you both I think exemplified what, if you are interested in agency, I think there are two things that all, either to be agencies or current agency, people have in common. The first one is they really care deeply about the serving and fulfillment part of the equation. They are less consumed and interested necessarily in the acquisition side, and they seem to be much more interested in the fulfillment and nurture part of the marketing equation. And then I think the second thing is that they have this really deep technical skill set in the funnel world where it's like, I don't wanna just know this for the purpose of going live and launching. I wanna know this for like every possible condition, every possible option. How does this play out? I mean, there's a deep technical expertise in the thing that you serve in. And I would say that those two things are by far the same for every agency owner that I talk to, they have those two things in space. Yeah, yeah, and I want to add something. We are like, for example, your agency guys is like a full blown complete agency from A to C, from idea to conception, launch and beyond. And there might be people here like listening that, oh, but I don't know how to create a, I know some customer experience, a customer journey. Oh, but I don't know how to do email marketing, right? But I know how to drive insane amounts of traffic, really qualified traffic, right? And an agency, like you said, Andrea, in the first place, it can be like a one specific agency for traffic or for email marketing or for something like, I would create your best headline. And I'm the headline creator agency, right? And I can bet my life on that headline, right? So it can be like in something as small as that, like honestly, I've seen people like specialize in stuff like that, right? Throughout the years. But yeah, it's really important that you have a deep, deep, deep knowledge of what you're doing. So for the originals, I'm not the de-season learners that we have, the step from why to build an agency is, well, you are proficient and you are basically an expert in what you will offer. So that's the first part, right? Because every now and then there comes a build your agency course that will sell you for, I don't know, 500, 2000, 5000 on how to build your agency. But if you haven't even created or gathered that expertise in the first place, you will hit the wall hard. Like that's a reality. Like before choosing to launch your agency, you have to be very, very deep in your knowledge and expertise. So that's something that I wanted to touch on here. Yeah, and I think Carlos, that kind of leads perfectly into the next question because the next question is, I'm usually bringing up here, what makes a good agency and what makes a great agency? So yeah, you definitely have to have the skill set. You have to have successful customers, right? There's a lot of people that you've actually helped. That's a good place to start. But yeah, Susan or Andrea, can you tell us what was your goals when you were making your agency? What did you, what are the standards that you try to uphold in your own agency? This is a good question. So I think first and foremost, we are oftentimes talking about right fit clients. And the more that we can hone in on the right fit clients, both ways, right? I think the better and better our agency gets. Because I think because we are a co-creation, that isn't for everyone, right? So on the part, on the client side too, right? Sometimes clients do just wanna like, I just wanna tell you what to do and give me what I want, right? And like, if that's what you need, that's awesome, find an order taker agency, but we're not a good fit, you know? Likewise, we really hone in on kind of coaches, course creator, SaaS owners, and even in that, it's people who are usually very deep experts, they've usually been training people, right? So like, we have, through years, really refined and got a lot better at, these are the type of clients that are good fits for us. And it's not a personal good or bad or right or wrong, it's just like, these are the right fit clients. And I think the more that you can just, every single time that you're working with someone, reflect on like, do you enjoy working with this person? If the answer is no, stop saying yes to that person to make room for the people you enjoy working with. And do you enjoy the nature of the work? So a lot of times, you know, there's a lot of tedious work, oftentimes in agency, because that's why they're hiring you, right? Like they don't wanna do that part. And so I think it's just constantly tuning in to like, okay, do I wanna do this work? Does my eight, do I wanna keep doing this as an agency? Can we do it with integrity? And if I don't like doing it, do I wanna hire somebody in my company to do it, right? But it's just like that continual refinement of, do I like this work and do I like working with this person? And just continuing to try to, the next client, get a little bit better at that. The next client, get a little bit better at that. That to me is the difference of what makes a really great, a great agency. And then the second ingredient I would say is that as an agency, start to get really good, again, with each client at a time, with setting expectations. And I know that sounds so simple, but I think my favorite presentation ever was Frank Kern on Funnel Hacking Stage Live one year. He said something like this. He's like, okay, here's how it's gonna go. We're gonna have a project kickoff and you're gonna love me and we're gonna be so excited. And then about one month later, everything is just, I'm gonna be asking for a lot of stuff that you don't necessarily have and we're not gonna be making progress fast enough and you're not gonna be happy and you're gonna wanna end the contract and I'm gonna tell you no and we might get into a fight, but then one month later, we're gonna launch and we're gonna be excited again and we're gonna start getting traffic and things are gonna start flowing and then we're gonna hit a plateau and you're gonna lose some money and you're gonna hate me again, right? And like, this is how it's going to go. Inevitably, there is always gonna be ups and downs that is never like one big party, right? And I think the more that you can get really, really clear at the very beginning of that project, kickoff with your clients to be like, okay, here's how it's gonna go. We're gonna love each other. Then we're gonna hit this wall and it's gonna be really hard but we're gonna get through it together and then maybe there's like a bailout plan if you wanna bail, right? But you have it, you know the customer journey that you're gonna take somebody on and you're really transparent about that upfront. I think that's also something that makes a really great agency. So then it's when you do get to those hard spots, my funnel's not converting, the designs aren't what you want them to be. You're not communicating with me enough. I thought I said this and you did this, right? It happens all the time. But you have a way and just is really upfront conversation of like, this is gonna happen and we should expect that to happen because we're two humans with two different brains and two different ideas. And so then how are we gonna navigate that? So that would be my get really clear on who you wanna work with and the type of work you wanna do and be really, really clear upfront. Don't oversell it and make sure they know like what they're in for when they're working with you. And I think that's what continues to help you be great as an agency. Whoa, that's very valuable insight. And I guess that is the good to great that can only come from experience. And I know Susan, you've probably got some stuff you wanna add to that, right? Because it is, in my mind, separating the two. But for our clients sat here, they're like, actually, that's been so helpful. What's your thoughts on that, Susan? What you can add to what Andrea just laid out? Yeah, no, it's actually funny. Andrea's first point was the exact same thing I was gonna say of like, a great agency is knows who's right for them. And they're gonna say no to the ones that are not right. Whether it's the client's not ready. I think that's the big one, right? When we're starting out as a funnel builder and you're just like, I need most of the time we're like, we just need money, I need cash flow, I gotta pay my bills and you'll say yes to everybody. And whether they're the right type of client for you or if that client's even ready for your service, don't say yes if it's not a good fit because it ends up being more of a headache than it's worth. Yeah, it is exactly what Andrea said. She was right on with all of it. I think it's, sorry, Danny. I think it's pretty, everybody that has read the books, Russell Brunson's books and has kind of gone through the journey of creating a funnel. I think we all know that that's the typical journey, right? You start, you're really excited and then you hit a wall because there's gonna be things that you need to test. There's things that you need to adjust, strategies that you might need to change because there's not just one cookie cutter way to do everything, right? I wish, but no, there's like 20 cookie cutter ways. So that's, I think it's really important that you are upfront with customers and that they understand too. I think that's super, super valuable. Now, so how do you, once you, you mentioned like contracts Andrea and you mentioned agreements, how do you get started? Is that something that you need to develop to have ready when you're beginning a project with a customer? Well, this is gonna be a shameless plug, but if you're going to Funnel Hacking Live, there is a free proposal template for you inside of the Funnel Hacking Live membership area on just that. So yes, I would say there is a, we put all of our proposals into a funnel because we want the dollars going through a funnel. And so yes, we have a map it out our framework. It's the same framework we take people through every single time we just adjust to that funnel and then have them go to a checkout page and then do a thank you page to schedule a kickoff call. So we have that, we are not super formal. I know a lot of agencies, they prefer like a very formal, legal agreement that people sign. We choose not to be that formal because we don't, that's not how we wanna set up our, the relationship. Instead, we just, we have the proposal on our first page and by, you know, checking the box, they agree to the proposal and then they move on to make the payment. So, but I would say, you know, again, choose your preferred way of formality. And if you want a more formal, you know, contract, make that, but then put it in a funnel and have them agree to it through a funnel. It would be my, how I would do that. Yep. I would say, Andrea mentioned something that's key that I don't want anyone to overlook in that our proposals to our clients, no matter if they are coming to us for an opt-in funnel or for a membership build or a webinar funnel, like it doesn't matter what they're coming to us for. We walk them through the same process every single time starting from the onboarding call to the last, like the last thing in the project. I mean, obviously the build and the discussions are going to be different between each of those, but we have a set process that we walk them through. So our proposals are generally all the same. We're just changing out like opt-in funnel for webinar funnel and maybe some tech stuff, right? Their tech stack, depending on what they already have or what their goals are, right? That was like a huge thing for me to learn is like, oh, if I want to be faster at turnaround times, and I don't want this to feel like I'm reinventing the wheel every time I get a new client, I need to have a cookie cutter process that I walk everybody through. Makes such a huge difference. Yeah. On that same note too, it's your payment, right? So this was actually one of the hardest things for me to do or to understand what my payment. So when I first got into the space, Susan and I both learned from Catherine Jones and in that the recommendation is do half upfront and then half when you're done. It was great when I started, but it outlived itself really quick because when you're first starting, you're probably pretty bad at scope management. It's like the hardest thing of this equation, right? It's really hard, especially when you're eager and you're hungry and you want to get paid, just say no. And so the scope of your projects are gonna get bigger. They just inevitably always do. And so tying that second payment to the finish of a project is like death, right? Cause then it's like, I have no predictability because I don't yet know quite how to say no and how to scope this project. So then that final payment just never happens and it's really hard. So one of the best decisions I made really early on is I was very clear that my payment schedule and my project schedule were divorced. I would not tie my payment schedule to my project schedule. And so then it also freed us up to say, okay, you're first month payment. And it also is helpful, especially cause we're working with entrepreneurs where cash flow is usually hard for everyone. And so if you have a six K project and you break that up over three months, it's two K per month. So it doesn't matter if the project gets done in two months or three months or four months, you know what your payment schedule is going to be. And that is a non-negotiable. So it is a, we're paying initial upfront and then we're gonna get on the payment plan. That's just gonna chuck along. So we all know what to expect. And the project plan, we're gonna do our best to manage it and get it done in the timeline that we want. But there's a little bit of flexibility for life cause it happens and we can manage that, right? But that was like early on separating your payment structure from your project structure was super, super helpful for me. And then we have played around with rev share. I know that's a popular thing. I do not recommend that when you're first getting started. A, because you probably don't quite know how to navigate it. And it's a very difficult thing to navigate. And B, because the people that you are attracting probably can't fulfill yet on that rev share. So it's not smart to get into those arrangements when you first start. I would say, you know, wait until you're way further down the line. And it's kind of like a gamble almost that you can afford that gamble to make nothing or to make a lot. Would be my general recommendation on that payment structure part. So by rev share, you mean revenue sharing where you actually make a deal and okay, when we launch you give me 20% or 50%. Okay. Yep, exactly. And even if you do like a payment upfront. So the structures that we've tried is payment upfront and then a rev share on the end. Even that is it's a gamble and it's hard. It's a lot harder than just a set payment structure. And so I would say definitely wait until you have a little bit more time in the seat before you start to get into those arrangements. Definitely very good advice. And I think our clients sat here now thinking, well, look, I definitely need to go down this route. I need to probably start at the sort of earlier end of the spectrum. And I realized that customer expectation and my expectations need to kind of be in alignment. And I don't want to be going in there with some big dream to help somebody but not get paid for it. So I'm going to make sure that I have an agreement in place and that I bill the card and every month or every six weeks, whatever it is. We stick to that. We don't move away from that. And now I'm feeling a little bit more relief because I know kind of where to position myself with help from our experts. So I can be an excellent agency with excellent reviews, an excellent feedback and excellent clients because as good as you are in your skills and your agency, it doesn't take too many of the clients that you probably say no to to where you're down and the things are pinging off all hours and there's no expectation set. And before you know it, you've built 100 grams worth of work for a few hundred dollars and you're thinking, why did I start in the first place? So this realization is happening right now. And Arsuz and he's watching the office is thinking, I'm glad I booked this consultation and folks watching this, you've got all this advice literally for turning up free in the group. And I can't thank everybody enough for bringing so much value to the show this morning, this afternoon. Where does ClickFunnels come into the equation? Because obviously... So excited about this question. Sorry, did you finish your thought? Because it's such an exciting question. Because you know, you can be an agency like Andy said and Carlos said you can be an agency in lots and lots of different things, but there's something special about helping folks with ClickFunnels, right? So I know that from experience and I know we're all kind of biased, but where does ClickFunnels come into this agency equation? Everything. And here's why. Okay, so I'm going to start with the story and it's going to seem like it has no relevance whatsoever, but just go with me. So I was back in Ames, Iowa. It was, I think the year was like 2013 anyway. And I really, I have a dream of being this like, this super awesome, like bicycle, bike biker lady who's like on her Bonneville, you know, and like driving across Ireland. Like this is my dream, right? Like this is my bucket list. I'm like, I got to start somewhere and I don't have a motorcycle license. So I'm going to go in and I'm going to buy a Buddy 125. And so Buddy 125 is a super little scooter. It's like, if you're familiar with Vespa, whatever. Okay. So, but they sell them at the Harley places. Okay. So I walk into the Harley place, right? And this big burly Harley guy comes up and he's like, Hey, what are you here for? And I'm like, I'm here to buy a scooter. He's like, Oh, we keep them out back. I'm like, okay. I was like, but wait, before I buy a scooter, can I do the thing? And I, it's going to harden the zoom, but like the Harley drivers, right? They do the like, they do the signal to one another on the road, right? Whenever they pass each other. And it's like this like known signal. And it's this known understanding of like, I see you, you're a fellow biker and you're an awesome, right? So, and he like leans in, he's like, you can do it. I'm not so sure they'll respond, but you can do it. I'm like, okay, you're telling me I have a chance. So I get out on the road and I get on my scooter and I'm going down the road. And then it was like this miraculous thing, this big Harley starts coming my way from the other side of the road. I'm like, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do the thing. And I put my signal down and he did it back. And it was amazing. And in that moment, I'm like, I don't care that I'm only on 125 ccs. I am the coolest thing on the road right now. And I am a biker. Okay. So what ClickFunnels does for us is it gives us this shared language where like you can just put a single signal down and all of a sudden we know we see each other and we're a part of this world and we're cool together. So ClickFunnels like when you form an agency with a ClickFunnels community and right, yes, exactly. We have a narrative. We have a conversation. We already know like it doesn't take more than anything like a single signal or use of a single word. And all of a sudden you're in, you might not have a lot of skillset. You might be still riding on 125 ccs like right. Like you have no idea what to do with a real bike, but you're in because you have this common language and this narrative that you can use to start to go into bigger bikes and to start to actually work with the people who are in that community. ClickFunnels gives us that just out of the box, just being a part of the community. And it's amazing. Like there is no way I would have the agency I have. If I didn't have it all wrapped up in this really pretty common language that all of us share in this common vision of like, I see you, you're an entrepreneur who's trying to change the world and I'm right there with you. Let's go. Right. And it's just like this immediate bond that helps so much to then, okay, now let's get on with the work of it instead of me trying to convince you of the work that's needed. So I think ClickFunnels is everything when you're starting an agency. And if you're not in there and using it, then good luck in Godspeed because I don't know how you would get into a bigger bike without it. That's, that's an amazing story and an amazing insight. And I think from all of us being our all experience in the community, you only need to look at Funnelike in live, right? Susan and I know from the stuff you're doing on FunnelikeTV, you've had the pleasure of interviewing all of these amazing speakers and, and building this up. And, and you can check it out in the feature section of the group, right? If you don't know what we're talking about, but looking at the community at large, it kind of makes sense to build your agency on something that's got all the wheels, it's got all the lights, it's got all the features and a lot more to come. Watch, watch your thoughts on what Andrea said in the, in the community at large, I guess, because it is definitely something else. Yeah. Well, I'm glad that you brought up community, right? Like I think that that is the driving force behind why we all are Funnel hackers, right? Why we are fanatics of ClickFunnels. It is a software. It is a great software. I mean, even classic is the leading Funnelbuilder, right? Then that's like was built 10 years ago or something like that, right? And it's still considered, I mean, now we have 2.0, but for so long, right? The software is awesome, but it's the community. It's the leaders. It's, it's the knowledge that we can get from this community that I like, I don't know like what Andrea is that I don't know where, why you would go anywhere else and I don't know where you would go that can offer the same stack of stuff, the same community, the same knowledge, the same frameworks, the same connections. This is just for me, it's a no-brainer. I don't know. I, and that's just me. Again, I guess we're all biased, but we've built our entire agency around ClickFunnels. I know starting out as a, as a Funnelbuilder and doing it on my own, I dabbled in like people would come to me and they're like, why don't use ClickFunnels? They use this other thing. And I'd be like, okay, like I don't want to make them switch. Like, right? They're like, I already have everything established over here. I just need help over here and I'd go and do it. And I go, this is the worst thing ever. I don't want to do this ever again. So like slowly checked off all of this other software that I just refused to touch. Right? Um, but aside from that, it's just in our agency, we've not only built, we not only use ClickFunnels, we have adopted all of the strategy, all of like, we have a book club where we are on book three of the trilogy of Russell Branson Secret's trilogy. We, we follow LynchPan, like all of our projects, whether they're one on one or um, just teaching through a video training that we're doing, it all comes back to these frameworks because you're a Funnelbuilder. Like why go and reinvent the wheel? Why go and create new frameworks if you don't have to? When Russell's already done all of the heavy lifting and all of the work to create these that clearly work because people are, are making money with them all day, every day. And um, we see the best in the business using these frameworks. So just adopt them, learn them, dive into them, like learn them so much. Like, like, like, what's the thing? Like, you know, like the back of your hand, right? Um, and I think I'm glad that Funnelhacking Live this year is, I know we're not here to promote that, but it's on our brains, right? Um, it's all about LynchPan. So like get the book, right? Like dive into as much as you can. Um, that is why we choose ClickFunnels in this community is because everything that that means one thing that we like to talk about also, which I don't think that Andrea just said, um, we have ClickFunnels 2.0, right? The software. Everyone thinks of 2.0 as the software, like the next version. But we're starting to talk about it as like we have ClickFunnels 2.0 is not just the software, but like we have new frameworks. We have new things that are happening. We have iterations of old frameworks. Like it's not just 2.0 of software. It's like 2.0 of the movement. And it's an exciting ride. And I don't, I wouldn't rather be anywhere else. Like I'm here for it. Yeah. I think, uh, what, one of the key words that you said, Susan, is frameworks. And Andrea, I love the analogy about, uh, you know, Harley and the community and stuff like that. Um, by the way, there's also a community with Jeep Wranglers. So we have, you know, we have a little salute too that we, uh, we say to each other when we pass somebody in a Jeep Wrangler. What is it, Andy? What is it? I'm so curious. Uh, usually it's just a wave. It's usually just a wave or a piece. Yeah. The first time that I bought a Jeep Wrangler, I immediately noticed people waving at me and like people inviting me to their Jeep club and things like that. And we have that with ClickFunnels because there are so many things. First of all, we have like the blueprints is the secrets trilogy, right? Everybody knows the terminology and the words and the strategies. And Carlos has the, uh, the books right behind them there. Um, we have Funnel Hacking Live coming up. We have, there's so many resources. And you know what blows me away is that there's tons of people as, you know, Carlos and I and Danny, we, we work behind the scenes, managing the Facebook group and encouraging people to, to participate in the ClickFunnels Facebook group. And there's a lot of people that don't have ClickFunnels, but they're there for the infrastructure. They're there because of the resources. They're there because there's excitement behind it. And there's, there's so many opportunities just in the group. So yeah, I love the, the, what you talk about as far as like the framework and the community. Well, and we don't have to create the desire, right? The best marketer in the entire world is creating the desire. So it's like, it's so easy cause people already know they want it. You know what I mean? Like we don't have to, we, we never take clients that we have to convince of ClickFunnels, right? Like that's not who we work with. But, and it's never been a problem. We always take people that are like, I heard about this. How do I do it? And I'm like, oh, I'm so happy you asked. Or like, okay, Russell needs us to do this, but I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm so happy you're here. We could totally help you with that, but we don't ever have to convince them that it's the right way. You know, it's like all this desire is just right there at your door and it's amazing. It's, it's totally awesome. We've got a client in our office now jumping around for joy, knowing that they've made the right decision. And all of this, what we've covered in this, in this hour, cause we've been on for like an hour and it's like so much gold in terms of information. And our client is ready now to move on to this next stage and start thinking about, well, how am I going to, you know, position this thing using ClickFunnels because it kind of makes sense to use ClickFunnels to sell funnels that you're building in ClickFunnels, right? So you're like, whoa, and I've already got the experience and I knew this was my calling and I know how to get the clients and build the contracts and set expectations and be a great agency. The people watching, let us know in the comments if this has been a great help because it certainly helped me and we've had some amazing discussion and we've had so many, I think amazing points because this is based on experience, right? And I guess, like we said at the beginning, you get the experience. If you've not got that experience, you've not got that expertise, maybe the agency is a little bit further down the line. But when you know that the time is right and you're ready to make that transition, you've got the community, you've got the education, you've got our amazing ambassadors, you've got things like this in your corner wanting to help you succeed. It's the time is possibly right and the time is definitely right for our client. I think it's, and Mary's in the chat right now saying this is great and hopefully we're helping people to take that next step in their business, right? So I can't thank you guys enough. And the where are we going on the next show, which is going to be coming up tomorrow. Can I say one thing super quick? I know you guys are trying to wrap up just super, super quick. I will say that one of the biggest objections that people have when they first are coming in to be an agency is they think that there's not enough work to go around. And I would say that there is more work than there is. There is more demand than there is supply and that's going to be there for a long time. So whatever your expertise is, wherever you're thinking about doing agency, there is tons of work for you. So I would just say that one thing if you're considering it. Sorry. OK, go ahead. Amazing. This is our agency right now. We're starting agencies. Kevin says, thank you guys. And Mary saying this is great. And I think we've had folks watching from the beginning taking notes because that has been like a masterclass in how to get it right from an early point. Because I think Russell Brunson often says, don't be the person with the arrows in your back, right? And you've gone out there and you've sort of like learned from mistakes. This is learning from experience and we can't thank you enough. Andy. Yeah, yeah. So great to see Michael and Loris in the comments. So thank you so much. They've been following us since the beginning. And yeah, so what we're going to do tomorrow is we are going to continue the journey. I hope you can make it. Tomorrow at the same time, so just jump into the Facebook group. And what we're going to do is we're going to actually start taking the first initial steps inside ClickFunnels 2.0. I think what we're going to do is we're going to build a funnel, right? We're going to talk about what kind of funnel might be best for for Susan or Avatar. Not the Susan that's our guest right now. But with the with the with the expertise and with the tips that Andrea and Susan have given us today, this our avatar, which happens to have the same name as Susan. She's going to actually start taking some steps before after we talk about it, we're going to discuss a little bit about what kind of funnel might be best, what kind of structure, what kind of a strategy she should get started with initially. And by the way, if you were with us a couple of weeks ago, we are going to we're going to change it up. We're going to be talking a little bit differently. So it's not a repeat of what we did a couple of weeks ago. I'm really excited and I do want to say thank you to everybody that joined us today. And yeah, so we'll be back tomorrow. Very, very good stuff. And just like I said, big thanks to everybody who's who's joining us on this call. Everybody's joining us on the live. Take those notes and start putting them into into your plan. Join us tomorrow. Hopefully you guys will be back throughout the week, perhaps as well. And we do. We really appreciate your time and all that knowledge that you've shared. Helping people get started on this journey. Big thanks, everybody. You're amazing. We'll see everybody on the next video. Bye bye. Take care. Bye bye.
