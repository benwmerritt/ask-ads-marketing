## Transcript
Alright, we are back again. Great to see everybody and I'm so excited about today. So we are talking today and for the rest of this week, this is part of the Build a Business series. And what we do in this series is we take a fake entrepreneur, okay, we invented a entrepreneur or an avatar, her name is Susan. And Susan came to us and said, hey, how do I get started on ClickFunnels? So a few weeks ago, what we did is Susan actually started her first coaching business where she offers services to photographers because that's her hobby. She wanted to start with a specific niche and picked a niche that way. Then the next week, what we did is we wanted to take Susan's business further. And what we did is we talked about how to build a marketing agency on ClickFunnels 2.0, pretty much from scratch. Of course, we don't go into all of the details. We're not going to create all of the thumbnail images and do all of that. But what we did is we went into the foundation and the basic steps of how to create a marketing agency. And this week, yesterday, we started another business with our same avatar, her name is Susan. And this time, we are actually implementing the affiliate program with ClickFunnels into her business. So if you want to take a look at yesterday's training, it is in the group. You can just go up to the top. It's in the featured section. And you can watch any of our training from before. But I'm really excited because we have Turner Leslie with us. We have Tyler Wicks with us, who are some of the guides, I guess, that help people through the affiliate program in ClickFunnels. Danny Walsh is also with me as usual. And we also have Ben Janky. So Ben is going to be talking a little bit about how ShareFunnels work and why ShareFunnels are so effective at helping you get affiliates. So Danny, what else are we going to talk about today? So as always, it's a pleasure to have everybody on. We may have a few of our ambassadors joining us as well, who are also actively promoting ClickFunnels. And just by the amount of folks that we've got on the screen right now, you've got some support. If you're watching this, there's support, right? We want you to be successful as affiliates, we want you to be successful in your business. We want Susan to be effective in our business. And today we want to talk about two of them. The guys in the North, Turner and Tyler and Ben. We've also, like I said, we've got ambassadors on. Some James has just joined us as well. But we want to talk about the offers that we can promote as ClickFunnels affiliates. And we want to get into this ShareFunnels concept because when you described this yesterday, Turner to Susan, she kind of fell off the chair, right? She's like, whoa, you can do that. And Turner's like, don't worry, we've got the perfect guy for the job. He's going to drop in here tomorrow and we're hopefully going to teach Susan and everybody watching exactly how this thing works. We want to look at the offers, we want to look at the ShareFunnels. We could take this down so everybody can kind of see us. If anybody else joins us, feel free. We can ask questions and we can share our experiences. But Turner, I think we hand it over to you, buddy, and to kind of set the scene a little bit and then maybe bring in Tyler and Ben and we'll get into this stuff. Amazing. Yeah, that sounds great. We'll go ahead and share the screen there, Danny, if that's good. Perfect. Thank you so much. There you go. Okay. So as we talked about Susan's journey into looking into affiliate marketing, especially with ClickFunnels, talked about yesterday how she can go ahead and apply. We've then since got her applied and then she's now got her affiliate account. She's hopped on the affiliate Quick Start call with Tyler and I. We've got her in. She knows that Tyler and I are in her back pocket, like helping her out with whatever she needs, right? We're her guys. Affiliate managers, right? So she knows that she's ready to go. And on that Quick Start call, we told her about the different links that she can promote as a ClickFunnels affiliate. Now I'm going to go over these links that she can promote that everyone can promote, right? And then Ben's going to share some amazing stuff about ShareFunnels. But I just want to cover these real quick. If you are brand new to the affiliate space or brand new to being a ClickFunnels affiliate, let me know in the chat. Just give me a hashtag new if you're brand new. Also let me know if you've been around a while and that you've maybe promoted yourself. Now if you just promote and ClickFunnels classic, all these links are going to be 100% different. You've never seen these before, right? And if you're just starting in ClickFunnels 2.0, we also have some new links. So this is going to be pretty interesting for everybody as we look into it. Now we've got a bunch of links in here. I'm not going to confuse you. I just want to show you very briefly of what we have in here. As I see some hashtag news coming through that, that's great. All right. So we have the Your First Funnel Challenge. Let me know if you've done the Your First Funnel Challenge in the comments. Give me a hashtag YFFC for Your First Funnel Challenge. Give me a YFFC in the comments if you've done this before. It's absolutely amazing. I've never heard anyone say anything bad about the Your First Funnel Challenge. It's fun and you learn a ton. Now everyone loves your First Funnel Challenge, so why don't you promote it? Why not? It's amazing, right? Now this is a five day challenge that Russell came out with right as we came out with ClickFunnels 2.0. And the whole purpose of this was to help everyone to start building a funnel, kind of learning about ClickFunnels 2.0, coming into our ClickFunnels world, whether this is your first funnel, your 35th, or your 128th. I don't care. This is great for everybody. And the Your First Funnel Challenge does start every Monday. So if you're promoting to them, they can't do it this Monday. Get them in the next, right? With this, Russell did partner up with Damon John. Let me know if you know who Damon John is. Give me a hashtag DJ. You should know him from Shark Tank. You may not know this, but once he gets people on Shark Tank, he then builds them a funnel or his team builds them a funnel. It helps them to be successful on the online space, right? So it's super cool. The Your First Funnel Challenge does come with a 30 day free trial of ClickFunnels 2.0. It also does come with the box. Tyler, you got the box with you? You know it. Tyler loves the show as well. All unfolded, but it's a nice box. The cool thing is it's got some motivation in it for you. Your future 2.0 Club Award. Whoa. Or the people that you sign up are going to get the classic funnel hacker t-shirt. It's something that Turner knows I always love to talk about. I'll be right back. It is the books that come with it. This is one of my favorite ClickFunnels books ever. Just 30 seconds to feel on it is it's got basically somebody from actually a couple people really from about any niche you can think of. We have a lot of people that are like, hey, what would you do if you had to start over from scratch and rebuild your business with no lists, no following, no name? What would your 30 day game plan be? And they literally break it down day by day by day. It's pretty sweet. So no matter what business you have, whether it's brick and mortar or any of the online variants, like there's going to be some good information for you. And that's also a good thing to know. Yeah. If you're promoting as an affiliate, if you're promoting the brick and mortar business owners or whatever that may be, know that that book has a game plan in it to help them get launched online. So it's pretty cool. And then the funnel hacker cookbook is in there too. It's a great book. It has like breakdowns of kind of step by step of any funnel you could ever imagine and kind of how to set it up and the upsells and downsells and all the things. So it's a really good value. Yes. Now this is basically our MFG. We have a lot of people that are like, oh, I'm going to be like, oh, I'm going to be lucky with this, right? Everything in the box is a lot of stuff that our ClickFunnels community loves, right? We're all wearing ClickFunnels shirts right now, right? Got the hats on all the good stuff. We love this stuff. It's basically our movement, right? Our MFG is helping out with movement, getting people into ClickFunnels, using our software and so much more. Now also this comes with some amazing coaches. I've met almost all these people, but Damon John, absolutely amazing going through the five day challenge here and just getting right into ClickFunnels and so much more. Now what does this mean for you? What does this mean for Susan and the other affiliates out there? Well, whoever you're promoting to, they're going to be taken care of, right? They're going to get a 30 day free trial of the ClickFunnels 2.0. They're going to get a box. They're going to get a t-shirt that they could wear, right? It's all about the movement. They can read all the books. They can put the books on the shelf afterwards. Everyone's going to see it. They're going to start building a funnel in their account. They're going to get their domain going, all that good stuff. They're going to learn the ins and outs of all that. So they're really stepping into this movement through the year first funnel challenge and they're going to want to stick, right? They're already taking a few steps and taking the next bit here. So this is really cool. This is a no brainer for any affiliate marketer or any business owner or any entrepreneur or anyone really. So this is extremely cool. Russell Brunson also does make a really amazing offer on day four of the first funnel challenge. Let me know if you took advantage of the offer. It's really cool. It's called the Funnel Builder Secrets Offer. It is a year of ClickFunnels 2.0 and a year of ClickFunnels Classic for $2,000 bucks, $19.97. So you actually do have the link to the offer as well. Susan's got it in her account, right? Everyone's got it here. It's the Funnel Builder Secrets Offer, a year long of ClickFunnels Classic and a year long of ClickFunnels 2.0. Now Russell Brunson does teach urgency and scarcity all the time. So this offer does go away after 10 days. It is sticky cookie to what you have there, right? So you just saw that first page come and go because I've already seen it, right? 10 days have already happened. And then it does go to the next offer, which is $2,500 bucks for a year long of ClickFunnels Classic and a year long of ClickFunnels 2.0. So you want to make sure that as you're promoting this, hey, take that offer as soon as possible. My internet is super slow. Okay, there we go. So you'll see that that offer is still here. And remember, as an affiliate, you make 30% off of every commission that happens. So if Susan goes ahead and promotes this for that $19.97, she's going to make $600 USD off of that commission. If she makes four of those Funnel Builder Secret sales each month, that's a good chunk of money, right? And then as we talked about, after that urgency and scarcity, it does go up to $2,500, but still that's a really good commission for you as well and it's still lower. So if you paid for ClickFunnels 2.0 monthly, it's going to add up more than that $19.97. So this is a really good deal to pay for that full year. I don't know about you, but I'm not huge into monthly payments, so I just like to go ahead and pay it forward. Pay it right there. So let me know if that all makes sense. I know I'm talking about two different things here, but just to keep you on the right path, your first funnel challenge is a 30 day free trial of the ClickFunnels 2.0 and coaching. And then again, this is the year long offer. Now, if they do jump into your first funnel challenge and then sign up for Funnel Builder Secrets, they are sticky cookie, still get the commission on that sale. How we do it? Am I in my long wanted here, Danny? We're good? Doing good. Susan's just like in my ear right now, going, what on earth is a sticky cookie? Just for folks who are watching. Yes, for sure. Now, as we talked about yesterday, a lot of our newer affiliates that come in will go ahead and start promoting your first funnel challenge because it's great. Everyone can do it. And that sticky cookie, right? They're sticky for that 45 days, sticky cookie to you. Don't worry about the whole tech stuff. Cookies are great. So yeah, if you have any questions on that, we've got you back. And then next up, we do have the Cook Funnels 2.0 trial, just a two week free trial, the Cook Funnels 2.0. If you want to just get someone to write in, okay? And that is just cookfunnels.com slash and then your affiliate link following that. We got the your first funnel, MIFKI. This is just getting people right into the 30 day free trial, the Cook Funnels 2.0. It does get them the box as well, the MIFKI that we talked about in Lynch Bin, all the good stuff basically for free. Most incredible free gift ever. All right. I'm just going to talk about the next two really quick because I want to get to share funnels. Ben's going to talk about the money stuff, right? The really good stuff as we continue. But this is amazing. So if you've gotten funnels and templates, let me know. Give me an FT in the chat there. This is extremely cool. So with what we've done here is we want to see help everyone to see the amazingness of Cook Funnels 2.0. And we've had our amazing designers build some crazy cool templates within Cook Funnels 2.0. And we're giving away these templates for a dollar. And there's like almost 20 free templates. You just have to pay a dollar and you get right in. And this is awesome. So you'll see here when someone comes to the page here in the funnel, they're going to see, okay, this is amazing. Okay, we've got Click Funnels, Canva Photoshop, InDesign. Awesome. We'll work with all those. And they'll come down a little bit further. Okay. I trust all these guys. Awesome. Credibility. And then they see they can go ahead and click on any of these templates right here. And if they go ahead and pay the dollar, let's see, just a dollar, they go ahead and put in Funnels 23, a dollar. Then they get all these templates. And these are amazing. If you were to build all of these within Cook Funnels 2.0, it'd be pretty expensive, right? Because they're very well done. They're really, really good. And they're compatible with Cook Funnels Classic as well as Cook Funnels 2.0. So it's a no brainer. Now, what does this mean for the affiliate? So as the person you're promoting to goes ahead and gets this, they're going to then be upsold into Cook Funnels 2.0. So then they can get in that way, get in this software. And then that affiliate makes that month of current commission right after that. Okay. So this is a no brainer in my opinion to go ahead and promote this too. You might as well continue to give to your email list and say, hey, I got all these templates. Go ahead and check them out. It's just a dollar. So pretty cool. Lastly, we do have the PLR Funnels. And I promise this is the last one I'll talk about, but I love this stuff. Russell Brunson partnered up with Paul and Shreya. This trio is absolutely amazing. I was actually in the room when this whole deal got talked about about a year and a half ago. But this is to save your seat for the webinar. It's about, I think it's about an hour webinar or so. But people get in there for free and they're upsold into getting in with coaching with Paul and Shreya. They also get a funnel every week for the next year, which is absolutely insane. They get help with their email sending and tons more and also gets upsold into ClickFunnels. So that's where the affiliate gets, it's helped out as well. So extremely cool. There's also some AI stuff in this as well. I think you'll absolutely love it. So yes. So Susan was just told a lot of really cool stuff. I would definitely check out all of these different affiliate offers. And if you ever forgot anything I just said, just go in here and check out the funnel. Buy it for yourself so you know exactly what you're promoting as a ClickFunnels affiliate and check them out. You can't go around with any of these, especially buying them yourself and promoting them. So we're setting up these people for success for sure. 100%. That's an amazing rundown and all of these different things going on. For example, those templates for a dollar. Like you said, people would have to pay a lot of money to have all of that stuff done for them. You're going to go out there and you're going to hire designers and the in design stuff, the Photoshop stuff, they're all different specialisms. You're definitely going to have to spend more than a dollar. But you can go in there, use that coupon code, get all of that stuff and then start building sooner. That's really attractive to Susan's customers. And it's a great way for her to add value to her agency as well. And I know we've got James on the line as well, who does a bunch of work with clients and customers and a bunch of stuff. And I noticed James, you're already saying that these templates are amazing up in the com. What's your take on this stuff before we move on? I can't believe how much value is provided for $1. It's seriously ridiculous because not only are these amazing templates and they're really varied, but they're also for ClickFunnels Classic and 2.0. It's for both. So no matter where you are, you're covered. And on top of that, they will continue to release templates in the future. So this is the most no brainer opera I've ever seen. I love it. Definitely is. So we want to move this forward a little bit and I know Tony, the entire you've been like, we need to do share funnels. Susan's like, well, come on, boys. Tell me what is this, this share funnel thing that you keep saying so amazing? Yes. We're ready for share funnels. Yes, we are so ready. And we're ready. All right, definitely ready. We're ready. Feel free to share up a screen and let's get into this. Susan's excited. All right, Susan, here we go. Okay, so here's the idea with share funnels is the ability to share a completed funnel and not just the funnel, but the also the workflow, the workflow, if you don't know what that is, or if you need a reminder is all the automation, what emails need to be sent out on how many days between emails, what tags need to be added to context, stuff like that. So if you were to build out a simple or a complex funnel and workflow, you can share those to other people's click funnels 2.0 accounts. Okay, so that's kind of the basic idea of a share funnel. You're sharing it somebody else's account. Now, the other part of this is the ability to, if they don't have a click funnel 2.0 account, allow them to sign up for a click funnel 2.0 account. And you will be the affiliate for that account because you shared a funnel to them. Okay, so that's kind of the idea of the share funnel with the affiliate play in there as well. So here's an example of how that might work. So this is Susan's share funnel. Susan could come in here and build out a funnel. We'll build a real super simple one for now. So we'll add a new step or create a new page, which just says an opt-in lead generation funnel we'll create. Let's just choose this template. We can add all this stuff later, but for now we'll just go create page. Okay, and then we can add another step, create a new page, and let's just say it's a thank you page. So this is simple, simple opt-in page, which you think, hey, I got to make this super complex. I got to make it, you know, I guess then two weeks on it. No, you really don't. You can actually create this very, very quickly. I'll show you some shortcuts here as well. Let's create that page. So just like that, we've got a funnel. Now, the other thing to keep in mind is you can actually add workflows to these funnels. So for example, I can click on here, and I've got these different workflows. I can create a new one. So we don't have a niche for Susan, do we guys? Yes? Do we have? Do we have like a niche that she's going for anything like that? She's specializing in people who are in the photography business to help them sell their photography and help them take their business online. A lot of these guys are like traditional, you know, they're going down the business furs or displaying all of these photos and things like that. They want to get online, right? And Susan's figured out she can do that, and now this might be a perfect opportunity. Okay, perfect. So this would be a great way for her to create a little opt-in funnel for photographers so they can start generating leads. Okay, for example, so she could add some emails in here. She can add some tagging. You know, a simple tag would be this is a lead. Okay, a simple tag. This is a lead. This one, these contacts are buyers. So that's kind of how the tagging works, just so you know, we can keep it super simple. So you can create the funnel and the workflow. Okay, and these these thumbnails will generate as well. Okay, so I've created the funnel. I'm going to go back here to my all of my funnels. So now if I go over here to the right, you can see on the very right, there's a little gear icon that says edit funnel when you hover over it. If I click on that, it's going to bring me to my settings for this funnel. I can change the name of it. I can change the domain. I can change the path of the funnel. I can make it live or in test mode, all that type of stuff. Okay, but here is the magic button where you can generate a share funnel link. Okay, so all you have to do is come in here after your funnel is ready to go. Click on that button. We can give a name to it. We can change the name if we want. We can change the name of the affiliate. We'll change it to Susan for here. Okay, and then we create with that little button right there and it's going to start publishing that. Okay, it takes just about 10 or 15 seconds and now we've got the share funnel link. Okay, so all she has to do now is copy that link. So this is, let me show you real quick, if someone clicks on this link. So I'm going to go to a new incognito window. I'm going to paste that link and here's what someone's going to see once they click that link. Now again, these some of the thumbnails and stuff like that will take a minute to load, but this is actually going to have them start the 14-day trial right here. Okay, and with that, they're also going to get this funnel that we created. Okay, so it's kind of the flow is after they did someone have a question? We're just seeing your share funnel screen right now. Are you showing the incognito? Okay, let me share this again. Nope. Incognito doesn't automatically get shared, I guess. Okay, can you see it now? Here we go. Okay, there we go. Okay, so this page is kind of automatically generated based on the share funnel that you create. Now we kind of just threw one together, but they'll put their name in their email address in here to start the process of signing for that 14-day trial. And again, you're the affiliate for this, which is awesome. After they complete the process, they'll go to their click funnels 2.0 account and this funnel that you created for them will be in there. So that's kind of the flow of how that works. So this is, so I pasted that link into an incognito window. So let me close this one. And then let me show my screen again for the other side of things. There we go. There we go. Okay, so that was to grab that link. And then I was just showing it in that incognito window how it works. So some of the ways you could approach this, okay, here's some strategies. You could give this funnel away for free if they sign up for a click funnel's 2.0 account, right? That makes sense. This could be a bonus for them to sign up. So you might build a funnel that presents this opportunity for them to get this funnel as a bonus if they sign up for click funnel 2.0. I would add an affiliate, Susan should probably pre-explain in her funnel process what these new customers or clients should be doing her and what that process looks like. So if I was doing as an affiliate, I would actually show this whole process maybe in my sales video or my opt-in page video, whatever that might be. So they understand when they get to that share funnel page what that means. Okay, so the higher conversions from that page are going to come when you explain that process to your customers and that flow. The other idea with share funnels is you could actually not just give them away, but you could actually sell them. So you could create a funnel. You could actually create a cart page inside of a funnel that you're building for this funnel. They buy it, let's just say it's for $97 or $997 or $9,997, whatever you want. They purchase it and then in the thank you email, you can put this share funnel link in there and then they can click that link and get that uploaded to their account. So that's kind of the basic idea of that is to create other opportunities for someone like Susan to serve her customers or her clients at a higher level and give them a huge head start. Now people can obviously go in to their own ClickFunnels 2.0 account and build their own opt-in page funnels or their own sales page funnels, right? But if you have something that you already know works or you've got run some traffic through that you can see conversions at a certain rate, that can be huge. I mean, I would buy a funnel right now, a share funnel from someone, let's just say I was a photographer and let's just say they already ran traffic through it and it converted at 30% front of the opt-in page and then it converted at 15% for the order page, whatever that process is looking like for them for their packages. And they wanted to give me their pretty much their full business and their traffic strategy and they showed me the receipts, she's showing, hey, this funnel works for me and this is where I made my $250,000 last year, whatever it is, right? I would buy that for $10,000, but it's pretty much a full business and a package for something that you know is working. Now, obviously there's maybe some, maybe a course or consulting that goes along with that, but these are super, super valuable, especially the ones that you know are working. But if it's just a cool design or something like that and you want to give away, you can do that. The other thing that you can do is in these funnels, I'm going to click on the funnels tab here, keep in mind that you can, like we have really, really cool templates, right? But with, let's just say we've got a page template, let's set an opt-in page. Within that opt-in page template, there are sections. Okay, and you can actually save those sections and put them in other pages. So if you're not a designer, developer, whatever that is, which most of us aren't, right, you can actually borrow some of those sections from other clicks, funnels, templates, it's like that, put them into your own templates, structure them the way you want, and then give those away as well. So there's lots of shortcuts in there. Once you play with it, Susan, you're going to love it. So is there any questions? Did I miss anything guys that you might think would be helpful to Susan with ShareFunnels? I don't have any questions, but I just think the ShareFunnels is something so unique to click funnels, and it's just awesome because like you said, Ben, you can sell them, you can give them away, you can include them with other types of digital products. So actually, I do have a question for James though, or maybe somebody who has had a little bit of success being an affiliate. James, have what kind of offers or what strategy have you used in the past? And maybe you have a few affiliates, maybe have a bunch. I don't know, it doesn't really matter right now, but what has worked for you in the past? You're going to love this answer. I have zero affiliates because I am just getting into this. So I'm actually more like, I mean, Susan's shoes than anyone else. So now I'm thinking like, okay, I'm a funnel builder. I have a process for building linchpin funnels. The very first funnel that I do is this like coming soon early bird funnel. I'm going to make one of those, make that a lead magnet, give it away for free, and then anyone who signs up, boom, there you go. That's my next step. That's my action step from this call for sure. Definitely in the right place. Yeah. Definitely in the right place. James, that's huge. I can give a few examples. So I'm not going to name off any names, but we have an amazing affiliate who's just just absolutely killing it over the last three years. And he has people get into an event that he runs. I believe it's once every month, but he has him sign up for ClickFunnels first to get into the event. And then he also shares funnels after that. So that's one way you can do it as well. This affiliate has just crazy amounts of sign ups. He's killing it. I would also have, and I'll share this name, I would have Susan talk to Sarah Petty. Sarah Petty is absolutely amazing. She's one of my favorite people ever. I love seeing her at events. She's very creative and knows the photography niche just inside and out. And she's used ClickFunnels like crazy. I would have her funnel hack, Sarah Petty. She'd be set up for success, of course, but maybe she has a share funnel where, man, you can put different categories of photographs or digital things that she's done. And then just be like, hey, all you have to do is put in your pictures and then your digital assets. And then you can sell it just like I do. It's super easy. Just put in your stuff. And then what she can do after that is whoever signs up for that, she can do a class later on and say, hey, this is how I did this. Let's do this together. So I'll have my dev or whoever builds a funnel show you how to do this. So I'll show you where my assets are. We'll take those out and then you'll be on your funnel and then you can just put yours in and my dev will just answer all the questions. It'll be super easy. Just go ahead and make sure you sign up with my ClickFunnels link. Oh, by the way, I love ClickFunnels. And then to be able to get people in that way, it's just as much hand-holding as you can do, the better. Because people just trust you even more and just be like, I really like this person. This is good. And then they'll be able to sign up that way. So some people just give away ShareFunnels and that's their price to get into coaching programs. You don't even have to buy this thing. Just go ahead and sign up for ClickFunnels and then, hey, I'll get compensated on the back end. They're great. They'll take care of me. But just go ahead and sign up. So if you don't have an audience, I've been seeing a few questions here. I don't have an audience or I don't have a list, blah, blah, blah. Start soon. We talked yesterday about your superpower. Susan's superpower is photography. So you got to build off of that. So Susan now has a photography list that she can send emails to. Now, whatever you're, I see Linda here is asking about building a list and where to start. Linda, what's your superpower? Are you a copywriter? Are you a business owner, entrepreneur? Maybe you start teaching about how to be an entrepreneur. Maybe you start teaching whatever on YouTube. And then from YouTube, you can talk about, hey, my ShareFunnels right down below. Go ahead and click on the link. So start somewhere. Right? Absolutely. And another, before I forget, another ShareFunnels strategy that I like that we have had affiliates have some pretty good success with in the past, it's probably not going to get you to thousands of users underneath you. But let's say you own or run or work at a brick and mortar, right? A gym or a chiropractor or whatever, you can build out a funnel to bring leads into your chiropractor practice, right? Test it out, make sure it works for you. And the cool thing about a business like that is that I always like to talk about is the chiropractor, even 20 miles down the road, they're not really your competition, right? People are only going to kind of stick within their circle to go to that type of business. So if this marketing and this funnel is working for you and your chiropractor business, you can turn around and sell that to another chiropractor down the road. Hey, I built this prebuilt website slash lead gen funnel for you. All you got to do is put your branding in it. Here's the link, boom, they open it, set up their domain, put their branding in it, they're good to go, right? And you could rinse and repeat that through every chiropractor in the world if you wanted to, right? And that can work for a lot of brick and mortar businesses or small businesses like that as well. So if you're like an expert in a niche like that, that's kind of another way that you can utilize share funnels. It's going to take some hustling and some selling on your part, but it's a good way to be able to niche down and kind of dominate a market that you're an expert in, right? Rather than just trying to be out there in the general internet marketing world selling somebody a coaching funnel or something. And not that there's anything wrong with that, but that's just going to be a lot more competitive than if you can kind of position yourself as, hey, I did this, I'm the expert, it worked for my, I mean, my wife has one for an auto glass business. And I'm always telling her like, we should turn this thing into a share funnel and promote this. And I should probably put my money where my mouth is and do it, right? Because it works for her. So it would work for the auto glass company down the road. So just kind of another strategy that you can think about with the share funnels. And the share funnels are so important because the key to this, if you follow Turner and how you know we talk about this all the time, the key to this affiliate game with click funnels is you have to get them to stick. If they don't stick and they don't pay, it doesn't matter, right? Trials are awesome. But if they don't start making payments, none of us make any money, right? So if you have that share funnel and you kind of shorten the gap for them to be able to implement, especially like Turner said, if you have somebody on your team or you yourself can spend some time and be like, Hey, I'll help you look up your domain. I'll help you do your email sending. Now this thing's live. The odds of them paying that every month after that are exponentially better than if you're just like, Hey, here's my 14 day trial link to this software. That's awesome. Sign up and figure it out. And then they might pay like once and they're like, I haven't done anything with this. Like, what, what am I doing? You know, I don't need to pay for this. So the share funnel like takes kind of all of those barriers to entry out for them. It is pretty cool, right? And I think something that people, if they do put some work into this, they can have a lot of success. And my brain's going, what about like, you know, kind of like you're coming up to like Christmas and Halloween or short term seasonal holidays. And you're like, Oh, we need to do a Black Friday offer. And I like James just like ran off to build share funnels, right? We need some kind of short term site, but you're going to run it again next year. And then you thought, Oh, that works. And now we need another one like seasonal promotional share funnels, get people in, but they know they're going to run it next year. They're not going to cancel. And what's the next season that's coming up? What's the next season? You've got a suite of those to hand out. And also the old classic thing is just do a demonstration video. This is how you use click funnels at the end of it. There's the funnel. You can now go and edit this thing for your business. Like you said, put your branding on, and you can follow along with the tutorial. There's so many ways creative ways. I think we must have had at least 10 different ways that have just been cited on this live right now. And you only need one, right? You don't need to take one of these methods and go and deploy it for yourself. I've seen people who I think you mentioned earlier, where you just take the sections, you save the sections into one funnel, but those sections could have lots and lots of different elements that you can use in funnels, right? Like underlines or borders or little images and AI generated stuff, right? Somebody downloads a funnel. It's almost like a big old, what used to be like the clip art directory, but in one funnel. So I get all of these assets that you can use inside a clip funnels. There's my share link. So there's about, oh man, you can probably think of hundreds of the ways that you could use this thing, but you've got to start somewhere and you've got the links, you've got the capability and you've got a clip funnels account. There's so many ways you can go with this. Susan's currently like running around the office like, ah, I can't believe this because you've got so many different opportunities. You can use this with your agency customers, with just your friends, people you know in business. Like you said, people locally, people further afield. You've got to get creative with people. People start sticking to clip funnels. You start making some money. It's a win-win. And you guys are here to ultimately support folks. I see Laura's in the chat and a few other folks in the chat that I can't see. I know Laura is in the chat. If anybody's got any questions, ask live while we're on here because we do want to move forward this week and we want to start talking about things like how to enhance your offer. We want to start talking about bonuses. We'll start talking about bridge pages. And then at the end of the week, tie this all together with how to be ethical in your promotion and have a just a good old question and answer session at the end, Andy, right? Absolutely. Had to take myself off mute there for a second. But yeah, this has been awesome because how there's no excuse to get started. We already have so much, so many resources, so much information. We got Turner and Tyler helping out. We have Ben that just showed us how share funnels work and how everything works together to help you so that you can offer help with click funnels to everybody. So yeah, this is completely awesome. And I'm really excited about getting deeper into more things tomorrow as well. In the guide section of the affiliate Facebook group, Ben has already done a training on share funnels. Greg Dakens has done a training on how to build a share funnel. He also did one on how to add the workflows to share. So we have like not only what Ben did here today and this is going to be saved too, but we have like multiple walkthroughs from different people of how to do this. So we'll put them in the comments. And look, we're approachable as well. Right. So if you watch this, you watch the other videos and you still don't get it, you can write in the group and you'll be like, I don't get this thing. We've got a dedicated affiliate group with all these guys on the stream. It's like, if you still don't get it after that and you've watched all this stuff, you can like comment or grab one of our attention and be like, please just explain this because I want to make a go of this thing. Surely between all of us, we can help you just get that little one thing. Now I get it, we're off. And you got all the support of the community. You got the support of the ambassadors. There's a lot to be done. When I first started with affiliate marketing, I'd often look at it and think, do I really want to go to all that effort for $4 or $7 or $47? And you're thinking small, you add 47 times a thousand every month. Oh, you see that? Or just times 10. Right? And that's just 47, right? I'm just pulling numbers out of the sky. What's the typical commission on the most basic ClickFunnels plan times 10? It's about $30 on the lowest tier to $100 in the top tier. So you've got anywhere on that scale and you can, you know, you might just get one person a week, one person a month, but if they're recurring and you get that little email saying ClickFunnels has sent you your money or your affiliate commission, you could kind of get in the groove with that, right? I mean, it's really, it's pretty exciting when we start, you know, thinking about the numbers and the possibilities. And there's always somebody that said, well, I tried that and my brother's girlfriend, it didn't work for them or something like that. But the truth is it does take some work, but the work will pay off. And this is how you can get a recurring income that just comes in automatically after you've put in all the work. So we have so many different ways for you to be successful with this and just so much help that you can get. So I'm really glad that we have this affiliate program and all the resources. Yeah, we've got a doubt. Well, and with what Ben showed, it looked pretty easy, right? You just build your funnel, go to the share settings. It's super easy. So hey, let us know. Have you already built a funnel and ClickFunnels? Let us know in the chat. If you already built a funnel, share the thing, right? Make it shareable, clone the funnel, share the other one and get going. Might as well. I love the idea of, for example, if you like brick and mortar business and you're operating in a locality, right? So you're in your local area and you get this thing working for you, but there's the same business 30 miles away who can't even come near your customers because you are in those localities. And this guy over here might be struggling. You just quick phone call or a quick message on Facebook and be like, Hey, buddy, this is working really well for me. You know, we're not crossing the streams with customers. Would you like to check out what I'm doing? Yeah, sure. And then it's not only the case of there's the funnel and there's some commission. It's like, well, I can set this up for you. And there's a deal in that potentially. Yeah, you can potentially charge on the front end for setting it up for him too. Give him the share funnel, set it all up. Hey, I'll set this up for you for 250 bucks. And then you just got to pay your own account. You know, I'm going forward and set it and forget it. The other reason that I like that strategy, I mean, we have a good buddy that used to work here with us that had done this on the affiliate side. He owned a CrossFit gym and did that, helped a couple other CrossFit gyms set it up. Well, pretty soon, just by word of mouth, he had people reaching out to him, Hey, can you get me one of those lead gen things that you did for so and so, right? And it can kind of help you snowball a little bit. So yeah, yeah. And it's, it's all powered by that amazing share funnel method that we've just looked at and the fact that that's built into click funnels. And you've got all the tools to build amazing concepts that you could potentially sell and potentially share and generate yourself an additional income. And is anybody not doing it? What's actually stopping you? That would be an interesting thing to see up in the comments, right? And I know we might have some questions from people saying it's addictive. They're loving it. Some folks have been swimming around by themselves and now they found us and hopefully we could teach you a big bunch of stuff. There's so many videos in the pin section and all of these groups and tutorials. We've got the help section. We've got a dedicated support team. We've got ambassadors. We've got Q and A. We've got all this stuff going on. Ask the questions and you'll get the answers, right? We're here. It's what these communities are all about. Turner and I's DMs are open. Tyler always says slide on in. We got you. Slide on in with affiliate questions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's some crazy stuff. Also, we're going to be at Funnelacking Live. So if you want to say, hey, Turner and Tyler, grab our computer. Come show me how to do this. We will be there. We will sit down with you. Pull us aside. We'll actually be there a few days beforehand as well. So if you want to say, hey, can you help me out with my affiliate stuff? Come grab us. We'll be there. We'll sit by you. We'll buy you dinner. Let's get your affiliate stuff going and we'll make it work. It'll be good. Let us know in the comments if you're coming to FHL. Give me a hashtag FHL. We would love to see you there. I feel bad for anyone who's not coming. You're just, you're going to miss out if you're not coming. So make sure that you just go ahead and buy that ticket as soon as possible and it's worth it. Any amount of money is totally worth it. Just come. Be with us. It's going to be a party. Sounds like a plan. And we've just been discussing that Andy as well. What's going on at Funnelacking Live and there's so many opportunities. And I know you might be watching this a little bit later down the line. The event might have passed. If it's passed 2023, make sure you check out the next available opportunity if you missed it. But if you're watching this live or on the run up to Funnelacking Live, you need to like, as we say, be in the room, right? And just that opportunity for, you know, Tyler, Ternad, Ben, one of us who pull out the laptop, show you there and then. That's before you've even listened to a speaker. And obviously, you know, if you had a rush of a thousand people, they might be charging a little bit of money to do this or they might have to be some coffees, exchange or whatever it is. But I think that opportunity alone is just amazing. And the fact that DMs are open and the fact that you're so supportive and we've got all this stuff going on in groups, it's like, ah, if you're watching this, you've not made an inroad with the affiliate marketing maybe it's time just to have, you know, 30, 40 minutes this evening, this afternoon, wherever you are in the world and just take a look. Susan's certainly looking right. Love it. Love it. Danny, what are we going to jump on tomorrow? What are we talking about tomorrow? So I want to get into like, so now we know how to make a share funnel, right? And we know that we've got all these offers that we can promote. But I guess if you just like take a link out there and just sort of like, say, put the link on social media, that isn't necessarily as attractive as what other affiliates might be doing. I really want to talk about how you enhance your offer and kind of get into bonuses a little bit and how can an affiliate really make the chances of people signing up and sticking increase, right? Out of this stat, the odds in the favor. But I guess anybody can share a link. I know from my experience that if you add extra value, maybe you're going to build the funnel, right? Whatever it is. But if you can have the extra value, you open up another dimension of the affiliate marketing. I really want to get into that stuff, get into bonuses and hopefully we can talk a little bit about bridge pages as well of how you can use affiliate offers to actually build your list. Right? That might be a tall order, but that's like what's on the slides. If you guys can join us and maybe Ben's like, wow, I can show you some of that stuff. I don't know. We're here. We're doing it. What's your thoughts? Yeah, whatever. Yeah, lots of ideas out there for sure. Yeah, bridge pages. You know, there's different ways you could obviously be an affiliate. You could be just an affiliate. You could use it as a compliment to your business. You can use it like as an agency type thing. There's so many different ways you could do it. But the important thing from my experience is just pick one, keep it super, super simple, get started right away. And your implementation of it today will obviously look different than a year from now because you're going to be learning a ton during that time from your audience and the feedback that are coming through. So if you're kind of confused on, well, what should I do? I mean, you guys give me all these ideas. Just pick the easiest, lowest hanging fruit you can. And a lot of people are like, well, I don't have an audience. I don't have a list. That's going to come during this next year. Right? And again, your strategies are going to be fine tuned. And you're going to be the best expert of what to do next in your business. Then you're going to be way better than us at telling you what to do because you're going to have all that data coming in. But just creating a simple Instagram video. Maybe you don't have a bridge page yet. Just pop your link in there. You know, for now, it doesn't matter. You know, later on in two weeks or three weeks, you can change it at a bridge page and all that stuff. So I know there's a lot of different ways to create income and, you know, using a share link and all that type of stuff. Just keep it super, super simple and just get started. That's number one. Great. Nice. Building off of that. I want to do a little something fun. Those of you that have been around with us for the last 50 minutes, let me know what your plan is for the next little bit. What is your, after listening to this, what is your plan to start being an affiliate, whether it's share funnels? And we know that Susan's got some brainstorming going on. But what is your plan to take the next step to get the next commission? Are you going to build your bridge page? You're going to build a share funnel? You're going to start promoting your first funnel challenge, send out emails. What is it going to be? Give me a detailed list in the comments. We will send you a whole ClickFunnels wardrobe of stuff. And maybe a gift card as well. So let me know in the comments. Make that thing as detailed as humanly possible. And I want to see who's going to really take action on this. And I promise I will send you a package that will blow you away. It'll be super cool. So we'll pick it on our next, on our live tomorrow, but go crazy in the comments with what your next step of action is going to be. And I'll make it worth it for you for sure. We'll maybe pick it tomorrow or the next day. But pick it on Friday, right? So it gives folks a reminder, remind folks to top that up. But if you're live or on the replay, that's like a super generous offer, right? And if you guys go crazy in your detail, you're like, this is what I'm going to do to take action. And maybe this is what help I need or that like people are writing already. You might see one from, from Susan in there very soon as well with a view to everybody loves swag, right? And look, there's, I did a bunch of stuff with the classic affiliate program and I went and did some other stuff. And I'm fortunate enough to be sat here with you guys. And it's like the ClickFunnels dream has kind of come true for me in more ways than one, right? But the affiliate stuff, I let that go. And man, I need to build that back up again, because I know the power of the program and not get into the life story and the money and stuff like that. But if you're on the fence and you've never done it, or maybe you've done it for a while and then you've stopped with the way that things are going and ClickFunnels right now and the cool stuff that's happening and the support and the share funnels and 2.0 and all the rest of it. Now is the time. Now is the time to get your answers in the comments and fill that in because turn has got like the key to the swag cabinet. We got access to the good stuff. We've got access to the good stuff says Tyler and that's like people want the good stuff, right? Where's the replay? There's a few questions about the cookies and things like that. If we've still got time, if you guys can see those, it's moving real quick, right? There's loads of content in the guides and in the featured section at the top of the group as well. There's also the affiliate group as well. If you drop the links, drop the links, you make sure everybody's fully aware of where to go and have seen the training. And we do have a calendar on ClickFunnelsAmbassadors.com as well, which shows our lives. It shows the affiliate lives. We keep this up to date. Sometimes you just don't know it's here and we're working so hard to make sure that everybody knows what's what and where things are. And we're pretty much on every single day, Andy, right? With something new or if I'm like a TV's on, there's always stuff going on. And make sure you stay informed and watch the content because there could be one little thing. People are saying this is pure gold, right? One little thing could change your business. Absolutely. I can handle the cookie one real quick. So somebody asked basically if the cookies valid for 45 days, what happens if that same person signs up, for example, five months later, but on another link. So the couple of things to unpack there, they click your link and they don't sign up. They're cooking to you for 45 days. So for the next 45 days, if they sign up anytime, you're going to get that credit after 45 days, that kind of resets goes back to zero. Now that said, last click, last link clicked, it's kind of a mouthful for some reason, always wins. So if sometime during that 45 days, they come across another affiliate's offer that has great bonuses or whatever, and they click on that and they end up signing up, that affiliate is going to get that credit, right? So whoever's link, they click last wins. So that's immediately going to bring up like, yeah, the affiliate game is a little bit of a dog eat dog world. That's why it's really important that if you know that you have a bridge page that we'll talk about probably tomorrow, you gather that email address and you keep marketing to them and giving them offers until they take action and use your link and sign up. But yeah, kind of the long and short of that is it lasts for 45 days. But if they click another link in between there, that affiliate will get credit. Another thing that always gets brought up is if they sign up, they get on the ClickFunnels email list, are you going to override my affiliate link? No, we won't steal your affiliates from you, they will be yours. But if it's another affiliate and they click their link, they will get credit. So that's why it's important to have good bonuses, a bridge page, a share funnel so that they can implement right away, like all these things that we talk about. That's why they're so important is because it is it's competitive, right? So just that that's yeah, stick to your game and make sure they sign up with you. Yeah, and a few folks, T-Cars asking, when are you on daily? And we do have that calendar on ClickFunnelsAmbassadors.com and that was featured on Funnel Like TV last night. So make sure you check out the calendar. We'll try and drop that in the in the comments for you as well in the in the affiliate group. If one of you guys can drop that in maybe as in that group, it's ClickFunnels ambassadors.com and on there if you scroll down, there's just a Google calendar. You can actually assign that to your Google calendar. And we're doing the best to make sure that's synced between what the ambassadors are doing. The question and answer stuff we do, the Builder Business Series, the affiliate stuff, it will say when which group it's in. We're always trying to keep that updated and Funnel Hack TV and anything that Russell Brunson is doing like the pulse. And you can see Funnel Hacking Live on there and there's going to be stuff going on at Funnel Hacking Live as well on Funnel Hacking TV. You see all of that stuff hopefully on that calendar. There's a lot, right? There's a lot. Yeah, we do have tons of stuff and more coming out all the time. And so at this time, at the same time that we started this today, we're going to be on tomorrow and also on Friday. So if anybody wants to join us, yeah, we're going to be on usually around this time now. Next week is going to change a little bit because we don't have a Builder Business Series next week. But don't worry, we're going to be back really soon. And this is going to be something regular that we do every couple of weeks or two or three times a month. So really exciting. And Turner and Tyler, I know that you guys and most of your audience in the ClickFunnels affiliate group knows that you go live as well. What times or when, how often do you go live in the group? So we try to stick it to the T's, right? So Turner, Tyler, every Tuesday at 9am Mount Center time and every Thursday at 2pm Mount Center time. So just think about the T's. Also, we'll have it in our banner as well. And then we talk about it often. So Tuesdays and Thursdays, and you'll see us every day. And then always the replays are always in our group and the featured. So you'll see there. And then our guide section is just jam packed full of cool stuff. You don't need Netflix. Just go in our guide section and you'll be busy for sure. All gets done. Without a doubt. Time flies when you're having fun, right? Susan's off to build share funnels and share links. We'll be back tomorrow talking about announcing your offer and bonuses and bridge pages and more. We'll have a Q&A on Friday and then check out the calendar. Like Andy said, we've got a big bunch of other stuff planned, other stuff coming up. There's Ambassador Shores, there's all this crazy stuff going on. And everything is designed to help you go out there and build a business, get moving with click funnels and change lives, make money, do your thing, right? That's right. Yeah. Awesome. Just as if you made it this far, just a little recap. If you're going to watch the replay, the first of the video was me talking about the different links you can promote. So if you want to watch that, go to the beginning and then the middle towards the end was Ben Jakey talking about the share funnels. If you want to see that and then the later half was kind of strategy. So this is an hour call, kind of a crazy long Facebook live, but that's how it's broken up. So we'll ease your... And don't forget the competition, right? You're going to leave us a nice comment and you could get me furnished with a bunch of swag and cool stuff. We'll be back tomorrow, same time, same places. Been cool. Thanks everybody. Yeah. Load us up in the comments what your plan of action is going to be as an affiliate. And like I said, we'll hook you up with a sweet swag package. So see you tomorrow. Sweet swag. See you guys. Take care.
