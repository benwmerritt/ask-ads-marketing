## Transcript
Hey, we're live again. Yes. Hey, Danny. How are you doing, buddy? Yeah, doing really good, buddy. I'm just so excited. So today is day three of our build a business from scratch series. We've been going live every day at the same time. So if this is your first time joining us, you are welcome to join us today and tomorrow and also on Friday. In fact, we're probably going to be doing this pretty regularly in the future. Just because we've gotten so many great comments and so many people saying that this is very helpful. So really quickly, what we're doing is we're building a business from scratch. We started on Monday with the concepts and we actually have a like a person, a fake person that's starting the business. Her name is Susan. And we'll talk a little bit more about Susan and what we've done with Susan in a little bit. But first, let me talk about how you can get help with ClickFunnels. If you ever have a question and then we're going to introduce our guest. Yeah. So, so really quickly, if you ever need help with ClickFunnels, all you got to do is go to our knowledge center. That can be found at help.myclickfunnels.com. You got to put the my in front of ClickFunnels. If you're using if you want help with ClickFunnels 2.0. So it's help.myclickfunnels.com for ClickFunnels 2.0. You can also just send an email. It's super easy. Just send an email to support at ClickFunnels.com and our awesome support team will make sure that they answer your questions as soon as possible. All right, cool. So we have a special guest and by the way, in case you guys don't know, my name is Andy. I'm also with Danny. Danny is a super ambassador and he's also part of the ClickFunnels community outreach team like myself. So we're really excited. Danny has tons of experience and we have a special guest today. He's actually an ambassador as well. Danny, do you want to talk a little bit about who our guest is? This guest is someone who we've sort of been noticing more and more and more in our community over the last sort of year or so. And recently he's just released some awesome content and you see him in the group and he goes live in the group on a Monday. If we'll show you that stuff at the end and you can check it out. We want to bring on James, right? And James Coran and he's one of our ambassadors and somebody is amazing, but he's kind of really hung his hat on the Lynchpin model, which is something that you may have heard of, you may not have heard of. If you're going to Full Hacking Live this year, you'll definitely know about this thing. But James has literally emerged himself in this stuff because it is, like the name suggests, the Lynchpin. And it's so important to anybody's business that you need to take note of this and you need to start looking and thinking how do you implement this. And it's not just a word. It's not just a concept. It's a system. And James is the guy who has taken this further than quite a few people, right? There's not many people who have done what James has done. And Laura, our director of communications recently interviewed James and when she was talking about this, she said, the only person that she sees who's done more with this in her mind is Russell Brunson, which was kind of crazy. And James has delivered the goods in more than one area. So he's done a lot of work with clients. He does awesome work in the group. And we want to bring him on right now to talk about how Susan can go from her little community with her little idea to now she's thinking, well, I've run some of these webinars. I'm getting people excited. I'm selling templates. I'm selling guidance. I've got this thing. Now how can she start to implement more advanced marketing? So we're going to bring James on. James, everybody. Hey, James. Thanks for that awesome intro. And yeah, I call myself the Lynch pin funnel guy. Well, it's been full guy so that everyone will look to me when it comes to lunchpin funnel stuff. But yeah, thanks for the intro. That's that's all I'm doing these days is lunchpin stuff. And I'm happy to contribute everything that I can. Pleasure to have you. So I know we kind of picked this up from halfway through the story, right? Because we're halfway through the sessions. But for anybody who's just joining us, basically on Monday, we created Susan and Susan's walked into our office and he's like, hey, I'm in this weird niche photography group. And I'm also somebody who understands click funnels. And I want to offer these guys my skills and my services so that they can take their skills online and potentially, you know, sell more photographs, sell more canvases, you know, take this, let this more professional. And we developed a concept yesterday where we move into logo. We've got a brand. We've got a big one for Susan. But Susan wants to start using very simple, perfect webinar kind of events. So she's going to go live on a Friday and she's offering the guys in the photography group her skills and services to show them how to add a logo to their photographs. And then she was thinking, how do I move them up the value ladder? So imagine everyone that a few weeks has passed and Susan's been doing these webinars. She's been having success. She's getting people joining her from these communities. People are having a good time. And maybe they've spent, you know, $47 with her or $100 with her here and there. And Susan's getting these folks now more and more interested. And she's like, wow, this could potentially work for me. But I need to take this to a level where I've actually got a business. And this is perfect for you, James, I think with the linchpin stuff. But I think we need to start from Susan's point rather than our where we're at right now because we kind of get it. Anybody watching might not understand it. Does that kind of fill the gap a little bit? And I know Andy, you've got other bits to add to that. But that's where Susan's at in her development right now. And hopefully people following along, you getting this and then on Navneets in the chat and a few other people have been watching as well. Let us know in the chat if you're following along and if you get it. Andy, what's your thoughts? Yeah. Yeah. So right now what Susan is coming up with, she knows that she wants to sell her services. So she wants to offer, you know, her services, maybe she can help photographers eventually build their own sites and things like that. Now, that's great and wonderful. She's going to make a lot of money. But she knows that there's a way for her efforts to continue on even though she's not trading her time for money. Right. She wants to, she understands that there might be a way for her to maybe create some type of membership or course or some type of some type of product that will keep paying her even after she's done. And then the money just keeps coming after and she doesn't need to be spending so much time working. So I think this is going to be great. And we have one of the leading experts with us on this strategy. So we're really excited about this. But James, what are your thoughts? How what do you view if Susan was your client? What would she, what would you be telling her or asking her or recommending to her? Well, what the key thing that I heard is, you know, a sort of like decoupling of investment of time, like high touch point versus but still wanting to serve a specific audience. So with that, like, I pretty much only work with people who are going to be doing something with linchpin. So I'm like always filtering and looking for specific sort of flags that will say like, is this a good fit or not for linchpin. And that's one thing that I heard it definitely makes sense to me. It's okay. Got some stuff going. So I know there's an audience. I know where they are. I've been able to validate some, some actual buyer. So this is very good thing. So many times people have great ideas, but haven't put in the work to, to be vulnerable to put themselves out there and to actually put an offer out there. That has had success. So she's a perfect candidate for concern for a linchpin system. And I think that a membership site, since we're talking input products, I know we're talking about some services later on, maybe of actually performing the final building itself. And that can be something where that's either it's a higher level of engagement, or it can be the kind of thing where it's an upsell. So we have like this kind of like membership do it yourself thing within in the funnel. We can do a one time offer upsell for more high ticket done with you or done for you services. So that would be the, the sort of map that I would do. You know, I would use a tool like arrow to actually map this whole thing out and then present that and see if the client was on board with that. And usually if I can convey that with some, you know, some, some certainty, let them know that I've done this before a million times, I could help them achieve this goal. And then usually they're on board. Awesome. So maybe, maybe what we can do right now is just kind of throw out some ideas for actual courses or membership programs. I don't know what do you guys think. So obviously she's, she's her target audience right now is macro photographers, right, because she has this hobby. She loves all the technical stuff. She's really good at graphic design and, and you know, getting into click funnels. But she's also a hobbyist. She loves macro photography. What do you think, what kind of product could she come up with that would attract macro photographers and maybe help them and maybe spark the idea that they need to get a click funnels account and start creating their own phones. I would counter that with a question of, for her audience, where are they right now? And where do they want to be when they're, they've had success? What journey is she taking them on? And I think it'd be a good point just to recap on yesterday because Susan's been out there running these little mini trainings and Susan's had a little stack going on at the end of her first ever webinar. She's put a little thing up. She's taken some options. She's done this thing live on a Friday or a Thursday on Zoom. And if I just share the screen, I've got this thing in Photoshop, right? So this hopefully you can see this. Share the screen and what I did is I kind of pulled out the funnel. And if you guys can see that on the inside of Photoshop right now, can zoom in. So Susan's got a little landing page and she's took people out and she said, Hey, I'm going to do this free training that's going to show you how to put logos onto your photographs. How you can use a bit of AI to make things a little bit smoother, a little bit easier for you when you want to impress people because these macro guys have been taking down the photographs to like the local markets and things trying to sell these things on canvases and they're trying to get money online, but they don't quite know what to do. Maybe they're putting things on eBay and stuff like that. So she's run some of these little webinars. She's been doing this thing where she gives away some Canva templates and a couple of training videos and a little call with herself. She's given this little checklist and some AI prompts and a little thing for mid journey and stuff. So she's kind of got these guys enjoying it. And if we fast forward like, you know, couple of months, she's got maybe a couple of hundred people on her mailing list right now. They've already bought this thing and she's, she's stacked the value, but she's done it at what everybody does James, right? They come out there and they say, Oh, this is $5,000 worth of stuff. You can have it for $47 just to get people in the door. So she's got this little funnel going on. But once they've completed the webinar, she's kind of like ended that process and they bought the thing. She's put the money in the bank and she's gone out there trying to get new customers. And she's kind of now, well, look, I've got these people on the list. They want more of this stuff, but they've never heard of click funnels. They've never heard of, you know, doing this sort of like selly canvases online, use a funnel, do a, do a trip wire. Any of this crazy stuff we know, they've just literally learned a bit of AI how to put logos on photographs using Canva and how to take these things, do a bit of mid journey and maybe just enhancing what they're doing in the photography. But she hasn't moved them into this marketing zone in their minds just yet. Does that kind of set the scene for you a little bit? Cause I know we've. Yeah, I think so. And then the end result is that her clients are able to sell their original photos in some marketplace. Are we going to specify that marketplace or is it as well watermarking like with an original brand? Putting a stamp on things. Yeah, exactly. So normally these guys would try and print something on a canvas physically take it down like into town or whatever and stand there at some, you know, little shop or a pop up market or whatever. And they're trying to sell these things to the public and they're not charging enough. They're not really getting much success. You know, success to these guys would behave to sell three canvases in a month. Right. And maybe the messing around with like Etsy or eBay or things like that, which is fine. But Susan knows that if she unlocks this funnel hacker mentality in their mind that these guys could literally take this to a whole new dimension, but she needs that help from us to move over there. So she's done the webinar. She's had some success and now she's ready for this potential recurring revenue thing. I think so. What's coming up for me is like what if the aim of this membership was to get the customers to be able to generate $1,000 revenue every month. Beautiful. It's kind of side business. We're not talking how do we pay. Well, it's we're talking level one. This is someone this has taken someone from hobbyist to like I'm making money and I'm serious and I'm consistently putting out my art and selling it on some marketplace Etsy or like I live in Asheville, North Carolina where there's a ton of little tiny markets all over the place and department stores and everything. So there's ways to get your stuff out there. And yeah, that feels like a good journey. So $0 a month to $1,000 a month is like the beginning and end. Right, right. So what I imagine is that maybe these macro photographers, they're just not very technical. I was just watching the other day. An episode of the the of Cobra Kai, you know, the series on Netflix, right? And there's a part where Johnny one of the martial arts teachers. He's trying to recruit students right and what does he do he goes to a park and he hands out flyers, which is like so 1990s right and obviously he didn't know anything about funnels or social media. And so I imagine that these people these macro photographers that Susan is trying to help. That's what they they don't know anything about Shopify. They don't know how to, you know, use Etsy so well. Maybe they're just going, you know, they're doing the pop up shops and things like that, which is great. I mean, that's a that's a great way to sell your art to but but you can. It's very obvious to her that she that she can see that they don't know how to get their stuff out there to a broad audience. And, and maybe she can create something like a like a blueprints type course where, you know, where there's lots of different tips and it kind of walks you through how to use Shopify how to use Etsy how to, you know, market your stuff on social media. And then perhaps at the end, maybe there's an upsell where she actually offers to build an entire website or an entire funnel to her to her clients. Does that make sense. It doesn't know that I'm because I'm leveraging chat GPT in the background to sort of different ideas for not only the membership site but also like what's what's the what are the what the methodology that we can use to actually get these canvases and people's hands and create happy and consumers. So yeah, so what I would like to do then is create like a really quick and simple video sales letter funnel that like it we can go as technical as you want we kind of keep a high level, or I can build a I can spend 15 minutes building a VSL with with no actual video just kind of a placeholder, and then have it so where it's can actually make a sale and then we can do like a workflow that unlocks the membership we can build a really basic course and had that be like the sort of deliverable for for this session. Beautiful. Yeah. And this could technically could bolt on to the back of the webinar right so when the opt into the webinar then we could show them this instead of just saying hey check your email and join me on zoom. We could have this now a VSL page that appears that says thank you you registered for the webinar. However, I've got this thing. And you, Danny handed me a share funnel of that funnel as you made yesterday and I have not seen it yet. So this will be a very like live on the fly kind of thing but I think we can take that change the thank you page to point to another funnel stuff that I'll create. Yeah, and then create a course and keep it sort of like very very high level. I won't do much graphic work or anything like that, but put some placeholders so you can get the feel for like you know if I were to spend some more hours on this and actually did put a real headline and some real copy. This is how I would implement this, but we can cover more breath and focus less on depth. Yeah, and then what we didn't cover yesterday I went back and I kind of added some tweaks and changes I put a background in and stuff just in 10 minutes before we came on. And that has got some additional steps in there you might want to modify them remove them delete them but there's nothing fancy on there it's just literally an order for an upsell and a thank you page but they are just templates from click funnels right so I've not done anything further. And the thank you if you want to bring your screen up James I can bring it on. Let's do it and share the entire screen. No wrong button. Screen entire screen click that one share. So there we go. And to infinity. Okay, so I brought this into my account. I've not clicked on it yet so let's go in and see where we are. See where we can go. Okay, so this is the webinar opt in preview on this to see we've got a workflow came in as inactive but that's probably because it was an import. Yeah, and okay we send an email so probably a confirmation email or something. Yeah, best click. Okay, here is a. Okay, so this is the webinar thank you all the getting started kind of stuff. Yeah, just for the webinar right so right here is where I think we can we can either add a step for or replace step three with you know sign up for the membership in the in the sort of canonical and then we can use the same lever and say sign up for the membership will be using it during the free training. You want to do that sounds like a plan is like we always talk about the next logical step right so it's like when I was signed up for the webinar. Well what are they going to do between now and Friday when we do the webinar well they might as well sign up for the webinar. Well, they might as well sign up to the thing that we're going to use and we talk a little bit about this this myth. G thing James and the most incredible free gift thing and how does that come into play with this stuff. Well, the myth you could be there's a whole lot of myth is a big topic potentially the simplest thing that can work with the myth you though is a free trial to the membership. Your Miffy does not have to be a physical thing it can be digital does not have to be any additional bonus that they can just be like hey you get to pay nothing and get this thing for 14 days or 30 days or something like that. So it's kind of like on the stuff that Russell puts out there and other challenges and things it's like test drive and just by saying maybe give you some stuff maybe there's something that you can do with the membership. I don't know but the crux of what you're doing right now is saying hey now they registered for the webinar we're going to give them an option to try or buy or membership right and I guess it's up to Susan which way she wants to go what would you advise. Let's keep it simple and say well it'll be step four and we'll call it macro Academy. So we'll be using macro Academy during the training so sign up for your free account today and this will be a button that links to the next step in fact I can actually do that. Make this go to next step. And we're good to go. I'm going to go ahead and say hi. Hi, I'm going to go ahead and say hi. Hi, I'm going to go ahead and say hi. And we're good to go. This order form. I'm going to delete this. Or actually what I can do. Yeah, I don't think we're I'm not going to use these so I'm going to delete these really some yeah. There's now Susan's going to the into the future right so now she's been running this webinar for a while and she's been making a few dollars even there and she's got a mailing list. She knows that this webinar is good but she can also email what you're about to build to her existing list right hey we've launched macro Academy and you guys because you'd like awesome I'm going to give you a free trial to and she doesn't have to get them to sign up to the webinar ever again she could just send them the the link straight to this page. As people going crazy in the chat with the likes and the heart. I don't know these templates super well so I'm just going to pick one or run with it and I have to just nuke it they'll do that so yeah. We want index we will create page. All right, let's see what this actually looks like. Okay, so this element at the top I would probably go to the top right here. I'm going to go to the bottom right here. I'm going to go to the bottom right here. All right, let's see what this actually looks like. Okay, so this element at the top I would probably keep I'm like super honed into the no BS letter calm final I use that for like all of my stuff. So like I'm on that one there's a there's a header across the top with the logo. You know there's a big video right there so that makes sense to me. This looks like it might be some sort of like logical section here. This looks almost like a like a funnel hub page. We can keep this really simple so let's say this is emotional. This is logical. That's logical. And maybe this is like an urgency thing like you know we were. Say we'll be closing this. So the reason why you said that you know some of the headlines and some of the parts are logical and then there's different parts is is because you want to. You want to I guess the what you're trying to do is address the different points right you want to have some emotional stuff that maybe gets people excited or or you know excited about the product and then there's also logical parts that are more facts and why it's going to help you and you know less bullet points of the benefits and things like that. So is that what I understand is that you want to have a balance of of emotional logical. Is there anything else that you want to include on a page? Yeah this is like dot com dot com secrets one to one like in I don't remember which chapter but there's basically different types of buyers. And you'll get some people that are really responsive to emotional stuff and you can use either towards pain or away from or towards pleasure away from pain. You can really hype up the emotion either especially with the video because it's so high bandwidth and then you'll have some like logical buyers who are like OK that sounds great but I think you're tricking me so let me see if some facts and figures so that's where you get into a lot of the very specific like you know social proof. Specific quantifiable results things that are just like really appealing to people who are more analytical or logical. And then at the end you use things like urgency of like this offer is going to only be open for a short period of time. In the the linchpin book which you know I think we'll be getting a copy of soon the way that they do launches is with this pressure launch and it's a it's a very short window where you get people onto an early bird list and then you put out your initial finding member launch offer and then you take it away and it's not fake scarcity it's real scarcity. I did this myself for my offer where it's like I put it out there and now you can't get it so that I can go focus on the people that I just sold this to so that I can build out the course and make it an amazing thing and then I'll open it up again later on for a higher price. So scarcity is a really valuable tools because with you take something away and make it seem scarce a human is going to be more likely to to go for it. Gotcha makes sense. OK so we need to order form. This looks like the same thing. I'm going to totally ignore so many of these details and normally do fill out but that's OK. We need a product. I want to make this functional. I'm like the tactician like person where you know my design skills aren't as hot as my technical skills so making things where they're actually functional is where I excel. So let's say this is T macro. Academy. The digital product. It'll be a subscription and what do you say in the Linspin training that is right now only available in two CCS but perhaps in the future will be more widespread. There's two sort of ways to think about the psychologically for a tier one where if you're in the business of health care you're going to be able to do that. But if you're doing something like help and people make money or save money and then $97 a month is a good place to start. And if you're doing something like dog training or some other maybe health related you do $47 a month and I was going to say 47 because we're talking about art but we're talking about making money with art. So I'm going to make it $97 a month. I'm going to make a free trial and I'm going to make it a 30 day free trial. seeing here as well James is just the simplicity of ClickFunnels right because quite quickly you've taken a funnel that's working and it's worked for a while this is what we're talking about about having like you're moving people along a little track between one point and another you can pause for a little while you get some traction with that you have some fun with it you engage your members and right now we're ready to have this thing and you could just go into ClickFunnels and now we're building out free trial we're going to add the academy we've got a bunch of stuff going and that then well where we're going to put this content so then like Andy said we're going to build a little members area at some point maybe we'll get into that later or tomorrow but Susan's quite quickly gone from the lady in the group who helps people understand tech stuff to doing some regular webinars to now she's got a mailing list full of people and now she's about to launch her first ever continuity program with recurring monthly revenue that's going to teach her friends and and folks from the group how to get recurring monthly revenue that's a big big thing that we've covered in like three days right this is this is super exciting yeah totally exciting I mean especially for anybody that's that's brand new to this and watching right now this is this is exactly what we're doing is we're going through the the principles that are found in the in the secrets trilogy books by Russell Brunson and and we started on Monday we went through the foundation we talked about the you know dream customer and how to build the product came up with some ideas yesterday we went through how to build an actual funnel and some of the initial ideas that Susan is coming up with for ways that she can help this group of macro photographers so that they can make their their make some money so this is really really interesting and I'm excited for Susan even though she's a fake fake person I agree with the annual it's it's infectious it's part of the reason why I love doing this is like getting bringing people's ideas to life is like I don't know it's it taps into some like emotional like um tendons befriend kind of thing where it's like you want to help people so it's I see what you mean by being excited for her um what I'm doing right now is I'm creating some workflows um and workflows are the way that we automate things so it's kind of like um when this thing happened to do this thing so what I want to do is create an opt-in workflow so that when someone puts their they click on the the bsl they add their email address and name and I think phone number was on there it's called an opt-in so when they opt in we want some things to happen and the first thing that we want to happen is to tag them and we tag them so that we can um find them later when it comes to um sending email campaigns or just kind of keeping track of who's done what within our ecosystem so I'm going to say I like to do pre-pixes for things I like to use naming conventions um as a programmer we use naming conventions for a lot of different things so I'm going to say macro academy interest here you see yep and then create that step and then what I can do uh real quick is an abandoned cart sequence and we do this to uh get people who gave us the name and email address but maybe haven't actually signed up and send them a couple emails to um to convince them that you know this is a really good idea so I'm going to actually leverage chat gbt here and say uh email that go up some chat gbt yeah and this is something that you should never do which is blindly copy and paste from chat gbt into a um an actual email responder but it shows you the power of having a non blank canvas situation you know like what we'll do here is we'll take this and what I normally do is take this on a brainless in a google doc or a word doc or something and I actually infuse my personality into it or hand it over to a client and have them infuse their personality to it but when you're staring at a blank document it's kind of crippling whereas if you start off with something that's comes from chat gbt it's okay this is like a scaffold this is like a structure that I can use in tweak and um and do something with so uh let's see what I'm going to say is tag contact tags is not oh I must create the other one first so I'm going to do this trick all we want to do is check and see have they made the purchase yet and if they haven't then we want to send this email so I started this opt-in workflow and now I'm going to make a workflow for when they make the purchase you'll see why I'm kind of going backwards in a second so this is macro academy purchase the vessel purchases the event create the workflow and here's where I'll where I'll invent this tag that I can use in the previous step okay so now the tag exists in the system so what I'm going to do is refresh this I don't know if you need to refresh or not but I'm just going to do that to make sure that we have success here I'm back to tags is not product macro academy purchase and I missed a while there but that's fine so and I'm going to give this a name that makes sense to me so um have not not academy submit but they have not purchased academy I'm realizing that my boolean logic's kind of off have have they purchased there we go if they haven't then we can send them an email and we can use a really simple Russell Bunson style we'll say this is a Bennett cards email one the subject we'll take from here we'll say yep that's from info and now we can edit the email and I'll just do one of these so we're not doing all three but I want to go through and show you how to actually do it because we can do some here's that trick I just showed everyone yesterday where I can make this disappear here and then uh merge tags merge tags is a way to put in uh placeholders for actual contextual parts of a contact profile so hi first name we notice you would here's the link let me get the link the link is to let's say this one and boom and people watching right now you you don't underestimate the the importance of that abandoned car email right because I know just in one business these things were covered like a quarter of a million bucks in in lost revenue where people they come they get the page they do the thing and then they like abandon it literally halfway through and if you don't have that follow-up to remind them you know like I don't know the kids have come on from school or it's time to walk the dog or they get shouted or distracted as the phone goes that email is such an important thing in your business and look if all it did is recover you know a thousand books it's worth the time that James had just spent in like what I don't know seven minutes you know I don't know you can hear the keyboard going and I was going crazy with this stuff and like steam's coming off you know the hands and stuff when we're doing this this is like the experience that we've got doing this repetitive you know repetitively thousand thousand times but if you're new to this you could do this nice and slow we've used chat gpt you know we're using the workflows inside a click for those we're just thinking right if you don't choose the product send them this email and then if they still don't choose the product send them another email right so it's not exactly it's it's super like the concept is simple to grasp if you're still not getting it let us know in the comments and we'll figure out a way to do that but what you've actually done here James you're potentially going to make sure Susan gets as many folks in into the program as possible right absolutely yeah and and I would like if we say I would do this like probably three times where I'm checking to see have they purchased the the product yet and if not send them another one and sort of like ramp up the urgency and scarcity of it yeah um and you do this because you don't want to send it to people that have bought it because that's just annoying um and I think what you were talking about with like you know the the power of this stuff like we're digital marketers we're marketing on the internet if we didn't have this then we would have to have people calling people or someone in person go do this but we've got automation you know we've got things that work without us even thinking about it at scale which is the power of quick funnels so you you need to leverage the platform and put this dot fin if not like he said you're just you're just leaving money on the table which is crazy I don't know if you guys are like me but there's tons of times that you know in my head I'm gonna go to the store to go buy this thing right and by the time I set foot in the door I've already convinced myself that I don't need that thing um and and then maybe later on a few days later I'm like yeah actually I do need that thing and I mean it's like the cycle sometimes so um you know people do this all the time they'll go to the cart the checkout page and then they'll rethink it or something will come up oh I forgot I have this bill and and then they leave they're still they were interested that's why they were there in the first place so maybe they just need a little bit of a boost to get them back right so uh I mean I love this uh you know I never I never thought that we were going to talk about an abandoned cart sequence or anything like that but I'm so glad that we're talking about it right now um what what do the emails say or what do you do in the in an email uh that's trying to bring somebody back to the cart well this is all kind of contained I'm going to point everyone back to what I consider you know the holy trilogy which is the the expert secrets trilogy there there are literal scripts in there for how to do follow-up funnels um with a lot of two different contexts um there's training there's all kinds of different ways to do it but essentially it's like you you you call them my name you're like hey did something happen we noticed you started signing up for this thing and you you know we understand people get busy whatever here are the benefits that you can get and then from there you kind of increase the um the urgency and scarcity and importance and and you know depending on how long you know we're supposedly it takes us seven times to see something before we actually are convinced it's a good idea for us to do it so like this is just doing that on autopilot um in in knowing that it's in the best interests of our clients to have the stuff that we're selling it's not really annoying it's like I I want you to achieve this goal so much I'm going to keep putting this in front of your face until you admit that it's a good thing for you you say yes to yourself and you actually complete your dream without a doubt and one of the the simplest ones that we we found work many many times you're just the first email says hey we noticed you was trying to check out did something go wrong please reply and let us know and people would email back and go look I'm not paying you know 899 shipping on a five dollar item ah so that in itself just makes you think oh man obviously they've tried to choose a small thing and then the shipping's ridiculous so combine the paying 13 bucks or whatever it is for a five dollar thing you can then look at your shipping costs and think well could we do something on those smaller items or could we offer them a bundle of the smaller items to to offset the shipping or could we give them a coupon or they might come back and say you know life got in the way like Navneet saying right now in in the chat yes it did so what do I need to do you can reply to these replies that's the cool thing I asked somebody to reply so you might not even need to send them the second and third email because you've just got the conversation at the right time and that's like so simple but so often overlooked James is building out something magnificent here where he's covering all of those bases making sure that Susan's customers are getting a really well-rounded service and it shows that you're thinking about the customer as well right it's like sometimes you just you sign up for something you never hear anything ever again in this instance it's showing that Susan's attentive to the customer and Susan's loving this right now you know she's in the office thinking well I could really do this I didn't even know I could do this pretty cool very cool okay so I'm gonna assume that that's gonna be all good to go and we're gonna now focus on creating the the course so again I'm gonna leverage that GPT to start the conversation about what the structure of the course will be Stu McClaren is someone who spoke at FHL several times he's a he's leaned on heavily for his success with membership sites he has a framework for structuring content that he calls the success path so what I'm the chat GPT knows about it so we're gonna ask chat GPT to help us create a success path for this client that gets them from A to B and then again in real world we don't stop there we take it we make our own we make sure that it's actually going to solve our particular problem but for the purposes of this demonstration we're just gonna go with it as it is so I'll continue second this out and um is Stu speaking at this year's FHL James? He is I think he is and it is going to be an amazing presentation I have seen a few bits that he's done and every single time he's very dynamic right on stage and he really gets into it and he's got some amazing stories and insights and oh man you just you watch some of this stuff and you kind of like drawn into it is a true natural on stage and if you guys watching you're like oh man I really want to see this stuff um funnelhackinglive.com right and you just go and get your tickets and join us and you watch the presentation in person and this will just amplify what James is showing you in you know in an hour you know you get into this stuff and you start to immerse yourself in this stuff you're taking your business in the right direction right chat gpt can obviously help as well but this is um exciting times for Susan right now I'm gonna guide chat gpt a little bit because it's giving me three milestones per stage and I'm gonna let it know that I only want one milestone per stage the the structure of the success path is you have three to seven stages that take your person from where they are to where they want to be every stage has action steps that are required to sort of like learn that skill or build that thing and then at the end of that stage you have a tangible milestone it's very binary it's like I have this thing or I don't have this thing it can't be like a feeling or a vague notion has to be very concrete so having three milestones per stage I'm not agreeing with so I stopped the right there and I'm going to let it know that I have one milestone I noticed that James talks to chat gpt like a like a person you even said thanks right always you gotta be nice to the robots because they're not gonna get smarter or more yeah they'll remember you when they're like putting brains in jars and stuff right crazy stuff going on he's like oh man you want to be on the nice side of the of the robots and it just it just shows I guess what you know the kind of character that we're dealing with right when you work with James you you know you say nice things to the robots you're gonna be super nice to your clients and this is some of the amazing stuff that we see in the community one of the reasons James is an ambassador we tend to like to work with people and treat them in the right way so not only do they get the result but they come back and that's something that maybe Susan and might need reminding on or might might you know just think about or anybody running a business you know and it's like one of our businesses we've got some amazing reviews right we've got some amazing reviews it's pleasure to see these reviews coming in we've got to work hard for those reviews and those little things just saying please and thank you just being there on time showing up when you say you're gonna be there you can't do it you know 100% every single time but you've got to try your best to do that and you don't want to put any excuses in the way of other people's success right and important lessons for anybody who's thinking starting out on this though oh man I could just go and chat gpt and bang out some stuff and it's gonna it will not do the work for you you've got to take this stuff and make it your own and then apply it to your funnels but remember and I don't know what you think of this James but the time is so important because like we said Susan's done this webinar for a few months now she's building this out over a course of time she's going to introduce this to her members slowly like it wasn't all built in a day right even though we've literally built it in three right yeah it it shouldn't be built in a day either um though the sort of suggested route for creating a membership site that you know we're learning at 2ccx is to not build it out like you don't want to build out all every content and then sell it we do this founding member launch thing where you like from my launch I built out one stage and that's what I sold and I made it very very clear like this is a founding member launch this is going to be half the price or maybe even a third of the price of what it will be eventually you get in early you get sort of like lifetime access to this recurring price and you're there with me as I build it out and you get to influence the result like I'm in my community that I created and asking people do you want me to focus on this or this is this good or that good what kind of problems are you solving so it's kind of a collaborative thing as well yeah and super important to have your members giving you that feedback and often I've seen it where people are going to do the best facebook course or the best clickfunnels course or whatever it is to build this stuff and then something changes in like ads manager changes and then you've got to go back and redo it all you better off kind of like doing what you've just said James and then you can at least test the concept you get some folks in you're making a little bit of money you can reinvest that money but you can also stick like stay with the times as well as things evolve you evolve and you're not crushing yourself trying to bang all of this stuff out in you know a week yeah yeah I mean I think part of what we want to do in order to kind of stave off criticism or to increase certainty in our world is to to build the thing out and perfect it but there's you know I think at some stage every entrepreneur has entered this if they haven't they've read about it you polish this thing never ship it never put it out there that's like an anti pattern that we want to avoid so the knowing that going in just build a part of it very very upfront about that the fact that you only got a part of it give a significant discount and then everyone's winning if they're for you then they're gonna love this you know so you're not being deceitful at all yep yep yep I wanted to note that um I created this sort of shell of the course and now I'm including it in the macro academy purchase workflow there's an enroll step I've created it I'm checking this box so now anyone who buys automatically is enrolled in the course and there's also a way you know this is super nerdy but I love super nerdy so we're gonna do this we're gonna come over to the marketing section I'm gonna create a new workflow not based on a funnel step but based on something else I'm gonna say macro cancel we can create a step that removes access so subscription cancelled and macro academy and make it active so this is a really important step because if someone normally cancels their subscription does that mean that they will still have access unless you put this step in that's right so you have to go in here and actually remove this so that when they the subscription stops they're unenrolled from the course automatically so again no need to do this yourself hire a VA track anything in spreadsheets all the tools are built in with click models to handle all the use cases pretty cool yeah so this is it from a starting point perspective what I can do is add lessons and show you how to create some content sure but from a high level we're there so you know depending on how how much further you want to go with this I can continue to build some stuff out or we can say like oh I get the point and we can kind of wrap it up it's up to you guys I think we have covered as well some stuff Fandy in the how to do the lessons and modules but it'd be nice just to see a couple of bits go in there James from your perspective and and talk a little bit about maybe how you would think about that maybe that first module just in terms of the thought process rather than you know we're not going to go and build a bunch of content but that's been literally what we've done is taken the webinar that we was running and we have been successful with and now we've bolted this option onto the thank you page that says hey take a free trial of my academy and when they do that you've got some follow-up emails and if they don't take it you remind them if you do take it it's enrolling them automatically into this course and then they're able to see the content and kind of follow along during that that webinar and maybe you tweak the webinar it's a more advanced webinar Susan's rolling right because she's come from like absolutely nothing on Monday to now she's got these systems in place that are not only really cool but they're actually automated as well and I know I like there's a lot of typing a lot of stuff but it's actually a lot of it's repeating the same things over and over again once you get into this stuff so it's amazing what you've managed to pull off in you know 53 minutes with us talking yeah and I love how I love how courses and digital products there there's so many benefits to having a course or a membership side digital product you know initially maybe Susan was thinking about trading her time for money right she's going to offer some type of service that's great she's probably gonna you know she'll probably kill it but now with this this is kind of opening up a new window right this is a new opportunity because maybe she can start creating other digital products and these digital the cool thing about a course or a membership site some type of digital product is it's like a book or writing a song right you create it once yes you do have to maintain it you're still going to have to market it you know you can't just abandon it completely you're going to have these customers but most of the work is done right and this this thing that you've created keeps paying and it keeps bringing in customers you know from now for a year or two years five years who knows so so this is a really really cool option that she's adding to the different products that she might be offering yeah it's looking good so here's the course from a high level you know it's like I'm using I just brought this into my actual live account so I've got some of my branding here that's not like usually what it looks like but in the interest of just getting something up quickly this is this is how fast we can put together some content so now you just take your phone you record some stuff you throw it in in boom lean or or Vimeo or there's an option to upload video to the clip funnels and have clip funnels be the video host you throw up some digital assets and add some worksheets and you guide someone from zero dollars a month to a thousand dollars a month and you're making an impact in the world and you're making an impact in your bank account and everyone's waiting awesome buddy very cool very very good very very good and and Nav needs in the chat say wow clip funnels will do the heavy lifting and unenroll people and we learn something every time we do one of these lives and James that's that's been a pleasure to watch and I know you know we might have gone around that super fast but I spoke to you earlier Andy about let's get the replay videos let's package these up let's give the share funnels let's give it all the stuff that we've done we'll bundle it all together and we'll just give these guys the the links so they can go and play we all of this stuff and become susans and of the macro photography world or whatever they want to do by the end of the week so stick around to the end you guys and we'll figure out a way to just like give the downloads and the the bits that we can do in the replay I do have a sheet that I give to my my community that's a success path sort of template so you can kind of like plan your success path where the stages and action steps and milestones that's really simple but kind of essential and really important so I can give you guys that link we've got a bonus yeah so if you're going to get the bonus from James and you're going to get the videos the replays and you're going to get a big bunch of isn't that like a reason to go and grab yourself a clickfunnels trial right now and just like sign up to clickfunnels and like on Friday we'll just give you this stuff on the Q&A and you can just go and plug this in and like don't become susan right don't go out there and like start hitting the macro niches and and like go and find something that you're passionate about I know there's folks in here talking about uh cookery and different skills and different things and it's like time take the time figure some stuff out we said at the beginning like have a walk around the pond and look in the water and see what fish are feeding right and which fish do you want to catch and then you know are you fishing in the right ponds I'm gonna do something that you're passionate about right if it's if it's music if it's cooking if it's if it's funnels whatever it is but go and find yourself something that you can really relate to because you it takes longer to become an expert in something you don't know anything about if you go and you find something that you've done for years it maybe it's a sport maybe it is photography I don't know what it could be anything right but you only need to go on a TikTok adventure to find a million people making a million dollars doing a million different things and all of those things can kind of like be funnel hack funnelized taken to the you know the depths of the the webinar or the linchpin or whatever and it all starts in the books it unlocks some of the thoughts in the amazing minds like gems you know just speak to us right we're in the group tag us find us talks with yeah I mean I've seen and you know the idea of putting together a course or a membership site I have seen in my career and my experience I have seen some of the most ridiculous courses and membership sites that make tons of money I mean it's it's I when I when I heard that there was a a course on horse ballet teaching your horse to do ballet I thought well who's gonna buy that you know and this person is making you know six figures when I you know I've seen courses on how to teach etiquette to children and I thought what is this so like weird right I've seen just just crazy I know there was a course that I saw it was on it was geared to hairstylists and at first I I mean I thought it was not going to be successful at all and it became very successful so yeah you're right Danny you can just follow your passion and whatever you're good at there's probably a community out there that is going to be interested in that so very very exciting I think Susan is right on the right track and James thank you so much for showing this showing us how to implement this strategy very very exciting and it's it's cool to watch Susan's life or business kind of evolve right so tomorrow Danny what are we what are we doing tomorrow well like like you said we're just going to progress this and we're going to move this on a little bit further and we're going to kind of wrap this up into a recap we're going to make sure that Susan's got all of the tools and all of the things that she needs but look with what James has just showed you there now and you've got to say a lot you know big thanks to James because you've dropped in here you didn't you know you watched the replay from yesterday or you've seen a little bit of this stuff you've taken a funnel and you've gone right tell me about it do the and and we now we've got potentially recurring revenue but if Susan goes out there and makes I don't know she makes an extra few grand a month two grand three grand four grand and she's enhancing this offer and she puts the price up over time and she moves from that founder launch to this is it it's ready and we're charging you know I don't know two nine seven a month that's big bucks we're a thousand members right so if you had a thousand members paying you two nine seven a month we'll do the maths right and all of that is born from the things we've covered in three short look what I don't know four hours right it's four hours of your time to watch these videos and if you're watching this right now and you just like take the link to this or invite people to the group and share this stuff or tag people in the video who you think might be interested right because we've all got networks and if folks we don't mind if people tag other people from the group and go have you seen this that you know you're even like five people ten people watching on a regular basis who are coming back time and time again uh loris made the comment he doesn't understand why there's not 10 000 people watching this thing right there's gold in in the hills and and james just dropped a big bunch of it and tomorrow let's go back let's recap remind folks what we've done and let's look at how we can take susan even further on a journey towards success right to comma club award for susan awesome yeah sounds good let's do it let's do it and james you're gonna be at fun like in live and ambassador stuff and two comma club stuff and funnel hacker tv stuff and the stuff stuff there's all sorts of stuff right and we're just excited got where to do it um you're also live in the group teaching some of this stuff every monday yeah yeah this ongoing thing where it's like let's just show how to use um how to use models kind of pull apart what's working over there and apply it to our own business um and so that's what i'm doing this is like you know investigating the your first funnel sales page and then dissecting it and showing how to recreate it in quick bonus too and i've watched some of this stuff and it is amazing and and you know hats off everything that you're doing and thanks for being such a valued member of the community really because this is what it's all about thanks for having me love it keep doing the thing uh the replay will be up in the group anywhere but we will pull all of the sort of videos together and put them all on a page and then we'll just have one page and give it away on friday so anybody watching they can go back and get it with that i would scroll through facebook cool sound good buddy jam it's been a pleasure andy anything else we we've sort of like wrapped that up in in record time but it's really given people an opportunity now to think well i started off with a concept then i had a logo and i looked at a value ladder and now i was doing a webinar and then a few months later i added a membership course and now i'm actually developing this linchpin and very soon folks will be able to get their hands on the linchpin content and and our gems you've probably got the linchpin book within arms reach at some point this thing will appear on your screen i would imagine at some point in the not so distant future and if you see that stuff like go get it right go get it and don't just get it for the sake of getting it get it for the sake of how are you getting it what is the process that underpins this how does the mind of russell brunson work how does the you know the clickfunnels mind work how does the mind of james work these are all important questions you want to be asking yourself susan and i think from from you know for me certainly i can't wait for tomorrow and and get this moving i think we've got other ambassadors coming on as well ready it's coming on and we've got a few other folks joining us as well so we're super excited and and we'll be bang on time get this thing moving and then on friday i guess uh james more than welcome to come back and and really can come back another ambassador's come back maybe we have a little bit of a q and a what people have learned but this week is it's been amazing so far and i can't i can't wait to see where we end up with this stuff yeah james it was great getting getting into your mind and just watching how how you work um and i hope everybody else enjoyed that too very very exciting and uh yeah we have two more days so i love that yeah awesome but um i think certainly from me go do it watch back you know watch the previous two days if you're not seeing them tag your friends in the group and let them know if they're not in the group and they need to know this invite them to the group we can you know as long as they answer the questions we can let them in and yeah you see these clickfunnels and and we're here to help basically and this is what it's all about and andy james the pleasure as always as always thank you so much y'all and um also i'm kind of on a kick right now of talking about how to launch a lynch pin funnel so i keep dropping stuff in the group so just look out for that if you're interested in actually launching one of these things yeah and we've actually got some stuff of yours in the guide at the top james and once you do a poll you can actually pin it to the guide so go and use like you pin add the post to your guide and people will be able to find it all in one place like it's going crazy people are tagging people i guess we'll see everybody tomorrow right see you tomorrow yeah thanks everyone bye bye
