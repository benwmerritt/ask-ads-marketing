## Transcript
Hey, we're back again! Alright, so this is day four, Friday of the Build a Business series where we focus on the affiliate programming clip funnels 2.0. So all this week we've been having a great time. Thank you so much for Tyler and Turner from the affiliate group who have been helping us out and really giving us all of the insight into why people want to be an affiliate and what an affiliate program can do for you. The really cool thing is that you can get a recurring income that just keeps coming after you do all the work automatically. So if you're unfamiliar with the Build a Business series, what we do is we pick an entrepreneur, a fake person, we invent somebody. In this case, we invented Susan. Susan is a techie. She's pretty technical. She started using clip funnels. And the first business that she came out with was a business for photographers where she is offering services and ideas to photographers and showing photographers how to get online. And then after that, she decides to create a second business where she creates an agency where she's starting to offer help to photographers but also anybody else that really wants to get set up on clip funnels 2.0. And then finally, this week we've been talking about how Susan took it another level where what she's doing is she's using both of her businesses but when she offers clip funnels to her clients, she's using her affiliate link to in order to gain another income, which is pretty exciting. So what we're going to do today is we're going to recap some of the things that we talked about this week and we're also going to open it up for any questions that you might have. So if you've got questions you're watching right now, just drop them in the comments section and we'll be happy to get to those. So yeah, I guess how's everybody's doing? How's everybody's Friday so far? Doing good, doing good. We've got some awesome folks on the stream today, maybe some ambassadors will join us as well. Big shout out to Navni over in India watching right now and we had a chat earlier today. I know we're doing a lot of good stuff in the big community right now and really trying to make his mark using clip funnels. So it's a pleasure to have awesome funnel hackers in the place. Let us know where you are on your affiliate marketing journey. Turner Tyler, Carlos, how's it going? Yeah, Friday before a long weekend here for us in the States. So yeah, let's get this over with. I'm just kidding. Let's start early. Bye everyone. I got my squint punks on, you just can't tell. Perfect weather. I was coming in late because I was in Russell's decade and a day day. Decade and day day. Yeah, that sounds kind of weird. I have to admit Tyler's like, you're coming in right? I was like, oh yeah, let's go. So some really cool stuff happening in the room next door. So pretty awesome. So those of you that are watching that are going to get into Inner Circle one day and be in clip phones headquarters. It's going to be worth it. So keep on working hard. But today's going to be fun to wrap it up. I'm just going to turn around. So long because look at the like the stuff on the wall. I'll do the way I'm just look at the wall. I want the one with four, but field. Yeah, should we do a little tour? Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Okay, so Turner, this is ClickFunnels headquarters, right? You're there right now. This is. Yeah. So everyone want to see? Yeah, let's have a look. Let's go. No, they don't want to see it. Give me a hashtag HQ in the comments if you really want to see all the cool stuff. Alright, so I'll take you from from the front door. How about how's that sound? Okay, so if you are in the crazy state of Idaho and you want to come into headquarters, this is where you would come in. That's the parking lot right there. And then this is the, the, guess the glorified sign, right? And then this is Jackie. She is not here. I think she's out for lunch, but she's our front desk. She's absolutely amazing. She's the one that makes everything happen around here. Pretty cool. This right here is where the decade and a day is happening. I'm talking to her quieter because I don't want to be too loud. But so what Russell's doing is with our inner circle, he's helping everyone to do the decade and a day, right? Taking everyone for 15 minutes and kind of helping them out with their business stuff. Super cool. And then that is Russell's Batman suit. Pretty awesome. And then go this way. Thank you. All right. And then he is a bunch of our two comic book awards. Hope I'm not making everyone dizzy here. And then this might be the coolest bathroom hallway ever. But here's more of our awards here. Pretty awesome. And then office space. Some of our, our fun, uh, quick fun little logos. And then if you were to look like on our stage here, this is what you would see with some of our, our workers, our employees. Can everyone hear me still? Everyone good? Okay. Does everyone want to see what we're eating for lunch today? This is good. I'm very excited for this. So this is kind of like our, um, famous sushi spread that, that Russell likes to have here. So pretty awesome. Oh my God. And then we've got some sushi. I'm going pretty cool. So this is very. It's referred in. What's that? It's referred to like, yeah. He's making it for us. Pretty sweet. And then this is our kitchen right here. We just like to eat food and look at people's awards all day. So yeah, when someone gets an award, do you get one in the office too? Right? Yes. Yeah. Everyone that comes in gets an award. We'll get their award on the wall and then I think we're pretty much filled up with space here. And then we're putting the rest of the awards in the Canton office. Like Georgia office. Right. So pretty awesome. And then sitting with click funnel designer, AKA my brother. Yeah. Yeah. So sorry, this wasn't planned, but I thought I'd show that little tour there. Very cool. Thank you. Yeah. So basically, if I'm playing Susan's role, right? If I started with a business, then created an agency, right? And then I am putting my customers businesses through click funnels. So I'm getting recurring commissions, basically, right? So then I can get one of those awards there. If I work enough to, you know, deserve it. Heck yeah. Oh yeah. Oh man. This is a great thing for business owners as well as to have a movement for your business, right? To have awards for your business for the people that you are selling to, to sell so much stuff and with your software or whatever, and so that's where they get one of those awards and they get to think that headquarters like this is so cool. Kind of show every, everyone what you do in your office. Kind of cool that like we talked about with publishing yesterday. Publish often show what you do, show where you're at, show your office. That sort of thing too. So Susan can definitely do that. She can tell, you know, I'm an affiliate for this really cool business. I get people sign up for their software and all that cool stuff. So that wasn't planned either, but pretty cool. That's awesome. Thanks for the tour, by the way. I've never been there. It's going to be six years working in key funds and I've never been there still. I think this year I'll go there for to work alongside the great there. Come on over. Yeah, really cool. Really cool what you said, Turner, about the different different things that people can win. I mean, that is one of the strategies that we've been talking about all week, right? Gamification and and doing different types of challenges, offering things that people can can either win or subscribe to. And so I don't know. I think maybe what we could do is talk a little bit about some of the things that we learn or some of the cool ideas that we heard this week. But I think that one of the one of the best ideas that really, really made the gears turn in my head was about, you know, just offering different types of things. The links that you showed Turner for the affiliate program. If someone joins the affiliate program, they get all these resources, they get a bunch of links and swipe copy. That right there was one of the coolest parts for me this week that I learned about the affiliate program and just how easy you guys make it for someone to join and be successful. So yeah, that was definitely my favorite part. I think Dan have is still building bridge pages as we speak right. That's like the most awesome like tour. And that's that's kind of like people saying the feast of the gods and the jams. And I think that also shows how well walks are looked after. You can see what you've just said, Andy, about, you know, the way that we're looking after affiliates when providing all the stuff you go in the kitchen and there's like guy in there is like hand rolling, the finest sushi. Folks might take the two comic club awards and folks might just want to go in there and like join the buffet line. And but there's a big thing about the culture and looking after your people. I think he's very important and also that can translate right now. If you're an affiliate and you're signing people up to your offer that you're kind of looking after them with the bonuses and the support calls and all the rest. And I think that's going to send out sushi as a bonus right if you join click from my link and I send you a big bunch of sushi to you. You might that might be the that might be the winning thing. It might be the bonus of all bonuses, the bonus of all bonuses right you sign up and you like when you when you subscribe in your first month up and you've made your first payment at the end of the trial we're just going to ship you this huge box of sushi to your house freshly roll. Maybe that's a new thing right physical bonuses and. Like yeah done every year I'll be back in two weeks right. Well, Well, just one more thing to add as I'm overhearing a lot of what Russell's talking about with the decade and Dave. He's talking a lot about ascension as well right section is in the business and what I mean by that is always having your customers to continue to have something to buy or ascension and training. Right, we've got to CCX inner circle category kings. In Atlas right so those are multiple things that people want to get to you because people at to CCX really looking at the Atlas right or really just looking at the inner circle. I think that's massively huge right and also with click with our click funnel affiliate program we have a dream car program which is so cool. I'm not sure if we have a dream car trophy in here. You'll have to look for but we have the dream car trophy that affiliates will get once they've gotten over 100 people signed up with their click funnels link, which is even cooler that we also pay them 500 bucks a month towards a dream car of their choice, or 1000 bucks a month if they get 200 people signed up. But really just to get that trophy with presented to them in front of 5000 people presented by Russell Brunson and Todd Dickerson. Wow, that's cool. This is a trophy. I have to find it somewhere. It's a steering wheel. It is like super unique. So ascension is massive. So if Susan was hearing this right now she's like, Oh, I want that dream car award. What click funnels to pay for my car. I just think that's so fun and valuable. It's a real thing and just the these sessions this week have certainly, you know, ignited a fire and quite a few people was like, I do need to get back on the affiliate journey or start the affiliate journey. And there's a lot of folks out there who may have looked in the affiliate area and not know what to do maybe they've registered. You just go back and watch these previous three or four days and we literally ran you through a big bunch of stuff. One thing we did want to talk about a little bit was the sort of like ethics, but I guess you guys giving the downloads and you're giving access to all this stuff. But it would keep this moving on the Friday. If there's any questions, drop them in the comments right now because you could get an answer. You could get this thing rolling over the weekend, right? And you know about bridge pages and you know about where the links are, you know about the offers and you've got the swipes and you've got the emails like bonuses with all these things that we've covered. It really has been very cool this week and just to sort of like the icing on the cake having that little tour of HQ. There's a lot of money on that wall, right? So that means that click funnels clearly is doing something right. It's clearly working and you're promoting an offer that you can promote with confidence. I think definitely promote the confidence. It's a big thing you're not right guys. Absolutely. You have to believe in what you're promoting and that's why we also find that maybe even going back to share funnels we've kind of beat that to death but are the affiliates that do the best are the ones that are using the software right and a lot of times that means they're have a share funnel that they can share but they believe in it they're using it. They've done it themselves they've seen it work. Yeah, there he is. Put a mic on him. Kidnap. Come sit down and eat sushi right. Maybe that's a feature in the group for in the future and sushi with whoever right. There's a lot of power in that building a lot of great minds and it's, you know, listening to that stuff in itself is probably gold. And as much as we can translate back to the members and we are getting some questions dropping in the chat right now. And one question coming in. I'm not sure if you guys can pick that up it possibly in the affiliate group and I'm not seeing it in. We're in the main group is nav neat and I don't want to be an affiliate marketer as the front end. I want to share things about click funnels, some funnel types and other things. How can I do this so he doesn't want to make like click funnels the core business wants to kind of do the affiliate marketing sort of like behind the scenes. Yeah, I can I can jump on that so I'm sorry what was the name of the I'm not seeing the comments for some reason. Yeah, it's a little bit in the main group this one from Navi over in India. Okay, perfect. Yeah. So usually everyone that is a click funnels user, they claim that maybe their mentors Russell Brunson, or they just love our click funnel stuff right. So what you can do is you can reach out to your email list or social media or whatever, and just say hey, I really would like to help you guys out and what you to learn from from. Someone that I really look up look up to Russell Brunson. I want you to see the software that he helps and come up with right. And so that's a great way to do that. So hey, they came out with your first funnel challenge. I jumped in this week you want to try to even do it with me on certain Monday. So that's a great way to get them in. You don't have to call yourself an affiliate marketer. But you can definitely provide and help people out and you're always just helping people out right. And so just calling affiliate marketing just serving people within your list right this is something so always giving your stuff to your list help these people out with maybe put those offer or something they can try out. And I think that's the best way to do it. I think you're going to be surprised affiliate marketing may have whatever rapper it now, but it's becoming more accessible and more desirable. And people are going to be more into it, but just serve your audience with click funnels offers. They're going to get a lot out of it just like you have as well. And you might even get some commissions out of it too right couple full circle. I think starting small but in my opinion always having the link available in a way that you can remember. And maybe it's not a bridge page inside of ClickFunnels 2.0 we've got a URL redirect thing and you can put your affiliate link in there and then create your own link from your domain. So it could be like I don't know Danny.com forward slash click funnels forward slash first funnel challenge whatever right so it's easy to remember and should the opportunity arise. If you're having a chat conversation with somebody and they're like hey how did you build that web page how did you build that thing I've been following you for a while that's pretty cool. You're like I usually think all click funnels, but you don't want to be trying to think of this like affiliates dot click funnels dot like in a big bunch of long like string of numbers. You just make sure you've got those URLs shortened or something that you can remember. And then if you're in a conversation with somebody even if you're unlike, you know you show somebody on your phone it's like hey yeah you just go to whatever dot com forward slash click funnels and folks. Right I'll check that out. Make a note of that. So you try and give yourself like when the opportunity arises, but it's not your core business it's not what you're doing on the front end. Very soon you probably think man I need to do more of this and you figure out creative ways of weaving that in. But if you've got some links set up and you just have in conversations before the opportunity will arise. Yeah, and I want to do it. If I'm Susan right and I'm helping photographers create courses. I created a course for photographers then I created my agency and then I'm focused on photographers right. So you what you can do if you want to, you know, promote affiliate stuff and it's not only click funds right it's you can you can use bridge pages in click funds to promote other photography photography courses, maybe photography masterminds another, you know, if you don't have one a photography membership, you know, anything. Basically, so if if I were Susan. So, how can I say this idea came out out of Leslie, reminding us that as long as we're serving. We are providing value right. So if I am Susan, I want to help photographers like sell their portrait services. Let's say. So imagine how many photographers are in each city, trying to sell their services right so you can create like in your agency. Get your IP from your agency and license it like certain dude, opening James did right and license it to photographers in each city and you see in you sell it. You know, franchising it because it's not a franchise, but you said it as a franchise without selling the franchise right, but you say hey, I got this IP with English will do will gain, I don't know, 30 customers in the next 90 months, or I'll give you your money back right. So now you have something to you promote click funnels you promote maybe an author responder, you promote tools that they will need that will give you a commission, and you you have basically for income streams out of one business like the IP business, selling the that content that you have the knowledge you have, click funnels tools and other memberships right so everything just think macro and then get it to an each like okay. Better way. Take your niche and then go macro right the other the other way around. Let's click the funnel right. Let's let's go to the phone for affiliate marketing. So, let's go photography. What does photographer needs to run their business, and then break down all the things you can do to help with content with tools and with with support, for example, monthly call with support or a monthly mastermind for all the cities, but was working now that was working now put in photography mastermind right. That's it you have like a million dollar business right there. Easy. We have like in a facial basically. What's this guy's name, the one who creates the coolest webinars of all time like in the Grand Canyon. The name escaped me, but he's he's he started with a photography business. And now he's doing that shields, team shields, team shields is amazing dude. Like, it started with a photography course. So now imagine what you can do right. It cannot be like, please go. It's going to be in in every show this year. So we'd love to meet you quick quick announcement right quick out here. Yeah, without a doubt. And I think that of like, there's not just click funnels as an affiliate program we've probably got the best affiliate program in the world right we're biased. You know, you get the support you get the chance to win stuff you've got these guys helping you out. But I think if you can think what else does somebody need. Maybe they need graphics maybe they need, you know, and if click funnels doesn't provide that you can fill the gap with another affiliate product. You create an around the business and it's using the same principles. It's probably an affiliate product for everything a growing business needs right and you can plug that in. It's like accounting packages and specialised things but you can also add your own training and stuff as a bonus and create that package that you can literally give to somebody and say hey, you signed up to these things you've got all the tools and I'm going to show you how to do it click funnels kind of covers the majority of those. But if you can fill in any gaps with other affiliate products then like Carlos said you've got those different streams of income. It's like this could potentially become your full time business and be your front end. And you start off that thinking well, I want to do this behind the scenes. And the more you get into this the more you realise the potential, the more that you will unlock. It's like the main message I guess is get started right and the best place to start with all of this stuff right there inside a click funnels account link up with turn a link up with Tyler, get yourself in that group as well and get yourself out there and start promoting right and start small get it in the conversations that you're having. Yeah, absolutely. Another thing we haven't talked about so much briefly is if you have just like a general website funnel hub for your business with like a resources page, you know just throw a link in there. Right it doesn't have to be like your main thing that you're promoting just having a link on your resources page or just kind of in random blogs or whatever There's a tool that I use that I find useful like over time, you will get people to sign up for that and it doesn't have to be pushy at all it can just kind of be like a little side thing that you have and in random places on your blogs and resource pages and things like that. Yeah, James says he's building his resource page right now so funny you mentioned that. Drop the link. And we also literally we showed you on that on that page that you get with all of the swipes and copy and different things emails and stuff that we've put together for you on there there's like little ads that you can put down the sidebar of your website right. Curiosity killed the cat is the old saying and people going to see this thing these are expertly designed to catch people's attention. Right, these ads are designed because they convert and they're all they if if Turner I don't know if you've got that page handy where you can just show folks like the sort of assets and resources. Again, or maybe it was Tyler that showed it on the on the other day, but if you just bring up that page to show folks the ads because if you're building a resources page, you've got those assets those little images that promote the challenge they promote the trial click with you just drop those in. And you make sure your links connected on there. If somebody is browsing your page or maybe on your blog for example, people expect blogs to have ads and things down the side right. That's kind of like what happens you go on a blog and there's a bunch of stuff and then his ads that pop up in between make those click funnels because it's relevant content. Right and this is being dropped in the in the in the comments right now these this is like the power of these guys right the affiliate affiliate managers at click funnels is like you need something and it's there it's there. Go in there grab your assets. Have these two resources page James do it because you wake up one morning and you've got this like we're sending you money email from click funnels and you have what did that even come from you might as well build this stuff into your page right and go out there and then the commission is powerful. Yeah, and you're email. Thing at the bottom where has like you're about you like whatever so put it where you wherever you want. Always if you think of oh you're going to think of me as a marker. They're not worried about that right just put your links where you want and see where see where it's going to go right. But yeah this is this is a fun wrap up let us know if you have any questions Tyler and I always talk about this we are your affiliate managers right. If you ever need more help or ever want to get on a call our schedules are always open for you all we want to help you out the better you do better we do right so what help you out as much as we can. And if you have any other questions let us know in that the comments there will definitely hit them up we'll keep watching the comments there for any questions that pop through it we got you anything you need we got you. What about the swag. What about the yes. Yes we're going to put it we're going to leave it open for one more day. Let us know in the comments. What is your plan of action after watching these last few days. What is your detailed plan of action to start promoting today. Let us know we're going to start promoting your first phone challenge or you're going to promote PLR funnels you start your email list. Let us know in the comments there and then we're going to pick somebody or maybe two people and we'll send you a quick one on swag package with gift cards all sorts of fun stuff as well. But put those in the comments and we'll pick someone by Monday. Get that sent out so have it by the end of the week so let us know if that sounds good. Put them in the comments and we'll send them out. It'll be awesome. We'll make it worth it to you for sure. Another comment just coming in. I've heard about affiliate marketing. Is it good. Now you need to go back and watch from like Tuesday session right because we're firing this week we're like yo this is this is the thing this is what you need to be doing but check out the stuff is it good. You know we're not responsible for your results right. Some people could be marketing things. I think I just saw who posted that I think it had been a little bit of sarcasm. Robbie might know a thing or two about. I'm just I'm just saying a Facebook user so not. I think that might be some sarcasm. We're going to see where far that went. And yeah go check it out. Check it out from Tuesday. Ask ask another question. Here's a good one. I think we missed it. James is asking for my bridge pages. Should I have my own opt-in or should I just have buttons with my affiliate link. You definitely want your whole opt-in that's that's almost. Aside from the fact that a lot of platforms won't let you post a link straight to an affiliate link so you want a bridge page like having your own opt-in is like 97.7% of the reason that you want a bridge page right so you capture that email. Then if they don't take your offer on the next page or buy your product or whatever it is you're building that email list so that you can continue to remark it to them so like 10 out of 10 times I would recommend having your own opt-in on there. Yeah. And tag the person as well right so if you've got like you're just building lots of bridge pages for lots of different offers make sure you can sort of segment that list. Looks like hey these guys signed up for the trial. Tag them trial these guys signed up for the whatever tag them whatever they keep them separate and then you can mail them separately. And if you are going into that realm of what another offers like other softwares from other places or whatever you know send the video people video stuff send the funnel people you know share funnels and templates and things that are going to be relevant. Sometimes if you if you try and mix it with too much contrast people like well that's not my thing and then they'll unsubscribe. So try and segment and make sure you care to for that list of his click funnels list click funnels people who signed up for click funnels things always try and stay relevant in the future when you're mailing them. And I think the big win for all of us doing that is hey do you need any help building your funnel depending on your capacity of course but that's always a cool thing to do make sure you segment your list. There's always a funnel builder certification you can grab right. Yeah, without a doubt. Any other questions coming in drop your questions in the comments because we are and going to be also giving away some swag as we've said and want to know your plan what you're going to do are you going to take action and we're going to try and collect these over the last four shows over the weekend and then Monday and our question and answer when we're back to normal schedule and the right and we'll make sure that we're doing well. We'll make sure that we've had a chat and we'll pick somebody and we'll send out some swag and some goodies. So if you've got an idea what you're going to take action on drop it in the comments. 100% one more last plug. If you are thinking about buying a funnel hacking live to get by it today right.

I mean and it's not a hundred percent requirement but it's pretty hard to get in that lunch room and eat sushi with Turner and Russell if you don't go to funnel hacking live first. So like you can do it without but probably I'm going to make up another statistic here probably 96% of the people that are going to be in that room eating sushi started the journey to that room at funnel hacking live. So you need to be there. Yeah. You watch the documentary you guys either live and breathe the documentary right but it's like anybody watching if you've not seen that I think he's been taken down right and it's like oh man I watched that thing I watched it like twice. It's one of the most amazing events and unfortunate that I've been a few times and I'm caught wet to get there this year but man do what the man says right and if there's a bonus in that as well just for sending your receipt to Turner then like. Have you seen how many other bonuses are attached to this this thing as well it's like there's craziness going on from the moment you walk in the door and be in the room get in the room. Yeah in case I just went to the FHL story.com and it's still it looks like it's still available. I'm not sure I haven't clicked on the button on the page but in case anybody wants to take a look at the FHL documentary it is really really good super exciting and you can find it at FHL story.com. It still seems like it's there so man the time it hit zero but the video is still playing. Maybe we don't want to say that too loud in the office and like somebody just goes on there and edits the page and it's still there you get a chance to watch it do it real quick and get your tickets. Love it well should we send them off this has been a fun week. It has been a fun week and you guys are awesome and have an amazing weekend everybody and any other questions that we don't obviously can't get around to now we pick them up in the comments don't forget to drop your little plan for affiliate marketing you never know you can win some swag as well and if you do go and get a full like backing live ticket and blow up turn is in box and you never know what you might receive on top of that as well as an extra bonus but you've got to do that within like the next few hours right this is not going to be Monday Tuesday next week and buy it to be further they're probably going to sold out.
