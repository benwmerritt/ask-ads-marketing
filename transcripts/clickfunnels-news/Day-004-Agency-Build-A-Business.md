All right, we're here live again. Hey, everybody. So, there's Carlos with the ClickBones logo hat. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. We're back. My name is Andy, and what we're going to do today is we're going to continue with our Build the Business series. We're really excited because all this week, we've been talking about how to build an agency. So, what we did a couple of weeks ago, we actually started this series a couple of weeks ago with our avatar, Susan. Susan is a pretend person that we made up. We're pretending that we're consulting her and walking her through the journey of starting a business on ClickBones 2.0. So, a couple of weeks ago, we started her original business where she's offering help to some of the people that are in some of her favorite hobby groups. She's a photographer. She loves photography. Hey, Dan, we got another one joining us. And so, Susan is now, we're pretending that it's maybe six months later, a year later, maybe less, I don't know. But she wants to take the things to another level, and she is starting an agency business. So, all this week, we've been diving into some really, really exciting stuff on what will you do if you started an agency? What does it take? What are some of the requirements that you're going to need? How do you deal with your customers? What kind of offers are you going to come up with? If you're interested in learning all of that stuff, just take a look at the replays that we have. In fact, we'll be loading them up into the site really soon. But anyway, let me go ahead and introduce everybody. And we're also going to talk about what you need to do in case you need help with your ClickPonels account. Hey, Andrea. Hi. All right. So, again, my name is Andy. We also have Danny Walsh who's a senior photographer. We also have... And a recent two-cobba-club winner. Woo-hoo! Yeah, congratulations, Danny. Yeah, always cool to have a new award winner. So congratulations, Danny. Thank you. We have Andrea with us who's also an ambassador. She joined us on Monday and dropped some really good strategy. Yesterday, we had Dan Havy. And Dan's been joining us pretty regularly. So thank you so much, Dan. Dan is also an ambassador. And you're probably going to see his videos in the Facebook group. So make sure you comment and say hello. And if you have any questions, you can always ask any of our ambassadors. All right. Lastly, we have Carlos. Carlos is a veteran of ClickPonels. He's been with us for so long. He started in support and worked his way up. And now he's all over the Facebook group as well. Carlos, what's up, my friend? Can you let people know how they can get help? Because there's lots of different ways to get help in ClickPonels. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the first one is obviously from inside your app. You have access to, you know, search, the search bar on 2.0, which will take you to a slew of support documentation that you can also find in help.myclickponels.com. That's the 2.0 support center. And for classic, it's help.clickponels.com. The difference is the night before ClickPonels, right? You can also support, email us at support at clickponels.com. And of course, if we can help, you know, just ask on the group. We're always there, you know, helping people. We, I actually do a lot of like quick five minute Loom videos. Dan is great with Loom videos. He will actually give you custom code, which is, you know, awesome. That will, you know, get you through things or he will actually copy and paste in his videos what you need to do and all that. But yeah, there's a lot of ways to get support. And also 2.0 gets chat support, right? So live support with our most experienced agents, which is an awesome fit. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you so much, Carlos. Well, I think we can, I think it's a good time for us to just jump right in. So Danny, what do we have for today? Oh, thanks, Andy. Everybody for joining us as well. We're trying to be super efficient and have a slide for each show. So we're kind of following on with this agency theme and Dan, Andrea, awesome to have you here. Carlos, pleasure as always. Andy, it is building momentum, this thing. So super excited. So we've done the kind of a little bit of a recap talks about our client Susan and she's gone from helping folks in the Facebook group to building a little membership site. And then she started offering more and more funnel services. She's kind of been in again this week looking at, you know, this possibility of creating our agency. Andrea was on with Susan Leddison earlier in the week and they outlined three types of agency model that you could do. And then we've sort of looked at positioning and we talked about clients and do's and don'ts with Dan and the few other folks yesterday. We're now at this point where she's going for it. She started bringing in clients. She started getting people coming through her funnels. She's at the point where she's thinking, well, this is moving, right? And I want to go from this handful of clients to like major league, right? She's ready for this stuff. So she's really concerned that she doesn't have enough to offer. And we started talking about the value ladder a little bit and she's like, tell me more. How does she add more to a value ladder and how does she actually increment as she goes? So this value ladder gives her services she can offer that are increasingly more expensive. And she wants to talk about that a little bit. She wants to talk about outsourcing because she can't do everything on her own. And she wants to make sure that she's actually practicing what she preaches, right? So this is kind of where we're at with it. A little bit about finding the right partner or partners in the agency. So again, it adds value, but it makes sure that Susan's not like overwhelmed with a flurry of clients. And then later on, just before we close, I just want to mention slightly a little bit about potentially enhancing the existing offers and what's on the value ladder potentially with some other products that Susan doesn't necessarily need to own, such, deliver in the sort of affiliate scheme of things, right? So that's kind of where she's at some of the questions that have been tabled. And it'd be great to grow these out to the floor. I see Andrea's nodding. Hopefully this fits. But the value ladder and like the products that are offered by an agency, this can potentially go on forever as you get bigger and better and stronger and more capable of what you're doing. But just for folks who might be watching, like, what is the relevance of that? Is it relevant at all? Is it something that you really need to look at? Is it the right time to discuss in this? What's everybody's thoughts? It'd be great to hear us. I'm just laughing because each one of those, I'm like, oh my gosh, that took me like a year to figure out. Yeah. So it's a, you know, I don't think that traditional way that we look at value ladder necessarily applies to an agency model. I think that there's a big difference between your business model and your service model. And as an agency, getting really clear about what your business model is, AKA, how do you generate revenue? What is the payment arrangements that you make available to your clients? And maybe what are the payment tiers, right, that you're working in? And then your service model is, I think then, and they go hand in hand, right? Your service model then will determine to your point, Damian, the like infrastructure building and the capacity that you have to do it. And it's like these two sides of the same coin, right? So again, going back to if you're the type of agency that is, let's say the order taker agency, right? Then you could probably handle a lot of volume, right? And so like your price point, your cheers might be a little bit more clean cut and simple because it's like, I do the things in this box, right? And it's super, super carved out and niche because they're coming in and taking an order, bada bing, bada boom, you're fulfilling, right? And then it is just a matter of like building people who can do that exact same thing, right? And just turning and going versus like if you're in a co-creation model, like what we do in geek out, the service model can go very deep because we want to understand the business and we want to be involved in the business a little bit deeper. And so there has to be room for all of the 101 things that you cannot plan, right? And so we need to allow ourselves more capacity and time to be able to be there with clients to do that. So then our business model, we have to have price tiers that we know are like right now are stratified, right? We have the super high paying packages that we know we're going to take more of our time from a service model standpoint. And then we have our quick, what we call entry level projects that are like middle of the road price point. But they're more scoped. And so we know that we can take, you know, 10 of the entry level and only two of the big guys because our service model. So I think the value ladder to me doesn't make as much sense when I'm thinking about an agency. It's more about what is my service model based on the agency I want to run? What is the business model based on the money I want to make and do those actually fit? And then let's run with that. Yeah. Kind of my sense. What I would add to that is the 30,000 foot view, which is the marketing of those things. And as we were discussing yesterday is if Susan, in this case, our avatar is absolutely brand new. She just got into this business a while ago. I forget what her product was, but it doesn't really matter. So she wants to start an agency. Well, how does she start an agency? And this kind of goes to the value ladder in many ways is she's got to get some at bats. She has to work with some people and how do you get working with people as normally you have to do it free the first time, second time, third time. Maybe you have to get your chops. You've got to learn what you're doing. You've got to do basic things like figure out a basic contract. You've got to figure out everything soup to nuts as a single individual. That's normally how you're going to start out is as a single individual. And then one thing down on the list further was partners and people you're working with and those come in later. But most people don't start an agency with 10 people already in place. Susan, in our case here, she's starting by herself. So she has to figure out not only who does she want to work with, but what she wants to do. Well, how do you do that? You do it by getting a customer. You work for them for free and then you go, okay, I liked this bit. I hated this part. And then you do it again and you go, okay, I liked this part. I hated this part. Well, guess what the hated parts. That's where you got to find somebody else to do that because with Andrea and Susan and Nicole and I when we work together, we work together very well. And this team kind of came together mostly because of Andrea, I would guess over time, but it came together. Because none of us are good at all these things. You just can't be. I mean, I'm actually a pretty good copywriter, but I don't do any of the copywriting for our stuff. But I do coding. I build some of the sites and stuff like that, but I'm also not great at the design. I can't figure out how to run Photoshop to save my life. I mean, every time I got to do something in there, I got to Google it first and walk through the instructions. So, you know, that's the process you have to go through is not like, okay, we're just going to start here and Andrea got it right. She's got the big picture, all that stuff. But this is somebody coming straight in off the street going, okay, what's the first thing I do? Well, the first thing you do is you take on one customer and you see what happens because you may find, oh, man, I hate this agency thing. And then you go do something else, but you got to get a customer first in order to do that. And usually that means working for free. Yeah. And I think the way the value ladder fits in the agency model is the services you will be adding, right? It can be one step at a time, adding a service. Like, for example, let's say Susan got really good at generating traffic and converting, right? So she's more on the marketing strategy side of things. So she offers, you know, free strategy sessions to start getting, you know, her shops like Dan was saying. And then, okay, I did a strategy session. I sold my first consulting. So I guess I have a consulting agency right now, right? It's not a traffic agency. It's not a full-on marketing agency. It's a consulting agency for marketing strategy. And then she, her clients will start asking for, okay, now we got the funnel. Now the strategy. I need traffic. Come on. Help me with that, right? Oh, now I have to go and get, you know, a partner that is good on that, on that thing, right? On, you know, getting the right amount of traffic for the strategy to convert, right? Or getting it from, you know, Facebook or YouTube or TikTok or whatever, right? So I guess what I see the latter in the agency is that one service first and then adding another service. And then you start building your team and your, you know, your outsourcers and whatever you need to do. But that's how I picture, you know, an agency starting for Susan, right? I am a consulting first, a consultant first, or I am a traffic girl first, or, you know, I am, you know, whatever specialized, right? So I always go back to, you have to be really, really proficient in something and be an expert before trying to sell it, right? Because we actually get in the Facebook group and it's like, I kind of find it funny, but it's really interesting. Really, that, hey, I sold my first big client. I need help and I'm like, calm, please. Yeah, like, oh. I would say, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that's how I see the value that are in an agency, like if we put things over things, yeah. Yeah, really good points. And I just wanted to add that, yeah, you do need to focus on one thing and everybody's got strengths and weaknesses, right? We're all good at some things because our brain just is attracted to that. And then there's other things where we might need help or Google, right? So there's definitely times when you make plans and you can do most of the stuff, but then you need to outsource or get some help. Another thing I wanted to mention is that sometimes you start your business, you get started and you stumble upon another niche accidentally, right? Susan, our avatar, she's in the group where she's into photography and she's teaching photographers how to get online. And it's specifically macro photography, right? Which is a really small niche. Most people like portrait photography or landscape. But then guess what? She maybe she has some kids in soccer and the soccer coach asked her, hey, Susan, can you take pictures of the team? Right? And then all of a sudden now she's doing portraits and maybe she wasn't good at it at first, but she's got this assistant. So yeah, there's definitely times when you might stumble into a different niche or or even sometimes you might think that you have the right niche, but then there's people pulling you from the other side, right? So I think I think it's really important to have your your eyes open and just be aware of other opportunities as well. And I would say on that same note, though, Andy, I would say definitely have your eyes open, take advantage of the opportunities. But then if you need to kill the baby, kill the baby. And what I mean by that is when I was first starting, right, I can make somebody a great funnel and Dan and I can make pretty amazing membership sites. But it doesn't matter how great our funnel and our membership site is. You don't have a traffic strategy than, you know, a zero, a conversion on zero is zero. So it's like, you know, I can't do so. I kept hitting this problem again and again with my clients. And frankly, I don't I didn't like traffic. I knew I didn't want to get into paid ads. I did a little for you in that world and I'm like, nope, I'm out. That's not what my brain and my heart love. So I was like, I can't do it. I'm not I don't want to do it. So but I kept hitting this traffic problem, right? And so then low and behold, I had a team of designers at the time who were all really into social, right? They give us like, I'm learning Instagram. I'm learning Pinterest. I'm learning, you know, like, how do we be social content people? And I'm like, all right, I'm going to ride the wave. My team is interested. We have the skill set. I invested in this massive tool for social media management for agencies, right? Because I'm like, we do it like how hard can this really be? Right? So we dove head first and we're like, okay, we're going to publish on every single social platform because this tool allows us to do it. We have amazing analytics. We have graphics for every platform. We have a way to convert it. I have a videographer like we can do this. No problem. So we started like, we had a system. I had air table intake so that the clients were out there shooting the content. We easily converted it into social. Like I had a copywriter that went in and came to the post. Like we had the whole system down, right? And it was sucking the ever loving life out of me. I hated every minute of it. Like all of the management of it, like no matter how good the system was, the payment and like what I could get from a price point from clients. I couldn't prove the KPI even though I thought I had like the best possible analytics system we could ever buy and use. And so it was sprout social for anybody who's interested, but it was like I, I was like, so I think we took on four clients, right? And I could get them in the door, but then again, like just the day to day work of it and all of the effort that was needed for what I thought was very little return for both the client and for ourselves. And I was like, I know like abort abort. So it was like a, and it was painful. It took us probably a good six months to get out of those relationships because like we're so deeply embedded, right? Like to get out of the relationships, to get out of the contract, to get out of the business. And I still had the problem of I don't know how to help my clients with organic traffic. Later, I have found an amazing solution and we figured it out. But I think had I not had that excruciatingly painful experience of trying to do the service, I don't think I would have landed in the service that we currently offer and the understanding of what we currently offer. So I would say yes, follow it. Yes, do it. Do it in small numbers at first and be ready to abort mission. If it doesn't work and pivot. Without a doubt, without a doubt. There's some stuff that comes to mind from all of this is that quite often you can like Andy said, I've this kind of like accidentally stumble into this other niche and you could meet somebody. I don't know. You meet them. You know, maybe it's like you said, the kids are playing soccer or whatever it is or you're at a bar and you talk to somebody and you get into this idea because you live and breathe marketing or you live and breathe your agency stuff and somebody tells you what they do and you go, I can do that for you. And then you're like Monday. Oh, now I realize that the magnate and you can accidentally recreate the value ladder for one person just like there and then. And it's like, I've just invented this concept for that person's business without knowing anything about the inner workings of that business. And I've made a big guarantee that my thing that I know is working with my clients will work for them. And that is not a fun place to be because it's so hard to like Andrea said unravel and actually press like where even is the abort button because it's harder to dismantle something and set it up. And I think often as business owners were so energetic and so excited about things. And you just said it's easy to get them in the door, right? But once they're in the door, you've got to be able to do all of that stuff that you led claim to. And I think this is why we, you know, you learn you learn. I think exactly what you've just said, you've got to experience some of that yourself. There's nothing wrong in doing it. But once you soon realize, man, I need to like stop doing that thing. I need to stop roping people in and making these offers because that isn't our core business. And if you carry on down that route, you're either going to go insane, hate your business or shut down and nobody wants that. Right. So some, you know, I know, I know that from experience, but I'm also listening to you guys thinking, yeah, Susan doesn't want to be going down that road. And you really try and need to stick to what it is that what it is that you do. And I think that's kind of like, you know, the value ladders kind of, you know, important. And I think we need to make sure that our Susan understands exactly what her offer is and how to offer it and stick to that, but also having those experiences. I think it is crucial, right? Yeah. Well, as we discussed yesterday, I think it was we, you know, the whole concept of when somebody sees you as an expert, they see you as an expert in everything. And I recently had somebody, you know, I'm relatively decent at hacking some stuff inside of ClickFunnels. I had a woman come in to me the other day and asked me if I could build a gaming app for her. And I was like, I wouldn't know the first thing to do. But you know, I'm almost 60 years old now and I learned that one of the most important words in business is no, because it takes off of what you are. If you have a set design business and you have a set value ladder and you know what you are good at and what you are not good at and most people should learn that very quickly, then you learn to say no. And you just go, no, I'm not going to do that. But it doesn't mean you can't refer them to somebody else. You can't help them a little bit. You don't want to just discard them because I mean, they're human beings like all the rest of us, but don't reinvent who you are. Do not reinvent your business to help one customer who in the end, you're probably not going to do that great of a job with anyway. And it made me think of the old quote. I mean, I've heard it attributed to Ben Franklin, but who knows where it came from. It's basically avoid costly entanglements. And Andrea found out the hard way. What happens when you decide to get involved with some entanglements where you should not have gone and great. You get to learn a whole lot. You get to tell a great story. You get to get up on stage and funnel hacking live and tell everybody about it. And it's great. We all laugh and cry, but it's also a time socket and you can't get that time back. And you could have been doing something else and growing your business while you were wasting your time on that single thing. It's really funny because that always happens to me with in real life, like this marketing life for me is like, you know, a parallel universe, right? And in real life, when I get with friends or with someone who I haven't seen in a long time or something, oh, yeah, and I'm doing this business and my marketing mind, my marketing switches, you can do this, this, this and that. Oh, you can help me. And then, oh shoot. Why did I say that? Like it's really pricey. It's going to take time and you're really too busy for that. And, you know, I go back to Mondays talk when Andrea was here and she was talking about scope, right? The value ladder, it's also the scope of what you can do, right? We can do some stuff to make the value ladder fit in this. So that scope is we can help you with this to get you here, to get you here and here and that's it, right? So, yeah, it's really, really important to have your, your value ladder set and your scope. Okay. This is all I do, even though it can be 120 things in the marketing world. We do, you know, this training, but we're the best at it, right? Well, just to stay on the issue of scope, you also have to think about it as an individual project. So you're talking with a customer, you agree. Okay. I'm going to do X, Y and Z for $5,000. Well, then you get Mission Creek and they're like, Oh, but could you also, and could you also, and could you also, and you have to also remember a, it doesn't go outside of the box that you feel comfortable working in. That's number one. And every time there's an also you go, and I also need more money because I, you know, when you, when you're, when you're pricing a project, you have to look at it to some degree and go, okay, it's going to be this many hours. And I'm going to have to bring in this person and this person and this person and it's going to cost money for those three people. Well, okay. Now this also, how much more time is that going to take? Who else are you going to have to get involved? You know, are you going to have to research things or you're going to have to buy software, you know, you have to look at all these things. And so don't let that scope grow unless there's more money coming into your pocket and you want to do it and it's within your wheelhouse. Really important. And I think you're watching this. And winter, Jones is on saying what a good looking crew of people's. This winter. As well. A few other folks watching. And I think anybody starting out in any kind of business, I wish this like, I wish Dan would have just said this stuff to me, you know, years ago. It's like just, I never saw this years ago. Yeah, it's like so, so important. And I guess where we're kind of landed with this is perfect because we are sort of moving into these next points on our slide, right? Because you mentioned just now down about hiring a bunch of people to do certain things. And I guess that comes down to outsourcing some of the work. Otherwise you're never going to sleep. You're never going to see your family. You're going to be at the computer every day. You've been researching stuff until like the cows come home and for longer. And at some point you're going to realize, man, I can't actually do the thing. The customer's just like crept into into this project and I'm not even getting paid for it and you're going to hate what you do. Right. So outsourcing after you've made sure you've got the right deal in place and you've signed the contract and you make sure that you know exactly what you're doing and how much you're going to get paid. But at some point you are going to have to get other people to help you just for a little bit, right? You're not hiring a full time staff member, but you need maybe a designer, maybe you need an ads. I don't know. We talked to us a little bit about the importance of being able to outsource some of the work. So I think for me outsourcing has been the number one reason why I've even been able to do my agency. So the very first outsourcing that I ever did outsourcing is a funny word because I think in our heads, we think, oh, I'm going to go hire somebody and they're going to do a task and then be done. Right. I think that's what a lot of us have in our head when we think outsourcing. I'm going to encourage you to have a little bit of a different understanding of it, especially when you're young agency. You need something that's a little bit more steady that you can count on because your company is still pretty volatile, right? Like, because you're still trying to figure it out. And so it's really hard, I think, to work with like non stable outsourcing options because you're still working on stability. So the very first one that I ever did was I knew that with integrity, if I was going to serve a ClickFunnels client, I knew that my technical aptitude in ClickFunnels at the time I started was not at a level that I would want to serve with integrity, right? So I joined the TCCX program. The number one reason I joined the TCCX program was for just that's where all my people came from. The number two reason was because they allowed me to ask my technical clients about my clients account because I was a TCCX member and Sarah, she used to be a part of the TCCX program advocated for me to be able to do that. And so technically the ClickFunnels support team was my outsource team when I very first got started because I decided to pay for the TCCX program so that I could get the support. I knew that my clients were going to run into and I did not yet know the answer to. And so that was to me one of the best decisions and best investments I ever made because it was a twofer, right? I got my marketing because that's my community. That's who I serve and those are my people, right? And that's who was like referring and helping me and I got access to additional support that extended to my clients and it was like it was again, the best decision I think I ever made in my entire life with respect to my agency because I had that. Carlos is shaking his head because he's having flashbacks. Probably. You are that Andrew. I literally would have to call every day with support, probably four times a day. Like I was surprised I didn't get like black. I'm pretty sure I help you like a hundred times for so. With different very varied issues. But yeah, no, that's honestly. That's a great way. You know, it's a little bit of a segue of what you get when you go all in, you know, in something, right? In your case, well, it was extra support and marketing and you grew and grew and grew and you know, you're now at a stage where you are in this stage, right? And to me, that's. You know, you you pay whatever monthly to have that and you can next that easily, right? From from that investment alone. So also what you were saying is you have to be really aware of what you can do. That's why I think I have repeated myself a couple of times through the week, but you have to pinpoint your first expertise and what you can do. Because if not, it's going to be hard for you and for your customers. And you know, that thing you said that you have to serve. What was the word you used? And the service, right? Yeah, with integrity. Yeah, with integrity. Yeah, ethically and with integrity. Because if you don't really know what you're doing, you're messing with other people's business and dreams and you can, you know, a shadow dose and it's a harsh reality, but it is something that has that can happen, right? And has happened. And I think it's okay to step into the not knowing, right? And still offer the service, but you better have a support system or an outsourced system. You can stand by that, right? Like, so you have to write the system and your capacity to be able to do that in order to serve integrity in my opinion. And for me, that was customer support through my next investment. That was it. Like I'm telling you, I'm so surprised they still like me because I mean, because I was an annoying customer that I was like, I don't want you to just fix it. I need you to teach me like, why is the infrastructure this way? And like, why did you guys decide to do it this way? I have to understand. Yeah. And we actually love helping because that means that you can solve it next time. Right? It's the same thing you should do with your customers, right? Yeah. You help them with the marketing and, hey, here's how I thought about this. Here's how it worked out. Now you can do it and then you can off board your customers, right? Yes. Because that's a really important thing that I don't think we haven't touched. It's how to off board your customer, right? Okay. We're done. Good luck. Godspeed. Much success. See ya. Right? Because they will keep coming back to you and what Dan was having and can you help me with this and this and this? But they don't say how much will it be, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The first question is never how much will you charge me to do something? Right. Can you do this for me? Well, can you write me a check first? And the reality is, you know, obviously, well, actually you could say it to them that way if you wanted to, I probably would. But the truth is, yeah, I mean, they suddenly think that they're going to move into your house. So you do a project for them and, you know, they're standing there at the kitchen counter with a plate and bowl, you know, a plate in their hand and a spoon and go on the beach. And you're like, no, that's not how this works. This is a business arrangement, just like you go to your office, you work for your eight hours at the end of the week. Hopefully your boss pays you for doing it. You know, this is the exact same way. And I'm thinking, as Carlos was talking there, is we got people who may want to be moving into the agency world who have a very, you know, limited skill set. And that's fine. But you have to understand that there are so many other things. So what are the other hundred things that you also have to be able to help your client with? Because as we said earlier, they're going to see you as an expert in everything. So you may be a fantastic funnel builder. So you build this funnel for somebody. Well, what's the problem you just created for them? You created a problem that they need traffic. Now at that point there, do you just completely cut them loose? Or do you find them somebody that can help with the traffic? Do you partner with somebody who does the traffic? Do you have somebody you outsource them to who pays you a commission for that outsourcing? These are all things. And it's not just the traffic, because you may be great at building inside of ClickFunnels, but are you great at the copy? And sure, we all got ChatGPT, but frankly, you kind of put out garbage when it comes to an actual full blown sales letters. And what else do they need? They need graphics. So who do you have that you can turn to do graphics? Or you can learn how to do the graphics all by yourself. So you're an expert in copywriting, and you're an expert in how to use Photoshop and now mid-journey. And then you're an expert in figuring out your ChatGPT prompts. And then you're also enough of an expert in copywriting that you know what the copywriting should look like when you're done. And should I just keep going? So those are all things that people have to understand going into this. You may have a very small skill set, but you have to understand all these other things and how to put them together to create the package that ultimately becomes the funnel itself. I'll say one more thing on the outsourcing. And that's a good of just taking an inventory of your skill set, like Dan said, making sure that you have the most critical need first. So in my case, it was I knew I needed technical support if I was going to be a funnel building agency. But then the next thing was I think that as agency owners or in our case of Susan, I think that ultimately we talked about this on Monday, that we have this innate desire to serve and we're more fulfillment oriented and we might not be as good at acquisition understanding, right? And like the dance with clients because it is at the end of the day a relationship business. And we're all just crazy humans with our crazy issues and we're going to bump into them when we work together, right? And so I think there is this element of relationship management and being able to navigate those really sometimes difficult conversations. So the very next person that came on my team was somebody who she was a phenomenal designer and funnel builder, but she didn't necessarily really appreciate her like the strategy and the client management part of the equation. And so I was like, well, I was like, we do have complimentary skill sets in terms of funnel building, but she's a way better designer. She builds faster than I do. And she wants nothing to do with client management or strategy. She just wants to be a great funnel designer and builder. So we found each other in a shared community, the design hacking community that we're in. And it was kind of like, like, and so it was one more of as an agency owner, I was like, okay, I know I have that skill set of being able to do the client management aspect of it. And I love the strategy part. I think I could give up some of the funnel building because I know it well enough to serve with integrity, let her go and do that. And it was that marriage that was again, another like ClickFunnels 2 CCX investment was like a spike, you know, it was then bringing her onto the team. And this is Nicole Coons now part of our geek out group. That was the second part. And so we were able to run for at least a year and a half with really just her and I and then we brought in a couple people here and there. But it was pretty much we were the core and we had an agreement right away where like, I have this role for the agency. She had this role and we could just then run. And that was, I think, when we think about outsourcing again, she was willing to come with me in the ups and the downs of the business, right, where it's like, hey, I'm going to try to consistently pay you every month this amount, but I'm still in early stages of my agency. So no, like, we might have a rough month or we might have a great month, you know, but like, there's going to be some bumps and she was willing to go along for the ride because, you know, she wanted to grow together. And that was huge. Instead of me just finding random designers along the way and paying them, right, we were able to build something together because she was willing to go with me on the bumps. So that would be my next recommendation to Susan of, you know, find your immediate need, but then find your stability person, you know, the person that's going to help you grow. Well, and we've been talking a lot here about the customer satisfaction side of the equation here, but we haven't really talked about what the avatar needs to know about the customer acquisition side of it as well. How does this person even get the business in the first place? And then there's other aspects that have to be looked at is, okay, depending on where you live, where you are, what kind of legal entities might you need, what kind of contracts you need, even things like setting up payment gateways, things like that. I mean, all these things have to be brought into the equation and, you know, taxation, you know, all that. I mean, so there's about a million different things that somebody has to look at going into this. Now, do you have to solve all of them on day one? The answer is no. You have to solve all of them before you get your first customer. The answer is no. Because again, you're serving first, possibly probably for free or very cheap. You're serving a couple of people just so you can learn how to build your business. Really useful stuff. And it resonates because I've done a bunch of these things. And I think the things you're saying about the dance with clients, you know, the ability to say no, actually, how do you acquire the customer? Like I said, there's a gazillion ways to do that. But if you're starting off small and you're giving value and you're helping people for free, but I think it does kind of, again, link nicely and jumping if you will, on the importance of kind of practicing a little bit what you actually preach as well. Because we know that, for example, ClickFunnels uses ClickFunnels, right? That's an example of a company using its own thing. If you're an agency that does footals, one would kind of expect that you use them at some point in your business. And personally, I found that people trying to sell something that they don't use, they don't do a very good job of it. And you look at that in affiliate marketing, right? Somebody pops up and goes, hey, buy this thing. It's awesome. But they don't actually use it. Oh, man. I just added that go. Practicing what you sort of your own methods, I think is kind of important. And I know we've kind of talked a little bit about the partnerships and bringing in the right people as well. So we are kind of melded in through these next few points. But there are a lot of different elements. What advice would we give about making sure that you are practicing what you preach to a degree? What's your thoughts on that, you guys? Yeah. It's really, it's kind of a no-brainer because you want your client to have the best type of platform, right? Because you want them to have, if you are good at ClickFunnels 2.0, then you want to make sure that they have the platform that you have so that you can max out your effectiveness. And the cool thing is that ClickFunnels 2.0 does have the affiliate program. So you might as well. It's a win-win for everybody. I know that next week we're actually going to talk more about using your affiliate business, your affiliation with ClickFunnels 2.0 to make another type of income along with your agency business. So yeah, you definitely want to use some of the tools that you specialize in, recommend them, and make sure that your client has access to the best type of tools. Without a doubt, without a doubt. And very important, for example, Andrew, you mentioned earlier in Dan, the membership sites and things that you do. And you look at your stuff and you use memberships in your business. You talk a lot about the customer journey and would you believe it? You use these in your business, right? And talk to me a little bit more about that. And maybe we are going to lead into this sort of concept of enhancing the offer with affiliate products. I think we are kind of painting the full picture for our client. And whether she runs out of the door like this at the time at the end of this, or she's like, I'm all in. It's entirely up to Susan, right? But I'm seeing the value of this and I'm seeing the full picture. Where are we going? I think it's really important, actually, and this goes back to Dan. And I actually, I got to give a shout out to Jim, too. He's doing a great job of this. And that is your traffic strategy. I'm a big believer in pay to play. I'm a big believer in get in the room and network, but that plays to my strengths. And so that's how word of mouth and those investments have been able to help me with my traffic. But I think that on this note of using your platform, you can kill two birds with one stone by, I think YouTube is one of the best sources out there for you to get traffic and for people to find you. And using any kind of click funnels keyword is hot. Like you will pop up in search engines on YouTube if you do that. And so I think by shooting content and talking about your use of the product and how you use it, or even just telling your client stories and how you, what you've been able to do for them, I think is huge in terms of operating from integrity, using the product, but also in your traffic strategy of showing what you know and talk about it and demonstrating it. So I think that it feeds on itself, right? In terms of being able to grow and build. And I, yeah, I think you, if you're not in the product that you're building in or you're working in at least like 10 times a day, then you are not doing it right. I think you, I think you just, it should be the thing that you live and breathe every day, right? Because it's the thing that you are serving and what you're doing for your clients. And so, and you have to be in it in order to really serve in the most capacity. Depending on the service that you're offering as your avatar here, the, you're right. I mean, you have to be seen as an expert somehow. So if what you're selling is building a click funnel sites, you're right. You better be putting out something that makes you appear to be some sort of an expert in some way of building funnels. Now, that doesn't mean you have to be the expert on the one who's, who's doing the coding, who's, who's building the site. You don't have to necessarily have to be an expert on the copywriting and all the other things, but you better be an expert on something regarding the funnel process. And you better be able to. Annunciate that and talk about it. Now you look at somebody like Russell Brunson, obviously the man is the absolute expert when it comes to marketing strategies and things like that. But I doubt if he knows how to use paint or, or, um, you know, he probably, I'm actually, I think he's probably a really good copywriter to be honest with you. But, um, there's a lot of tools that he's not going to know how to use very well. And that's why he can outsource and hire other people to bring in, but he is clearly the expert. He's clearly putting his message out to the marketplace a thousand different ways about his expertise in marketing. So if you're building something regarding the photography business, you better be putting stuff out there to the world to show that you're an expert in photography. If you're the, you're doing this micro macro photography thing, you better be showing, you know how to do it. You better be able to show the results. Here are the pictures that I have taken and prove that to the world because nobody's going to knock, knock down your door begging you to help them. If they don't think you're an expert at it. Yeah. Yeah. And that's why your agency can be like transplanting your business into someone else's, right? If, for example, if you have a course, your, your value ladder or your leach pin, let's just talk about leach pin, right? Your leach pin, uh, your, your entry level pro and your leach pin one is the, the community, a big community, right? Which you have a mid-gear or, you know, a most incredible free gift ever about like an entire course on macro photography. And then you have like a live conference every twice a year. And then you have a mastermind where you go around the world and, you know, doing photography, right? And my agency can get you, yeah, you know, uh, the, the beat of the gate clients getting stuff for your photography locally, right? And that's it. And, and I just, you know, share my funnel to your account. You know, you get the click funds account, I share my phone to your account. Let's add your, your emails. And that's it. And that's my agency, right? It doesn't have like to be a, because you think agency and, and just like, for example, in my mind, it's a, it's a, it's an office with, you know, 10 people there, right? But it like going back to what Andrea said on the first day, it can be a one man agency and what you sell, it can be a couple of clicks as, as easy as that. And outsourcing design and logo design, you know, or whatever to someone else. But that's very well, you can very well charge, you know, five 10 grand for that because, you know, you can, like Danny saying, you can say, and you can express how the value of paying that, you know, what is the, the missing cost opportunity, right? What, what is costing you not having this site, right? Well, I made a hundred grand off of this part of the leach pin, which is my local, you know, getting my local courses, right? So I teach you how to, how to do it. And I teach you how to teach it. Now you can have this side business and you turn this into your new, new opportunity, right? Like, like in the book in the, in the blue one expert secrets, right? What is a new opportunity? So an agency can be just that. You don't have to think about, you know, this is a full marketing agency. If you specialize in photography, it can be like an agency for photographers, right? So yeah, that's, that's like, like my ending speech on this. Yeah. So good. So good. So look, we kill time on these because there's so much value and it's so good to listen to and we value everybody's time. Um, we kind of went through that sort of partnership a little bit and talked about, you know, the importance of finding the right folks. And this is not going to happen overnight. Right. And once you get the right folks, you can take your agency to that next level and you can keep adding your services, your offers and grow as big as you like. But if you follow all the guidance that everybody's kind of set out over these last four days, you should have a real good understanding of not only what to do, but some of the things not to do some of the pitfalls. And this little training alone, whatever it is, four hours of your time to watch this could potentially not only save you a big bunch of stress and effort and, and, and doing things wrong, save you a bunch of money, but also position you in the right way to go out there and get it right from the, from the get go. And it's so, so interesting to listen to these things and think, yeah, being there, done that. We don't want folks to make too many mistakes. And I think the learning that we're getting from this is, is, is amazing. And like Carlos just said, you can literally be on your own, delivering that very specialist service and do that for as long as you like. And you don't need to scale any further than that. You just need to keep rinsing and repeating this thing. You collect your money. You say goodbye to the client once it's done and you keep moving. So you can make this from what I'm gathering. You can make this as your own custom agency that serves your needs as much as it serves your clients needs, right? 100%. Yep. 100%. But in order to do that, I think you have to know yourself and how you want to serve first. That's the only way you can make that decision. And so I would say just keep leaning into that with every project and trying to understand that. Great, great, great advice. Um, we are moving, but we're also running out of time this week. Andy, it's been amazing. I've learned a lot of stuff this week, right? Where were we going from this point? Yeah. So, I mean, exactly. I learned like a ton. I'm just captivated by all the little tips and things that, uh, that our ambassadors have been sharing. So thank you so much. Um, and, uh, I'm kind of bummed because it's over, right? This, uh, the training, the actual training that we did for this week, uh, we've kind of come to the end now, but the good thing is that tomorrow we're going to get together again. All of the ambassadors have been invited and, uh, we're going to do a Q and A and a recap. So actually, if you want to jump in and anybody that has comments, remember that anytime we're live, you can always drop comments into the, uh, into the comment area. And if you, if you have any questions or if you want to, uh, do something like, uh, like winter and say, what a good looking crew of people's that's, uh, that's going to be awesome. So thank you. But, uh, but yeah, I hope everybody can join us tomorrow. We're going to do a Q and A. We're going to continue talking about this same topic, but, uh, we're going to kind of let it naturally flow and, um, and answer any questions that we might come in. So yeah, I hope everybody can join us tomorrow. Yeah, it's going to be awesome. Um, going forward, we've just had a message, um, from the guys in the affiliate team, um, next week we are going to be enhancing our offer with, um, some affiliate products and Susan's at a point where she's ready to get her onto common club or wide ride. She's like, whoa, I've done all I've been doing working this, this whole year and, and it's finally coming together. None of this would have been possible, uh, certainly for me without click funnels. And I know you guys, Andrea, what you're saying just about tapping into the support down the fact that we're building in this thing, day in, day out, the click funnels is certainly the, the way to move forward. And when we unlock the click, affiliate program and all of the other goodies that, uh, you may be that folks have not even seen or they don't even know about yet. I think this is a fully rounded business. And look in, in the three weeks, what we did, like 15 hours, right? 15 hours is not a great deal of time to spend to consume the stuff that we've covered across three weekly sessions. And you go out there and, you know, read the books, get your click funnels account and start making stuff happen. In fact, I'm excited. Yep. Yep. It's a great opportunity to be a part of doing. Yep. Without a doubt, without any closing remarks, uh, before we wrap up today, folks, because like Carlos, I'm out. I'm, I'm just ready to go and like do some stuff. Yeah. Build some funnels. Right. Let's go. Oh, and, um, I know Danny, he plays it a little bit modest, but if you guys are participating in that contest, when you land on it, just take a little look at the URL. That's all I got to say. Pretty amazing. Danny is amazing. Um, I'll say no more. Say no more. We will, um, continue to play it down. Ishmael's joining us. Um, he's here. Um, just a student learning with the looks of it. So you're welcome. Come learn. Um, watch the replays. They're all in the feature section of the group. Right. And Carlos, we're working some magic to get all of this stuff up on their own landing pages as well. So you can come on and you can watch each series and Carlos is working on some notes and little workbooks that accompany this stuff. And who knows where this may go. And if folks have got any suggestions and if the things they might want to see in the future, we're all ears. Right. So yes. Oh yeah. That would be great. If we could get some feedback. If there's something that you would like to see, um, we would love to hear about that and, uh, get started on it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think from all of us, thank you everybody. So much. Um, we'll be back again tomorrow. Take care everybody. Bye. Bye.
