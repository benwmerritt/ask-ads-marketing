What Susan's problem or what she sees as a problem is that in this group that she's in Now that she's been Quainted with click funnels 2.0 and she's getting pretty good at it Susan is a very technical person She's kind of good at graphic design too So what she has thought of is maybe it's time for her to offer her services To other people and she wanted to start in a photography group And in some specific it's a macro photography group, which is you know those those big lenses But they're not for taking pictures of something far away They're for taking pictures of something very very close right like bugs and flowers and things like that So what she wants to do is she wants to help these type of photographers Sell their businesses online on Tuesday. What we did is Danny who's also an ambassador talked about funnels and and offered some ideas for Susan to Actually start offering her services and what she did is she came up with the idea of Teaching people how to put a watermark on their pictures so that so that they can protect their images and they can actually Start thinking of ways to sell their pictures online Okay, and then yesterday James Karen came on that's another one of our awesome ambassadors we have a ton of them and James came in James is kind of a one of the experts of the linchpin model and so he went just a little bit into the linchpin model, which is a Continuity What's the word can continue Yeah, thanks guys Continuity model so that in other words a membership or a course or something that Where people pay on a subscription? They're paying on a constant basis and the cool thing about that is this is a way for you to get some income that keeps coming in After you do all the work. It still keeps coming which is awesome, right? so today We have ready and what ready is going to do is we're gonna kind of have a discussion on the parts of a sales page because Susan our entrepreneur that we've been helping throughout the week is ready to actually start selling some things and What we're gonna do is we're gonna talk a little bit about the parts of a sales page Because you don't just put you know put the price of something. There's there's there's some concepts that go along with a sales page Isn't that isn't that right ready? absolutely so So ready, why don't you tell us about the if somebody were to come to you because I know that you work with other people that are using click funnels to build their business and If somebody came to you and says hey, I need to build a sales page. What are where do you start? Okay, so before sales page I'll take a few minutes and we'll understand Why people buy and how people buy and this is where I start with my clients as well so first thing is why people buy either they have some kind of desire or some kind of problem they want to solve and Then you provide your solution as to achieve the desire or solve the problem This is the time when they buy now everything starts with the who Who you are selling to who is your ideal customer who is your ideal of that and That's your foundation on How entire sales page the message the copy the design will be? Anger too the next thing we have is an offer Your offer is this is the something that sells the message the page is to make it automated and make Make make more sales basically because when you're sleeping somebody Goes to your your sales page read and buys things like that. So first we need who? your offer and How you're going to sell your thing? So in this case Susan is doing the membership site Which is a monthly subscription and now Susan will need a sales page to sell his month Sell her monthly subscription program And we're going to build or we are going to discuss how to build a sales page for that to sell Susan's monthly subscription program for Micro photographers right so this is where we start first identifying who in this case we have Who is a photographers? my micro or micro photographers who want to make more money or sell more services and The offer is a monthly subscription So this is a starting point this is starting point awesome, okay cool, so so from when I Back a long time ago when I was 18 19 years old my first job was at a shoe store, right? just like Al Bundy and It was a great time. I love this. It was such a cool job and The boss taught me some really really important things that that I mean it's amazing that they carry on over into what we're talking about today and What the boss told me is that every part of the store is Valuable real estate you got to put the right things in the right places So for example as soon as you walk in there's there's a you know There's a setup There's like a bunch of shoes and you got the sale the hottest shoe the latest, you know model and It's got the discount 20% off and Then you walk over here and there's a different section the women's section the kids section the men's section everything has Valuable valuable real estate even the pictures that you put up on the wall, right? You don't just put a random picture you put a picture of somebody with their brand new shoes. They're excited, you know a Guy that's maybe doing exercise and he's got his brand new adidas or something like that and I guess that's what you're trying to say, right? There's parts of the sales page that you know the offer needs to go in a certain part. There's there's a language You know, there's there's parts where you're talking about the problem. Is that what I understand? Yes, so there's one saying that we buy something When we buy something we buy our future self So you are absolutely right, right? You're absolutely right so in this case Susan's customers will buy either if they if they have some kind of problem Let's say they already have a business, but there is Sales are low not selling more services and there is another people another set of people who are Interested in this kind of business. They have a hobby. They know like I want to do this I like it, but they want to start in so that's these are the two people to segment of the people For Susan's who now when I when I talk about the angle now who Susan wants to attract This isn't one people who already have a business or who are complete beginner? So that's when we talk about the angle. This is the angle and that's why we need to know of who Understanding where your ideal customer is right now at and where they want to be We'll talk about both the cases first if if the customer if the ideal audience is at the business at the low business level What is there one ideal desire and what is what will be their one ideal problem? they want to they want to survive or thrive both can be the cases and Basically, they want they have a problem which is low sales and they want they have a desire to make more revenue So if Susan is trying to attract this kind of people the message will go differently The the message will be more of a problem solving kind of thing But when they're talking to the different set of person different set of people who has a passion and they want to explore a career in this field at this point they Mostly are a desire driven like I want to do this. I want to do this. I have passion so the message Goes like entirely different angle with inspiration and things like that So that is what we talk about like angles. This is what the angles are and Once we identify that then we can build out the entire set the sales field the funnels everything now I'd love to ask you who we are going with Already existing business owner or somebody who have a passion and want to business I want to build a business in this field and we can go and talk about in that area so people can understand better. I Think what would be really good really is you've kind of give us a little bit of an example for both But at this point Susan she's kind of sold some stuff to the hobbyists like she had to put your logos on see photographs I Very basic digital skills These guys are not quite a point where they've got a business But they are in that transition and now she's moving them slowly over time Towards maybe they're gonna set up the first, you know full themselves and they're in that kind of transition period But she knows she's got them because they've joined the membership They're enjoying some very basic stuff that's really linked to the photography But now she wants to kind of hit them with this well, wouldn't it be cool if you could do this full time? So you kind of in a transition But if you give us an example for both and then go down that route if you can work with that I think Really happy Okay, so Okay, so let's start with this the audience types so there are mainly I Know this is a little bit of theory kind of thing But we'll go to the will come on the practical things in some time. Let's get the basics clear So there are three types of audience basic human natures People who are emotional in driven like they take decisions by motion like okay. I like it. Bye Then the second set of people are Logical like more on the logical side. They understand what is it? Why do I need it? Will I use it? Do I need to buy it right now or the budget fix things like that? And there is the third kind of people who Who wants things but kind of have a laid-back Attitude towards things and they need a scarcity scarcity in the sense like hey this things is running out We need to give them a motivation or some a little push for them to buy so these are the three types of people and This is then the anatomy of any sales page So if I can if I can share my screen We are a little bit short on a time, but I'll show you the best sales page I have ever seen I'd like to see the best sales page that you've ever seen that all pleats it is a click funnel sales page Let's bring it onto the screen for you there So my is my screen invisible and my visible so this is the best page in terms of everything and Mostly when you are when you're a beginner or something when you're just trying out the sales corner in your business You can just go with this flow and you will succeed trust So let's start with the first section first section is mostly for emotional buyers and Something that gives you the is a gist of what it is So we can start with the headlines headlines are always either curiosity driven or Resulting or a desired driven so in this case if we can look at this and if we can analyze this What does headline reads the marketing secrets black book? This is a curiosity Built in the desire like I want a marketing secrets. I want to build my business I want to scale my business and the curiosity is it's a black book what it what isn't that what isn't that I need to know and Then we go on the on the sub headline So what is it? What is the role of sub headline is? When we have evoked the motion when we have revealed some results some Desire or some problem the role of sub headline is to give a little bit more Context to the headline so in this case We can see clearly 99 marketing secrets that will change your business and change your life So this gives a lot more context to the headline and Ultimately this makes you want this so hard like I wanted Whatever it is. I wanted say if you're an emotional buyer This four or five lines are enough for emotional buyer to get into this So Then the sales page reads want to know how we took click for us from zero to a Million in sales in just three short years Then get your free digital copy of the marketing secrets black book this from that you can see here This is our call to action. So Any sales page starts with a hero section hero section is a is a part of page Which your audience will see on the first Blames so everything that you can see on the screen right now. It's your hero section The the goal of hero section is to do three things first Make sure to convey What what you are I did first identifying who you're talking to So if you have seen few of you websites, this is like hey attention this this this person So identifying who they are talking to and revealing people who are not meant for this page second is to To generate curiosity by result desire or problem and And then Give them the call to action like hey if you like that Here's how you can get it Hero section is for emotional buyers So if you're if you're one of those people you will buy you'll get this on By reading on with this I don't Think when I when I got this book, but then I read and this is the fabulous piece of coffee amazing And Then the logical part starts so what is a logical part? So I have I have I have made you curious like this is something amazing that you want But there are people who want to understand like how it will help me What it is in the product or the offer and that's where we use a logical part So the next page the next part of sales page is mostly the story story of how this product was born and basically Basically this works as like we had this problem because of this problem we had Some consequences and to solve those problems and consequences We created this product and now we are helping you with the same part That's the entire gist, but we'll break it down step by step so This part contains four things first the story of the product Born like how this product was created Why why? Did I created this product the story of you having the problems? third what it is in the offer or the product that Your audience can be beneficial And not think is how The product that you're pitching to them. Okay. Now, let's analyze this part The marketing secrets black book inside of this free book you will discover. Okay. Oh, what what will I discover? And then then die story starts of Russell Branson how it was Okay, let's read it. So For the six years They had a podcast of marketing secrets every day They were sharing how the click funnels is going in real time and what's working what's not working and after doing How many I guess now some episodes few hundred episodes They created this 99 marketing secrets that that were working for them and for their clients aka Inner circle people. So this is how this is the story from here To here This is a story of how marketing secrets was born So in this case for soon, let's talk about Susan if she's talking to the people Who want to get into the business of the photography? How she was struggling or with protecting her protecting her Work how she was finding clients how she was delivering how she was charging and how she made a his or her business and That will be the story of this monthly subscription if she is talking to the to the people who are Who have a desire to start business now on the other side the people who already have a business So here's to to relate to with the audience What does who she means Susan needs how she had faced some problems in her business? How she how she overcome those business and how she turned her business up and down and She will going to share those secrets with the existing business owner for them to grow scale and Get more revenue grow their business and of course better than life. So these are the story on both the side Of course, okay This one membership can be for both people But the talking point the angles the problem is different. So this is how we put it Okay, so I love I love how you picked this this sales page is a real sales page that is very successful, right? I love how you pick this because it has all of the it gives you the ability to be able to talk about all of the parts that you're talking about now I am I Think maybe because I'm older. I'm more of a logical buyer now, but when I was younger I mean I have junk all over my house You know stuff that I used one time and never used it again because of those emotional you know the emotional buying right there's a lot of people that do that and And then there's a lot of things that I bought You know that where I had an emotional drive to buy that thing and I'm still using it Okay, so yeah, there's lots of great stuff that that you can use these these tactics these strategies techniques whatever you want to call them to To draw people draw people's attention to your page and get the people interested now This is this is great as well because right now what we're looking at is the actual story and It goes into the the reasoning and the benefits and things like that. So this is beautiful ready Yeah, and actually copywriting and sales and everything It's it's more like more more on a human understanding rather than a tactics and things Tactics and things comes later. But like understanding of human and that's what we are doing right now So yeah, so this is the story because if I don't know how this product was born Why this why did you created this product in the first place? I'll not be able to understand the benefits of The product and how will I use the product in in my business on in my life, right? And that's why we need a storytelling in in every field of the business Okay, so the next part is so this was a story of how the product was born now This product needs to what is the product and how you can get the product So get the results that you are looking for now We are trying to more like relate to people because of course if people don't relate with you they won't buy So what this product will give you what this product will do for you So this is a fact no nonsense get right to the point Compilation of my best marketing secrets why this this is a fabulous line right because this identifies for the people who Who are already the business owner who are doing some good? Businesses and like they don't have a lot more time to do read all the things or listen to all the podcasts and everything They just want like give the point and how can I implement? So? Okay, yeah, I can like literally go into the copywriting basic, but no yeah Okay, then there is insider steps. So now we are we are slowly graduating To the what the product is again So this product has inside insider tips strategies techniques tweaks and little more formulas That have helped Russell Branson take their company from zero to hundred million in sales in three years So who wouldn't want to know that no? Of course, everybody would love to how I can do the same for my business even if I do the 10% of this Pretty good. So and what's great about this secret? So why now here's um This part is amazing because this part's create Gives you the satisfaction and curiosity because now you know like this is short secrets Instantly implementable skills and now gives you like a more desire like oh now I need to know this what it is now So Yeah Now you're talking about marketing sales and you get all of these things in back all laid out for you and all you now From this point you are talking in how they can get the black book and all you have to do is swipe and hack every single Tip tricks secret and time test strategy for your business Okay, no, sorry, so we are going a little bit more deep into the what so it It describes each and every Chapter each and every chapter or the secret of the Book it explains what what you get that this creates more curiosity the trust factor and of course More often from that So yeah, I have a question. So for this part, he's kind of going through the different chapters of the book, right? And if you have a course or a membership I think I've seen some people that put the like the thumbnail of each module And they'll just put all of the different lessons and modules, right? Could could you do that for a membership or a course? Yes, of course we can do that and the the trick of doing this is to To identify what each and every section of the program or what each and every section of your offer Solves the problem for example Let's take something out of this Okay, so let's take this one. Are you focusing on the wrong things don't fall prey to this sneaky business killer is Instead of zero on this. So what this test is? This is not the probably most ideal example for course Kind of things, but let me tell you how to do things for example Let's take the example for Susan only she is selling to the existing business owner so the first first part of her course or the subscription model is To help them get the get the business on the stable stable path So what are the three problems she needs to solve first? She needs to help them get the lead flow so that will be the headline for the for the Chapter and then sub headlines of how we are going to help you solve that and how this chapter We're going to help you and do the same thing. So we laid out the entire Program in in a way like identifying them a problem like this is the problem and this is how we are solving it What does this things to? First it it shows that you know what you're talking about Second it shows how you are going to help them solve our results So this means a trust We talked a big bunch about building trust as well in the previous And sort of sessions when we did we sort of did the webinar and the stuff that James was talking about and it's super important That you do lay out especially if this is a new product to an audience that doesn't quite know if the need it yet, right? So if if you're looking at this and you kind of in that transition from maybe it's a hobby Maybe something fun you want to try and build a business and then all of a sudden you see this thing You need to be able to make that decision and like you said really on all of those different levels Right, so one of those levels will appeal to you as the buyer But as a somebody writing copy you've got to kind of like hit That point for that person and if you just go in there with like you said at the beginning I'm the just a buy button. Hey buy this thing people go. Well, what's in it for me? Why should I? You know they start looking through the bank account Can I afford it if you do all the things that the guys have done on this page with this product? I remember this product from when it was first launched, right? And if you hit all of those points what you're actually doing just like you're doing the webinar is Getting rid of those objections and it all kind of comes back to the stuff that we're talking about in those books as well So we've kind of gone full circle really right we're bringing this back to principles to psychology to almost like sales one-on-one, but people Reading this and they're gonna be thinking oh well. I don't get that. I'd now I get it Right, so there's always gonna be something that gets you and if you just try and skimp on your Copy or you just try and skimp on your messaging or you don't take the time What really showing you guys is is to actually lay this out in full you might be missing sales and You know as you as your audience gets more used to you and you get more used to your audience and more used to selling Of course, you can leave a few things out sometimes you could do this just with a video in an order form But even in that video you're gonna be hitting these points and it's a fantastic example That takes you through all of these steps and then actually really goes into detail about the product and Often you see these big long sales pages right that take you on this like half a mile scroll If you're scrolling when you get to the bottom of this thing You're probably gonna buy it because you've taken that information in and we've tackled so many objections So it is you know even their cherry pick just for you is really trying to make this personal right in the in the approach and It is a fantastic example of some of the stuff you drop in in this really easy, you know pure gold We do have some comments popping through we've got some fire blazing. We've got some thumbs up from Scott and Navneet said he purchased some groceries today because of the scarcity But where do we kind of go from from this section now because I notice we're getting towards the bottom of the scroll really right Yes, we got just two things left so it won't take more time but yeah sales sales and marketing is basically basically talking to the people and Giving them what they want simple messaging Okay, I won't take more time and yeah So then the entire compilation of what you are going to get the entire compilation of this everything from here Here and now you have a call to action now if you have noticed one thing There is only two call to action first is here and the second one is here at the last and this is Actually with the intention of if if you're not going to buy this at this point You will need to know all the information or all the stories that is that has been laid out on this page Because if you don't buy on the first section you won't buy this without reading the entire sales page and Because this is for free. We don't have a scarcity or something like that, but mostly we Do a scarcity thing if you are selling the product the scarcity Okay, here's one thing that I'd love to tell you like don't do the fake scarcity. That's that's not a good thing so there are some amazing way to do The urgency and scarcity stuff without lying to your audience so I don't know the best example right now But if I find I have list I'll do the video in the group as well. Is that fine Danny? Yeah, yeah without that and I think Scarcity is something you've kind of hit the nail on the head there really right because we do get folks out there We will just come on there and say, you know I remember like the days of the like the automated webinar when that was first emerging and you'd get people coming on going Hey guys, we're live and hey Andy. Hey really, but Andy and really didn't exist right? These was like a bot and it was just like some chat room bot thing and a recorded video And it was engineered in a way that it looked like it was live and it was you did the video You put this in there you created your own little chats and you add all this together and people started to get wise to this stuff Right and then these marketers who were they were crushing it at first Slowly the sales started to dwindle and people became wise once people become wise wise to your lies Is that a new phrase and you can move wise to your lies and You can't recover from that right and I've known people who've gone out there and they've used some kind of fake BS Scarcity business and they've come on there and they've said hey There's only a hundred seats available when this is like a digital product, right? It's fully automated. There could be a million seats, right? Try and get with using some authentic Scarcity and if you are going to come on there and say hey, we are closing the cart on sunday evening at 7 p.m Go in there and close that cart absolutely People are going to be like whoa Because people don't believe this stuff anymore, right? It's like the the old boy you cried wolf stuff Yes So there's one of one of the one amazing Marketer and he's my favorite the one thing he says like and of course Russell says this as well I don't like your audience that trusts you for for some reason don't like them Simple you don't you don't want to be coming on your sales page and doing all this energy and time and you know all this Information and then get to the bottom and Susan like put some stuff that's not Actually true and the audience might believe it the first time But would you believe it the second time on the you wouldn't right because you've seen through it It's like exactly often this happens where they say hey This is a limited time offer and then you could go back and open that thing in an incognito window and that office still there Right, so you're like oh man I you know I've just remodeled my house to come and trust this guy and buy this stuff and I could have still got it like Six months later or you find out that they're selling it cheaper when they said the price was going to go up That's that's another thing that often happens is You know marketers come out there they build a sales sales page and then they'll say hey whatever it is 100 dollars Whatever it is right and then they sell that stuff And then a week later they realize they're not getting as many sales as they want and they go and do a crazy discount So the thing that everybody just bought for 100 bucks they're now doing for 47 And all of those hundred dollar customers are all looking at you going well a week ago And I know it's these people's prerogative if they want to do that, but it creates a Mouth bad impression your bad impression about you So next time you come and deliver an offer with your fake crazy scarcity that you think is going to work is probably not That's so important right now Yeah, and there is there are ways So important to to remain to stay ethical right when you're doing sales pages when you're running your business It's just so important because people Value that they they value your honesty Now for courses and memberships there are ways for you to have scarcity built into it And it's not artificial for example if you might have a you might have a course And does it matter how many people are taking your course? Not really Okay, not really you could have like like like you said thousands a million whatever but What if you want to have like a vip training? There's only one of you right? Yeah, and and you're not going to be able to Speak and and give the attention to a million people or or even a thousand people So you may have to Have a higher price for this other program and there might be limited spots available So there are definitely ways for you to include scarcity and any type of product Well, most of the products that you offer Even if they are digital even if it is a course or a membership Of course and for susan the best way to do is if she's doing a membership monthly membership I believe she has some kind of engagement or some kind of video qna. So things like that so The best thing is like, okay. I'm not going to open this course for next three months and you're going to miss out on three months and You'll start three months late if you want to start now. This is the right time That is one of the things Yeah, yeah, there's something like that works Um, quite often is when you try and illustrate the cost of not doing something So it's like, you know, what is the cost of not taking this offer right now? Because you could wait another six months before you get this opportunity again You've not learned this stuff. You've not done the work. You've not put this thing into action You've not started your business and what's that going to cost you in the long term? It doesn't make sense to kind of sign up now and and and get into this, right? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So now we have talked about the entire page and Now the next step is to actually Taste the page and then we'll talk a little bit about how to launch your sales funnel Of course sales funnel is a big thing and we are talking about the one part page of it. So Okay so Do I share my screen or do I talk like that? You bring your screen back on no problem at all if you've got another screen to share with us and just checking in the chat Tim's here. Scott's here. Navneet's here. James is here from from yesterday There's a few people watching and I know if you're watching live or on the replay This is all um really good stuff and food for thought when it comes to building out your sales page, right? So Susan's gone from Just helping out in a in a photography group to now she's done a little bit of free training She's got people interested in do some graphics and things like that. She's now decided to add this to a members area And she's got abandoned carts and the mailing list and all the rest of it and now she's ready to start offering various products She's now building out these sales pages and sending these to the list and doing a big bunch of cool stuff And what are you going to show us next really about actually taking this to like over the line a little bit and actually, you know You know, what's it going to look like on mobile? You know, I'm about my colors all this kind of stuff when it comes to designing these things and I guess covering some of that stuff might be useful is that where you're going with this um Well, we we've got only 15 minutes. So I'm going with the just testing thing. I don't know if we can design We cover the design part. Yeah So got your screen if you want to bring it on and show us what you want to show us Okay, so this is the this is the page Template in the click for us. Of course click for us. How amazing them, but if you have not checked the plr Go check that out. So yeah so here are few few steps that I take before delivering the Funnel and to make sure like the everything is working fine So first thing we do is a speed this because if we are losing if you if our pages are not loading fast We are losing on some serious sales. So I recommend using not instagram Okay, so these are the two amazing What page speed this sorry guys happens So this is from the google and gd matrix. These are two of my favorite Uh tools because sometimes this page speed insights gets break down by the page size so we just do we take this link and put this In the analyzer and analyzes what does this? Tools to it gives you the the speed The size of your videos your images and where where you need to improvise Like basically everything that you need to know about your speed based on the page so This is what the tools to give you so what are some of the things sure Waiting, what are some of the things that might slow your page down and why is that a bad thing? Okay, so this is really good good page. Okay, so there there are mainly for okay Let's talk about this any web pages build up build up of four things the text image videos and code right so mostly two things slows up your pages images and videos because images If you're not optimizing your images before putting in on the page It are images are the higher side in the m base not kb's Those are the higher sizes and the videos because we Host our videos on some other platforms such as Zimio or youtube so when the page is loading it takes a browser Some seconds to talk to the Other software that you're using to host the video and get the data on the page, right? So those are the two main reasons that slows your page down So Yes, so this if you get the a I'm not going into a lot of technicality But if you get the a or b you are good to go you are really good to go and Your page is really good and it's it's loading fast And the next is a responsive viewer. Why because We have so many different type of people using different type of devices And we need to make sure that the page looks good on each and every device So for that I use this amazing a chrome extension main responsive viewer The good thing about is This chrome extension gives you almost all the available screen sizes And runs your website On each and every device size so you can see how things Look on each and every each and every screen size As you can see here It has almost all the iphone screen sizes All the pixel mobiles the galaxy samsung The ipad And everything So this This way we make sure like our page is looking good on 99% of the device Sizes right Then when we use a browser stack so browser stack is amazing thing of A tool which lets you run your website and they if they check Your website on all the different available browser like all the browsers that are available in the world And they give you like how your website is running on the browser Next thing we do is the test version So if you if you have your Product page or the opt-in page the first thing is to check if the entire flow is right Enter your details enter your credit card if you don't want to enter like we click on us an amazing thing You can test your finance in sandbox with the fake credit card So basically the goal is to see if the entire funnel is working the way we have designed It to work is it that is it tagging all the contacts right? Is it sending all the emails right? Is it redirecting to the right page is it giving you The right upsell pages and things like that so These are the The testing things that we do before we Go and launch Okay Yeah, this is Testing your your site is so important and it's something that a lot of people don't do right You'll learn that you have to test your site probably after you forget the first time and You know the email doesn't go out or the button is not working or something like that So it's so critical to go back check all of the links check all of the emails Send test emails. So yesterday Well Last week the click funnels team just released something where you can do send test emails right from the editor. So this is a great You know, I just thought I'd mention that because this is a really cool update that you can do Related to what Rydia is talking about right now, but it's so important to To test out your pages. Thank you Yes, because we learn it from mistakes and then you know what happened last week Yeah Testing is important thing before you ship out the if you ship out the funnel declined or if you should if you launch your funnel to your audience Now we got we got some few minutes, I guess Yeah, yeah without a doubt We are going to do a question and answer on the on sort of like the bonus Part of this tomorrow right on this so we're gonna An opportunity to come back and people can ask questions and we pick some questions up ourselves and out of the group as well but I think You know looking at a sales page and going down And seeing all these different bits and pieces and you know figuring out well look, how do I actually tell my story? How do I show people how they can trust me? How do I make sure they've got all of the details? No matter which way they choose to buy how do I call them to action? All of this stuff is super valuable Because Susan, you know She's sat here now thinking yes, I get it and I need to be able to go and put these things together Super important that you don't spend too much time But you spend the right amount of time on each of those things and again it leads back into the books Right so dot com secrets secrets and indeed as you start to launch traffic secrets But are going to come in handy, but you have consumed an amazing amount of content really right and and you've watched and downloaded and and and literally absorbed Hundreds if not thousands of hours of Content and that's where you know you can understand some of this stuff Some of the things you've shown me there, especially the you know the thing that shows all the screens Normally, I would just be like hey desktop and mobile, but you're right. There's these tablets There's different shapes of mobile phone and you see the new phones coming out now that you can actually like fold in half and they kind of like all bend technology moves real quick and as a designer As somebody who's working with clients and there's somebody who's kind of you know immersed in this full world It's so important that you stay on top of this But people who are just trying to do it themselves They might not understand some of this stuff, right and we know how important it is to actually Get that mobile audience and for that thing to load super fast without consuming the data But if you didn't know this You know, this is like so important for your business right now, right? Yes, so this I recommend these things for even a beginner if you're a business owner doing your sales funnel on your own These are the important things. Why because in last last six or eight months I have experienced that most of the audience of my clients are on mobile So now we have shifted from desktop design to mobile first So we just we designed the mobile screens first and then we move It to the desktop because of course it depends on the industry you are in but Yes mobile optimization and the speed of your pages because at this moment we we have 100,000 options to do things. Why would I stay on a page? It's just taking longer than six seven eight ten seconds right so that's why That's why the these are the two things get your pages to load fast and make sure those are mobile optimized Even if you're a beginner So yeah And now the last part I'll take five five or so minutes on how to launch The funnel because that was the one of part. So yeah The best way to launch any funnel is to build your audience first and then launch So in this case what Susan has done is incredibly amazing thing is to first talk about what what you have to offer Right, then you take you create some content or help people do a pre-webinar So this is how you you're gathering data. This is for like whatever i'm talking right now is for the new people or people who are launching new offers You need a data first How to get the data do pre-webinars to free challenges? This gives you the the real-time data like what people want how they want it and how they want to be helped right so That is the first thing build your audience Talk about what you have to offer and show them what you have Then take a small group of people Make sure they go through your offer and get some testimonials of course and then build a sales funnel and make it automate automation and on this point When you have tested your offer you have some testimonials you can go ahead and do paid act as well Other than that there are a few other ways such as having affiliates joint ventures and so many other things that you can do but these are the foundation and this is how any any offer is getting launched like this is how offers launch in the marketing industry or in any industries It's important because I think People sit there and they say I'm going to launch and what does launch actually mean and what does it actually look like and sometimes people think that you just press a button and then like the rocket goes off and that's that's it done but there's there's time and there's these things that happen over time even just Going out there and talking to folks on facebook adding them as friends That's all part of your launch and building up So if you just build a funnel overnight and you've never talked to anybody on the internet and you sat there with like I don't know your mom and your brother and your sister on your facebook When you go and take this thing out there if that's your audience that's your audience, right? So it's important to lead up by doing these steps that susan has kind of taken to get from You know the group expert to the person doing the cool training to making those little offers To then now you've got this little membership going and you've built up some traction This starting to add these sales pages and actual her own product specific products She can take it back to this membership. They're actually considerable price items This is taking time From that moment she had the idea and we could now be into sort of a year of susan's business journey, right? We could be in further than that Some people think you've got to squish all of this stuff into the like a day and that never works out too good So take your time and your patience Think about what's coming next even before you introduce it to your customers and look at your speeds Look at your page loading times. Look at those types of buyers the emotions that you're pulling on and how you can go out there and actually Build this carefully and slowly so that it's sustainable and you can grow this thing Because if you get that right and you've got those recurring revenues as well that james talks about yesterday you're actually gone from Nothing at the beginning of the week To in business by the time we've got to this point on on sort of the fourth day We want to try and wrap all this up on the into you know Some q&a and some different bits on the next session But really you could take these steps and a lot of learning from this from what we're really sure james has showed the stuff that Apply this along with your books Click funnels and really start to make some moves in your own life your own business for you your customers And you know it's a pleasure to be part of this and it's a pleasure to have you on ready Thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here and talk about the things that I geek out on in the best Yeah, it's definitely been been a pleasure ready and and uh You know, we we love this type of thing.
