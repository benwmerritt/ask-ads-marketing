Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We have a lot of updates to bring to you today, including, oh my gosh, Russell Stuff, FHL Stuff, Hero Hacker Stuff, we got it all for you. We've been giving away stuff, so we're gonna go ahead and roll the intro and we'll get into it. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. What is up Funnel Hackers? We're so excited to have you here on Funnel Hacker TV, my name is Ben Moot and this is... Susan Lennardson. I switch sides every single time, we're gonna figure this out. And we are so excited to have you guys here. This is, if you guys have not been paying attention, there has been so much value dropped recently. Like, the community is just getting busy, everyone's getting excited because you'll never guess around the corner, Funnel Hacking Live. Let's talk about Funnel Hacking Live really quick and just kind of bring this up. Guys, if you have not seen everything that Russell's dropping for Funnel Hacking Live, we're going to cover it. We're going to give you like a little FOMO release a little bit, kind of show you everything that's kind of happening, but then also tell you what's about to happen so that way you don't lose it because Funnel Hacking Live is crazy. So I just got off a super secret meeting that I'm not allowed to talk about. And we all know that ClickFunnels has updates every single year and they're crazy. And I got a sneak preview of what you guys are going to be able to see, be able to get. You need to be in this room. Like there is no reason you should not be at Funnel Hacking Live. So here's the deal. If you don't have your tickets yet, you need to go to funnelhackinglive.com. You need access. This is going to change everything. Like we're just counting competitors at this point that we're just, you know, it's so exciting. There's so much good stuff that's coming around the corner and you want to be on the edge of your seat getting all of it at Funnel Hacking Live and being able to hang out with everybody afterwards in order to figure out, okay, now how do we implement this? How does this work? How do we, you want to be in the room? Funnel Hacking Live itself is going to be spectacular, but if you're just a user of ClickFunnels or you're one of those who's like, you know, ClickFunnels, I get it. But you know, the software and I want to go and use my software, you need to be in this room because you need to be in the room. There's so much that I want to discuss that I'm not allowed to. And so all I'm allowed to do is hype. So yes, I will hype this. Funnel Hacking Live is a place that you need to be. I've been teasing things to Susan, be like, go check this out. It's just exciting. Like, just trust us. You need to be in the room. That's pretty much our message right now. You'll be one of those people, like you want to be at this Funnel Hacking Live specifically. This is one of those moments where you stand on a peak and you look out and you go, oh, that's the Funnel Hacking Live where we did and ClickFunnels did and you want to be there. It is just going to be absolutely brain dead. Absolutely amazing. So with that said, let's talk about everything that's just happened recently. Is that okay? Yeah, let's we're going to come back to some FHL stuff that we got to show later, but let's jump into our water cooler segment for now. Yeah. So something interesting happened. It was this week that, you can talk about this more, but Russell had his decade and a day event and he hasn't done one of these. Has it been like three years? I think I heard him say somewhere. Yeah, something like that. And so Ben, tell us what is the decade and a day? Okay. So when you're in the inner circle, when you're a category king member or higher, what happens is you're able to fly in. He can't have everybody in the room that just doesn't fit. It just doesn't work. When you're in the inner circle, you come in, you fly in, and he does what's called a decade and a day. The strategy and idea is that you take a decade's worth of knowledge and cram it into a single day and you give a whole bunch of value and you change someone's business in a day. So everyone has the opportunity to be able to sit with Russell and talk with him about these different things. And so it's just, it's an absolutely really, really cool event. There's a couple of sneak peeks that he gave. If you guys are following Russell on social, you saw some of them. One thing that he did that was really cool in the evening was he went live on his social and they went live for the decade and a day. Everybody who flew in and they all told their stories. They told their stories about what it's like to be in the inner circle, what the decade and a day was like. But more importantly, like they talked about funnel hacking live. They talked about why funnel hacking live was a pivot point for each of their businesses, which is a really cool angle that you think of. You know, you look at these people and you're like, I don't know. They're making a million dollars in their business. At least they have a two comma club. You have to have a two comma club in order to be in the inner circle. So they're at this level. I can't be there. I'm not there. That's just not me. And as we hear each of these stories, all of them talk about, look, I went to funnel hacking live and I said, this isn't the place where I belong. And then I talked to people who were selling cookies and had a multimillion dollar business or people who had a small brick and mortar business in the middle of nowhere, Oregon that was making $2 million a year growing their business. And you just talk to these people and you're like, the opportunities are available for me. And so if you guys are not following Russell, definitely do it. That's what's been really busy going on inside of the, inside of the ClickFunnels offices. So that's been the water cooler gossip for a while, is getting everybody to come in and being able to do this. It's been three years since we've done it. So being able to have everybody come in and to experience that again has been really, really, really cool. And so guys, you can go check out all the social stuff over at Russell's. Hi, they recommend it. Let us know if you guys are catching this. Let us know where you were, when, because yesterday Russell did something super crazy too. Like he just keeps going crazy. And let us know in the comments, did you see what Russell did yesterday? Did you see it? Because it had, I don't know how much of an announcement there was for it. I know that the email got sent out. We were live yesterday. Like it's going to start in 30 minutes. You guys need to like make sure you go like leave us, go to that as soon as we're done. It was awesome, because was this the first time that Russell's taught this like publicly to the entire internet community of ClickFunnels? I think it's the first time he's ever done like a public video on it where people can like see what the idea is. Yeah. So what he did was he from the horse's mouth, you get to learn what Lynchpin is, because we've all been talking about it for a while. But we've been talking on behalf of Russell. And so he went live yesterday. You see him drawing it out, talking about like why Lynchpin framework is special. Why is it different than anything that you may be doing already? And like, what are the important pieces that make it unique and why those are important pieces? You can see in the background, he's got Mifkey. If you don't know what Mifkey is, like you gotta go watch this video so you can learn more about it. And this is all in preparation for Funnel Hacking Life. This is what is going to be the topic, the entire theme. The thread throughout all of the speakers throughout all of the days is going to be about Lynchpin. And you get a sneak peek of it in his live video that he did yesterday. You can find it on his page, not his profile, but his page. And it's in the ClickFunnels official group. Yep, it's pinned up on the group so that way you guys can go and watch it. This is a extremely valuable training. For those of you who know who got the Lynchpin book, like this is Russell. Yeah, there we go. Always with in a hand, a finger, a finger with the way for me. Susan's always got it right there. It's this is like to be able to hear Russell train it to teach the basics piece by piece. This is really, really powerful. This is, and he teaches why the Lynchpin is so important right now for everybody's business. And so if you have not watched it, go up to the pinned videos and watch it. This is super, super important and super valuable. You do not want to miss this one. So number one, make sure to go and do that. And then you guys, okay, if we keep some other FOMO away really quick, let's go ahead and keep some funnel FOMO at a distance because there's something that's that they just released that is leaving here very, very, very soon. And that is the funnel hacking live documentary. I don't know how many of you guys have ever seen this before, but every once in a while, Russell will release the documentary and you guys can go and watch it. So if you guys got the email, it's available for you guys. So you guys can go and watch the funnel hacking live documentary. If you guys want to like you can go and watch it. You can go to fhlstory.com and you can opt in to see it or go to your email and go and check it out right now and go and kind of you can go and see when Russell emailed you this morning. You guys can watch the documentary. This is an amazing like walkthrough of what funnel hacking live is. Why does it exist? What is the purpose behind it? What are the strategies behind creating an event like this and why do we do it? You're actually able to see Barry. Oh, there's Barry. Barry Baumgartner is speaking at funnel hacking live this year and she is like the secret behind the scenes powerhouse that makes it work every single year. And so you guys get to kind of see the behind the scenes of what funnel hacking live is, what goes into it, what all the all the processes are like it is. It's a video not to be missed. It is it is so cool. And so if you guys want to watch party, let us know and you know, we'll see if we can do some kind of a watch party like we'll all just hop on together. We'll all watch it together because that would be fun. But otherwise just go to fhlstory.com. This is up for two days. Okay. And then it comes down. So I would highly recommend if you guys are even thinking about funnel hacking live, if you're thinking about throwing your own event, if you're just trying to figure out the brain of Russell and how it all works, you need to watch it. It is absolutely beautiful. It is good stuff. Awesome. I can't wait to dive into it. It's like, it's like 90 minutes. Like it's a full on documentary. It's not like a 10, 15 minute like hype video. It's a full documentary. It's good. And it's not just a hype video. Like we create the funnel hacking life hype videos. This is like, it's in-depth training and guide. Like why are we doing this? What is the point? What is the purpose? So as much as it's a marketing piece, it's also a training piece. And if you stay attuned to that, it's really, really, really cool. Sweet. Okay. Can we forecast a few things? Yes. What do we have to forecast? Oh, we have a couple things that are going on.

All right. One last piece. Let's talk about some hacker heroes, shall we? We have been missing a couple of updates lately and there's been a lot of spotlights that we do about you, specifically user spotlights. And so we had one drop for Mercedes, Mercedes Kelly. And so we just did that. Lord Demetrius does these interviews. If you guys are not watching this on YouTube, it is so cool, so valuable. And you guys get to hear from Mercedes and get to hear her story, what it is that she does and how she does it. And the thing is, we're behind because we should have been doing these for a while. But Susan and I have been talking about all the follow hiking live speakers. And so if you have missed them at all, there is an interview with Jessica Crane. Okay. If you definitely want to catch up on that, we have Sam Quack, Sam jumped on. We have Jamie Lewis. We have all of these different ones that are hopping on that you want to make sure that you guys are watching. There is so, so, so, so much. And each of these are like 20, 30 minutes. They can be as fast as you want. You can do X speed if you want, or you can take it slow and just recognize you're not alone in the community. Like there are people that are pushing through the same hurdles that you have. These are regular day users. These aren't just too comical winners. And so we have one dropping. Lena, who is that really quick? Who we have one dropping in about 15 minutes on the YouTube channel, 15 to 30 minutes. Let's see, who is that Lena? Do we know who that is? We'll see. That would be so, so cool to give that call out. It is who is Andre? Yermiev. Cool. Andre, we cannot wait to see you guys. So if you guys are missing any of the user spotlights, don't do it. There is so much going on that you do not want to miss. Go to user spotlights. There's so many other things we can talk about, guys. If you're not following Russell's podcast, if you're not looking at the ClickFunnels radio podcast, we're going to talk about those later and spotlight some of you guys as you get going up. So share, do all the different things. There's some really cool stuff coming when we are back on on Thursday. Yes, because we are back to a regular schedule mostly, most of the time.

So thank you guys for coming and watching. Huge congratulations to the winners of all the things. And thanks for hanging out in the comments with us too. I see some of you there. So we will see you guys next time. Bye. See you guys next time. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences. But all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating. It's pulsing. I made for something more. And then fear hits us. The little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven, are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking points and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. It felt like I had gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that's made me all of my money. My best selling framework. Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust in you. This better blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning to begin. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt an experience in this one precious life? You wouldn't be able to tell but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People build a sense of belonging here. It feels like home. It's so encouraging because if they can do it, so can I. It's all I'm saying. Hey, next year we're going to get better. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer of ever lived. You find exactly what your business is missing. He's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day they're telling people how they met you. I can live change my entire life because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be blasted. Your legacy's going to be blasted. Movements are about to be burned. My story hopefully gave women permission. You do not have to be great to get started, but you have got to start if you ever want to be great.
