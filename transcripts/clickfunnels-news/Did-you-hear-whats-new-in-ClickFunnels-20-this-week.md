There's a new hotkey in ClickFunnels 2.0. What's up, Funhacker, Simpits, and Bargahere with ClickFunnels, and we recently made some really awesome updates in ClickFunnels 2.0. For example, like the new hotkey for saving your work. All you have to do now is simply click Control and the letter S while you're making changes in your editor or editing your style guide, and all of your changes will be saved. Very easy. And while we're here talking about the editor, why don't we go ahead and actually show off that now you could actually move the text toolbar if it happens to be in your way. Another recent update I would like to highlight is actually our analytics dashboard. It's the same dashboard that was in ClickFunnels Classic, but now it's in ClickFunnels 2.0 and it's even better. You'll be able to see an overview of all the important stats and numbers broken down by page and products here. You can see page views, opt-ins, sales, and even earnings per view. Plus, you can even filter your results by UTM or date. And for the last update I would like to highlight is actually a bunch of really cool updates we recently did to our orders page. This is the page where ClickFunnels 2.0 users can see your customers' orders. Now on the orders page, you'll be able to see detailed information of upcoming invoices, clear subscription prices, and even shipping options. If you would like to see more in-depth details about these updates and more upcoming things in ClickFunnels 2.0, make sure you go ahead and check out clickfunnels.com slash pulse. See you next time.
