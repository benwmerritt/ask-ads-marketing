## Transcript
Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels, and today I'm joined by Sherry Ronning. Sherry is a chef, recipe developer, author, and blogger at From Michigan to the Table, a culinary journey. I'm so excited to be interviewing my very first chef on the show today. Thanks so much for joining me, Sherry. Yay, I'm so excited also. OK, so I could talk about food all day. I know I mentioned I'm really excited that you're the first chef on here. Tell me a little bit about how you came to ClickFunnels as a chef and how you use this for your business. I have a website called FromMichiganToTheTable.com. So I have all kinds of recipes on there. And I created an e-book, a digital cookbook. And then I've also had the desire. The reason I got into blogging was to share recipes. I wanted to share my recipes. And so I decided I wanted to create a course and share that. But I wasn't exactly sure how to do that. And yeah. And so just talking with my blogging community, I had knowledge of ClickFunnels. And it was along my journey of doing my e-cookbook that it's like I decided, found out that I'm terrible at marketing. And so that's how I searched out ClickFunnels to help me with my marketing journey. And it's been wonderful. I'm learning a lot. And tell me a little bit more about your journey as a chef. Where did that passion come from and how did you get started? I actually grew up in a family restaurant. So I've been in the culinary world since I was 12 years old, 12, 14 years old. So I started as a busser. And as a family restaurant, you pretty much go wherever you're needed and all over. So I pretty much did everything besides owning the restaurant. And my mom passed away just a little over seven years ago. And when she passed away, a lot of her recipes were lost. It was very unexpected. It just devastated us as a family. And me being the only daughter, I was just I just really missed. Not I didn't write down her recipes. There was a lot of recipes. I took that for granted that she would be there. I think most of us do. Yes. And so it was like right after that, I had a daughter that was about ready to go to college. And I was doing the college thing with her. And I'm like, why couldn't I go back to college when I graduated? I had no idea what I was going to do in, you know, had kids. And and then it was like when she was we were doing our college journey with her, it just like all of a sudden clicked. It's like that's what I want to do is I want to go back to culinary or go to culinary school. And I want to share my recipes and share it with my family because I have two daughters and I've been married. What is it? Almost well, 29 years now. And I just haven't like really I'm the same as her. It's like I didn't really write down my recipes and I didn't, you know, I had a cookbook or, you know, my book that I've had. But it's like a lot of it was just in my head, you know, I cook from my head and, you know, a little bit of this and a little bit of that. And so seven years ago, I just had it come up on Facebook. Seven years ago, I started my culinary journey by going to school. And then I graduated two years later. But it's like I still was like, how am I going to share recipes? I still that part of it baffled me. I'm like, I just didn't know like in my late 40s. And it's like, OK, I'm not very computer savvy, not techy or anything like that. And it's like, but I still had this desire. How am I going to share my recipes? And it just all of a sudden I got this message on Facebook and this ad that kept on popping up. It kept on popping up all the time. And it was how to be a food blogger in Danny Meyer. She just changed my life. I joined her mastermind and learned she taught me everything I have known about food blogging. So that's been like four years now. I've had my food blog and it's been wonderful. It's changed my life. It's I've now working from home, you know, and it's like I just. She's helped me with like creating the digital cookbook and and she's walking me through like the course and and it's like, OK, now advertising like sell it. And it's like that's where I come with a roadblock. And it's like how I have no idea how to sell it. And so hence led me to quick funnels and in doing the funnels and, you know, going through that process of learning all of that. Yeah. Yeah. And I saw that you have a challenge. It's such like a griddle challenge. Is that the first funnel that you've built using ClickFunnels or have you tried other funnels? Now, this is actually my second challenge that I've done. I did take Pedro's challenge. Yeah, the challenge. It's masterclass. So I did one in June and I ended up only selling two of my courses to two. And then now I'm trying to do my second one and just progressing. You know, I'm learning as I'm going along and it's it's cool. It's just really cool to watch like how I came from seven years ago to what I'm doing now. And and I say that maybe I had a midlife crisis and after my mom passed away. And it's like I just decided this this is what I want to do. I don't know how I'm going to make it happen. But, you know, this is this is what I'm doing. So well, good for you. I feel like that's typically how it starts with people in their entrepreneurial journey is like a profound life event happens and it kind of shakes them to their core and makes them realize like there's more to life than this. I want to do more with this. And the fact you mentioned you had a daughter. I'm sure it's really, really beautiful for you to be able to create this legacy so that she now always has access to your recipes. Yeah, I have two daughters and that's the whole when I'm writing. That's the whole thing is I'm writing for them. I'm writing like how if if I pass away tomorrow, it's like what, you know, how can they create my recipes? Because there's I have a lot of recipes that they that I know that they love that several of my family members love. And and so, you know, that's my whole thing is, you know, they they have a catalog of my recipes now. So, yeah, that's wonderful. Yeah, very cool. So now you're you're building funnels. You have these challenges going on and you're kind of learning your way through and you're definitely paving your own way. I mean, I don't know many. You're the first one in the ClickFunnels community that I've met. That's a chef that's building your online business. And I know that there's some out there, but you decided to go for it. And you took the risk of, you know, putting your recipes out there and putting yourself out there as as a business builder. What kind of goals do you have utilizing ClickFunnels in your business? Like, where do you see yourself 10 years from now in terms of being a chef with an online business? So along my journey of blogging, I had no idea when I first started what my niche was. It's like discovering. And I say my niche chose me and it was Blackstone Grittle recipes, the outdoor Grittle recipes. And once I started posting about that, my website really took off. And so that's kind of how it's led me to the Grittle Secrets Challenge is doing Grittle recipes and doing, you know, the course, the Grittle Secrets course. And I mean, maybe the course, I'm also a baker. And so my, my actually, my hometown knows me as Chef Sherry the Baker, that I do like wedding cakes and decorated sheet cakes. And I actually have a licensed kitchen in my home that I work out of. And I do wedding cakes and that for the community. So, but I wanted to be known more than just cakes. And so, you know, eventually I'm thinking that maybe I might do a course about home bakeries and, you know, and it's really the sky's the limit. I'm not limiting myself. I have a lot of ideas and, and I've gotten ideas from the community posting in. That was awesome. That was like, because sometimes I get roadblocks in and it's like, I just posted in the ClickFunnels community and said, you know, this is what I'm doing. This is the direction. I've got my cookbook. I've got my course. Now, what else can I do? And they posted in and it was like, these light bulbs started going off. And I was like, oh my God, yeah, I can, I can do, you know, the one I want, which I've thought about doing, but I'm like, I got this in my head that I'm just not good enough kind of a thing. And I'm like, I can do it. It's like, I think every entrepreneur or anyone who's wanting to start an online business or put themselves out there has that self doubt. And it resonates with so many people to say, like, I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can do it. But that's the great thing about the community. And it's been so great to see you active in there and connecting with other people because that sense of belief really comes from other people being inspired by you and feeling like you have something to share that helps them along their way. And that's really the whole point of what we're doing. Yeah. And I know a lot of people say that QuickFunnels isn't for like food bloggers or like that kind of a business, but I'm taking it as the sales. You know, I'm trying to do the sales part and then putting my own spin on things. And, you know, it's like, I can take this little bit and this is how I can, you know, grow my business. And this is, you know, just taking little bits of things. There's so much knowledge in the ClickFunnels community that it's just it's sometimes it's overwhelming. And I have to like really like reel myself in and, you know, focus and say, OK, I need to go this this direction with it and stay with it. I, you know, trying to stay the course and but yeah. And I love too that you mentioned, you know, finding your niche or that your niche found you because some people would say like, oh, you're a chef with a food blog. Like that's niche. But like it's better to go deep than it is to go wide. And when you discovered that like doing things on a griddle was your specialty and your niche, you know, they say riches are niches. And like that's when your audience really started paying attention to you. They know that they can go to you for that very specific content. Yeah. Mm hmm. And in the griddle was actually bought for my husband during the pandemic. And I explain that in several of my recipes. I talk about it and in it. But it's just evolved to where it's like I can cook on it, you know, even though I bought it for him, it's like I'm I'm pretty good. And actually, I've discovered that I actually cook on it more than he does. And, you know, it's it's it's been quite the journey as far as that. So I'm finding that there's a lot of women, you know, it's I think perspective that an outdoor cooking appliance is a man, you know, the the grill is a man's appliance, but it's not it's, you know, this is women. I love that you're on top of being niche and using specifically like a blackstone griddle. You're also kind of breaking that stigma of like this is a woman's tool as well. Yes, yeah. And definitely women could cook on it. Yeah, I'm empowering them that and that's what this challenge is all about. This griddle secrets challenge is like, you know, letting people know, you know, whether it's children, you know, kids, kids like to cook on it also. And, you know, it's it's for everybody and they can do it. And I'm challenging people to get out there and just to cook on it just to, you know, obstacles are so many obstacles. And with my griddle course, I walk you through the different obstacles. So it like breaks down like if you don't know how to season the griddle, then I have a course in there for you to season the griddle. And it's like there's so many people that don't know when they buy the griddle, they don't know that they need to season it first. Right. And that step is scary for a lot of people. And and I've heard so many people say that they buy the griddle and they don't open it and unbox it because of that seasoning step. And it's like cast iron. You when you buy cast iron, you need to season it first. So what an exciting challenge. I can see people being very excited about that because they finally get to be, you know, a master of the Blackstone griddle. And rather than just like, oh, I guess I'm, you know, cooking breakfast while on the campground again or something, they get to feel like they're a top chef using the tool that they've had and finding out, you know, techniques from somebody like you. I'm sure that's a really exciting thing for them. Yeah. And that's another thing people say that, oh, well, they only cook breakfast on it. They don't know anything else. And I'm like, there's so much to do on a griddle. It's like I've even baked on a griddle and people are like, why? Why do you bake on a griddle? But there's people that are camping and that's all that they have to cook on. Or there's people like I found during disasters that happen, you know, natural disasters, people only have their gas griddle to cook on. And so that is like huge for people to be able to cook on this outdoor. That is like prime YouTube content right there for it. That's very niche in itself in that, you know, in an emergency situation, here is how I can help you cook what you didn't think you were able to cook. And you can cook breakfast, you can cook lunch, you can cook dinner. I've had appetizers and in desserts, I have a whole bunch of desserts on there. So it's just opening people's eyes up to what, you know, what's what's out there. You know, so. Very cool. I'm going to check out all of that. I'm inspired by it and I can't wait to start using a griddle a little bit more. Tell me what is your biggest piece of advice? I know that you said you started this journey about seven years ago and you've clearly made some leaps and bounds since the passing of your mother in a big life event and you've taken risks and you decided to just go for it. Like what is your biggest, most impactful piece of advice for somebody who is maybe wanting to get started in this business as well? Don't give up. I've I've had a lot of obstacles and with me, like my age was a huge obstacle. And I had so many people say, like, why are you going to culinary school at the age of 46? And I'm like, you know, I just seen I just had this vision of my life. Something different. And so I just say, don't give up, even though you you're not sure of where it's going to take you when I left culinary school. I had this vision of sharing recipes that I wanted to share my recipes. And I had talked to my the head of the culinary school and I asked him about it. And I said, what kind of things can I do with sharing recipes? And his advice was, you need to go back to school. You need to get the bachelor's degree and get science, do like a science degree. And I'm like, I have two kids in school and I'm married in a college nearest me with with that was like four hours away down in Detroit and stuff. And I'm like, I can't I physically I can't do it. And it's like, there's there's got to be some way that I can share my recipes without going and doing another two years of school. I said, there's got to be. And so I just thought thought about it, thought about it. And it was just that Facebook ad just changed my life. And it's like, I had no idea what food blogging was. I had no idea how to build a website. I had no idea about click funnels for marketing. I, you know, and it's just just it just things have just kept snowballing. And I just I don't say, you know, a lot of people start a blog and then they stop. And because, you know, it doesn't make them non money. They don't, you know, they don't know what to do with it. And I've just surrounded myself with a community of blogger friends in a blogger community, which helped me get to where I was. And then now I'm trying the marketing, which I'm surrounding myself with click funnels to to help me on that journey to sell, you know, to be able to sell what I've created. And I know it's good. And I know people need it. And it's something that is an amazing product. It's just I have to reach the right people. Yes. And that's it. That's it. Just reaching the right people. Yeah. Amazing. Love that. So never give up. It's never too late to start and community matters too. Like we've we've learned so much from your time being at ClickFunnels already and the way that people are engaging with you. And everybody has so much valuable advice to give. But my favorite part is seeing the advice that people are giving being in different industries and how so much of that is still relevant to what others are doing. So I'm sure you've, you know, gleaned so much information from people who are, you know, public speakers or their funnel builders or they run an agency or, you know, all different all different places, all different walks of people. And everybody has special advice to give that I think is really helpful. Yeah. Yeah. It's great. And it's being open minded. Don't close yourself down. Just be open minded and just see where the journey takes you, you know. Yeah. Love that. Well, you're an inspiration, Sherry. It's been so great to speak with you. Where can people go to learn more about you and your business and everything that you're doing with your blog? You can go to from michigan to thetable.com. You can also go to my YouTube page, which I have a lot of videos. And just from Michigan to the table or Chef Sherry Ronning. You can search that and watch my videos. It's I have a lot of amazing, not only Blackstone Grittle videos, but also my other ones that you can check out. So wonderful. Go check out those videos on YouTube. I know I'm going to go home and look at some of these recipes myself and see how I can start using a griddle. So that's awesome. And Sherry, we'll see you at Funnel Hacking Live this year. Right? Yes, I'm looking forward. I'm so looking forward to this. It's I can't wait to have you. It's definitely a life changing event. I have my list. I have your like my. Oh, I love that. I have, you know, when I saw that post, it just made my entire day. And it's just like I'm one of those people that I'm quiet and shy. So when I go, I know that I'm just going to sit in a corner and I don't know anybody. And so this is kind of like after I watch Christopher with his. Yeah. Funnel Hacker TV. I'm like, I need to do this just to be able to open myself up and force myself to meet other people and, you know, get out there. And it definitely helps to have that list. But also you can still be an introvert. You can still sit and take it all in. But after with networking to know exactly the types of people that you want to be talking to, it really does help. And I promise that when you're there, you're going to be so shocked at the friendliness and how everybody not only wants to network in terms of business, but you leave that event with lifelong friends. So I'm excited for you. I'm excited to connect with you. And I look forward to seeing you in all the things that you're doing using ClickFunnels in your business in the future. Thank you again. You're welcome. Thank you. See you later. Bye.
