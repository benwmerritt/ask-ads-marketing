Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm speaking with Adam Boe. Adam is the founder of Business Success Academy where he works to support coaches, entrepreneurs, and course creators launch their expert business. His main focus is teaching business owners that technology doesn't have to be complicated and mindset is everything. Welcome Adam. Thanks for being my guest today. Thanks Laura. Thank you very much for having me. It's an absolute honor to have been asked. Thank you very much. I'm really looking forward to getting to know more about you and what you're doing as a funnel builder. So tell me a little bit about yourself and your background. Yeah, thank you. So yeah, I guess my journey has been a bit of a whirlwind over the years, but I've always really involved myself within technology and automation and just love that kind of thing and brought that to every aspect of my life. My earlier businesses were very product driven, product based. It was specifically retail and I was around very early with that whole online scene of shifting brick and mortar businesses to online, which was really cool at the time. So that kind of led me down this whole different world, different path because it really mixed my love of that entrepreneurship, that love of selling products, getting in front of people and doing all of the things that was running a business and merging that with the online. So that became kind of a little bit of my passion, a little bit of everything that I did. So fast forward a bit. I had multiple businesses, brick and mortar, all retail and then COVID kind of came along and I, things, things, we pivoted things even more online and found that things exploded even more, which was kind of, you know, the opposite to the job. And I think it really trended I suppose, which was, you know, a terrible time for many, but it really worked for us to the point where we had, you know, people wanting to look at buying our, our businesses. And I kind of gave me that opportunity to get out of the physical space and then focus purely on the online, on the, on the online space, which was, which was really cool. But whilst I was doing that, I was also mentoring, helping lots of other businesses sort of doing that kind of thing as well, which is I guess where that shift had started already happening to that expert kind of realm, that sort of coaching, coaching business, which was, which was, which was good because I think when I really sit back and look at what really drives me and makes me, it really all comes down to education. You know, if being able to help people, being able to educate them in how that they can make what to them is really complicated things really simple. And that's what I absolutely love doing. So that's sort of that journey that brought me to, to where I am kind of now, which was sort of at first I was spending a lot of time helping retail businesses with their merge that brick and mortar to online. And that has since shifted really to where I guess a lot of my passion is, which is helping, as you said, coaches, course creators, people that are amazing, absolutely brilliant and heart centered, passionate about what is they do. But they, when it comes to the technology, often there's a bit of a roadblock. And, you know, they put all this, all this work or this effort into, into building a business, but the, what's letting them down is, is this big bad technology, which really, when we break it down and and no one's shown them how simple certain things can be. And especially when it comes to something like click funnels and now click funnels 2.0. It just simplifies everything and brings everything together. Rather than before where we're having to grab a piece from here and plug it into the machine, grab a piece from here and plug it into the machine. It's just brought it all to that one place, which is, that's, yeah, so amazing to do. Yeah, and I'm sure that resonates with a lot of people in our community because people from all walks of earth join click funnels, whether it's to find funnel builders or to do it themselves to learn about business just to get tips and advice on how to get things started as an entrepreneur. And we get people even in the community all the time that get started, they're in their trial, but then they're just overwhelmed. And the software is simple, but people just have this really big business ideas and they don't want to take the time to actually build out their funnels. So it's really interesting. I think a lot of people can resonate with the idea that the technology is one of the obstacles for a specific type of person and to be able to get past that is, I think, really helpful because so many people have amazing ideas and that shouldn't, the technology shouldn't be what stops them from moving forward. So speaking of that, how long have you been with click funnels? Yes, so well, to be honest with click funnels, it hasn't been that long because of that product focus business. However, in the world that is Russell, much longer, like I first was introduced to Russell in 2012. So pre click funnels, which was which was really cool. So he had come down to Australia for an event and was, you know, what really like it was the first speaker that I'd really seen that merged my two real passions at the time which was, as said this this technology, but also the marketing you know that that raw principles that that, you know, that that Dan Kennedy that stuff just put it all together and I was even looking through notes from 2012, which was really cool. And he laid out, you know, the 10 things you need to do. And it's like, this was just the blueprint for, for, you know, the books that were to come, you know, the dot com and the expert secrets, which was so cool. Yeah, so yeah, followed always been sort of immersed in what Russell was doing and loved click funnels had helped others set up click funnels where their product base wasn't quite where, you know, where those physical products were at the time. But it wasn't till the funnel builder program was launched on the first webinar that that Russell did the one that he did live which was so cool. And started he really, there was the first time he did to my knowledge that he'd really showcased what 2.0 could do. Yeah. And that's when I had that real aha moment hang on I can bring all of this together. You know, I've been helping people with 1.0. But now I can, I can really just plug everything in with 2.0 and it was going to be absolutely brilliant. And so far 2.0 has more than editors more than delivered on the promise which has been amazing. Awesome. So I imagine you work with tons of different types of experts in different industries. So I imagine you have experience with several different types of funnels. What would you say are the most effective or the ones that are your favorite to build out for for some of the people you work with. Yeah, definitely. Look, certainly anyone starting like the lead squeeze is just, it's just amazing. You got to you need to build a list that is the most critical thing in, in what we do we need to build lists. So anything that captures their details but by far for me for clients, a variation of a free challenge funnel is by far my, you know, I think the lowest barrier to entry to really get in front of people and really impact people. And especially in the, that sort of expert industry, when you break it down, it's, it's education. That's what we're trying to do is, is educate. So if you could, you know, it's something that's so easy to plug into a challenge model and what's so cool about it, especially you've got the upcoming upcoming challenges with Russell and Pedro, which is really cool. But what I love about challenge model is it's like an accordion. It can be, it can be done to the grandeur of something like what Russell does, or it can be done to a much intimate setting in much more intimate setting, which is, you know, it's just so powerful. It can be a, you know, it could be delivered in a one day, it could be delivered in a three to five day, but it could also drag out over eight weeks. So you can, you can really play with, with it depending on how best to get in front of prospects, how, you know, how best to really showcase what it is you do in a way that they're really left at the end with the only one logical solution that is, hang on, I need you in my life. So, so that's a really good point. In fact, I hadn't really thought about that before because I think I've been well versed in challenges for a while now being in this space. For somebody as a consumer who is new to challenges or who is being marketed or is receiving emails about like, you know, let's say a five day challenge, I feel like that's a pretty common one. They kind of get in the mindset that that's what the average challenge looks like, but you're right, like the time can, it can be longer, it can be shorter, it can be delivered in an email sequence or not a responder, it can be delivered via video, like there's so many different ways to customize it. And I think that makes it more approachable as an expert of you already have the education, like you know how to deliver this, you have the content, it's just kind of putting the pieces together and teaching it and kind of spreading that out so that it's in bite sized pieces for people to understand and actually do the homework. So I like that that does make the whole idea of a challenge a lot less scary for somebody who may be interested in actually building one. Yeah, most definitely. It's, yeah, I've always looked at it more of an event style funnel that kind of removes that free thought that it has to look like a Russell challenge. It has to look like the big challenges that that are hugely publicized and and look amazing and they do amazing, but that then gets into that mindset of the that person that's really sort of starting out earlier in their career and that sort of first first sort of three years that are going, I can't do that. I can't speak to thousands of people like I don't have the video screens. I don't have the tea. I've got one I've got a laptop and I've got a camera. But by taking that pressure off and by a sort of refer to that more as an event funnel, but it's just that that model, but be able to repackage it in a way that is totally totally works for the people that are sort of in more their infancy. Yeah, I love that. That's really cool. So you mentioned that you've been kind of new to the ClickFunnels world or at least working with the software as a funnel builder. Tell me a little bit about what you have set in terms of goals in the next couple of years. Yeah, definitely. So, yeah, so I've been around ClickFunnels a while, but as far as my me physically paying for a subscription, that was what was what that was what really shifted it. But that was where I was kind of was able to bring everything together is what I would have found with with all of that is you can especially with the affiliate program you can really sort of merge a lot of things together which you know make your your total offering so much stronger because you can really support with especially with what I do with supporting with that education surrounding technology. But as I said, I joined the funnel builder certification. So I think I've the big goal of East to go on stage and collect the funnel builder award. So that's right on track. That's kind of got all the all the certifications lined up there, which is pretty cool. And then just working the this business to towards a two common. That's obviously the next goal. I want to have a matching plaque which will look even better and just sort of working on scaling it from there obviously. You know, that's that's the the sounds good on the on the on the back of the wall kind of approach to it. But the truth is, it's the same thing I've same approach I've taken to every business and every business has always worked out in a very successful way that I've not really cared about the money. I've not cared about it's about how can I have that more impact? How can I how can I help you understand that this is the right way forward for you the right product the right anything? If I can help you understand it from your point of view as to what you you know how this will impact you in such a positive way, then it the rest happens by default. Yeah, that's the need. I think a lot of people chase the dollar. But if you chase the just serving the serving the customer at the highest possible level, the you know, the reverse effect on the spot. The reverse effect on the spot. It's all into place for you. Yeah, it's great. I think it's so important to put the value first. I spoke to somebody on here that mentioned, you know, kind of like what you said about chasing the dollar and if you are willing to even work for free or prove yourself, you can kind of create your own value ladder of let me help you do this. Let me prove my worth to you. And then those same people are going to be so loyal to you because you provided them with that value that you're going to be the first person that they go to when they need help actually growing their business or building new funnels or trying a challenge or and I think that says a lot like serve first and everything else kind of falls into place. So you have given us a lot of really great pieces of advice as a funnel builder and somebody in this expert space. What would you say is the most impactful piece of advice you could give to a fellow entrepreneur? Yeah. The big one is look obviously selling through education but keeping it simple. Don't over complicate it. The biggest challenge that I see that creates that overwhelm for most people is they're trying to solve their problems of today for their customer where the problems of their customer are probably so much simpler but that creates a disconnect. You know the problems your customers are having you know your clients they're generally something you can do in your sleep and that's where that disconnect is is just keeping it simple and and wrapping it around everything marketing you know marketing is everything and the biggest tip I can give is Carried the books, Russell's books like you've got the blueprint you've got everything you need right there in front of you. You know especially with with X you know if you've got a bit of an idea about it all expert secrets is just next level. You know if you're very new to it dot com secrets would be the first one to go but expert secrets. Absolutely amazing. Yeah it really does give you all the frameworks so that you finish that book and you there's no question of where to get started and you just you feel the your fuels to get started regardless and I think that that's really cool. So Adam as a funnel builder and somebody who focuses on this expert industry where can people go to learn more about you and your business or go to you for help. Yeah so Business Success Academy as you mentioned dot com dot au because I am in Australia but I do probably work with the US so time zone challenges are less of a problem than you might think. Socials yes they're there but certainly the website and I have got a challenge coming up soon for those coaches in the in the you know sort of first one to three years that is just trying to really break that market and I've got a challenge coming up very soon which should be a lot of fun helping them. Just look at creative ways to really launch that to that next level and you know get that whether it's that first client that 10th client or that that 100th client just getting it so that will work more on autopilot and really helping them build the machine around it which ultimately lead to a much better business that is far less stress three. Wonderful and I look forward to seeing that and if it comes out before this interview goes public on YouTube will make sure that we include that in the description along with all of the other places that people can find you. You did mention one last thing you did mention that you are hoping to collect that fundamental certification award will you be at funnel hacking live this year. Most definitely yes I will be there and I will be walking on stage to collect that trophy or that little plaque super excited about that obviously didn't join the program even knowing a plaque existed. But once as soon as they announced that though they should they showcase this that last year and I saw that when that looks very cool it's probably one of the really almost I almost got as far as saying it's a better looking award. It's a very nice looking award so. It is it's very nice and that's probably the most exciting day of the entire event is getting everybody getting to see everybody walk across that stage collect those awards get their picture taken and it's just everyone is just glowing. It's so motivational I'm truly inspired by watching all of it so I will be there as well and I look forward to seeing you collect that award and getting to meet you in person Adam thank you so much for being my guest today. Thank you very much Laura. Thank you.
