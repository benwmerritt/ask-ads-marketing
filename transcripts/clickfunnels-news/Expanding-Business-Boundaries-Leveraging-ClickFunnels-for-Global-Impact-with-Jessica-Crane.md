Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels, and today I'm joined by Jessica Crane. Jessica is a wealth and business coach for salon owners and high-level female entrepreneurs. She teaches others how to use their business to create generational wealth and live the life that they dream of. Welcome, Jessica. Thanks so much for joining me today. Hi, Laura. Thank you for having me and really excited to share my journey so far. Great. Well, thanks for being here. And can you just get started by telling us a little bit about your background and how you started this business? Yeah, so my business started very organically. Like, I've always been in the salon industry. I had my first job in a salon at 12. So I've always been in that industry, and I always progressed pretty quickly. So I taught for big hair brands. I've been a salon manager. I've educated hair, beauty, business, and sad men. I've worked for private training providers. I was an assessor. I was an internal verifier, you know, managing a big, large training provider. And yeah, I went on maternity leave with my daughter about nine years ago. And I knew a lot of salon owners and I was teaching their teams. And so many were reaching out to me and they were like, oh, I know you're on maternity leave, but can I meet you for a coffee? Can you come and help me with my business? And I know you are really good at this stuff. And so it started very, very organically. I started me going out and helping them and kind of doing that old kind of face-to-face business consultancy method. So yes, that's kind of where it started, very organically. And yeah, it was, yeah. Okay, you shocked me when you said you had a business at the age of, did you say 12? So I worked in salons from the age of 12, yeah. Wow, okay. So like this has been a big part of your life for a while. Cool, so why click funnels? So I kind of told you the backstory to what happened. So I was running my business as a face-to-face consultancy and basically my husband plays sport and one night he came home and he was like, yeah, like literally overnight we are moving city. Like we're moving two, three hours away overnight, no kind of choice to a city. So what I realized was that my business had these limitations for me and for my customers because without me being in that location, I literally lost my business overnight by moving away. And so many of my clients were like, how are you still gonna help me? Like I still need you to help me. And so I was like, right, well, we need to find a way. So we need to find a way to take this business to the next level where it doesn't matter where I am physically, I can still help my clients and my customers and reach them. And so that's when I worked for the mentor and he introduced me to click funnels. And he was like, look, like he's teaching these people and they all have the same problems. So we can put all of that knowledge into a membership area and we can still have support. We can still have this and we can still have that. But now more importantly, I don't just have to limit my time for money and coach one salon owner at a time. Now I can reach salon owners like all over the world, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And the real key for me with click funnels is that you can grow that impact like exponentially. All right, there's no limit with that. Whereas without it, you are kind of limited with a time for money model for me. Yeah, so cool. What tips of funnels are you using with your business? So we use a, we mainly use a BSL funnel. So we run Facebook ads, true traffic, that go into our BSL. So we teach them, we give them some high value. And then we have a phone call without onboarding team because we need to make sure that this is a right fit and that we're aligned and that this person's coachable. And then we enroll them into our coaching program. So we have two coaching programs, our core systemised for success, which is for salon owners. And then from that was born our mastermind. So the core goal of systemised for success is to get your salon business to a point where it can run without you and you've got your time freedom. It's really profitable. So it's generating you a really good income. And what happens then is in our mastermind, we look at, well, now you're making all this money and you have this time, how are we diversifying? Because, and I think COVID taught us this for a lot of us that we don't want to be relying on one stream of income because something could happen to that stream. And you don't want to be the stall with one leg. You want to make sure that your stall has three or four legs so it's really stable. Yeah. So in our mastermind, we're going to teach you how to diversify your income and have multiple streams from the profit that you're creating from your original source. So yeah, so we kind of teach you how to do that all. And for some people, that's a second business. For some people, that's investments. For some people, that's property. Like that looks different for everybody and kind of how they want to fit it into their life, business and ecosystem. Wow, so cool. So instead of just dealing with the salon owners, you're trying to find a way to turn them into real business people and be more profitable. Are you helping them to utilize internet as part of their business model or is it mostly in their physical salons? Yeah, so we're definitely adding online income as a stream. Again, coming back to COVID, something could happen to your brick and mortar. It doesn't necessarily have to be as extreme as COVID, but it could be that you're closed for a week or you're landlord. There's a million things that could happen with your brick and mortar. So it's really good to maximize sales in other ways. So we are teaching them brick funnels, we're teaching them funnels, we're teaching them how to max and even how to enhance their client journey on the salon side by using funnels and automated processes to even maximize the revenue from that business as well as other options with multiple streams. I love that. And is your mastermind your continuity program? Yeah, so people can join it for 12 months and we kind of focus on really getting that ecosystem up and running for them. So the goals are that you kind of set everything at what we call the wealth cycle. You set it up so that in five years, 10 years, like you have the life and business that you dream of. You have that passive income, you have active income, you have stocks and shares, you have like all of these things are a reality because you put those foundations in place. Yeah, what a really cool business model. I love that. You mentioned goals a little bit and with the goal of the structure of your businesses, but what kind of long-term goals do you have for what you're doing? Yeah, our goal was really is to just continue to impact more salon owners and more women in business. So our mastermind is open to six, seven figure of female entrepreneurs who are ready for that kind of level. My passion and my goal is teaching women how to be financially independent and financially secure because the more that women have that financial independence and security, the more they have choice in their life. In every area of life, they have choice because they're not bound to anything called to anyone. So yeah, so we're really passionate about empowering women financially. As we all know, it's not something we're taught in school. A lot of us don't have those family members that can teach us because they haven't been where we are or where we wanna go. So we're really that source to help them, to coach them and empower them, give them the tools and the knowledge that they need to make those goals a reality. So my goal is to get our clients to a place where their problem is wealth management and to impact and empower as many women as we can on that journey. That's so great. And it sounds like you're doing that already. And I love that you are available as a resource for the things that we don't necessarily learn in standard educational systems. And learning, doing what you love. I mean, these salon owners obviously love what they do and it's probably been a passion of theirs for a long time. But taking that next step of like not just doing what you love, but making sure that it's a sustainable business. It's gonna be long-term, you're creating impact. It's really cool. And I'm sure that there's a huge trickle down effect of what you're teaching these other women. And I think that's super powerful. So tell me a little bit about what would be a big piece of advice that you would give to somebody who is maybe a salon owner that's like, I need to diversify. I don't know if I always wanna be brick and mortar. I don't even know if I wanna live in this city forever. Like what would you tell them? Yeah, so we would look at the world cycle and we would look at, first of all, is getting the foundations in place to one, give you the time freedom. So that comes with, because often for a lot of salon owners, they're in their businesses. They're not working on their businesses. They're working in their businesses. And for a lot, they've almost bought themselves a job, not a business. So the first thing we do is position you as the business owner. So making sure that you're leveraging your time doing the right tasks, that you're not working behind the chair five, six, seven days a week, and that you are doing the leverage tasks that you need to be doing. So first of all, we need to put the systems and processes in place that buy you your time. And then we can look at your finances and your numbers and kind of put the structures in place for those so that we're maximizing the profitability of your salon. Because so many times, people don't really know and understand their numbers on a really in depth level. And still we wanna do more of what makes you profit, cut what doesn't make you profit, maximize every single area of your business, your numbers, your marketing, your systems, your team. Once we've kind of got that singing and dancing, then we'd have that profit. And then we can look at, okay, now we have this surplus profit. And most businesses will easily, I mean, a lot of salons break you, they're gonna make a loss. And we, I mean, some of our clients see up to 86% net profit months. Because when you fine tune everything, like you'll see those changes so, so quickly. So now we've got, you know, 80% profit, 80% of your revenue to play with that you can reinvest back in your business. You can put into property, like a lot don't own their own commercial properties. So sometimes that's one of the first steps for instead of paying rent, you could pay a mortgage on this commercial property. And there's asset number one. Like, so we kind of look at where they're at and where the gaps are. And in line with their goals as well. Like sometimes people will come in and they'll have a specific goal of, I wanna reach this or I wanna have this. And so we work with that. And sometimes we'll say to them, well, have you thought about this or have you thought about this or this is possible. Or so yeah, so that's kind of where we start. It's really maximizing what they've got to the maximum potential profit. And then we can focus on where we're gonna put that in line with their goals. Awesome. And the amazing advice, I love how you talk about working on the business, not just in the business. Cause I'm sure that's probably more than 90% of salon owners are working in the business, doing and standing behind the chair. And to be able to provide that kind of information and talk about assets and the things that maybe they didn't consider because they've just been caught in the loop of like doing the same thing every single day, but saying like, how can we make this a business for you that is making you wealthy and that you can maybe pass on to your children some day or keep this business in the family. What I think is so huge. Love that advice. Yeah, because that's one of the problems as well. Like if you're a business, if you have a job in your business, you can't even begin to think about an exit strategy because it's not valuable to anybody else because it's only valuable because you're there. So you can't, if you've been running your business like that, you can't necessarily pass it on to your children or sell it or anything else. And meantime, it hasn't created you any long-term wealth or long-term income. And so you could find you're still gonna have to be behind the chair at 50, 60 light because you're in this cycle of using muscle for money instead of leveraging that into other income streams. That's so smart. I love that. And I already have so many people in mind of who I want to share your information with because I make the family benefit from advice like that. So I love that. Tell me a little bit about where we can go to learn more about you and your business. And if there are salon owners out there who maybe want to learn more from you, where can they go? Yeah, definitely. Like you can head over to our website, which is www.jescacrane.co.uk. On there, we can show you like a little bit more information about both our programs. But more importantly, you know, you can book a call with our team because we first and foremost want to get to know you and your business and where you're at and map out like a little bit of a plan with you as to where you are, what's currently happening, what some of your goals are. And if you want to work with us, that's cool. But if not, you're gonna get loads of value from having this call and setting those goals. So that would really be the first point is come get to know us, come get to know. On there, we have loads of client video testimonials. Like, and I love it when people listen to them because they're like, I'm just like that person and I'm just like that person and you can get to know some of our clients because they're all in the community and you'll be part of that, which is really invaluable in itself as well. Awesome, thank you so much, Jessica. And I appreciate you taking the time to let us know a little bit more about you and your business. And hopefully we have a lot of people that are watching this that will have so much to gain from your advice, your tactical information and get to know you a little bit more. So thank you again for being a part of this today. Bro, thank you, Dora. Thank you, bye-bye.
