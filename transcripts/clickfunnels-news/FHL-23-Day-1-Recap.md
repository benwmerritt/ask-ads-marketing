## Transcript
Hey everybody, welcome. Oh my gosh, day one is now over. It is. I don't even know what time like 10 o'clock here. Maybe even later. I don't even know. And we have a recap for you. So we will introduce who we are with right after we rolled the intro. We are part of an underground group of monster newers that you've probably never even heard of before. We are funnel hackers and these are our stories. Welcome to funnel hacker TV. We are so excited to have you guys here. If you guys join us live, make sure to give us a hashtag live down below. If you're watching the replay hashtag replay, there is so much going on. Yeah, it's down somewhere down there. Go ahead and make sure that you let us know what it is. We want to see it funnel hacking live because we are collecting a whole bunch of stuff. We have the AV team constantly giving us additional videos and images and we're just trying to figure out how to get it to you. So the number one thing that we want to know is what do you want to see? So our goal is to go live again tomorrow in the afternoon. That's the goal. We'll see if we get there. If we do, then what we'll do is we'll make sure that we text you if you're on the list. So what you need to do is down right below, you need to follow the instructions and text FH TV to 208 23137 97. All the information is right below. So and it's also in the comments. So make sure that you guys follow that. Get on the list because we'll let you know right before we go live. But these evening sessions, I kind of want to do something a little more flexible. So what we're going to be doing is we're going to be talking about what the event was like. And so every day we're going to be highlighting and bring on a couple of different groups of people. And today is really cool. So I was really excited for this one. So what some of you guys may not know, we have a certification program. So in the funnel builders program, we have a certification level. And when they get certified, they're able to do all sorts of things like yesterday we went to. Yeah, I think we can say it. Very potter world. Right. You're in Harry Potter world. And it was amazing. And so fundamental certification people went there. We had two CCX inner circle. Oh, it was so much fun. I don't know if we were supposed to go on the Velocic coaster, but some of us did brand new one. And oh my gosh, it was crazy. So we did that last night. If you guys want to see all of this stuff, let us know. But we did a lot of fun stuff. But today we get to highlight a couple of our funnel builders who've been certified. So when you go through the program, you learn all the strategies. If you were in certification, there's advanced strategies that are unlocked just for you, as well as we want to make sure number one, you can build one of our funnels. So we have you rebuild one of our funnels. Number two, we have you rebuild or make your own funnel. So you build your own funnel in each funnel type. And then number three, you have to like get on, do like a quiz, make sure you know everything. And you have to get on a call with somebody to make sure that you actually built the funnel. And so like we are verifying to make sure all these different things to make sure that the people we recommend as funnel builders are spectacular. And today we have some really cool people. So they've been sitting here going, when are we going to introduce us? So first off, we have Malia and Malia Burcham is coming all the way from Arizona and you drove. Yes, I drove there. With your family? Yep, with my husband, my daughter who's one and my sister in law. Absolutely. And so if you guys have seen Malia on the Facebook group recently, it's because she won one of the design contest, the very first design contest. So if you guys have seen her, she is wonderful. She is in the funnel builder marketplace. You guys can go over there, look for funnel builders. Malia has been amazing, not just because you built, you build very, very well. But it's, but also because you give to the community as well. Like you're, you're helping the community of funnel builders become better. And that's, that's really, really cool. And it's been really, really, really, really cool. And bringing other people up with you and sharing the value that I learned. That's a real funnel hacker idea. I love it. And then we also have Cohen do it. Now I know Cohen personally, so I used to sell a program and Cohen joined my program after being in Catherine Jones's program and then joined this program. And you came here all the way from. I flew in from Phyla with family. I flew in with my wife and my son because obviously we were in a place where there is like a park with a mouse running around. So he was very excited to come here. So yes, that's what we did. Oh, that's so crazy. And you've been here multiple times or is this your first funnel hacking life? No, this is my first funnel hacking life. And this is your first as well? Yes it is. Oh, all right. Okay. So we have one year, one year, four years? Yes. Four years? Eight years. So we've got the old and the new. It's going to be great. Okay, so what we want to do is we want to recap and just talk through everything that's been going on really quick. So you guys got registered. What was registration like for you guys? Because I know Susan already got a whole bunch of swag and she's really excited about it. Well, we were lucky because we got the VIP treatment. Yes. And we also got the certification program. So it wasn't as smooth as butter. You just walk in. Everybody was extremely friendly. Just put in your name. I think it was some sort of an iPad kind of thing. You sign it, you print your ticket, you get all your swag, you get your fancy early access boss here. So we were here with all the people that matter. In the circle and category teams, we all share the same room. So it was absolutely perfect. And then we can get into the main room also a little early and get seated and ready for the rock concert. Now, have you noticed, Malia, have you noticed a difference from sitting like up close versus like in the back? Yeah, well, I have never been before, but I can definitely tell it's really awesome to be up close and personal and being able to not be too close. And being able to not have to look at the screens. Yes. And just being the only time I do is when somebody's head is in the way other than that, I just, we look at the stage or in the aisle and know they are. It's really cool. Where did you sit? Oh, yeah. So I was going to say, you know, I heard Ben give some advice to someone yesterday of like, okay, you're going to want to go sit like in the middle because that's where all of like the high energy people and the extroverts will sit. And don't go sit to the side if you're wanting to have like people lift you up out of your introvert shell. And sure enough, the people that I asked to save seats with picked the farthest edge as possible. You guys know who you are that they've received. And there was a major difference in energy. I actually turned to who I was sitting next to and I was like, the crowd's dead. Like nobody's making noises, but I could hear the noise happening across the room. I was saying my husband is an introvert and he was repeating the chance. Yeah, I definitely got him all excited and I was like surprised to hear him do that, which was really cool. It got me into it. Yes. Oh, okay. So is anybody a Star Wars fan? Yeah. Okay. Yes. Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and go to the swag box. We'll show you guys later because there's cool stuff. What did we get that was Star Wars theme because I freaked out. Oh, you remember? Yeah, of course I'm moving. What's on the sock? You want to sit? Dark Vader? No. No. Mandalorian. Mandalorian. This is the way. Do they say this is the way or do they say Lynchpin is the way? I don't remember now. I think it's this is the way. Let's have a look. We're going to look at his socks for a second. Lynchpin is the way. Oh, that's fun. We'll have to show you guys. Maybe you'll start seeing some pictures. You might see some pictures. Yes. Absolutely. Let us know again what it is you're missing and you want to see so that we can get you images down below. We can throw it up on here. We just want to make sure that we run live because things went crazy today. Oh, yes. It was nuts. So we got all registered. You got a whole bunch of swag on top of the red shirt. I, yes. I, yes. There's a swag shop like right next to it. And she was like, we're walking past it. I need to buy stuff now before. I need to buy stuff before. Yes. I got, I got, I think I got. Two sweatshirts, two t-shirts and two hats and, and one of the metal, like want to be Stanley cup. Is it? They told me it was a black friend. Oh, maybe it is. And he looked at the bottom. I got a click on the Stanley mug. That is so cool. Yes. Okay. So I didn't, the only thing I bought. So I got here and Russell walks into, or we walk into the event room before it was like ready. It was like Monday. I think it was Monday. We walk in there and Russell says, check this out. And he's wearing a click funnels belt buckle. And it was so cool. And he's like, check this out. It's a ratchet belt. It's so cool. Like, where'd you get that? He's like, I got it over here. So Todd and I went over and they're loading up Todd. They're like, we have black, we have tan, we have brown, we have red, we have blue. And he's walking away with this huge stack. My wife's going to have like a whole bunch of different like outfits for me now with all of this. And I'm like, I just want one. So I had to go and get one. So I'm really excited. Okay. So much happened today. Doors opened around noon. Registration was crazy. We got stuck with registration. We were supposed to be on door opening and registration was, it was crazy. The line was really long, but it moved really fast. Yes, it really did. And, but it was fun. There's, it was fun. It was good. We had a good time. We had a, had a megaphone. A megaphone, which everybody was happy to tell me you were using that wrong then. I'm like, I'm sorry. Like your energy was great. I'm like, but I was using it wrong. Okay. That's fine. So absolutely appreciate it. We're going to be great. There's a couple of things that happened step by step. So we're going to go through all the speakers and kind of want to hear your thoughts through each, like what it is that you learn. So what did you discover as you were going through it? So first off, I'm going to grab my notes. Russell kicked it off. Yeah. You grab your own notes. This is fine. Um, Russell kicks it off and, uh, talks about the new thought movement and how it needed a little bit of shining. And so I have a couple of things that stood out to me. What stood out to you guys? Like, was there something that stood out to you most? Cohen, first off. Well, being in my first phone, I can lie. It's more or less like drinking from a water close. So much throwing your direction. It's like, oh my gosh. Like the value that you get is like, hey, people are back in their seats. But, um, what stood out the most from Russell is that, um, he's linking everything to Napoleon Hill. Oh yeah. And one of the cornerstones in Napoleon Hill's books is definitive purpose. Definitive purpose. Yeah. Definiteness of purpose. Yep. You got it. It's very important because if you do not really know where you go or where you want to go, if you don't have your direction, it is very hard to become successful because it's like a ship without a compass or a ship without a rudder. So you really have to choose what is my purpose and then go after it 100, 200 percent and stay focused, stay focused on that. And then, um, he actually gave us some, some, some history. Yeah. Actually way before Napoleon Hill, like this whole movement has actually started many, many, many years ago and we went all the way back to Stoic. Yeah. Philosophy. Oh, school. It's a couple of thousand years ago. So none of this is new. So, but this has, we have evolved. This has evolved over time and become, became more and more and more specific until we reached the stage where Napoleon Hill wrote his book. So, it was the biggest step for it. That was really, really cool. What about Malia? Yes. Oh, yeah. I really enjoyed the activity for writing or Definiteness purpose. So like, it was funny because like as a funnel builder, I've been kind of fun. You just get into this program and you're consuming information and it was just so nice to, to kind of, kind of be brought back to write down your purpose because that's something I, even though I've been doing this for a year, I've never done that. So I was like, I'm doing it right now in this two minutes. And the example you gave was Bruce Lee. And so I just took what Bruce Lee said. I'm like, okay, I'm just using this as my template. And I actually officially wrote my statement and I'm going to try to achieve it. So that's, I really enjoyed that activity. So that was really cool. And you got your husband sitting next to you. Yeah. The entire time. That's cool. Yeah. That's really cool. The Bruce Lee Definiteness purpose is really cool. I think you could probably Google it if you wanted to go look it up. It's, it'll pull up an image. Yeah. It was an excellent like template to go off of because my thing is like everyone's always saying, oh, you need to know your why. And I never knew how to write my why until I saw that. And then I'm like, okay, if I just use that as a template, it became easy. So yeah. Very cool. Let's step to you. Okay. I'll just take one. So from Russell, the thing that stood out a lot, at least in the, I think it was still at his first, he spoke a lot today. Yes, he did. I think it was still in his first session in this first one. But the three voices, I really, really liked that. So he talked about how we have three voices within us. The first one is you. It's your brain. It's the, it's the, it's what's asking the questions of like, oh, should I go and do that thing? Or, oh, this would be a good idea. Right. And then the second voice is what he calls the calling. You might have another word for it. It's the thing that's the voice that's calling you to go do something. It's telling you what you should go do. It's giving you the ideas. And then there's the third voice, which he calls the resistance. And that's the voice that he likened it to like adversary or, you know, the opposition. And it deals in absolutes. It's the voice, it's that negative voice within you that is like saying, you're not good enough. No, you shouldn't do that. And so the, he talked a lot about how to like, you need to quiet that resistance voice. You need to not listen to that. You need to listen, hear the calling voice and then go act on it. And I thought that was just some, I don't even know if that's directly his, but it was really cool. It was funny how you're related like the resistance is as simple as snoozing the alarm. I'm guilty. I did that this morning. I did it. Absolutely did. It was a shout out to me most for that one was like the little intro that he did. Like talking about a dead poet society and carpe diem and sees the day he lists lean in, see the faces of the past and recognize that they're calling to you to seize the day with the same desire that they had because one day we'll all be we'll all be my worms. And it was like, I've never seen the movie. And so I, it was really moving. I was, I was very, I was very much touched. It was very cool to see everything that Russell's building through that lens. So that was really cool to me and it's something I'm taking away. Who spoke after Russell? It was, it was Fred and Ryan. So Brad give and Ryan Lee cash flow tactics. This was their first time speaking on the FHL stage, but we've heard them, they've spoken on like inner circle stages and within the coaching programs and stuff. But this was their first time on the FHL stage and they filled it. They did off. Yes, they did so good. I saw them coaching with McCall Jones beforehand and like getting their charisma hacking down, which she's going to be on stage in a couple of days. So, oh my gosh. What stood out to you, Malia? What was, yeah, cause you got something leading your business with the movement rather than with the actual business and the services. So I've been doing it backwards and it's funny, I have no movement for my business. And I'm like, wow, if we just build this, build a movement and kind of lead with that, especially as I start making my more of my digital products and able to serve them in multiple ways, it becomes more about them and caring about your clients and your people than it is about just making money. And I'm like, even though we all knew that on some level, it was really, it really resonated with me that it's like, okay, it's time to make a movement. So, yeah. Yeah, Cohen, did you have anything? Yeah, for me it was the backstop. I got into the inner circle and apparently they were very bad. I can't show if I can use the word. But they set the top that they completely suck. They were the worst of everybody in the inner circle and they struggled for several years. And it got, yeah, and it got that bad that at some point Russell said, like, look guys, you need to reach a certain threshold in your business, certain revenue, otherwise you're out and they didn't give up. Instead of like throwing in this, okay, we've tried to start it was long. It was like two, three, maybe even four years before they had their breakthrough. It was like turning out. They really pushed through and they kept trying and then they showed their graph. Okay, we tried this, a little improvement. And then we added this, a little improvement. But then at the end, when they realized actually, we have to build a movement because people want to buy. People are not from the business. The hockey stick, they shut up. And that's just the persistence and I said, sitting back and I'm like, wow, if you really can like take it for four years and realize, my God, this is not going anywhere, but then still persist through it. And obviously they got massive breakthrough. They read the rewards now. So it was an inspiring story. Now, Cohen, you and I funnel hack a lot. And so you've seen the funnel, like you've seen how they did it, but it's interesting to break it down. It's like, he's like, people have copied our words before they've copied our different things that you cannot copy the fire that comes from coming out of that. That was really cool for me. I really love that. Anything else on that one? We want to cover because that was I that was really cool. I took notes like they talked about like a step by step, like the four secrets. I loved how that was more than three and they were having a great time with that. Oh, yeah, that was cool. So yeah, giving the customer the identity, right? So instead of calling them clients, you give them an identity statement. So so like we have funnel hackers, they have a funnel hacker. Yeah, I'm a funnel hacker. I am a it's a it's a kingdom or domination. I should know this. Well, it's rise up and live free as their tagline. Yes. But I don't know what their I am. Sorry, guys, I can't remember what that is. But the example that they gave was I am not a smoker is the biggest thing that helped smokers like in their success. One thing they said was movement is more than a dream is an obligation. Yeah, that was that was really good. Yeah, your dream is your obligation. That was awesome. All right, should we move to the person? So, all right. No, please. Okay, well, I was going to first say so in between this was actually kind of like the first almost the lock, right? Was Russell and then Brad Gibb and Ryan Lee. And then Devon like came back out and he was like, okay, from this point forward, everything is going to be like lynchpin. And so it was almost like beginning a new phase of the session was just so cool. And so for the rest of the day, how it happened was that Russell, oh, these are the workbook. Yes, the workbooks have like stuff in them, right? This is just the lynchpin graphic. You guys have all seen that one. But Russell came out and taught like the principle taught the idea of the piece of the framework. And then the guest speaker would come out and say like, talk about how they are implementing it into their business. So Russell came out, he taught about building an email list is part of lynchpin. And so the speaker who he brought out for speaking on how to, you know, monetize an email list was Perry Belcher. It was cool. That was a surprise for so many people. Like, I don't know how many people knew that Perry Belcher was coming out. Well, you guys probably did because we talked about it on this show a couple weeks ago, but it was kind of a last minute confirmation. A lot of people didn't even know. Yeah, it was really, really good. I was shocked at how many resources he gave. I have so many screen pictures. I couldn't even take the notes fast enough. I just took pictures of the keynote. It was like that is a golden nugget after a golden nugget. Well, if you're not using this resource, you should be doing it. Here's another one. Here's this. Oh, if you're using AI, here's my process step by step. Most people charge a lot for that information. Oh my goodness. And then he like put his phone number in the bottom left hand. It's just Perry Belcher. Oh, yes, that is real. That is real. Not a marketing. I don't know how he feels about it. I guess maybe people don't really actually, maybe they're like, that's probably not real. I'm not even going to try. Cohen, did you have any thoughts on that one? Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Perry. I've done one of his, he's an AIDist copywriter. He's a marketing genius and seeing him now giving all his secrets away on newsletters was, and he gave us software for free. He said, I built this and there you go. Just use it. I'm never going to charge you for it. And he even made a joke that had the whole 5,000 people in stitches when he was mentioned. Can I mention his name? Alex Formosi. Oh, that was so funny. Oh, but he's like, here, I'm going to give this to you for free because my name is Alex Formosi and I have nothing to sell you. Everyone just cracked up. It was fun. So yeah, love Perry. Absolutely brilliant. Now you mentioned like Perry's, like you said, A-list copywriter. And so most of what he was teaching from stage was like, here's how to use all these like automated and AI products to go and write your stuff for you. And so that's kind of funny, you know what I mean? But it must really, really work because he did mention that they, between all of his businesses that he owns right now, they are doing 19 daily newsletters, which is insane. But he says that they automate the whole process so it doesn't really take that long. And he said something like he spends less than $2,000 a month paying the people to do all 19 newsletters. That blew me away. Right? And so I'll say it's like, I have a little bit of a list myself and I don't need newsletters. I need to. I'm very bad about that. So this was really important for me to hear because AI can be overused too. And so what was great is he gave all these resources. So you use it the right way and you created a software so use it the right way and it adds more personality into it. And it was even something that reads us, right? Yeah. It was like we dumped information. Yeah, he taught like how to make an AI of you. Yeah. So it's like it'll spider scan that and then it can write stuff for you or at least help you write stuff for you. So you can actually give him no excuses. That's kind of what he's doing is he's created all this stuff for no excuses. And now I'm like, okay, I got to actually, so if you're on my list, I'm sorry. He's coming at it. And there's so many things like it just kept coming. Like Perry did not stop. And there were just so many different ideas. We wish we could give you all of them, but we're not here to do everything. Okay, so the day kept going. Eric came on next. Why do you want to say why Eric came on next? Yeah, so the way that Ruffle has scheduled to funnel like a live is everything that's been. He gave 30,000 in the morning with all the different components and then every speaker was going to teach us something extra on top of what Russell is giving us away. And where Eric comes in, because everything in the vision starts with the character because from the attractive character with right your traffic to what is the miski, which is the most critical thing ever. If you don't know this, please go and look this up. It's quite important, but also towards a dramatic demonstration, for example, challenges or your webinar. And obviously it all starts with the attractive character. And Eric told us for the whole audience that you have to be you have to be out there. And a lot of us are introverts and he started out with like, look, these are these people. And if you're persistent with putting your message out, like putting yourself out on social media, it's something that that will build up over time. And if you do this long enough, all of a sudden from being in the dressingly low, like maybe one, 200 followers, you can end up like 2 million. He showed us a lot of examples of people that actually had that struggled for months, but be persistent. That was the message. Be persistent. Keep on doing that. And then all of a sudden, after five months being flat, all of a sudden it chews up. And then it can be overwhelming because there's so many different platforms like you have TikTok, you have YouTube, you have Facebook, you have Instagram. And then he gave us a tip on what to do, where to start, and I'm going to let Malia. Basically, like to simplify everything is just focus on shorts across three, you know, short, short form content across three different platforms. I do that, which is Instagram, Reels. You have shorts on YouTube and you have, you know, TikToks. Yeah. So, and one of the things that I loved about that presentation that they were talking about is how he condensed Russell's 90 minute webinar to 60 seconds. And that was the big thing is like, I've always coached people on, oh, five minute webinars, like that's been nice. But not, I never thought about 60 seconds and I'm like, oh, wow. So that's a great framework how you can just, you know, have that hook, introduce a story, tell your three secrets, and then they can have a call to action with every post. And like, like, Corn was saying the consistency posting every day. And he was saying himself like he struggled. And it took a long time for him to start to take off any lost followers more than he gained them at first. And then he, after some time, he started to really spike. And now he's, I don't remember the following. He's quite large. He's quite large. And, and now he's realized that I am a creator. And that was something else he taught was talking about is not a little bit more than I am. But one of the things you brought up was use the word you instead of I in the content. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's basically all my notes on that. But yeah, just wanted to. You said something a little bit ago about I am a creator. He was talking a lot about like, he actually was having a say out loud several times of I am a creator again, kind of kind of going back to that identity thing from Fred, give and Ryan Lee, like I am a creator, right? He actually been doing to talk about what we were given. Yes, the title of my gosh. Okay, so he just came out with his book. So Eric things book is now create, don't capture. And so it's all about like a lot of the times when we do shorts, we're trying to take what we've captured previously and short it so that way you can create shorts out of your content and make something unique. He says no create this on purpose specifically. And so they dropped all these books on the chairs for us everybody got a free book. And it's, it looks so good and it's well designed and it's gorgeous. Yeah, this isn't even out yet. Like you can't get this yet. But like it's a really cool looking book. Can't wait to dive into it. So when you get the opportunity you should definitely grab it because it's great. Yeah, it's really cool. One of the things that he was talking about that I really loved but so using. So obviously putting content out there is a traffic source is a way to bring people to you he was focusing a lot on like the problems with only going towards paid sources of traffic. So he talks a bit about that. But so there's benefits to doing like more organic methods like being a content creator putting it out there and not just relying on, you know, spending more money. And so the reason one of the reasons though is because your content the more content you're putting out there. And if you're doing short form content you can do it faster. And it's going to be like quantity but still quality with his framework is. So the reason is to build deep relationships with your people. He brought up the number of like, I don't know exactly what I'm not going to quote him, but it was something like a person needs to spend like seven hours watching you and and like watching your content to be able to build a trust with you and be ready to they feel connected to you at that point. So that's one of the really big benefits of that is because you're putting so much content out there they have a lot to watch from you. And now all of a sudden they feel like they know you and your thing and like you just made some content. Again, I mean, I had a conversation with them where they can talk back to you but they feel like they have. Yeah, and there was this one that he gave to everybody, which was we don't have to be great start, but you have to start to be played. And that's the reference towards like, because all of us we have this inhibition that maybe you should put on camera and what if it's not good and of course you're not going to be good. People know the backstory of Russell, you know, when he made that first presentation and he ended there, okay, who wants a piece of that? That's how we start. We have to start somewhere. It was the same in Peng Joon. Some of the viewers maybe know Peng Joon, his first videos and he also uses that in his presentations. He has a video of him where he's just like completely, completely bombs in his first public speech or public presentation. And it doesn't matter. We all have to go through that phase, but we have to start and to become great. It's very clear. One last thing. He also said ads may be fast but influences what lasts. And I was like, that's good because I've always resorted, well, not with them a building, but with my other businesses, I've always resorted to ads. And I never built a movement, never built content that people can just consume. And with them a building and kind of doing more of that direction. And I noticed it's really starting to make like build a community. And yeah, that's what I'm kind of plays with that movement. We're just talking about stuff. Absolutely. So right after Eric was done, we then moved to a surprise really quick visit right before dinner, Stu McLaren. Now, somebody who's gone to Funnel Hiking Live eight years now, what was it that surprised you guys about this? Like what was different about that for you because I imagine you didn't know, it's not on the program that Stu's coming out. So was it different? What did it, what did that seem like to you? Well, I have to admit something, Ben, because I'm here with my family, with my son and my wife, and I bought them a surprise visit to Disney yesterday and they went today and they just came back. So I skipped that exactly. And I went up to see them because he hadn't seen me the whole day and I really was just talking to my son. All right. That's a foul. It's okay. Oh, you and me. I brought my one year old daughter and she really needed me at the moment. It was for dinner. It was a surprise to like a lot of people thought it was dinner break. I knew it was coming because they were introducing the foundation. Yeah, there's a village impact. And so it was in the middle of that, but I'm like, okay, she needs me. I had to go and I knew something was coming and I was waiting, but I had to skip out on that. Unfortunately, that would have been a lot of fun. So I'd love to hear about it. Okay. Well, you want to talk about it? Okay. So every year during FHL, Stu comes out with Russell. Was it just Russell and him up there this time? Yes. Okay. And so Stu McLaren and his wife have a foundation called Village Impact. If you guys remember, I don't remember it was it July where we actually covered their trip to Kenya. And we didn't go, but we were following the posts and stories from Russell. And so we kind of highlighted them. So back in July, they went to Kenya and they always make that trip every year as well. So their organization Village Impact is to help people that live in Kenya and maybe other. Yeah, it's mostly Kenya, right? And it's there's a specific community in there. So they work with the government officials and they work with the community in order to make sure that this can be as self-sustaining as possible. So that way everyone's behind it so that we can be longer lasting. And it was really cool to be able to see how it's changed this year. So number one, Russell got to bring his whole family, which we got to cover, which was really cool experience for Russell. But then they got to share like the impacts every time they go with a recorded video of what the experience was like. And then at the end, we were given the opportunity to be able to to be able to support Village Impact. And there were a couple of different levels with that. And there was actually there were a couple of different people that came back and said, we want the highest tier. We want to help build a whole school. And that was really, yeah, that was really, really cool. And one thing I thought was really cool was the president of Kenya. Yes. I thought after that work. So the president of Kenya helped them open one of the schools. That was really cool. They opened one school specifically for for women like it was right before COVID or that time right afterwards. And they realized that a school for for young women who are maturing into adulthood would be massively important in order to keep them safe in the community. And they said, we built this and it's great. And we didn't we were scared that we weren't going to be able to tap in. Now we're taking it to the next level. And it's like they continue to give step by step and they talk about how they're funding it and what goes into it. So that way, you know where everything's going and there's some crazy bonuses like Stu McLaren's doing a whole training in the office. I'm trying to figure out how we can go cover it because I know you can cover it. You're right. I'm thinking on being able to be there. Yeah. Yeah. So there was definitely some some incentives to donate. You know, they're trying to raise a lot of money so that they can go help. And yeah, so it was fun because Stu's like, well, what what they were they were was it in Kenya that they were talking about this? And that what he said that they were planning for today of like, OK, when we like, what are we going to what are we going to use as incentives? And I think it was Steve Larson that gave him the idea of like, well, you're the membership guy. Why don't you do something with membership? So he's going to be doing like like bonuses for people all around membership. And there's like different levels and different offers involved. Yeah. It was really good. We broke for dinner, which everybody was very excited for dinner. And afterwards we had the author of Extreme Ownership come now. I got the audio book once I realized that he was speaking and I just binged the entire thing. And it's an experience. And he told half the stories from that book, but then he also wrote a second book. And so he like mixed the two and organized right. So it was jocke-willing and it was spectacular. It was it was heavy. It was good. No, that was really good because one thing I got from that is well, it's important to own up to your own. Mistakes before you start pointing fingers at others. And we've all been guilty of that at some point, I would say. Some people I've even witnessed people run their businesses that way and they lose a lot of employees. And it's like, that's probably one way reason why. And instead of building up a team, you're kind of, you're okay. So basically what he's saying is instead of recognizing what you as a leader need to do to improve yourself and then make it easier for other people to improve as well. And they will also follow you because they see you as a leader and they will model you and want to better themselves as well. Rather than you having an ego and coming in and going, you did this wrong, you did this wrong. It's like, okay, this happened because I didn't prepare it correctly or it wasn't easy for you because of this and let's make it better rather than just pointing fingers. So that's what I got from that. Yeah, that was awesome. Yeah, for those of you who are watching us now, they don't know who Joko is. He's a neighbor seal. And we all know like they don't take prisms. So he didn't really let the crowd of the hook. He made it really very clear is that you are responsible for your own actions no matter what. So don't try to hide behind like that person or this person. And he gave the whole backstory because he's seen some hard combatants and some hard missions that he had to go through. If you don't work together as a team, everybody dies. It's really that black and white. There is no gray. Either you work together and you pull together or you're all going to die is that simple. And this is how people also shift from their businesses is that everybody has to be responsible at their level and own it and don't try to point fingers or try to skate your responsibility. No, that's what street ownership is about. It's all about your responsibility. And I was very clear. Everybody in the audience, we got a message. He didn't let us off the hook. There were so many different like military ideas that Joko shared. Like, so for example, a cover and move. So like the ideas behind like how do you move forward as a team with cover and move? What is the idea actually behind a centralized command? What does that actually mean? Does it actually work and how do you actually make that work? In priority and execute, detaching yourself from emotion and the appropriate moments. That was something I'm going to have to work on. I'm very empathetic. Yes. I feel everything in Spanish because my husband's obviously he's sensitive, but he's not like he doesn't feel what other people feel. So it's interesting. So that the attachment of he used an example of somebody being wounded on the ground in all these you have chaos when you have chaos around you. This is something I do all the time. I try to solve all of it at once and said identify what the number one problem is, fix it and then move on to the next problem fix it. And then you'll come to a solution that's more robust, more fixed. Everything's fixed rather than partially fixed. Was there any other ideas that you guys had from John Coe? Because there was there's so much like he gave so many different ideas. A tactical for strategic. Discipline equals freedom. That was really good. So it kind of goes hand in hand with other things we're talking about like what Russell is talking about. You kind of kind of bridge to that. But basically, if you're not taking action, you're not going to go anywhere. If you're going to keep making excuses, you're, you're not going to better yourself or better your team. And yeah, so just have discipline in your life, which we all will need to do. And that's it lines exactly what with the Russell is talking about. And so when dot com secrets was first published, the introduction was written by Dan Kennedy, who we all know and love now and is speaking. But the really cool thing about that was Dan Kennedy said shine shoes, save lives. And he goes, if I had to work with anybody who I know it would work with, it would be Russell because he's diligent. He shines his shoes like he does the small little things that make the difference. So that way when you go into battle, you trust that person makes you want to become better. And so something else I wrote down was don't wait for others. That was something that was really important because a lot of people kind of wait for somebody else to make the first move. Like I'm guilty of that even with my team is like sometimes I'm like, okay, when it comes to projects. I sometimes wait to hear their feedback when I should just be the one to take action. And anyway, so that was really cool. That's cool. Yeah, maybe just quickly point out because that stood out to me when he had bullet points next to each other, strategic versus tactical versus strategic. That many people just stay into the back of the heart and don't do the strategic but tactical is short term strategic is long term. And the reference he gave is like people stay with a tactical because it gives the instant gratification that we all want and look for like doing this little job answering that email. And then we end up there like, wow, so great. Look at all the stuff that we've done, but it's all shorter. And we completely forget that if you don't look at your long term strategic objective, then usually just going to keep on sitting in in short term vision, short term focus, which is also not bringing you forward further down, further down line. So that was pretty catchy for me also the way how he outlined that and made it really very, very clear where you should focus. He said, you can do the tactical stuff, but you should not forget about the strategic stuff. Yeah, I love that because it's sometimes like you get 30 emails a day or and you just want to deal with those emails. Like we said, put out the fire. Yes, just take care of the emails, but you're going to probably get 30 emails next day. Right now I have 100 emails. Because I drove here, but anyway, yeah, so rather than putting out the fire, sometimes it's better to just go on the strategic side and set up things in your business to make it easier for yourself and easier for your team. So that was that was really cool. And then the check your ego. That's kind of I was talking about that earlier a little bit. But basically you say you can't like go in if you want to be really successful, you can't go into everything alone. Sometimes you have to have a team with you and bring them up and use them strategically. Yeah, there was a lot, a lot of good stuff from Jocko. Okay, so that that kind of like wrapped up the speakers for day one. It was it was only half a day. It's only half a day. It's only half a day. Tomorrow we have a full day. We start at 9am. I think is when it is and we go to the same like I think 8, 8, 30. So Russell starts at 9. Doors open at 8 30. And if you're too kind, if you're watching this guys and you guys are here, doors open at 8 30. And if you're too comic club or certified or inner circle, your doors early access opens at 8 10. So be here appropriately. If not, we're going to be taking more notes and we're planning on going live hopefully during during lunch. And we'll send you guys all a text message. So if you guys want those announcements, you're going to want to see the behind the scenes and have some video. Make sure you put in your details down below text FH TV to 208-231-3797. And we'll go ahead and make sure that happens. And then tomorrow night we'll do the same thing. I think this is good. It's a little bit more long form. And we just kind of get to go and just talk about those things that were really impactful for us. But thank you guys for coming on. Thank you. It was pleasure. We have to get it tomorrow. We have to get it tomorrow. That's going to be awesome. So, yeah, yeah. So let us know if you guys liked this format, you liked us bringing on some awesome guests and covering kind of our takeaways from all the speakers. Since this was half a day, are there more speakers? We have a few more. Oh, there's a whole lot. So it's probably a good thing we'll try to go live twice tomorrow. Yes, definitely need to go live twice. And we'll go a little bit faster in the evening and kind of do what was your number one takeaway from your speaker. But stay tuned. Make sure you get all the text announcements and see you tomorrow. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it as beating, as pulsing. I made for something more. And then fear hits us. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven, are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized, I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I had gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that made me all of my money. My best selling framework. Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust in you. This better blow your mind and allows you to predict the future. People need a liveness and meaning to begin. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this one precious life? Happy birthday! You wouldn't be able to tell, but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. I feel like home. I'm so encouraging. Because if they can do it, so can I. I feel like home. I feel like home. I feel like home. I feel like home. I feel like home. I feel like home. They thought, let's say, hey, next year we're going to get better. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer in everland. We find exactly what the business is missing. You're going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right.
