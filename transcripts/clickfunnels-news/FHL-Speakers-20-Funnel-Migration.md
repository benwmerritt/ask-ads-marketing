Um, we're also gonna talk about some things that Russell is doing I want to highlight you guys those of you are putting your faces out there and being crazy I want to highlight you and also We're going to let's see last things Let's talk about 2.0 here we go. Yeah We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before we are funnel hackers and these are our stories Hey, there's Sheldon Smith, I see you everybody I remember I was gonna ask if you have not put in your details yet in order to jump on to funnel hacker TV Go ahead and text FH TV to 2.0 8 2 3 1 3 7 9 7 go ahead and set that up so that way you are good to go and Shoot we got a lot of cool stuff going on Susan. How you doing? I'm doing awesome We have some really cool. I was just telling Ben like this feels like a really awesome episode that's coming together for us But I wanted to share with you just kind of a thought that I had that actually stems from my daughter Just the other day So, okay, you know I don't depending on where you live as we start getting closer to summertime The days are getting longer the sun is still up and if you have kids You know that it is such a pain in the butt to like have to send your kids to bed when the sun is still up they're like but the sun still out like why am I having to go to bed and The so my daughter was like really having a hard time sleeping because the room is so bright and We have like room darkening shades We have curtains that go over that and there's still light that comes in and she's just been having a hard time And so she's like mom, you know those those masks that people put over their eyes Can I have one of those? I was like, oh, that would be really really awesome and like kind of like just Said like yeah, that'd be great and then Obviously we'd have to go get one for her and so yesterday She comes home from school and she the first thing that she does when she came home was she starts making one out of some felt Like she got on her markers. She pulled up a video Um, I don't even know what I think maybe she was just watching a video. I was just digging because I'm like it was pretty simple I don't think she needed a how-to video but she starts decorating it She draws some eyes and eyelashes on it cuts it out of felt ties some string onto it And she made her mask and she wore it last night and I didn't have the chance to ask her how it went but I was just thinking like how awesome is it that she had a problem And then she realized like I gotta fix this problem and she came to me and I wasn't in a place to help her fix that problem Immediately as fast as she wanted it fixed So she took matters into her own hands and was like, all right. I'm just gonna make this myself so I was thinking about how that is for us as entrepreneurs and how Sometimes there's things that that are not going our way. There's things that are not to our satisfaction and there we just we we as entrepreneurs are Hardwired and if we're not hardwired or if we forgot how to do this and we strayed from this idea my invitation is for for you to come back to this idea of be a problem solver if something in your business isn't going right or You need help with a software or a strategy or an idea Like find a way to problem solve it find a way to get some help with it find a way to do it yourself find find someone who can help you with it, right? And um, and and that was just kind of my thought today of like That is what an entrepreneur is that is what a funnel hacker is is we are problem solvers. So I think ben Whoop did I miss you? Yeah, we're we're good. How are we doing with with? All right, making sure that all systems are alive guys Let us know really quick if you guys are seeing us just say hi just underneath just simple hi Yeah, I see everybody else. I love that story.

So, you know, it's it's money everybody We all wait we all want all the green lights to be lit before we start going right? We're sitting there waiting for that green light to be lit and then the next for the next mile or two before we actually start Moving it's really just about getting some momentum now More than it is the rest.

Uh, Susan's got something to show us a share, but Check this out Has anybody seen this page in the last no, no 24 hours? Russell is inviting you to speak at funnel hacking live. That's you. That's not me. That's not Susan you Okay, this is something where you get to be able to step up and do this and I'm going to Highlight you guys who are stepping up and allowing yourself to be put out there Step up. Please put yourself out there if you're an ambassador put yourself out there If you are just getting started and trying to figure this out and you have something worthwhile to share Put yourself out there if you are an expert and you know it We need to hear your voice.

It is It's a group of people you want to see we have some really cool stuff for you So cool So really quick before I would go ahead and start highlighting everybody who's in there What have you seen Susan? What what's what's yeah up with the quick phones water cooler for you Okay, so I wanted to share this with you so Russell The latest podcast episode on the marketing secrets podcast This one here it's got a long name. So I'm just going to bring it up on the screen But it's this inner circle What we're building into the new into the new value ladder for click funnels 2.0 And I was listening to this. It's only like nine minutes long guys. It's it's a quick listen But one of the things so he in in the episode he's sharing a clip from him speaking at an inner circle event but before that He prefaces something that I've been Saying for a while now. It's great to see Russell saying it too um is like When a lot of us are using click funnels classic, right and we're moving Um slowly when we're ready to over the click funnels 2.0 And a lot of people want like this quick like oh, is there a migration tool? Um, can I just have like have it just copied over like why is it why do I have to go and rebuild everything? and I think on One hand you can look at all of the negative sides to that like oh, it's gonna take me Longer than clicking a button or two. Oh, I gotta go and rebuild everything but he brings up the point of like what an amazing opportunity to go through your funnels And look at them again. Look at them as you're moving things over And I even wrote down he said he said if you want to quick Fix a quick move you're depriving yourself from rethinking your funnels And that is what this podcast episode is about not funnel hacking tv but his marketing secrets podcast episode is He's talking about like okay, they click funnels Russell They've started moving things over to 2.0 and as they've been doing that They have been relooking at all the funnels and he realized something that he actually had been missing And so he he dives into that. I'm not going to go into that You can go listen to the podcast episode and listen to what he says But there is a strategy where he's like, oh, I could be doing this more But he wouldn't have realized that Uh for his funnels if he wasn't pouring over them and relooking at them and and figuring out like okay as we're moving These over how can we make them better? And so I think that's an amazing way to look at it. Yes, if you are short on time There are some ways you can you know go hire somebody to help you out whatever right, but What an amazing opportunity to be able to move stuff over and and have some fresh eyes on it You've learned a lot more since those were built possibly And so now it's time to look at them again. So we are in just a moment In this episode I am going to be showing how you can Basically, we're going to get inside the editor. We're going to get inside the editor of 2.0 and I'm going to rebuild a page part of a page from 1.0 to 2.0 and And we're going to dive into that so you can really see if you have all your stuff together You can see how quickly it actually is How it can come together. So I think maybe ben might be frozen So maybe we'll start into that and we'll come back to ben in a minute when he is back with us Oh, one other thing that he said I'm looking at my notes. He Russell said like You know when we're in it, it's sometimes it's hard to see things in our own business, right? especially if your expertise is like funnel strategy or marketing and You you sometimes miss things because you're too close to your stuff And he's like, oh, he was feeling that too in his in his funnels He's like well before I go out and hire a consultant Why don't I hire myself? So like by declaring like I'm hiring myself to do what I do for everybody else But I'm going to do it for myself now and by declaring he's hiring himself He was able to go into it with that like that hat on at that perspective of Okay, I'm going into this and I'm going to look at this with the eye through the lens of like if I were doing this for a client. So um, all right, I think Ben's back with us And I think we're ready to uh Go to the next thing that you have been Yeah, let's talk about this for a second. So some of you guys are putting yourself out there We really want to highlight you guys.

Well, there must be something there Let's go for it. Right and I feel like that could be a lot of you where like just put it out there Russell's gonna see something in it and maybe not now maybe later, right? And so What's the harm? At least allow yourself to be seen. Yeah Please yes, yes allow yourself to be seen. All right With that said Susan you've spent like the last Several hours in order to prepare for this like a lot of you guys have been asking over and over is click funnels 2.0 ready Is click funnels 2.0 ready is click funnels 2.0 actually ready for my business And we want to start proving it to you. And so Susan had this idea Susan. I'm gonna let you talk about it What it is that what what are we doing? Yeah, so okay, one of the I mean obviously click funnels is for funnels, right primarily first and foremost We use click funnels for funnels because no other platform Or software out there even compares to what click funnels even classic like I still maintain click funnels classic is better Than anything else out there, but now we have 2.0, which is awesome So what we're gonna do is I have the dot-com secrets page pulled up And I'm gonna recreate this page not the entire thing because that would take us all day But uh, we'll see how far we go. I planned to get down to like the videos area And um, and we'll just see how fast how fast we can do it and then we'll like we'll teach I'll show you some things along the way um And hopefully it'll help you like realize like oh click funnels 2.0. I can't be going in there and building funnels right now um, it's and and it's not like as daunting as some of you might think that it is so i'm gonna dive in And then you can chime in along the way. Oh, I'm gonna chime in. This is crazy cool. Okay. All right. All right Right now. I'm in the back end of click funnels 2.0 Awesome menu is happening over here. We've got a lot more things happening in 2.0 So the menu is going to be more robust But we've got two places you can go to start building funnels One is site and then funnels or you can really just click on this funnels icon And it takes you to the exact same place I already have a few test things in here, but we're gonna start from scratch. So Um, I don't want to make sure you guys are seeing. Yeah, you guys are seeing the right thing Okay, so we're gonna click up here create funnel and this is gonna be our dot com secret test funnel And we're just gonna create it So this is creating a blank now you can start from a template. There's awesome templates being loaded into click funnels I think on a weekly basis But for the purposes of this uh demo, I'm starting from blank. So we've got the new awesome like this funnel flow View which I think is just the coolest thing As you start adding in more pages You're gonna see how the pages are connected to each other How people are able to get from one page to the other page And if you guys are like any of the crazy ones that like to make advanced stuff Like we've been implementing this like on our side like if you opt into a funnel We have vip if you have a click funnels account We have a separate vip package than those who don't like there's advanced stuff you can do in here When you get to that point, but for now it's we're trying to make it as simple as possible Yeah, yeah, so what I did was I clicked on this plus click on a page and here's where you have some choices You can either start with a template And there's a lot of templates a lot of categories or if you've already built something and you want to you reuse that You can go to my funnel pages or if you click this button over here on the right side just new page It's gonna start you with a blank page So we're just gonna put dot com secret landing page I'm gonna skip a lot of this stuff, but here's where you can put a page description. You can edit your page URL Do you want to index in the search engines or not? And then you click create page? All right So from here if you hover over this this is where you can either edit or preview And there's other things happening. There's another menu. There's this thing, but we're not going to get into that today I'm just going to show you inside of a page editor so Reminder we're going to recreate this now. I've already gone ahead and For those of you that are already familiar that quick funnels 2.0 has a style guide Which I highly recommend you always start with that So I've already done that part and then I've already downloaded like the assets and stuff that are needed to recreate this so it should be Really, we're just focusing on the actual editor part So I can click on this button here and hide This is like our funnel view our funnel workflow if you will Like miniature over on the side and when there's more than one page You don't have to exit out and get back like click to another page to get to another page You can just click on the other page and it'll take you right to it. Really awesome. Super. I'm going to hide it for now so Click funnels has sections rows elements, right? So I'm going to kind of go fast through this because I'm assuming a lot of you already know sections rows elements from classic If you don't that's okay But we have the header area up here, which is black and then we have like a red I'm going to treat that as a border. So we're just going to build this that part right there So we're going to do full page it goes all the way across the top And I'm going to do one column because we only have one thing happening up here and that's the logo and then If you notice as I'm clicking from full page and then one column like this menu is staying open And so then I now it's like at an element level It's like, okay now what element do you want inside of that column or row and I want an image And now I'm done adding stuff into that particular section. So We know that we want the background to be black I don't think I have actually let me back up one second because I need to apply the right style guide to this page real quick for those of you who You have multiple style guides. This is how you make a style guide specific to a page. Yeah come out here to your Step your page go to page settings Scroll all the way down style right here. And I have it named dcs for dot com secrets Update your page. I've noticed it does take like a minute or two for it to actually update So when I jump back into here, it might still not be updated, but I'll hit refresh in a minute and and we'll keep moving So let's just check if it is Yeah, it already so I'm gonna go what do we have like pretty much the black black background We're gonna click the image to open up the image settings and I'm gonna add the dot com secrets logo, which is This one I believe yep a way too big So what I can do is shrink my image with down And I also want to get rid of like all of this height But that is going to be in the margin Oh, you just want that to be zero And then there's going to be other places where you can get rid of that that's going to be you see they're in the element the row There's row settings. There's also column settings that you can get to right here now And then there's the section so in all of those places if you're like trying to make it really tight Not have a lot of space around it. There's going to be multiple places. We're going to do that I'm going to make it a little bit smaller and then just leave it how it is But then we also have the red so and I'm going to add the red via a border on the section Because we can add a border on any of the sides of the section By using this cool little tool here now So I just want it to be on the bottom And I'm going to change the color to this red color And I'm going to make it a bit thicker You're nice There you go pretty close Pretty close. Okay. All right. Now here's the fun part So I'm going to add in like a bunch of placeholder stuff for just this section that we're seeing above the fold and then we're going to Make like style it make it the way it needs to be so we need another full page section And we have a single column row happening here. I'm actually going to do two rows Oh Two So I'll do one at a time So we're going to do a sub headline for the top this yellow highlighted text And then I'm going to Make a new row and I'll show you why in a minute I'm going to make a new row that has our headline text in it And I'm going to do two and I'll show you why that also because I've done some Some research ahead of time on this page and how it's built And then another sub headline For this text here. Okay. Then we have we're going to do another row for our video Our video has some text above it So we're going to do Uh, sorry, let's see where we are. We're adding another column And then inside that column I'm going to add a sub headline which is going to end up being our red background text And then a video Okay, so that's where we're going to stop with adding things Now let's make it look this way So I'm going to go ahead and copy. So if you're someone who has Uh funnels already built in classic and you're like, okay, I'm ready to move them over to 2.0 This is going to look a lot like what you're doing. You're going to be going back and forth between your pages And copying and pasting if you are someone who's building from like a new funnel This is going to look a little bit different, but you're at least to learn a little bit right now About how the editor works and just as a name drop Winter jones in the community is creating a process that makes it easier to migrate from 1.0 to 2.0 or sorry Classic to 2.0. He's making that a little bit easier, but it's still in process. So for now I would suggest if you're just getting started or if you're just getting started with 2.0 Become acquainted with it. It is much more natural than you than you think As you see Susan's like zipping through it. It's like natural. Oh my gosh Every time I think you have to like decrease the size and I forget you have the small medium large text You can just choose small and it brings it to the right size. Yeah So that's the awesome part about the style guide is if you already have it set up ahead of time and I ahead of time I went through and I used Chrome extension that tells me the exact sizes of all of the fonts on this page So I went through and created the style guide that I'm like, okay. I want this one to be the size Like I want my small to be about that size my medium my large right and so you can just click these buttons And it'll change the sizes for you Or if you're trying to be a little more specific for that specific place of your page You click override and you can override the size right here and make it anything you want and then there's also mobile Yeah, so okay the background the highlight. I just put a background on it and I made it yellow and I'm going to shrink my row Here I'm going to get rid of the padding on the top and the bottom of the row And then I'm going to shrink the row size to make that tighter So it matches more like this and I can make my text smaller to make it really like Really match it But that is how we achieve the highlight It's just a background and because I made it in its own separate row I can make this more narrow than what I'm actually going to do for the rest of this. Yeah So the rest of this should be fairly simple It's just all going to be large extra large here because I already have my sizes set This one was a little bit different. It's um If you see over here when we were looking at font sizes The default is the rems, which is Designers know what that means, but most people don't you can click on it and then you can switch it to pixels Which we're all more familiar with I'm going to shrink that down to 60 because I already know that's what it is And get rid of some spacing Here okay same with this one. I'm just getting rid of some spacing Okay, so that's pretty close. We're going to just leave that as is it's all it's um Feeling a little bit different because of that side menu And because we have extra stuff So for this part, I'm going to shrink this down It's going to need to be pretty small And then we're going to do the same thing with the background color. We're going to add the red And we want our text to be white And then part of this is bold Oops Bold and then we have to change the color of the bold. Oh, it already did it for me never mind It already knew I wanted the bold text to be white And then to add the icon this icon here. There is another little feature Yeah, and so inside of the I'm inside of the uh the sub headline settings You can add an icon before or icon after and there's a lot of pre loaded icons So I'm just going to type in sound and it pops up And then we can change that color And I like to add a space between the icon and the first letter. You can also add like padding in that setting too Yeah, yeah good point, um Now this is usually it's probably a little bit smaller Uh, this is all tight the vid there is no space between that text and the video So we're going to remove that it's on the video margin so we have that gone And let's see I have a video link so to add the video this there this video happens to be hosted on vimeo So to add your link you just have to paste your vimeo link in right there You have autoplay off on features lazy loading block pause unmeat label um different options in here padding like all the design Things that you can turn on and off as well for the video So we're going to take a pause We're going to take a look at the preview of this now. I do know that the when I refresh this page When you first land on this page it has Uh, oh I have to do the background too It has like click to turn on sound and it has this overlay thing. I believe that's a cf pro tools add on Correct. Yeah. Yeah, so i'm not going to be able to achieve that today with our field right now If you guys upload your video in voomly, um, which is where click funnels is moving all their stuff to If you upload it to voomly voomly will have some of those features built into it So you don't actually have to use the f pro tools if you want that you just have to use voomly and voomly is By far cheaper than vimeo and it's really really cool. It has it has features that no other Video builder or video hosting company has it is just it's so good. So voomly Yeah, we actually are starting to move all of our stuff that we do over to um, voomly as well And vimeo charges like yearly and when it charges is like oh the pain Uh last thing i'm going to do and then I think we'll just do a check-in and i'll check in with ben on how we're doing And how you guys are liking it in the comments But i'm just going to add the background because like this is such a cool background Like little touches like this just make pages for me Um, I had to do a little bit of tweaking because I think they used code for getting it placed exactly right But i'm going to grab our a background that I upload in here And actually what needs to happen is i'm going to put this video Into its own section Need this whole row. I'm just going to highlight over the row and move it down and i'm going to Take the background off that section and actually put it on this section There we go So that it looks better Slick And then you have a lot of Yeah, let us know really quick because this has been helpful for you as we're getting to a stopping point Yeah, I think we are so there's a lot of settings for for backgrounds in here now where you can have like the all the different ways to have it act and Uh, you also have now this positioning which is really awesome So I can choose to have it positioned to the top and now you can see it's kind of anchored to where I'd need it to It's anchoring it to the top of the section. That is so cool. Yeah okay I'm gonna stop there because there's so much more. I could show you there's some really cool stuff on this page but maybe we do a Continuation another day. Yeah Let's call this a tease for today if you guys enjoyed this and you want more of it Let us know in the comments if you're like, well, that was nice But you know what let us know what else you want to see because this is all made for you The whole goal of funnel hacker tv is to be something where you feel like number one You're an insider and number two, you know that you are seen and number three We give you the content that helps you keep going and build your momentum Oh, Susan that was cool. I'm seeing comments coming in so it sounds like maybe we'll can we'll do another one of these again in the future and Well, I that was like really basic stuff And so in the future we can also get there's so many features in the editor So I wanted to make the point though that if you are someone who already uses click funnels classic the editor is I would say it's So close to being identical that you're going to be able to get in there and you're going to know what to do If you have never used click funnels ever It's so simple to get in there You will be able to learn the basics really quickly And then if you're someone who is like I've used click funnels classic But like I had it add in so much code to make it look the way that I wanted it to look and I had to do all these things There's features in there that I didn't even touch on today that make it so you don't even need code anymore It's so cool. I didn't even touch on that. So our main editor's Designer is jake. So jake lesley goes in there and he like designs all the funnels and he's been like He keeps telling everybody he's like it feels weird being a designer or not having to put any code into click funnels He's like you can do everything internally. It's so crazy. Like I don't have to code anymore Like it just I get everything the way I want with no coding because of the tools that are in there So if you guys are just getting started with 2.0, there is A wealth of opportunity in order to be able to make this as fancy as you want or as simple as you want It can be simple. It's built for simple But it's also built for those of us who are a little crazy Those of us who have used classic in the past or you're coming from other funnel builders This is an opportunity to be able to make this So much so much easier and uh and more powerful So susan, thank you so much for taking the time on that.

Thanks for being here We love you. We appreciate you. Let us know what you want to see We'll keep making this better and better. Thank you susan Yes, bye everybody. Bye guys My name is russell brunston and i'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started And we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite You see we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives because we're fighting against the big brands People with literally unlimited budgets. We have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money We have to be profitable in day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the mba's or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible That is happening every single day and it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking It's not really something that I can explain to you It's something I have to show you these stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you We have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories
