Hey there everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are so excited to have you guys. Funnel Hacker Live is done. What does that mean? What was the experience like? What happened? That's where to catch you up on. So we're going live just to go live really quick because as you can see our booth is down. They've taken our booth down. It is gone. It is not there anymore. So what we're going to do is just go live with you guys and talk about everything that's happened so far as they're taking literally everything down. The breakdown has begun. The experience is over. What are the things that we take away now and do we have stuff to show you next week? Oh yes. Do we ever. So really quick, my name is Ben Moot. This is the Leonardson. And this is our good friend Matt Peake. Matt is here. He's an ambassador. He's a brand new the ambassadors. Tell us a little about yourself Matt. My name is Matt. I use ClickFunnels 2.0 exclusively helping new clients know how their funnel helps and their funnel so they can make more work. That's it? Yeah. Now you do video office stuff as well. That's the background. Yeah. That's like my day job right now is my own business. This is my day job. We're on the country shooting conferences and events for people. Now we're moving into funnels. Yep. And it's a good move. It's so much fun. And he's busy already. So it's awesome. Okay. So let's do a recap really quick. Is it okay if we go backwards? Yes. Is that alright? Yeah. Okay. So Russell ends every event with a letter to yourself. You write a letter to yourself in the future. Actually when I came I read the letter that I wrote to myself a year ago. And it was like one of those things I had to pause for and just feel physical. It was a lot. Did you get to write a letter? No. I didn't get to. Oh. So I didn't have to go through that emotion. It was really cool. People were coming up and dropping letters in the bin and you could see like it's a deep thought process. If it's not something you've done for yourself, valuable. I highly recommend. Create yourself a little mini-time capsule and set your goal and put it out there. Then talk to yourself in the future and say, so what have you done? Get on it. Alright. Then what happened before that? Then we had an Andy Grammer concert. You were front row, right Ben? I was in the back. I was out here because it was really loud. It was really loud. That's loud. I could hear the music clearly out here in the hallway. But tell us your experience being in the front row. Oh my gosh. Front row is where the party is at. You're up there in the middle of it. Jumping down the avenue, light up, phone things. Everybody was waiting in the air. It was such a great experience. The concert was a 10 out of 10. It was like so loud. He launched it in like three songs in a row. Then he goes, hey, click bottles. Then he came back and came to. Then he got out of the guitar, played on the guitar a little bit. Then he started to play some of the favorites that we all know. It was fun. It lasted like two hours. Yeah, it was a good room. Two hours. Yeah. And the lights were awesome. The sound was, like every year is amazing. But apparently in order for Andy Graham to perform, he made us upgrade all of his songs. So like it was. Yeah, it was an experience. They swapped out the sound system in between and trying to do a break. That's what I heard anyway. Then they swapped out the sound system so it was different. I don't know if you noticed like when Devon was in there, it was like a lot louder than it was earlier. Then I think they got it adjusted right before the music started. Yeah, it was really, really cool. So before that, we had a couple of speakers. We had the every single year you have this speaker, we had Garrett J. White. And this time he brought his entire family up onto the stage. We've never seen the whole family. We may have been missing the one and a half year old daughter. She came up here. Yeah, they were on the stage. I missed that part because they were all dressed in white. They had a prayer at the end. It was Garrett White. Some people walked away and were like, this was so beautiful. Others were like, what the? It's Garrett White. He wore something for every year. It's something unexpected. Yes. But it was really neat to see this version of Garrett. And Garrett announced that they're doing a new show where they're trying to... It's like somebody walked up to me and goes, so are they making like the Garrett White version of the Kardashians? Is that what they're doing? It's like, how it looks like. Got it, guys. Yeah. So watch for that. That's really cool. Yeah. And then other things that happened right before that, Russell and Myron spoke. This is the first time you've got to hear Russell and Myron. Yeah. Oh, what was that like? That was so cool. Myron, he just got it. He's so good. Look at the scribe, like how he got the attention of everybody. It was so magical. He commands so much. Yes, yeah, he commands. He's so good. Yeah. It's the perfect, like, you know, like... Russell was like super transcribed. I don't remember because Russell got up there twice. Yes, right. And I think it was actually the first time which we'll get to where he actually talked about like... So here's how you sell people. First you hit them up emotional and then you do the logical. And so you need to be super transparent about like today, we're going to be like, shut up and talk to you about the logical. All you logical buyers out there, like I'm talking to you like totally telling them what he's about to do. Myron is like the perfect logical. Like he just writes out the numbers. He's like, look, let's think about it this way. And okay, that's in plan. Okay, let's think about it this way. The cool thing, so I actually was watching that from one of the rooms on one of the screens that heads up in the room. And all of a sudden I see that there's just this gathering of people by the stage. Yeah. And then he's talking, saying his stuff. And then he like goes down the stairs and starts leading him. And I'm like, I asked the person next to me. I'm like, so why did he call those people up there? And he's like, oh, those are the ones that are on the fence. And I'm like, oh, he really just like is just walking them to the back of the room to go over like that was super fun. Yes. But it was really cool. And I heard later that some of the people that were up in the front, they were just in this like internal turmoil. Like, I want to do this, but I don't know. They had to make it. Some of them were in tears because they were in this like internal conflict with themselves. So what were your thoughts on the rest of that? I mean, I thought that that part was really powerful where you got to stand out. You know, trying to encourage to move forward and to take that next step and join to that. That was really powerful. Also, the way he used the analogies of like what something's going to go up, there's this thing. So you play the scene. It has to go into the soil before it can grow into a tree. You got to fall before you can fly. Those analogies that he used really feel like, especially when he drew the line for the heat, when they fall out of the nest and they fly, he's like, debt lives down here. Sadness lives down here. It's right before you take off. That's where it is. That gave you chills. He didn't show us any of that. It was good. But right before then, oh my gosh, I thought, so when Neo came on and like previous to this, in the previous days, like he got everyone riled up more than I felt like anybody else did until Ben Care came on. We interviewed Ben Care. Ben Care ran with the bulls before like we interviewed him. Like he's just that character. He was, oh my gosh, being in that room, it was like, you couldn't have scripted it better. It was, it felt like a film. It felt like a calling. It was, oh my gosh, the music swelling at the same time as he's called. It was brilliant. It was perfect. It was unreal. Yeah. And he's such an impressive guy. The stories he told, the things he's accomplished. Yeah. It's so cool to see it. I mean, yeah, it's one of those things that, again, we think back on it's just like, wow. Yeah. It's funny because like, Russell talked about the fact that he wanted Ben there because everyone needed to experience Ben. Ben Care, I mean, everyone needed to experience Ben Care. And I don't think any of us understood what that meant. We were like, oh, okay. I like, oh, Russell's doing something for a friend. That's nice. No. It was. No. Uh-uh. You want to be on that stage, even if you're Russell's friend, you've got to do something amazing because, wow. The line that got me, y'all don't know what it is. He was a kid. He got made fun of. He was in the bathroom crying. His mom came in and told him to look in the mirror. That line said, you're different. You have to make a difference. That was. Oh my gosh. Because everybody feels different. They all, we all feel like we're on the outcast, on the edge of something. It's like, so make a difference if you feel different. Man, that was good. It's so good. Well, I'm really like Maurice. It's a thing that makes you different. Exactly. And he did, right? Right. He was so loving and wonderful because he embraced it. So dumb. Yeah. Oh. And then before that. Russell gave his emotion logic fear. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was really cool. It was really short. But it was just a really good day. Yes. The whole thing, it's all four days together. So this is your second year. So you kind of know. But this year, it was a bit different. I just feel that this year was different because it was like, you know, Russell's always crafted very carefully with the help of the team to, you know, we know that the four days are basically like the perfect webinar style. Right. But this time it was different because it was linchpin. It was, it was, it was like linchpin meets facilitator. Did you guys pick up on that too? Yes. Like Russell comes out and teaches something and then he has other people come out. I mean, it's a little bit different because we're not like workshopping it. But then we were given the notebook to go and workshop it. And then when Von comes out and hypes everybody up, gets everyone excited. And there's a little video where Russell tells you exactly what's going to happen. I heard, I heard from multiple people. This was like, we've been here forever. This was the best year. Yeah. And there was something magical that happened yesterday when Russell finally like, he taught the linchpin, taught every little piece. And then he came back and taught how he was going to make a hundred million and walk through the entire linchpin, all the stats, how it all works to make a full circle. And the minds and the room just exploded like I get it. And he was like, you like this? It was so cool. And then today it was just always that moment like you go through all of this and then you just have that moment. Yeah. And anywhere it just takes off, you have that elation. I remember seeing the linchpin like it was first coming out. Yeah. And I was just thinking, oh, that's just like another like, it's going to be like another Mifki, they're going to give away or something. It's not. It's so hard. This is the business game changer. If you don't have that look, you need to go get that. Yes. It's a game changer. That's what the entire event was about. And it's kind of built. It's not a framework that's going away anytime soon. Like business. It is. It's the new standard. Yeah, exactly. New standard. And it's like, it's the new standard that you wrap your entire business in. Russell said at one point, this is the plan. Like this is your business plan. It's done for you now. It's your time to bring what you have to it. And that's like, take so much off the board. Where do I start? How do I do this? It's all time. Yeah, literally just fill in the blanks with your stuff. It's built out. I've heard from multiple authors as well, like in the space that like, if you could do this right, like if there's a way this becomes a movement, it's going to change everything. And so watch it. Yeah, Russell and ClickFunnels change in the space one entrepreneur at a time. And if you were not here, get the Lynchpin book. You need it. Lynchpinbook.com. Lynchpinbook.com. This is really easy. Yes. Nice and easy. It's worth it. It ships very quickly. You need it. Highly, highly, highly recommend it. Highly recommend it. Yeah. No choice but not to use it. So other than that, my friends, we're going to go live again on Tuesday. So we're back to our normal schedule Tuesdays and Thursdays. We're going to be going live and sharing number one. We're going to do a recap and show you like a little bit of footage and all the stuff that happened because it was so cool. And we captured so much and had so much we wanted to share with you on top of it. So we're going to do that on Tuesday. And there's things that are happening here soon there after Russell's already done. So if you guys want to keep up, make sure that you text FHTV to 208-231-3797. That's 208-231-3797.
