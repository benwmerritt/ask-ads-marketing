Right now there's two kids in a garage trying to figure out how to kill apple and they'll be a day when two kids will and that's healthy paranoia. We are at Funnel Hacking Live 2021. This is my first Funnel Hacking ever. With me being in Orlando, Florida, it's like oh I gotta be here. I have not seen a production like this ever before. I sent a video to my friend and they're like why are you in a club at 1p.m. and I was like this is a conference. If you got a taste of this energy you would never want to be anywhere else. I can literally say anything and this crew would be excited like chicken pot pie. So Funnel Hacking Live, get on your feet and welcome to the stage. We're gonna be talking today about high quality traffic. We're gonna be sharing with you guys a concept called Funnel Hub. I hope moms ditch the 9-to-5 to work from home. How to fast track your way to the two of Common Club and beyond with challenges. Let's go. What is that? Wait, what? Wait, what? Time out baby boy. What are you talking about? I'm gonna tell you. Let's talk about how you can do this. You just have to ask yourself what are my customers already buying from other companies? So we have our authority style. This is how you get people to act.

When you change the story you've been telling yourself of why you're not where you want to be, you will change your life. We're gonna have to become tougher and stronger. It's gonna take time. It's gonna be hard. What's something you can do tonight, today, tomorrow, right now? You know what should be done in the business daily. Why aren't you doing it? Because it isn't who you are just yet. Good times make weak people. Weak people make lousy times. Lousy times make strong people. Strong people make great times. Where are you in that phase? I am the believer that entrepreneurs are the prime movers in our society. This is why I've made it my life's mission to serve you guys at any level I can. I don't believe that changes we need in this world are gonna happen through government. I don't believe it's gonna happen through school systems. It's gonna happen through you guys right here. This is like life changing. Too much information. Very explosive. I am so glad that I'm here. I have the momentum. I'm on fire! This is so good. Alright. I am mad at you. You're ready. You're born ready. You ready? Yeah!
