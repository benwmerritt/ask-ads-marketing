## Transcript
Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm speaking with Sam Quoc. Sam is a serial entrepreneur, investor, and an author. Together, he and his brother Daniel built a real estate and finance education empire. Their mission is to help every American family experience financial peace of mind. Welcome, Sam. Thanks for joining me today. Yeah, my pleasure. All right. I'm looking forward to getting to know more about you. Can you give us a little bit of a backstory of how you and your brother got started in business and what brought you here today? Yeah. So my brother and I officially got started in business back in 2013. So it marks a decade, actually now, January, January 23 was our decade. And prior to that, we were just normal high school kids. We graduated, going to college, crossing our fingers. Hopefully, we can get good grades and graduate from college and get a good job for the next 40 years and do all that. And until it wasn't, it was until I got back from the military and a friend of mine suggested a book for me to read called Rich That Poor Dad. And that kind of kicked in. It was almost like a sleeping giant being awakened within you. And I didn't even know the word entrepreneurship until when I was like 19 years old. So all the way through high school and life in middle school, I did not know you could choose to be your own boss and start your own business. And so again, the word entrepreneurship was like the first time someone told me that and I'm like, what is that? Like, is that an insult? Like, right? And he's like, no, like entrepreneurship means that you're like a business owner, like you like to make your own path and be created. I'm like, oh, that's interesting. I never heard that word before. And I was 19 years old. So that's what ultimately kickstarted the journey. You know, obviously I can tell you so many stories of, you know, things not working out, failures and you know, working on projects that don't pen out profitable or thinking you're doing something that's going to be profitable. It's not. But that's yeah, 2013 was our official kickstart day when we decided to be an entrepreneur and spend, yeah, gosh, it's been 10 years. So that's a little bit of background story. Yeah. Cool. And what made you decide to do to go into finance and help people with finance? Yeah. Yeah. So, so I'm an immigrant and I moved here when I was seven years old. So this is back in 1999. My parents, my two parents decided to move here for an opportunity. And so my brother and I moved here. My brother was five of seven and the the drive of the hunger as far as being a student of finance came from the fact that being an immigrant family, we didn't know much about how things run here in terms of finances, right? The laws, baking rules, right? All these different things. Plus, you know, initially we had the cultural challenge, language barrier. We didn't know a lot of people as far as our network. So, you know, we grew up, I wouldn't say poor, but we always, you know, grew up broke, right? I remember moments where our parents couldn't pay the bills. So our heat, our heating was shut off for a couple of days and we would always struggle to find, you know, money to buy food. So I've, it's that kind of the life that I grew up that almost became a fuel for me to go and say, hey, I want to figure this out. I want to figure this game out of finance out because I grew up seeing friends that are really wealthy or better off and they're like, what are they doing? That's a little bit different. So it always left me with that question of what can we do to, you know, be better financially, right? Be a better steward, not only to make more money and be wealthier, but also how do we manage it properly in a way that we keep it, right? So that's what ultimately drove that hunger to learn more and, you know, and just become a student of finance and learn as much as possible. And now, you know, I'm my goal and mission, you know, with our business with the clock withers is to help every American family's chief financial piece of mind. But I do that as I want to teach tactics and strategies and perspectives that I wish my family had grown up. And so that's, that's been my mission for the last almost seven years now, being in this specific niche. Yeah, I feel like it's always interesting. The people who I think serve their communities and their customers are the ones who have those personal backstories of, you know, why you chose to do this and kind of overcoming adversity. And I've also spoken to so many immigrants too. And I feel like they have very similar experiences where it's like, they were brought here, they had the opportunity, they, they want to build something because they want to do better for their future and for the people that they're teaching as well. I think that's right. So can you tell me a little bit about what you do in your business? Yeah, so I kind of alluded to it a little bit. So we do, it's a three-pronged business. It's the same organization. But the way we built it, and I'm talking to ClickFunnels users, so we, these three are the three, these three are value adders. So they have different problems that we're solving. So the bottom of the ladder, we help homeowners actually pay off their mortgage faster, typically in as early as five to seven years. And we kind of see that, that business slash offer as more of a triage, right? People, a lot of homeowners kind of go about their lives, not knowing that they can actually save quite a bit of money on interest and time. And then they end up losing money because they're not using some of the methods and strategies we teach. So that's kind of the first part of the customer's hero journey. The second part is we help those same individuals become aspiring real estate investors and help them get their first real estate deal ever. And so, yeah, so we go from paying off a mortgage faster. And in that process, we help them buy and acquire their first rental property or their first real estate deal. And the last thing we do is we teach a cash flow strategy that involves life insurance. And that's all about preserving your wealth, protecting it. So if I'm giving you like a synopsis of the three, it's, let's save money, make money, and let's keep money, keep more of it. So that's kind of the journey of the three different offers that we have. Cool. Yeah, I was just thinking like get yourself out of debt. And then you're out of that. And then why not make an investment and then make money from it? Like what a cool thing. Like you're going through the entire process for these people. That's great. Yeah. So what is it about click funnels? How is click funnel specifically helping you in your business? Yeah, so I've always ran my business knowing that there's a funnel. Like I think I've started using quote unquote funnels because I've seen other people do it, right? And I didn't know it was called the funnel. I was like, oh, this is normal, right? And so before 2019, I was using WordPress and, you know, put things together and Jerry, your things. And so before 2019, I was an affiliate for another company, great companies. And we just had a different vision of what we want to accomplish. And and plus, like when I when I saw Russell do his perfect webinar during I think it was the 10 X conference in 2018, I'm like, Oh my gosh, how the heck did he do that? Right? He did $3.5 million, right? In like 90 minutes. That's amazing. I want to do that. And and as an affiliate at the time, I didn't have the creative controls to be able to come up with some of these ideas. So 2019, we launched our own product, our own company that again, just basically what the three things that I've mentioned, initially will be launched in WordPress and get tried to Jerry Jerry things. And I remember we got to a point where like, we had a refund rate of 20% 15 or 20%. So for every five clients that we signed up, one would refund. And so we were just bleeding money. And that was our margin that we were we were counting on. So I knew about click funnels, because obviously, I knew about Russell. But I was just like, fighting it. I'm like, no, I'm just going to use this cheaper option, right? I'm going to I'm not going to pay as much. So I'm going to I'm going to stay with WordPress because it's cheaper. And it's like virtually free. And obviously, I got to a point of realization of, wait a minute, if I if I'm losing, you know, one client every five sign up, I'm already paying for this. So might as well, you know, pay for a solution that's going to lead to a lesser refund rate. So we switched to click funnels. I remember this is May of 2019, built everything, all the final setup, and it was super easy to get it done. And literally that that month we switched over our refund rate went from 20% to like 4%. So it paid for itself. So the investment of using click funnels obviously paid for itself. Not only that, it's super easy to use, right? And build build steps and pages fairly quickly. So but I think more than just the tool, I think it was the community, the people that are part of this, that, you know, I get the honor and privilege to be part of Russell's inner circle, but every individual in that that that community in the inner circle wants to help you, right? They want to see you grow. They want to see you be cultivated and becoming someone even bigger. So I think more than just, I think the tool was an excuse for why we gather, right? And I think Russell does an awesome job with that. But that's yeah, that's my why as far as why click funnels. It's tool is amazing. But I think the community and the people that that use the tool and want to invest in you and want to see you want to see you grow and work together. Yeah, I think that's that's my number one reason why I'm sticking around. Yeah, the community is fantastic. I feel like already I've just built so many wonderful and lasting relationships with people who genuinely provide value and help you along the way, which is incredible. Yeah, what do you think of what specifically about the software that helped you with your refund rate? I think it's because it's so simple. You know, the the the tools that I was using with WordPress again, you know, I'm not it's not a dig on them or or anything like that. I think it was just the simplicity. You know, it just makes it so it's out of the box, especially I was using the member area functionality of click funnels. And I was trying to duplicate that right with with other plugins and stuff. So yeah, I've the number one complaint I would get with the client at the time was it's so hard to use I don't know how to access it like I lost my login. How do I get to the courses again? Like that was the main theme, right? Whereas with click funnels, you just log in and boom, all the all the sections are there on the left and just click, you know, it's so I think it's just the simplicity that helped people use it and act, you know, be activated. And therefore they're not asking for a refund out of frustration. So I think that that's the number one thing I would attribute to why we had such a drop in the refund or people asking for the money back. Very interesting. Probably just weren't accessing the things that they they had because they didn't know how very interesting. What types of funnels do you use in your business? Yeah, so right now we're primarily a webinar to call funnel. So we do run traffic on ad and we also have a YouTube channel that that generates organic traffic for us. So about I'd say about 40% of our traffic comes from ad 40% comes from organic and the remainder just kind of comes from affiliates. So wherever they come from, they come they come in and opt in for a live webinar. We actually use webinar fuel and we get them registered opt in and then once they complete the webinar, they have they go to the call application page and then apply for a call. And then we are our amazing sales team completes the call and we enroll them. And so we do a high ticket offer. So it's our offer starts at five and our highest offer is 25 grand. So that's yeah, that's we keep things simple. We try to we try not to overcompete things. We learned the lesson in 2019. Keep it simple because your users want one it's simple. So do you find that the best way to close people is by having them book the call? Is that how you do all of your conversations? You make sure that they're calling you they're having a consultation or a conversation with you and and that's how you build that relationship? Yeah, I think just the nature of our niche being in finance and because we sell more of a consultation program. Yeah, we try we typically get them on a sales call and then we do like an estimate on what they can achieve within the first six months. And then we sell based on that. Yeah, simplicity truly does make a difference for you. Oh yeah, for sure. Really cool. Well, what is if somebody were in your shoes or they were interested in starting a business like this and maybe they didn't even know what funnels were yet, but they knew that they had this call. What would be your most impactful piece of advice for a fellow entrepreneur getting started? Yeah, so great question. And I see this all the time, even in just the ClickFunnels Facebook community. And just generally all all entrepreneurs that are in the expert slash info product space. Because that's that's the space I'm in. The number one problem I see all the time is the offer. Like it like they have they may have the best copy, they have the best ad creatives, it's hilarious, it's funny. Everything like from funnel setup to headline, everything looks seems grade. But the problem is the offer and and a lot of people don't know I think a lot of entrepreneurs from the get started, they lack the the depth of understanding of what their audience wants and how they want it and what the messaging is. Right. So like I'll give an example. We struggled. So with our second offer, the Roast Investing offer, we struggled a lot because we weren't really sure what the audience wanted. I think I remember we spent I think we did like five or four rounds of surveying to like to get out of our clients. Like sometimes your ideal clients don't even know how to articulate their own needs. Yeah, you always have to like use ESP to get it get it out of them. Right. But you know, our offer originally started with, hey, like, we'll teach you real estate and we teach everything like very general. Right. And then we realized over time, you know, we had the problem of our client was getting more clear and clear just over time. So I mean, there's really two ways to approach this is either you you launch and create this very generic and general offer and see what your client gravitates to what their feedback is. And then based on that feedback, create something more specific. And it's obviously your paint paint pinpoint to a very specific problem that they have. Or the other way around is you got to have a very, very, very strong, in depth understanding of what your audience wants. And then getting closest as close to as possible. So with our offer, we started that and we realized our clients had a problem not with information or knowledge, but it was a problem of applying that knowledge. And so we started a so we modified offer last year to change the offer name to first deal mentor. And the name itself of the name of the company itself was like the solution, right? Hey, we're a mentor for your first real estate deal. And our big promise is, you know, we help you close your first real estate deal in as early as three or six months, or you get all your money back. Or yeah, so that's kind of the promise, right? So I often like to say if you explain your offer to your 90 year old grandma, and if your 90 year old grandma can't understand it, then you don't have an offer, right? It has to be simple, like, got it, I understand what you exactly do and what and I know what problem you're trying to solve. And yeah, just being super and hyper aware of that, like if you have an A plus rated offer and messaging, and if you have a B minus or C plus ad copy and funnel, like you're still going to win. So like I see that mistake a lot of like even from the within the community, the ClickFunnels community is like they just seem to have this lack of understanding of what their audience wants. Yeah, it's very insightful and very true. I can't tell you how many times I've seen comments or posts in the community where it's like, you know, I did this right and I use this funnel builder and outbill even share like a screenshot of it. It's like some of the most beautiful funnels you've ever seen. Amazing headlines, like it seems like it's fully optimized. Why am I not converting? It's like, well, the funnel isn't your problem, it is the offer. And a lot of times it is because it's either it's, it's too general, or it's using it's like, well, I don't understand what are you giving me. And not only what are you giving me, but what in what timeframe can I expect to see results, which like you just mentioned in your, your previous example of like, you know, three to six months or your money back. And a lot of times people look at something they're like, well, if I, we live in a world of instant gratification and people at least want to know if it is going to take a little bit longer about how long before I start seeing results or until I feel like I'm seeing success. Yeah. So one of the, yeah, one of the tips I give people a time like to do that is like go to who you're, who you think your audience is and test your offer out like verbally ask him, Hey, if I did this X, Y and Z, would you be willing to pay? Like, and then ask him, why would you will be willing to pay? Right? So like just doing verbal, verbal offer, offer creation goes a long way, right? Cause then you're not having to build all these funnels, spend hours and hours on creating ads and webinars. And then later you find out no one's buying because you never tested the offer. So like just take that quick 10 minutes and go to your audience and go, Hey guys, like if I created this and it's going to do this for you, so that you can do X, Y and Z, like would you be willing to pay for it? And if so, how much and why? And just doing asking like maybe five of your ideal avatar that question will probably that's going to put you in a thousand miles ahead of, you know, any beautiful funnel you create or whatever. So that's my big and it does seem so simple. Like instead of selling people what you think they want, why don't you just find out what they want? Exactly. Yeah. And I think the problem is most entrepreneurs are not dramatic, but they're, they're romantic about their, their thing, right? They're like, Oh, I want to offer this because I think this is important. And sadly, like, if you're the only customer of your own offer, like it's, you're not going to, you're not going to sell much of it. So be, be in love with your audience, not your offer, right? That's, you know, that's, that's really important because you could, your offer is going to take a different form and shape, but your audience will always be there, right? And, and it's super important that you're, you're starting a business to, to serve an audience, not to sell products. So that's probably the, the root of the root philosophy that I would go to, to solve that problem. Yeah. Well, that's probably one of my favorite pieces of advice that I've heard so far because it seems obvious, but it's something so few people actually take action on. And it's, it's, it's giving people the tactics. It's like, here's what you need to be doing. It may seem so obvious to sell the thing that you are naturally great at, but ask your audience what they want and let them know what kind of results they can expect. Very cool. Yeah. That's it. Where can people go to learn more about you and your business, Sam? Yeah. So if they just go to the co-op brothers.com, so thkwakbrotherswithanest.com, that's our funnel hub. So everything is, is in there, which by the way, we are moving that funnel hub to click phone us 2.0. So don't judge because it is built on WordPress for now, but we're moving the process of moving it to 2.0, click phone us 2.0. So yeah, it's the co-op brothers.com. Everything you want to know is, is there with our YouTube channel, free resources that we give away. And yeah, come, come funnel hack us, right? Do go opt into what we do and see what the emails and stuff. It's a culmination of the last, oh geez, five years of, of work that's gone into it. So yeah, go test it out. Go, I mean, more than happy to, you know, open the, open the back door and show you what's, what's behind there. So awesome. And I love that even though you're still on WordPress, you're calling it a funnel hub. That's great. Yeah. I'm excited that you're going to be moving over to 2.0. I personally use 2.0 just for some fun side stuff. So I can get well adjusted with the features and understand how all of it works. And I'm having so much fun. I cannot believe how many third party integrations I could just stop paying for and have to worry about. It's amazing. Right. Right. Yeah. No, my team is equally excited, but at the same time, we're scared because we have, we have this like behemoth of funnels like on 1.0. And I think about moving it all over is like, it's like getting a brain and a heart transplant. Right. It's like, oh my gosh, like what if our funnel dies in the middle of like transferring everything over just because, oh my gosh, like, I think every, every entrepreneur knows like you built this huge thing. It's all tangled in the web, it's messy. And so, but yeah, excited and scary at the same time, but that's usually a good sign that you're growing. So yeah, I'm sure that's overwhelming, but I'm excited for you. And I can't wait to see what that looks like in 2.0. And I see you've got, looks like multiple two comma club will work behind you. Will we see you at Funnel Hacking Live this year? Yes. Yeah. Can't miss it. I'm bringing my family, my terrifying family with so it's gonna be her. Yeah, it's gonna be my family tradition. And so there's gonna be, from my team, there's gonna be close to like 15 of us going. So yeah. Yeah. So one of the offer, the second offer, the first year mentor offer, just this genuine, yeah, this past year, we got the two common club over for that. And then we're working on our 2CCX award for the payoff remover one. I think we're, we're about a year short, like one more year where we're at, I think we'll get it. So yeah. Pretty impressive. All of your funnels sound very successful. Thank you. And doesn't sound like you're slowing down. So I'm really excited for you and all of your success and how your business is going. And I look forward to seeing you at Funnel Hacking Live. Yes. Likewise. Thanks so much for joining me, Sam. It was great to get to know you. Thanks, Flora.
