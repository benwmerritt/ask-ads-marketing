So this is the level of hacking. I am. I'm going to ask my wife that and just see how she responds. Will you help me download my email? I know. So I mean, he's very sweet to not make fun of me, but now I'm like, what was he thinking? I knew it was going to be the highlight of my day and then now we're here. So it's actually all happening.

And I think this is episode number 720, but joining us live from the Dallas, Texas area is the one and only Holly Homer. And let me tell you, we just, it was so much fun Holly too. Welcome out by the way. It's so much fun too, is like realizing like, we totally know each other. And then where we've crossed paths, you've been on cruises with Ben, like we've been in Mexico together at different masterminds and stuff. And so it's really fun to get you on here and kind of talk about this journey because we've crossed paths a little bit, but you've been doing so many cool things from being a blogger to actually doing software, my goodness, building email lists. So anyways, welcome out, good to have you. Thank you so much. Yeah, I know it's like a really weird path, but that's kind of how life is these days. Yeah, it is. And the funnel world is kind of small. Like you end up, you know, kind of crossing paths with people, but we always love to find out like what led you to, for lack of a better term, being a funnel hacker or like funnel land. Like what were you doing? Was this something that you always want to do? Or like, I'm going to be an entrepreneur. I'm going to be a blogger. Like where did this start and how did you get here? No, like so my entire story is like, oops, by accident. Happy little accidents like Bob Ross, right? Yes, exactly. So no, like my previous life, you know, I use the air quotes. I was a physical therapist and, you know, helped put my husband through medical school. And so, but I always said when we had kids, I wanted to be a stay at home mom. So as soon as he finally was gainfully employed, we had children and I stayed at home. And I had three little boys and I was completely overwhelmed and felt super isolated because when you have one or two kids, you can like pop them into the car and go places, but when you have three. By the way, Holly, I feel you right now. I have four boys from 17 down to seven. So I feel you keep going. Yeah. So I have three boys. So you're an overachiever, but. My wife is. Yes. So anyway, so I was emailing with one of my friends from college who had two little boys, kind of the same age as my older ones. And we were writing these really long emails back and forth. This is about 20 years ago. And this was going on for like almost a year. And it was kind of like what got me through the week, you know, like I could just like pour out my heart on Saturday mornings and I'd send out this really long email. And by the way, at that time, I was asking my husband to download my email for me. I had no idea that happened like automatically. So this is. Download your email. I am. I'm going to ask my wife that and just see how she responds. Will you help me download my email? I know. So I mean, he's very sweet to not make fun of me, but now I'm like, what was he thinking when I'm like asking him to do this for me? But anyway, so Jodi, my friend, one Saturday morning, the subject line is I think we need to stop emailing. And I was like, no, this is like this. This is what's keeping me sane. I opened up the email and she said, I've been emailing with another friend. Well, hello, I thought I was the only one. And the second part of that, she said, so it would be easier for me if we all started blogs. And she like, she said, you need to go to likeblogspot.com and fill out the form. Give us a context. Like what year is this? So this is 20 years ago. OK, OK. Yeah. So it like, I mean, yeah. So I was like, I inadvertently started one of the first mom blogs. No kidding. Holy cow. Yeah. Yeah. So I went to blogspot and I, you know, you had to name your blog. And so I named it June Cleaver Nirvana. Because I just thought like I have like this kind of traditional, non-traditional thing going on. And I became a blogger that day. And what was really cool is I had been making like at that time, it was like in the heyday of scrapbooking. That's how long ago it was. Yeah. Is I had been making multiple books. And so I was just a baby. Yeah. Like I had just been making multiple books to send to my mom and stuff like this is going to save me so much money on scrapbooking. Yeah. So basically I just started like posting pictures. I like I'm a science background. I had never written anything. So I just had like writing a sentence and posting a picture. And I told my mom and my aunt about it. And I my friend Jody. So I started with three readers. About three weeks in, I got a comment from someone that was not one of those three people. And I clicked through to her name was Megan. And her Megan, Megan had a blog too. And this is when I realized I wasn't the only blogger in the world. Yeah. What would you blog about? I never really started to blog. I literally started blog without ever reading a blog or knowing what it was. So the early years was really stories about me and the boys. It was kind of like kind of Seinfeldian. Because it's like words about nothing. Like very long periods of nothing. Seinfeldian. I like that. But it was really cool because really early on I felt like it was almost therapeutic in a way that I could like stand back when chaos was happening in my house and look at a perspective of how am I going to write about this in a way that has a silver lighting or is funny or something like that. So it really did help me not be in the moment of just reacting, but kind of being able to stand back and say, there has to be something funny about this that I can write about. Can I ask you a question like midstream here? Yeah. So you're doing this. Why? Like are you doing this just as an outlet? Hey, I just need to get words and thoughts out of my brain out into the internet or anything like that. Or did you have a goal? Like I'm going to monetize this or I'm going to try to help people do a certain thing. What was the purpose? Like what kept you going? I have no idea. Really? Yeah. And back then no one was monetizing at all. I don't even know that Martha Stewart or those early sites were even monetized at that point. Because this was before anything. I mean, this is probably five years before Facebook, six years before Facebook even was invented. Twitter came along several years later. And so actually I think for me it was kind of about the community because the early blogs were kind of social media-esque. In that when I got to be kind of a well-known blogger in that space, I might get like 300 visitors to that post every day. But I would get 200 comments because that's how we were interacting with each other before social media came about. Wow. OK, so that evolved into you kind of like doing activity blogs and that type of stuff. Like what are you doing today and how did you get there? Yeah, so I realized so I did that until the kids started going to school. And I had this realization moment when I was in the car line, one of their teachers came out and said, started talking to me about something that I had written about that child on the blog. And then I realized, oh my gosh, these aren't my stories anymore. You're famous. And then I had a crisis because I mean, I have nothing but these children right now, like my whole world is these children. So if I can't write about them because their stories aren't really mine, then what am I going to say? And so it kind of worked out that what is now kids activities blog, and this is what's kind of a crazy full circle moment, was started. It was originally called Quirky Mama and it was started by Rachel Miller. And I bought that blog from Rachel Miller 13 or 14 years ago. And yeah, I saw what she was doing. She wasn't talking personally about her children. She was writing about how to do kind of traditional play crafts and activities. So I thought that's a way I can still be creative and still be in that community without like, I don't know, embarrassing my children on the internet daily. Yeah. One quick question. It might derail us, but you have me hooked. Did you still email back and forth with your friend? What happened here? No, we all started blog. So her and her friend and me. And the funny thing is, is Jodi, and I have a talk with Jodi for probably 10 years, but the first two or three years, she'd leave comments on my blog. And then about five years in, she wrote me an email and said, I can't believe you're still blogging. I gave it up years ago. Jodi, if you're out there listening, reach out to Holly. We want to hear from you. That's right. She wants to hear from you. Yeah. Where are you, Jodi? That's crazy. So, you know, I at some point, though, you have started to monetize. And this has grown from blogging to even a software. And you've become extremely good at building an email list and also, you know, keeping that active. What was the transition then? Let's first start maybe with monetization. Yeah. So in the early days, once I saw that somebody was monetizing, and you have to remember, like I had run a physical therapy clinic and, you know, I'd done budgets and, you know, I've always been a math and statistics girl. So, like, I just, when I saw these things happening, I was like, well, if someone's going to make money on this, I'm going to. I mean, like, this sounds fun to me. And, you know, I'm like staying at home and, you know, it'd be kind of cool. You know, I had the luxury of staying at home and doing this without having to, like, you know, spend money and stuff like that. So, like, I was like, anything extra would be kind of cool. I'd be able to use it, you know, for some fun stuff. You know, wouldn't be taking it out of the family coffers. So I just thought I'd try it. And so I like in the early years, I had all sorts of websites. I did She Is Dallas, which was a local site for moms in Dallas. I started the first business that connected bloggers with businesses that wanted bloggers to write about them, called Business to Blogger. And I like set that up based on Harrow, the Help a Reporter Out, where we sent out an email where you could, you know, start out as an email of all these people wanting bloggers to, you know, either to do it in exchange for freebies or money. And so and then when, like, I was involved in some of the early, early blogger campaigns, when I was, I was involved in one of the local, one of the first blogger's campaigns was run by Chevy, where they put bloggers in the car and Chevy cars for a week and just let us kind of do whatever we wanted to. And then they were like, we just can't find bloggers. And I was running DFW bloggers at that time, which I had over 500 bloggers on my list. And so I was like, oh, I'll just run your blogger campaigns for you. And so I was actually working, like alongside Chevy in those early days, putting bloggers into cars and stuff like that, because, like, we didn't know what this was going to look like. You know, in those early days, like people would be like, hey, you want to try this? And I'd be like, that sounds like fun. Sure. And there wasn't a whole lot of money in it at that point because, like, we didn't know the impact. But I don't know. I just saw it. I just, well, first of all, it was fun. And then second of all, I just really felt like if, you know, as the foundation of all this started, it was going to lead to monetization in ways that we couldn't imagine. Well, in blogging, we can get into the other stuff in a second, but I have. Let's fast forward, right? Let's fast forward. It's 2024. Yeah. Somebody's kind of getting in online. Would you suggest that somebody still starts with blogging? Is that an older notion? Like it feels like it's maybe an older thing, but can it still be successful? Would you suggest somebody starting a blog and doing this? Is there a revival happening? Like what's going on with blogs in 2024? Yeah, I mean, you know, it's funny. We, you know, well, and it's not like Russell has said this from the stage any time blogging is dead. But I always laugh because I'm sitting in the in, you know, in the in the room making my living off of blogging. That's what feeds my family. So it's not dead in 2024. I mean, blogging, making your money, making money on the internet in general, whether it be blogging or anything, is going to be the most massive roller coaster you've ever seen. And and so one of the ways to stabilize that is to have multiple streams of income, which, but I would say I still, you know, my blog gets, you know, between a million and two million page views a month. Yeah, that's a mess. That's a lot of traffic. A lot of traffic. Whether it's like, OK, they're just, you know, they're just I'm monetizing with, you know, ads and stuff like that. But also, hey, I'm selling by my own products. I'm selling affiliate products and all those kind of things. I'm emailing. That was going to be my next question is like, how are you monetizing? Is it ads like maybe you can dive into that a little more? Yeah, for me, it's still the majority of it is still the advertisements. So you see in my sidebar and in in contact in context. The the blogging has gotten really advanced in the last few years in that we I used to have to like manage that all myself through like, you know, Google ads and Google DFP and all these like sell ads. Like I used to sell ads to people like on the side of my blog. And now there's like, there's companies that will come and just do that. And guess what? They're way better at it than I ever was. So yeah. So the ad management companies really help monetize that at a much higher level than we ever could in the past. And then I do like I sell a lot of affiliate products, everything from Amazon to products that are real kid related that might be, you know, from smaller companies that I can get a higher percentage of. And then I sell my own products. I have a, you know, printables library. I do a lot of like coloring pages, worksheets and stuff for preschool and homeschool and then, you know, and just like just little. It's just it's funny. I once had someone coming to look at potentially buying the blog and he he like looked at everything. He's like, I've never seen anyone squeeze more money out of more places. So if I'm making five dollars here and two dollars here and ten dollars here every day, it all adds up. And that's what's really got you. Is that a result? Would you say of one big thing or a lot of little things back to the comment of your potential buyer who said, I've never seen someone monetize like this? What specifically would you think adds up to that? Can I mention affiliate products, kid products? What are you doing that others aren't? Yeah, I mean, I think first of all, I've been like I've been here for 20 years. And second of all, so I've had time to build things over time. Like none of this happens, you know, over a quarter or over a year or stuff like that. But also, like I'm like, I was just like, there's nothing too small to try out. And it's kind of the I always look at everything as like a laboratory, like whether it be driving traffic or like setting up a funnel or monetization is like what little experiments can we do? And then, you know, every algorithm in the world is conquered by doing more of what's working and less of what's not. So it's literally that everything in Holly's business today is do more of what's working and less of what's not. Smart. Well, I want to cover. I want to cover two things for sure. One, I want to talk about how you built this email list. And then I want to talk about your software too. OK. So how then are you building? You've got a list of like 200, 250,000. What was the main way that you built that list? And I do know, well, first of all, how often are you sending to this list? I send at least once a day. OK. So I want to know how you're building this list. And then I want to know how you're sending one to two a day without getting burnout or like unsubscribes. Yeah. So basically about four years ago, in fact, it probably was at Funnel Clicking. It was a funnel clicking live. Funnel. Whatever. Funnel Hacking Live. Funnel Hacking Live. Yeah. My brain isn't working. My friend Becky, I was there with my friend Becky. You may have remembered her. They they pulled her on the stage because she had an email list of like, I don't know, 100,000. And she's a blogger and I sat there and I was at that time. I bought my my list was probably 35,000, which what city was this in? Which which Funnel Hacking Live? This was I think Florida because Orlando. Yeah, I think it was on Orlando. OK, cool. And they they were they were talking about email us and they're like, look at this girl. She has over 100,000. And I'm like sitting there like, well, and I know Becky really well and and she had actually worked. We'd worked together and stuff like that. So I was like, kind of inspiring that I was like, oh, well, Becky can do it. Like I'm going to do it too. And so I had like one or two opt-ins on on my site. And I just decided and like this did not happen first when I get home. And this is one of the things that like I would encourage people like like life happens and you don't get around to things sometimes. But as soon as you can get around to things. So as soon as I could get around to it, I ended up I said, I'm going to put a new opt-in on like once a week. So I'm just going to add an opt-in. And for me, like, you know, it's coloring pages. I just decided to gate any of my printables with an email. Sorry, not. So I started with. Yeah, I started with one or two. And then as I got a system put together because I knew I was going to have a lot. So like that was the other thing is at the beginning, I was doing just a lot of testing and then trying to figure out how am I going to manage a lot of a lot of email signups. Because, you know, if you have like a convert kit, which I use or or an Aweber or something like that, they're expecting you to have maybe 20 at the most. They're not expecting you to have hundreds. And so I kind of developed a system and then I hired someone and it was like a 15 year old girl who just who that's all she did for me. So she'd come in every few days and just hook up anything that we had on the site. That was that was a printable. So because I'm not very good at tech. So I was just like, I don't want to worry about it. And of course, like if you hire a 15 year old, it's not that expensive, by the way. But so over the years, I need to go to count them. But I have probably over 1500 opt-ins now. Holy cow. Right. Yeah. But I started with one. And then like as you got better and easier and as you have a system, you can multiply that. So today, like I'll probably end up with about 600 new subscribers today. That's just generally what I get on an average day. But I'll also have 200 math on that. That's 600 day. Oh, I know. Rad. But I'll also have two or two, 300 unsubscribes. Who cares? I don't have to pay for it anymore. You're doubling over that. Yeah. Yeah, who cares? So net net three to four hundred a day. Yeah. Yeah. So and I think that's I learned that on Facebook, though, when I when I built Corky Mama and, you know, people would be like, oh, you post too much, you know, you should you know, the like you're going to get people that unfollow your page. And I'm like, good riddance. They're not that into me. Yeah. Are they aligned or they not aligned? Yeah. And like, in fact, in the early days of trying to get a like an algorithm to start noticing you, like you really want action, whether it's positive or negative action. And so that's kind of the way. And so even like every month or two, I'm going to go in and like weed out the people that that are opening the emails because they're it's expensive to run an email list of that size. I got I got to know what's the subject line for today's email. Subject line. So I have them scheduled out for several weeks. I don't know what today's is, but I will tell you, Mark, we we we A.B. test for a really long time until we get a formula that works. So it's going to be it's going to mention three things. Something for everyone, basically. And one of those things is going to have the words for kids. And that's what we we tested a ton of A.B. tests on just a bunch of the emails. And that's what that's the formula we fell into. And we use a lot of emojis too, because we're fun. How how far are you scheduling these? In general, in my business, I like to be two weeks ahead because like, otherwise there's not a buffer for like life to happen. Holy cow. I hope people are paying it. I know for could be a lot of beginners who are listening to our podcast. And really, one thing that Holly is discussing right now, just to point out is, you know, and dot com secrets is referred to the Seinfeld sequence, but right, your broadcast buckets. So people that are on your list that you can now communicate with for free. That's traffic that you could control or don't control. That's now traffic you own, right? You can appear in their inbox whenever you'd like until they don't want to hear from me anymore, like you mentioned, you still haven't had positive. But people leave your email list every day. It's really just how it works. My question to you is you clearly. Indoctrinate people the right way. They come onto your website for one of your printables. They have to enter their email to get access to a coloring book, etc. Something that you have in your website. How are you putting them through a we call the soap opera sequence, right? As they come into their meeting you, their understanding, your why, you know, getting that human to human connection through written communication. What are you doing to make them so to make them love you? Besides being you. Yeah. So, like, and I am the face of Kids Activities blog, but it's not about me. So I do have a basically a soap opera sequence at the beginning of. But I've cut it back to just I think it's three email sequence now because I'm going to email them that day anyway. You know, remember, whatever I have scheduled is going to go on top of what I'm doing every day anyway. So I start with kind of a little bit of the story of how I started the blog and why I do it. And then so I feel so it's a little bit of human connection there. But then then they're going to jump into getting those emails and my emails. I use my email for traffic. So I am going to be sending out, you know, probably 10 to 12 links to my blog. And then it's going to sometimes they'll have a chatty little story or a picture from my phone. But the main thing is the content. I need those people to click over where I monetize or buy something for me. There's usually at least one monetizable link in that to be on beyond just the traffic. And then I have a dog. I have a black and white Frenchie named Panda that Panda and I write the emails. So you'll see Panda. You'll see go to friend of Kids Activities blog. Panda picks up over the Panda becomes a joint attractive character here. Yes. So I'm what I'm hoping is to move the attractive character onto Panda. Since my my my main people that that read the blog are our moms and and some dads of preschoolers, kindergarteners, early, you know, early grade school. My youngest just is graduating from high school this year. So like that's one of the things I like. I need that timeless thing a little bit too, because I've moved beyond that stage in a way and to the point where a lot of the things that I publish on the blog today, I hire other people to write because they just have a much better perspective of being in the trenches of at that age. Yeah, this is this is this is great. I know, right? It's really the foundational basics that always stay the same, you know, like online marketing 101, just looking at those metrics. And one thing I've gotten out of this conversation is that you're not afraid to try new things in your business, right? See if it sticks and then pour gas in the fire. Well, it's the last new thing you felt like you've adopted that you could share with our audience. So and I love what you said, because like like failure and even though it feels gross is one of the greatest gifts you'll ever have with that fire. I mean, like, I mean, it's it feels horrible when you're in the middle of it. But when you fail at something, especially if you fail spectacularly at something, then you get so much data that you could never get from the success. So so like I love to throw. I mean, I like I'm throwing stuff out there all the time, like, you know, and I think back over the years, like if I'm an early adopter to everything, I'm like in it for the the adventure. I'm like often practicing in front of people. You know, so like, you know, I think back to like when Facebook Live came out for the first time, I had been doing live video on Google Plus, which yeah, that doesn't exist anymore. But I had I love live video. And so I was super excited when my Facebook page, Porkey Mama, got live video. And so it got I get rolled out like five o'clock on a Friday afternoon. I'm live at six p.m. And, you know, and I'm going live to, you know, like a page that had at that time, probably one point five two million people on it. So I'm like practicing in front of an audience. And, you know, and like you just have to be OK with what what that what life is like when that you're doing that, you're not good at it. You're like you're not, you know, like I don't know. So so when you're at a scale and so sometimes that's one of the things I'd say if you're getting started and you're turning on a camera and no one's there or one person is there, that's actually it's a blessing in a way. Because by the time those people are surrounding you, you're going to be a lot better at it. You've heard how Garrett J. White like it's hilarious. Like, yeah, quote on my I have that quote everywhere that you're going to suck at something long enough until you're not you're not going to suck. And nobody's watching when you first suck. And you know what? Eventually you're going to suck less and less until you're going to suck so little that you're finally good. And that's OK. I love that permission. It's it's fantastic. So the latest thing I I've done is is I've gone back to Pinterest in that like I had hired it out for a while and and it was doing OK. But I thought, you know what? This is one of the higher traffic sources to my blog right now. Like I'm going to take I'm going to take the next quarter to really dive in and do it myself and make sure that we're maximizing it. So that's like my life. Like I've pinned probably 20 things today. I've made new pins and all these things things that I haven't I hadn't done for several years because I was working on other projects. But I thought this is a way to to kind of throw myself in to make sure that my business is optimizing that traffic in a place that is actually sending traffic right now. Now, yeah, in that same vein, you've created something from what I understand that helps remove you from this in building this list. So tell us a little bit about PageWheel. This is like using AI to help people build these lists so you can remove it and work on other things that are your superpower. What's that all about? Yeah, so PageWheel kind of came about because Rachel and I Rachel Miller is the other one that is a partner on this. We have another website called One Crazy House. And so we were putting together based on kind of my opt-in like, hey, let's get a million opt-ins. And then we thought, OK, we'll do an opt-in, but then we also want the low ticket products. And so we were like putting together like camping guides and organizational guides and how to clean your kitchen and how to clean your bathroom and stuff like that. But they were all like low ticket, printable, you know, workbooks, that kind of thing. And so you guys know as funnel builders, like a small funnel versus a big funnel, it's still a lot of tech and moving things, moving pieces, putting everything together. And so I was just like the math on selling seven dollar products without an upsell. Is hard in this world. If you're spending, you know, 10 hours on a funnel and, you know, several hundred dollars on on software and stuff like that for that. Like and so we're just to to move that out to get list building and small engagement pieces with that. Like I was like, this is really hard. And and the other side of that is I wanted something to be able to throw things out daily, not not have to build, not have to rely on every product to move the needle. Kind of the spaghetti throwing thing. And so we started out thinking we would just, you know, automate some things. And then Rachel was like, no, I think like we could solve this by creating like templates that would create a digital product. And so we started on this about three years ago. And the cool thing is, is we were about halfway through the coding of this. Well, and by the way, she was like, you want to make a software? And I'm like, yes. Yeah, which is daunting to even think about. Trust us, we know. Yeah. So three years later. Yeah. Um, but like what was really cool is about halfway through AI shows up on the scene and we had been creating these templates and like hand typing, like writing them. And, you know, for all these different niches and all of a sudden we realized we could connect AI into all these templates and all these different ways, you know, that a prompt could be then behind the scenes have additional prompts. And it just all came together in a way that was really magical. And then because we know what you made because you made it in PageWheel, it automatically creates the sales page or opt-in page and the delivery page. So you don't have to connect all that. It's like a starter or like a kind of a sales page for dummies. Because you can go from like starting, like creating that product through the launch, like having a link of a launch in 20 minutes or less. And so it works really well. And then what I love about it is like, let's say one of these goes crazy. You know that that's a proven product. And so like it's going to be worth your time to go to ClickFunnels and set up, you know, a nice funnel with upsells and downsells on my concept because you've already done the research. And so I just like it, I couldn't be more excited because it solved a big problem in my own life. Yeah, that's awesome. Right. Even from a product creation standpoint, creating something makes your life easier will in turn more than likely do it for others as well. Well, yeah, no. And I'm like, you know, I'm like that guy who like I like it so much. I bought the company. I know I needed this so much that we had to make the company. That was ClickFunnels too, right? Right. Yeah. Russell needed that. Well, I know this can help other people too. I mean, you've got your wealth of knowledge. How does somebody find you?
