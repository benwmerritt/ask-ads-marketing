So I'd want to dive in, and as you know, our ClickFunnels audience, they're very into funnels, right? Online marketing and being able to make enough money to either A, pay for anything, any goal that they have in life, or supplement their own income from a job, what have you. And somebody who has gained quite the presence over the, you know, on the internet over the years, what got you interested into this online world? What was your first introduction? So I think by now a lot of people know that my ex-husband is one of the founders of JV Zoo. And from our dating, from when we were very young, and him being a computer programmer, I was just always looking over his shoulder and learning. Then I went through a phase where I didn't want to be the person who couldn't hold a conversation about what he was doing. So I was always going and getting the next programming book from the local Barnes & Noble, and Greensboro, North Carolina, where I went to college. And I couldn't afford those various kinds of programming books. So I bought one and I just kept exchanging it for the next one. And luckily, when the manager realized what I was doing, he let me. But, you know, it just progressed that as my life grew and changed, and I was retiring from my professional dance career in New York, I had already been out in the corporate world. I was already an executive. I thought, what's next? And JV Zoo at the time needed help. And I was there and I was already passionate about it from speaking constantly with my ex-husband. I knew that they loved the project and I thought, okay, I'm going to dive in. And I was so green. I was so green. You know, like I had read all these programming books back in the day, but I was not a programmer and I wasn't up to date. And I just went headfirst in 2014 into JV Zoo world. Very cool. And you mentioned you were an executive in the corporate world. Were you still in anything that dealt with with online marketing or anything of that nature? What was your career like there? No, I was, I was there VP of operations, but it was, it was a very, even though a national chain, very New York City centralized. And so it was a lot of like face to face. Like I don't want to say knocking on doors, but it was building personal relationships face to face still. Okay. Which I'm sure paid dividends into what you're doing now, tenfold at this point. Yes. Diving in 2014 totally into JV Zoo. And actually real quick, one step back for those listeners or viewers who happen to live under a rock. What is JV Zoo? Okay. So JV Zoo was an affiliate network and an online marketplace. We have over one million active affiliates to date. And we just help facilitate everything from splitting the payments to, you know, letting people who have a click funnels funnel set it up, utilize our affiliate base and making sure everyone gets paid, gets paid all time and everything happens seamlessly for them. Very cool. And it's been something that has not only been a huge catalyst in the affiliate marketing industry, but it's also been a great way to get that rated. How many millionaires would you say at this point? How many thousands? No, I really wish I knew an astronomical amount. We finally said, you know, we give the notifications within the system, but I don't pull the report and I should, but it is, I mean, when I see someone who's made $15 million, $20 million on JV Zoo, I'm mind blown by it. Right? So cool. So cool. Yeah. And with, you know, again, diving into this world, what was the first moment where you're like, I'm on the main stage, like this is, you know, stepping into that light. What was that like for you? Imposter syndrome? Walk us through that, if anything. You know, I rarely experience imposter syndrome. I'm not going to say never, but it's rarely because I do the work. And so I feel like that, you know, when you do the work and you show up authentically and honestly, then you may not know everything and that's okay because you're willing to admit, hey, I don't know that. Tell me more about that. But, and I'm always learning. Like I, I feel like I'm a human being who's growing, always learning. But when I felt like, whoa, okay, I'm at the forefront of this. I think it might have been actually the second time I was at the Inc. 5000. And I was looking around at these incredible people. And just like, whoa, I didn't really the first time I was kind of star struck. But then the second time, I think being there was looking around and I was like, I'm not at a convention that I paid to be at. I have been invited here. And these are my peers. And realizing that these were my peers as opposed to like, I'm just trying to like wade to Tony Robbins. No, he's speaking to me because he's speaking to us specifically as the group that's been invited here. Very cool. It's my grandma used to always tell me like everyone puts on shoes the same way or everyone ties their shoes the same way and stuff. And it's, you know, at any point, even maybe even speaking personally, if I've experienced, you know, imposter syndrome, I do know that I'm growing right and pushing myself and pushing the boundaries. You know, you're in the right spot. And that's admirable too. Of, you know, second time being an Inc. 5000, which, you know, top 1% of companies ever reach with coming into, you know, this industry. What was the first job you had within JV zoo? Did you go from executive to running this company as well? No, so I can't. I stepped back from my executive position when I came to JV zoo and came in as a consultant. I was just doing some consultant work. And I mean, I remember I was in the support desk all the time. I was trying to see what the users were experiencing, but also it's a great way to learn a platform is to get in the support desk and from my previous roles and other companies, I believed in working every position in the company. So if it was a company that I was answering telephones, which I'm awful at, I'm the worst receptionist in the world. I have so much respect for anyone who's a receptionist, but from I really think it's important so that you understand and don't take for granted the people who you work with. So working in the help desk was huge for me at JV zoo. And then eventually they said, Hey, we want you to be our COO. And from there it was not long at all months before we came there. Very cool. It's I don't know if you know this even from a personal experience, I also started at ClickFunnels answering support questions as well. Like, you know, the maybe from a sales perspective, even just conversational, the more I know the ins and outs of whichever product or company that I'm working for, I feel like the better conversations I can have because I can actually listen to somebody. Right. Before I'm thinking in my head of what I need to say back, what I need to see to help them where I can actually just understand their problems and their issues and, you know, take it and recite it back. Right. It's well and truly, if you want to know what's working and what's not working in your company, go through your help desk tickets. Huge. You can quickly see what people are frustrated with what people love. People love to get their feedback. You get in your help desk. You can quickly find out what's working and what's not working. Is that something you still do today at all? Or maybe someone on your team? What's that look like now? No, so I still do it. Of course, I am. I'm the person that really intents to get skedescalated to, of course, but I like to randomly pop in a few times a month. And maybe I do it because I'm up at five a.m. And I know that my help desk, no one's on the desk right then. So maybe I think, you know what? I'm going to help my help desk out today and I'm just going to clear them out so they come into no tickets. And so sometimes I get in there, I answer tickets other times. I just pull random tickets. If there's one that scored high, if there's one that scored low, I just want to see maybe if I can figure out why it was scored high or low. And if it's low and I can't figure it out, I'll reach out to the customer. And I'll just say, hi, it's Laura. I'm the CEO of JV Zoo. I see you just rated a support ticket poorly. What would have made your experience better? And you learn a lot that way too. You also learn that there are just some people in the world that are angry and upset and nothing's going to make them happy. And that's okay. That's okay. You just let it go. But a lot of times you can learn, oh, I see, I see what was frustrating and I can resolve issues company-wide at that point in time. That's very, very true. And not only cross what we do for a living, but multiple industries as well. Anyone who's listening to this that's in local business, we do have a lot of listeners who are in the brick and mortar industry and even, I guess, from a story standpoint. And you know this about my background, but being from the same area of the Grand Strand, my dad is still to this day a manager of restaurants. And it's with dissatisfied customers. He always loves just hearing about how to improve their experience and then again, bringing them back, creating a customer for life. And it's a testament that you're doing that at JV Zoo actively, right? Still to this day for someone starting out, right? Because we have a lot of listeners too that are building their first funnel, right? Getting their first few sales, trying to get their first two comma club award. How different is it, if anything, if you're just starting out? To listen to your customer. To listen to your customer if you're just starting out. Okay, so I think you have to have a clear idea of what your business is. What are you doing? What are you serving? Right? Who are you serving? And then you have to know, especially when you're starting out, you can't say yes to everything. So you've got to stay your course. And even if you're saying no, you can tell customers no in a polite way. You can let them know if that's great feedback. I absolutely see why you would want this. Unfortunately, at this time, you're not going to be providing that. But I am going to add it to our list of features or whatnot for down the road. And you will find that, yes, when you are planning out your two, your five, you'll go back and look at those things and say, do these make sense for how my company is evolving now? A lot of times they'll still be a no, but sometimes you're like, this is where we're going now. That's huge. Have you felt, you know, in your time running a company that you've gone back to, I don't want to call it a backlog, but something like that of, oh my gosh, I would have forgotten this if I did not keep track of that two years ago. And now it aligns perfectly where we're headed. Could you dive into that at all for us if that's true? Absolutely. So anyone that knows anything about me knows that I am a big pin to paper person. I run tech companies, but I am pinned to paper. Yes. Well, and it's associated with more robust brain activity, more so than putting notes in your phone or on your computer, typing them when you physically write, you have more robust brain activity. So I think there's a lot to say about that, but I keep running lists. And I, so like I'm a big notebook person that I have, I'll show you right now, tons of these black notebook, and I mark them different tabs being different things. When I'm now going to go back and look at things, which color tab to pull up. So I'll look at all of them when we're deciding or planning the next year to say, hey, with what we decided prior to this list, right, prior to looking at other people's feedback with where we know with this company, we're headed, which of these things fits in there? How can we make some customers happy? If I date, if I noted who opened that support ticket or suggested it, I may even go and write them like the week of the feature rolling out to say, Hey, remember two years ago when you asked for this, we're finally getting to that now. And I just wanted to let you know I hadn't forgotten about you. Hmm. That's awesome. To know me, I'm just, I sometimes play the role like the curious five year old that always kind of digging into questions and asking why. So you're completely welcome to shut down this question. If it's too much of a peek under the hood, I'm not offended. Could you share any stories of that? Maybe a customer experience and improvement that you made again, welcome to vague or dig deep, but something where it's like a customer suggested something that not only enhanced their experience inside your platform, but the entire company overall. Oh yeah, I mean, for the longest time, JV zoo was like, we're digital downloadable products only. We are not getting into the physical realm. Well, then the day came that we're like, we have to allow our people to sell physical products. You know, so we started planning that out. And then we, we said, okay, we also understand the business aspect of this, not only because our users wanted it, but it lowers a refund when there's a physical product, it lowers the amount of refunds that come with a digital product. So yeah, it was a, it was a business decision, but then I got to reach back out to a lot of people to say, and I had a list of people's business cards as well that I had kept that I'd written on the back from being at events like TNC or affiliate summit who had said, when JV zoo lets me do physical products, I'll come over and I had a stack of business cards that I sat down with my team and I said, Hey, let's reach out to all of these people because that, you know, I wrote on the card. What event I was at what year it was, what did it was they sold. I said, let's look if they're still online if they're still selling we reach out. That's amazing. And there's this book and I'm gonna butcher the title but I think it's something about like top 10 things the rich want to keep secret or something like that. Whoever wrote it. I mean, his first name was Brian, but there was something in there about the biggest kept secret in business is just listen to your customers right and give them what they want of you know, it doesn't take some rocket science idea or astrophysics you know it's really just kind of of what problem do they have right now and can we enhance to solve it and it's it's pretty simple right it's being a human and doing that in those regards. You brought up something I really want to unpack at length and keeping a book of Rolodex from individuals you met at events. And the more I grow in this industry I love to pry and ask questions and so many people speak volumes to networking and there's just something about shaking somebody's hand in, you know, first person or that's not the right word was three dimensional realm, not through a screen. Yeah, how has that impacted your career. Greatly. And I have always been social. Prior to coming into this world I was a professional dancer. I was always, you know, doing events and out there and an extrovert so to speak. So, when I came into this industry I wanted to get out there and meet as many people as possible, learn from people. Sometimes it was sitting through the actual event but a lot of times it was just networking saying hi how can I help you what can I do for your business. And if nothing, still just knowing if I could connect that person to someone else that could help them in their business because being a connector is a very great role to play in life. Maybe you get nothing out of it now, but you never know what will come in return to three years down the road when you're a. But also, so when the pandemic came and everything kind of shut down. It worked great for me personally because I was pregnant at that time. So it was nice that things shut down and I got to take a step back from always being on an airplane always being on the road. But then as things started coming back up, I had either a newborn or a one year old and I didn't want to travel that much because well moms are physically needed. I mean we just you know we're needed during a certain time of our children's lives. So, I had been about two years my daughter was two and people started messaging me saying you know like Laura, you're never anywhere anymore. And like what do you mean I'm never anywhere and they're like, like people, people are wondering where you are what's going on with you and I'm like, well I'm always online everyone's seeing me post everyone seeing this and they're like no it's strange because not because my competitors were out more than me, but because everyone was so used to seeing me that when they did it, it was strange for them. So now that I'm back on the road and networking I can definitely say like I see the difference in the business as well. Interesting. And it is, yeah, it's a relationship industry and, and even, you know, I guess no matter where you're at in your business if you want to equate that to revenue impact. There's always people that will be willing to help and other people can help in return and I hate being cliche but it's the whole thing of, you know, givers gain and a rising tide, you know lifts all ships, and just to echo your statement of when you play the role of a connector. It is just basic human nature right the law of reciprocity that it will come back tenfold when you always have had that in mind and I've been in this game long enough to know when people are out for themselves and I mean, I do hate. I'm not a negative person by nature but I will say in confidence you won't be here very long if that is intentions of you know whether it's for yourself company etc. So with being back out on the road and you seeing the impact of what it's happening with your business. Can you tell us about maybe certain goals you have in mind when it comes to going in the event you go to an event of hey at these bullet list of things I want to accomplish need to happen and also traveling with your daughter which I've seen on social media that's super cool. I'll elaborate on both of those for us. Okay, so it depends on the event if I have, or I always have a plan so that's not if I have a plan I always do. It depends on the event. The first time I was in Dubai this year. I was speaking at a very JV zoo specific type event. The user base of JV zoo and one or two competitors was who the audience was going to be. So I knew specifically who I was there to speak to who I wanted to, you know, recruit over to JV zoo and the message I wanted to get out for our industry no matter where anyone was what platform you use. This is our industry that feeds our children. Let's make sure we protect it kind of message. So yes, I had a plan for that there are other places that I go that maybe I'm only teaching or if I'm speaking there I'm teaching about business in general business growth how to manage teams and my message is simply like, here's what I know how can I help you kind of thing. Very cool. Yeah, so yeah always have a plan and then you can plan all you want to when you travel with a toddler and it's probably. But yes, I do travel with my three year old. She's actually a fantastic traveler. I am fortunate in that respect. And recently she did travel I believe she did to me think about this she did a two hour flight, followed by a two hour layover followed by a seven hour flight 12 hour layover eight and a half hour flight. Holy cow. Zero meltdowns. And I was prepared for them because how much are toddlers supposed to process and but she's great traveler. She knew like on our 12 hour layover she just kept saying like even when she'd wake up I just need to nap some more and she would get back in that one time she got up she's never worn an eye mask before she gets up and she says I just need an eye mask. I don't know she sees other people in the planes. But yeah I think exposing my child to these things is highly important because she knows the world. It's not that big. Yeah, very cool. And kudos to you as well I'm sure you'll be a purple heart recipient at some point for having all the traveling with with your daughter for sure. What's that like you know working while traveling with your daughter as well. What's the day to day structure like have you had to figure that out on the go. Explain that to us. Yes, so it takes a village, and I have a great village. So, I'm really fortunate to have a nanny that can travel with me and do things with me she's 21 tons of energy, and truly like my other daughter at this point in time. I have a lot on her when we travel. So, and we learned together the two of us. The first time wasn't so smooth. We planned before the second time we talked through things each night we talked about hey this is what we're looking at tomorrow here's my schedule tomorrow. Here's when I'm going to need you fully to be on. And then here's what I'm going to come back and take on 100% mom duties and you go out and explore and get, you know, do what you want to do. Absolutely cool. It almost you know very similar to the role of an assistant, right it's kind of like you know your business at home and going the same way like you know I with my assistant we review my schedule and looking at you know what's to come whether it's you know the week, the month, the quarter kind of always keeping your finger on the pulse that's really neat to kind of see that stretch over into family life as well from a structural standpoint. Absolutely and it's really about communication and also respecting the people that work for you like I think a lot of times people travel with nannies and don't understand they cannot work 24 seven. So, knowing that you're like still being a mother you're still a parent so I want to raise my child. I don't want anyone else to raise her so I make sure to say hey you're off duty now like you can hang out with us you do whatever you want to with us but this is now my responsibility. That's very cool. And Abraam bulls well. So, one thing I wanted to hit on that I know our audience is always just very curious of from business leaders and I guess my opinions could definitely be straight but even really, whether it's a company of two people or 100. Culture building doesn't change a whole lot in between then obviously it changes because it gets more and stuff like that but it's very different. When it's remote and a lot of our listeners do have employees all throughout the globe as I know you do as well. What's it like being a CEO of a company that I guess we could say is it 100% virtual or 100% remote or mainly remote how would you define it. So we give 100% telecommuting we have office space and people can come in if they want to. Gotcha so we're really the same way here in Boise, Idaho with managing a team that you know in that hybrid model is culture building different how do you bridge that gap. Oh, so you know, I honestly prefer this. After having spent decades in office as an employee and knowing not only how people waste time but how I wasted time myself as an employee. Right. I, I decided to manage people the way I wished I had been managed, and that is to do a thorough interview process. No I'm hiring the right people with the right skill set, and then to treat them like mature adults. I don't manage their time schedules. We, we are very clear on this is the expectation. This is what you need to achieve by this date. And then I don't care if you have a dentist appointment if your child has a soccer game if you're going to go and get your hair done at such and such time. I don't care. I don't want to know that's just wasting brain space. I don't want to give it away easily. So I let my people be mature adults and I don't not trust them until they give me a reason to and this isn't baseball this is a job so you get one morning and the next time you're gone. That's how it works. And everyone is great with it. I have not had to fire many people in the eight, nine years I've been running this company and even better than that is that the people that do want to be micromanaged have later come to me and said I was wrong. I thought during my interview process, I didn't want to be micromanaged turns out I actually need that in my life. And I have helped them find their next job. That's awesome. Which you kind of know me a little bit. I'm a sports geek. And there's all those quotes of like the game is always one or lost before it's even played right and playing football in high school like, you know, or any kind of sport anyone who does can relate you know the prep work that goes into any type of endeavor and even when I've spoken on stage, the more prepared I am the less nervous I am which goes into your common on imposter syndrome to and I say that because you mentioned you have a pretty extensive interview process right you really know who you're hiring at that point which is why you've had to fire. So if you people in your career, explain that process to us as much as you can without the secret sauce you can keep some of it. Yeah, I'm going to give you our secret sauce. And I'll tell you, years of trying to get it right, that when we finally got it right, we're now years into doing this process and it works. So I am the last interview for every employee no matter what level they come in on. And the things that happen first and we do more than one or two or three interviews, we just do because we figure by the time we have the people that you're going to work with your team. When we have the people that are going to be on your team talk to you ask you the questions they feel are necessary, not me, not my CTO, the other people that are going to be working alongside you. They're asking you the questions they need to know are you a good team member for them. That's also how you protect company culture. But then, as you put they progress through, I don't care about skill set anymore. I know they already know if the skill sets there. I know they already know if the personality that fits with our culture is there. I know they already know if they can trust that person. By the time it gets to me. I'm no longer interviewing. I'm saying, did you ask all the questions that you needed to ask? Do you know the company that you're coming to work for? What do you need to ask of me to make sure you're making an informed decision today when I make you an offer? And then I let them name the price. Very cool. And you would say, how long did it take for you to iron out that process? So I would say years of being an executive prior to coming here. And then probably another two and a half years. And then as we were growing and we were growing so fast and we were hiring quickly because we just had to. We started seeing the culture of our company change. And it wasn't what we wanted. It wasn't what the core group wanted. And so there were things we did. That was when I did have to do some firing. Because we weren't great hires then and we hired the wrong people. But after that, what I started doing each time was asking my team, do you need me to hire someone else? Or do you need more money? Because you have to understand money motivates people to a certain extent. But then they're simply, you know, life. If there are young people or people in a phase in their life where work is what they want to do, work is what makes them happy. They're not interested in being social and doing other things. And they might want to grind then and just make money. But then there are other times that people are like, this isn't a healthy balance for me. I need to see my family. I want to be able to have brunch with my friends. Whatever it is that matters to them, play baseball or softball on Saturday morning. So you'll find that your team, the more that you treat them with respect, will treat you back with respect. And they'll just say, no, no amount of money you could offer me is going to make me want to work anymore than I'm doing right now. We need to hire people. We need bodies in here to help us. And so that's the way I've always done it. And it works really nicely. Very cool. That's awesome. And all of this, you know, skill set knowledge, everything you've developed at some point compelled you to put your thought on pages, right? And write a bestselling book, trust your increments. What went into that thought process of wanting to take on such an endeavor like that? Well, I thought at the time I was consulting because, you know, I don't just run JV Zoo. I run a lot of other companies, my own companies as well. And what I realized was that in consulting with other companies, I was regurgitating a lot of the same information and or re typing it in emails or whatnot. So I started just putting information down in Google Docs. So I didn't have to keep typing it over and over again and just saying, let me send this doc to this person. Let me send it to this person. Then I realized, wait, I've got a lot of information here for a book. And as I tried to round out the book and then started sharing it with other people, they were, they gave me the feedback of like, you actually can't leave out your personal journey. You can't leave out the things you've experienced, the things that have happened to you personally, good and bad, that made you the leader that you are. So the book idea morphed, became what it became. And I thought, okay, no, I did it. I sat on it for two years. I did nothing. Yeah, I sat on it for two years. And then after my daughter was born, and I was kind of thinking about who, who do I want to be now? You know, like I've done all these cool things up until now, but what, what kind of mom do I want to be? What kind of woman do I want to be that my daughter looks to? And I think for me, because I do talk about a lot of my growth and my journey along the corporate ladder, it was to be the woman who doesn't sit quiet about some things, but also is still happy and still wants to help other people. And I'm not jaded. So I wanted to put that out there to hopefully leave the world a little bit better for when she's climbing the corporate ladder or not. That's amazing. Yeah. So give us a spoiler. Anyone who, you know, should, should, everyone should read this, you can buy it wherever books are sold. But those lessons learned of really not staying quiet, right? Probably, you know, the saying fears a compass, I'm sure you felt that at a time or two. Tell us a story about, you know, the most impact for the one that's, you know, comes to your brain right now. Oh, well, there's so many, there's so many. I wish there weren't, but I think there's a couple of things and one is being very clear on what your goal is. What is your goal? What do you want to accomplish? And then it makes it very easy to say yes to the things that support that goal. Oh, my gosh, yes. I don't want to publish that because a lot of times we're like, I don't want to say no. But when you're saying yes to the right things, no, but come super easy and no is almost like an afterthought. Like those things aren't even top of mind. Because think about how much energy you've wasted in your life trying to figure out how to tell someone no. Like, I just don't want to let that person down. I don't want to, you know, I don't want to have to tell them no, but I really don't want to do that for worse. The times you did something you really didn't want to do that supported you in no way, shape or form. We've all done it. I mean, I probably have that written across my forehead at this point. How many times that I've probably said yes, whether it's to a project or a favor or something that has led not only myself, but even teams I'm leading kind of not, you know, down a wrong path, but just hey, is it aligned to our north stars that we at the beginning of the year mapped out for us, right? It's either yes or no. I don't mean it's a bad idea. The answer is no, but it's not where we are headed. But even, you know, as you set goals for yourself, was it aligned to where you were going? Within those goals for yourself personally, did you want to be a CEO from the inception of your corporate career of I'm doing what it takes to get to that point? So I knew since I was a kid that I would eventually lead companies. I knew I was going to be a Radio City Rockette. I knew I was going to dance in New York with the Rockettes. I knew that at three. And it was not long after watching my dad run his company that I was like, I'm going to run some companies. I really know what. I didn't know how I was going to do it, but I always dual resume. I was always in the business world and in the dance world until I fully retired from dance. Very cool. And did you have a, you know, wanting to reach both of those goals? Did you set time limits on them? Did you have a full reverse engineer process? What would that look like for you? So for me, especially when I was younger, the main goal was to be a Radio City Rockette. And that took priority because there's also, you know, the realistic point of view that dancers age out. So I knew that that had to come first. And yes, I had a real plan for the dance jobs I was going to get where I was technically going to move up the East Coast statewide and, you know, until I was in New York City, and then I would not leave New York City until I danced with the Rockettes. You know, so I had my plan mapped out. But then the day that, or the week that I moved to New York City, I walked and I stood in front of Radio City Music Hall. And I turned around and pan the area. And that's how I picked my next job. Because I said, unlike all these people I know, and you go into any diner in New York City and meet one of the people I'm about to tell you about. All the people that I knew that said, Oh, I moved to New York City because I wanted to be on Broadway. I moved to New York City because I was going to be an actress, you know, whatever. That wasn't going to happen to me. I was never going to lose sight of why I went there. So I seriously stood in front of the Music Hall. I was like, I can work there. And I walked across the street and applied for my job. Wow. And you got it? And I got it. And then I had to walk by Radio City. And so I knew why I was there. And I was there a year before I got hired with the R-Cats. Yeah. Very cool. And even one, that's awesome. And I appreciate you sharing that with us. For our audience, it's kind of really going back just a tad into the JVZ world, obviously being, you know, the world's largest affiliate marketing marketplace. For people that are listening who do have, you know, their offer, right, their passion, they've put into a product or a service and they may, maybe not even really know about the affiliate world, right, or opening it up into a marketplace like JVZ. Would you advise someone to do that? If so, what type of business, revenue-wise, you know, who's an ideal target that could be like, all right, let me go look that on Google and check it out, see what they have. Yeah. So, okay, there's, you don't have to have any certain amount of revenue to come and use an affiliate network. And a lot of companies will use an affiliate network to jumpstart a new product so that they can utilize other people's paid for marketing, not their own money to go market. That's what affiliates do. They either got their list or their running ads if you allow it elsewhere. So you're not spending your own money to go market your product out there to get a lot of sales in quickly. So say you've got a new product, you want to be able to market that product is 30,000 happy users. You've got to get 30,000 paying customers first. And that's a lot easier to do with an affiliate network where you can say, hey, we're going to launch this product here. We'll let it run. You may leave it evergreen forever on that affiliate network, or you may say, hey, we're going to do seven to 14 days here. And then we'll pull out of here and we're going to have our customer base to get feedback from to learn from to tweak our product and make it perfect for what we now use our own money to market it. I feel like your experience has been so, a lot of people I've met in my life have been, you know, like ready, fire aim, like I'll just figure it out later. But you've really, you know, put your ear to the ground and been like, Hey, how is this going to help said person because I've heard it from them. And that's why I'm going to go do this, whether learning from your own experience or others. And I think that's a massive lesson to take away from this episode of, you know, you, you're almost you're batting 1000. Right. It's kind of like hit after hit because you've done it right away. I'm just not let's not lie to the people listening. I do, but I'm not afraid of failure. I fell all the time. And the reason I'm not fearful of it is because I understand that failure is a part of the process on the way to success. You have to win. You have to fail. You have to not get it right in order to win. And if you just start out and instantly when you've learned nothing. So when you start looking at failure is like, Hey, I just learned one way how not to do it. Now I'm going into the next way. It's truly just like split testing. And we love split tests, right? If we want to go, if we want to find out what performs the best for split testing, I split test. I split test in business all the time. I split test in life, my personal life all the time, because I want to live the greatest life. I can live. So I'm always trying to figure out what works better. Does this work better? Does this work better? And there's nothing wrong with failing. And I just wish we could get rid of this negative stigma about failing. Our children would be happier collectively across our country. People would be happier because they wouldn't look at other people's highlight reels and be jealous. That's so good. That's amazing. I appreciate you sharing that with me. I'm really excited about that. Yeah, I could tell. And even I've ever read The War of Art by Steven Pressfield, but goes into, you know, fighting the resistance, right, which is any type of gravitational pull that you feel within you. That's, you know, any kind of higher power if people want to, you know, obviously, a God fearing man, but for the, you know, anything, right? It's the universe. It's any pull of that's what you should be doing. And when you're on that path, failure is required, right? It's actually part of it. And the more it's embraced, the more you can actually open up your mind and then, okay, what am I learning from this right now? Exactly. I love that. Yeah, I social media is such a part of our lives now. It's never going away. We're not getting rid of it. But I wish that like one day out of the week was mandatory. You can only post your failures. I think it would totally change the health of our teenagers and a lot of adults, adults that are so fearful of failing. If I started, which I might, I'm going to call you first and then we'll get on it and it'll take off from there. I tell you, please do. Yeah, I mean, I have friends that we do our posts and we call them not the ground, because these aren't our posts for the ground, but there are real lives. Yeah. And they matter more than any highlight reel you'd ever see. I couldn't agree more. For our listeners who want to follow you more, who want to dive into anything that you're doing, where should they go? Sure. You can go to my website, lauracastleman.com. All my social media is linked there. I do share my highlights, but I also share the real life and my stories. It's not always pretty, a lot of messy. And I'm always split testing and learning. So come follow me. And if you think I'm doing way too highlighting, just message me and say, we need to see some more real. That's awesome. And again, Laura, thank you so much. An amazing career and I look forward to following your continued success. And thank you for coming on the show. Thank you for having me.
