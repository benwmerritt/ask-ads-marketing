Amazing. Well, we're excited to hear from you and a little bit more about your story. So if you could just get started by telling us a little bit of your background and what led you to starting your own business, we'd love to hear that. Yeah, so definitely my journey has been started in December 2021. Like before that, like I was literally broke in terms of like, you know, not having sufficient funds to even manage my expenses, but something like I have managed it. And like I was not having the job, I was unemployed for like more than a year. And like this have been like biggest breakthrough in my journey. I came as an international student here in Canada in 2020. And somewhere like after completing my studies, I was like, you know, just using my savings for that. And it was somewhere, a kind of roller coaster journey where I was not having any support, the backs of what like, you know, in this international country, right? So something like I was pretty new to each and every stuff. I've completed my studies, not having a job. So it was a totally like, you know, disaster situation. But however, I've decided to give a last chance to my life to, you know, to change it from like, from up to head, right? So somewhere like I have to the loan from my brother and somewhere like, you know, I was keep on hitting the milestones because obviously this was my last go, right? So I've started my journey with it. And there are multiple breakthroughs I have like, you know, got in my journey as well, positive and negative, both the ones in the negative situations. I was a keep on remembering my back situations because they were, that was my burning desire to keep moving ahead in this business. So the burning desire have literally hinted me a lot. My wife was very strong because my parents have sold their house to, you know, send me here in Canada. And somewhere like this was my literally a kind of real why to do it, right? For them. And within less than six months, I have gifted a beautiful house to my parents because that was my first goal because they have sent me here. And it was somewhere like, it was of $100,000 years, but somewhere like I was not expecting that, yes, I will definitely change my entire situations. But click funnels have helped me a lot. My journey has been started with click funnels by promoting click funnel software. And like, you know, I started my affiliate marketing journey with full of big hopes. And there's somewhere click funnels and it's books and it's boot camps, like, you know, values from funnel hacking lives. And like, you know, there are tons of values which are there on the YouTube, right? So I was keep on learning from it. This have been literally like a kind of life-changing moment for me, like I'm sitting here, like, you know, in a spotlight interview with click funnels and sharing my own success story to inspire others. And like, if I believe that I can do it, definitely, the multiple people, those who are like, you know, willing to quit the nine to five, those who are like willing to change their situation, those who are willing to meet the parents proud, parents proud, like, right? So they can also do it if I can do it. So that was some of the kind of my burning desire from inside to, you know, have this kind of journey. And from broke to six figures, and like I'm on my way to multiple six figures and I'm willing to go with two CC award. But however, somewhere this have been a kind of like, you know, my journey has been started from literally more less than a scratch, right? So somewhere like it was a kind of major breakthrough. And today I'm feeling blessed. And thank you so much, Laura, for giving this opportunity. And I want to thank Russell as well. Yes, so this was my short introduction about. Amazing, yeah. So that's so inspiring and you're young and you went to university. So tell me a little bit about what it was like going to university, but already knowing that you had this bigger dream inside of you of running a business. Did you feel almost, did you feel different from your classmates? Because what you were doing at school wasn't necessarily what you wanted to be doing with your business? So somewhere like in my graduation days, like, you know, I was just focusing on my studies instead of like, you know, even thinking about like getting into this online business or maybe like, you know, doing my nine to five. However, I was having some savings which my parents have been like, you know, sent it that he has like, you know, focus on the studies first because it is very important to get passed in every subject and everything, right? So somewhere like I was keep on focusing on that. Like I was not even having an idea like, right? Like what affiliate marketing is all about? How are like, you know, we can make money from online. So somewhere this have been a kind of like, if I'll say I have like, you know, watch my mentor and like he was keep on sharing his journey regarding affiliate marketing. He was very successful. And I was following him from like last two years and like giving that kind of belief by watching him like crushing into this business space have got me that kind of confident that, yes, if he can also do it, I can do, right? So somewhere like, he's also having the similar situation like me. He also sold his house to come to Canada. He also went for the graduation. He was also broke from his like, you know, in his past journey. So somewhere like my story was definitely relating with that guy and that guy have helped me a lot. And in terms of like moving ahead with this affiliate marketing space, I've got to know before like when I've completed my graduation and when I was not having job for 10 months, like more than 10 to 12 months, I have like literally passed out my graduation and I've just stepped into this on that space. So somewhere I didn't even felt like that, you know, I should be struggling in that nine to five part. However, I was doing it one year I did it. But however, one year I was unemployed and somewhere like, you know, this have took me a kind of on the journey where I feel felt like that, yes, I did the right. I have to the right action and I've did something great in my life and I'm still left with doing some bigger milestones. Yeah, amazing. So you talked about your family and you said that your parents, you know, did a lot to make sure that you could come to Canada and fulfill your dreams and that your brother helped by giving you a loan. What was that like, you know, with your family investing in you as well as yourself investing in you and what you wanted. Do you feel like that really held you accountable to following through? So someone like my family were having big dreams for me, which every like mother and father, like things of that kind, right? So like after like they were having a big dream, but they were not having that amount of money to send me to Canada. So my mom decided that, you know, let's take a trip. I believe in yesh and I think like he can definitely, you know, make all of our risk worth it. And somewhere like I was in that point in my journey here in Canada where I faced like that, you know, I'm like, you know, not fulfilling their expectations. So somewhere like, you know, their belief have literally helped me a lot and like they have decided that, yeah, let's give a drive, let's hold our house, right? To send here in Canada and somewhere like, you know, they have paid my all my fees, which was somewhere $30,000. $30,000 they have spent and it was too much for me. And somewhere like, you know, after getting this thing that, yeah, they did all the hard work just for me. I have took my bags and like, you know, I have like just take the blessings from them and I've decided that, yeah, let's go for it. Let's start a new journey. And like not having any friends, not knowing anyone here. It was a kind of very struggling phase, right? Like as an international student. So somewhere like they have believed in me, that's why I'm like, you know, I'm here and I strongly give all my credit to them because without their blessings, I don't think so I could have done anywhere, anything like, you know, in my life, maybe like in my business as well. That's amazing and a beautiful story and what a testament to your parents and the support of your family that you have behind you, it's amazing. Tell me a little bit about, so you mentioned that you have a mentor and I know many people come into the ClickFunnels ecosystem because they model a lot of things that they do after the things that Russell does. How did you become familiar with ClickFunnels and Russell Brunson? So like when I was, when I started my journey, I was watching like, you know, multiple YouTube videos of ClickFunnels, like what kind of software it is all about, how it is working, how it is helping people in like, you know, getting email lists, how it is helping people in like, you know, making money as well, like by promoting that software. So some, something like I was keep on getting the values from YouTube and YouTube, I have helped me a lot in terms of gathering all the data which everybody like needs to go for. So somewhere I've started making content, I've started like, you know, doing group marketing, I've started making connection with people. I've gone with like, okay, what kind of product I'm selling and I know that yeah, this product I'm very proud for. I can definitely start with this product. So like this, my affiliate marketing has, journey has been started with this book, which is somewhere it have changed my life a lot, which is Expert Seat Rates. And like this book have literally like given me all that kind of values in terms of like, you know, how I can plan my, how I can plan the kind of structure to achieve my goal. So somewhere my first commission, I've literally got in just 17 days of starting and I have promoted, I've started promoting the ClickFunnels and like, you know, somebody have bought from me and I've got the commission of $17, $17 or $18 by promoting that $97 product, right? Which is every month of ClickFunnels subscription. So somewhere like this have given me a very big hope and obviously Expert Seat Rates were like, you know, I've started documenting my first content with Expert Seat Rates. And literally on my Facebook wall as well, like, you know, this first content, I'm keep on like doing it, I'm keep on sharing it as a memory. It's been two years and like somewhere like, you know, literally ClickFunnels have impacted my journey a lot. And after that, like, you know, I was keep on attending the boot camps. I was keep on attending the kind of like, you know, the webinars like, you know, which Russell was keep on doing. I was keep on joining the groups of ClickFunnels and like, you know, joining the lives, getting values from Daud, getting values from multiple entrepreneurs. So somewhere like, you know, my journey has been started like this and I got to know ClickFunnels that, yeah, this is changing life and I strongly believe that yes, it do because it have changed mine. Yeah. Wow. So you, you read that book and you just jumped right in and started doing it. That's amazing. Definitely. So tell me a little bit about how you started your business in affiliate marketing. And if you're using Funnels, what types of Funnels have been the most effective for you in actually growing your business? So like my journey with ClickFunnels has been started on the very first day. Like, you know, I've jumped up like by taking the subscription, I was keep on learning it, how to make Funnels, how to make the email list, right? How to make the order form, how to like, you know, somewhere like the kind of Funnels where like, yeah, I can definitely fill the pipeline with tons of emails. So somewhere this, I was keep on learning it with various boot camps. Like, you know, with attending tons of life, with attending like, you know, multiple YouTube videos with, so somewhere like this have helped me a lot. And in my ClickFunnels journey, what I've been strongly recommend people to go for, always try to learn first, always try to adopt the skills first. It is not about that, yeah, when you have to the subscription of, like when you took any kind of product or maybe like, you know, you're promoting any kind of service, you will definitely become successful. No, it's not like that. Firstly, I have keep on focusing on that, yeah, I should be learning first, each and everything, how to make it, how to build it. So I can become pro in it. And somewhere like, you know, my journey has been started with collecting testimonials and I was keep on helping people in free, right? So somewhere like, you know, I was keep on helping people in building their Funnels for free. And somewhere like, you know, they will keep on getting me the digital currencies which I was looking. So this digital currencies like, you know, have helped me a lot in terms of making my opt-in page, my sales page very beautiful, right? In terms of like, yeah, I was having the people's trust, right? So somewhere these have helped me a lot and I was somewhere like, you know, my journey has been very been supported by the ClickFunnels in terms of like, you know, getting the email list. And my favorite funnel is somewhere like a kind of order form. You must be sounding crazy that, yeah, what kind of order form I'm talking about. So somewhere like, you know, a opt-in page sales page and order form. This is something like, you know, kind of two-step funnel I like a lot. And like, you know, somewhere I see like that, yeah, this journey has took me on a very great way. And I'm sure that there are multiple great ways to go. Yeah. Well, I see that, you know, giving away so much value and being generous with your offer and willing to help people and teach them things and giving them that value upfront without charging them is such a great way of building trust with potential clients because then not only are they gonna refer other clients to you or give you a testimonial, but they're gonna know that, you know, if you did a great job for them, they wanna come back and that word of mouth keeps spreading. And it just goes to show a lot about your character when you're willing to give a lot of that value away. Something like my journey has been started a lot like by charging high tickets with this testimonial salty. Like I was not having that kind of belief because I didn't invested in myself. Like, you know, I've started with reading expert secrets. Then after that, I have to put the loans from my brother and I've decided to, you know, invest in myself so I can get that belief of charging high tickets, right? So somewhere like, you know, this has helped me a lot, but before that, I want definitely building authority is the most important part. However, like, you know, this has started by helping other people by like, you know, making the community and I've started my own group. I have started adding people. I've like, you know, started going live in my initial times. I have to keep on spreading the values. I have to keep on over delivering the community, right? So somewhere that community has, like, you know, got the kind of faith that, yes, this guy can definitely change our situation because he's definitely willing to. And when I have dated, they were witnessing my journey and they have looked at, yeah, what kind of support I'm like providing to them. What kind of help I'm doing them, right? So somewhere like my journey has been started without pitching the offers because when I used to give them the service, they got the belief that, yes, what if I pay this guy, right? What if I pay this person, how much support this person can, like, you know, give it to us, what kind of time this person can give it to us? So somewhere my journey has been started like that by charging, by charging nothing. And like, you know, people were asking me directly like, hey, yes, do you have any offers for us because we wanted to pay you so we can get your 24-7, right? So somewhere this have literally like helped me a lot in terms of helping people and over-delivering my values to the ground. Yeah. What has been your single most favorite part of using ClickFunnels in your business? So my favorite part of using ClickFunnels is definitely the one which people like. Like, you know, somewhere building funnels is the most important thing. And now in your business, if you're like, you know, willing to collect emails, if you're like, you know, making your business more supportive at the back end, if you are like, you know, trying to make the connections with people, however, like, you know, Russell is definitely doing funnel hacking lives every year as well, right? So somewhere they are like, you know, keep on throwing out the bootcamps and multiple things, right? So somewhere like, you know, if you are trying to adopting the values, definitely ClickFunnels is the most recommended platform which I can definitely recommend. However, if somebody asked me, he is like, you know, I want to start with the mixtecate product. I want to start with, like, you know, making out 100, my first hundred dollars, then I will going to keep on thinking about the 10,000, then 100,000, then 1 million. So somewhere my first point, like, you know, my first look is, hey, bro, like you don't need to ask for the recommendation. Go with the ClickFunnels. It's the best one, right? However, like, you know, if you are willing to make your first penny from online, I will strongly recommend this platform. And however, my journey has been started with 17 dollars and now I'm definitely like, you know, making more than that. But however, like, you know, this have definitely helped me a lot. And I will strongly recommend this platform to each and every person. That's incredible. What type of advice would you give to somebody who is maybe they're in university now or they're young and they have an entrepreneurial spirit and they're thinking about starting a business or maybe they don't have a business. They want to be an affiliate. What kind of advice would you offer to them? So my advice would be like, you know, what I have gone through with my journey, my experience, this one line, this one line have hit me impacted, it have impacted me a lot. The line is somewhere like, your one action can change your entire generations, right? My mother, like, you know, she has sold her gold as well, right? That you have to send me to Canada to make my child's life, right? Warming and definitely it should be beautiful. So somewhere like, you know, now she don't need to look like, you know, whether they should be getting the diamond, they should be getting the car, they should be getting any kind of luxuries, right? Somewhere like, you know, they have definitely gone through with each and everything. And I'm sure that most of the students, most of the university graduates and those who are graduating and those who are willing to enter into this affiliate marketing space, I'm sure like their parents have also like, you know, did tons of sacrifice, right? So somewhere like, you know, my strong recommendation is take first action, take your first step ahead into this entrepreneurial space, whether you are willing to go with the e-commerce, drop shipping, Amazon FBA affiliate marketing, doesn't matter, whatever you like, you go in it, but at least start taking first action because your first action can definitely change your entire generations, right? Because now I'm on that path where I don't need to look my back, I remember my sacrifices, but however, like, you know, I don't need to think twice of buying any stuff, maybe even a car or maybe like anything else, right? Even like, I'm like, you know, on my way to buy my first house here in Canada as well. So somewhere like, you know, my first step have definitely changed my entire life and that's what I can recommend to other people as well, that take the first initiative, rest everything you will get with your hard work. That's very powerful advice, very helpful. So what would you say to your parents now? I'll say that, you know, your time is definitely, your time was wonderful with full of hard works and now it's time to, you know, relax, relaxation and just go with the vacations part and like, you know, try to be happy because whatever you guys have did, that have like, you know, changed my life and definitely until and unless I'm there, definitely they don't need to think about anything because obviously what they have did, it's a kind of somewhere like, you know, most of the parents don't do, right? Because risking their life and like, you know, I know like, you know, those who love unconditionally, they do it and I'm feeling blessed for that, yes, they love me unconditionally and they were willing to change my life and they have changed it and now it's my time and I will definitely gonna change there. It's a really beautiful story, Ash. Thank you so much for sharing it with us. Thank you so much, Laura, for like, you know, giving me this opportunity to share my story. I'm literally super, like, you know, feeling blessed for it and I'm looking forward to, you know, getting tons of inspiration from others as well, like the way I'm taking it from click-funnels, like the way I'm taking it from multiple interviews and before that I have watched multiple spotlight interviews with Jonathan, with more entrepreneurs, right? So somewhere like, you know, these have given me that hope that yes, if their story is so much powerful, like, you know, your story can be too. So somewhere I also feel like that, yes, my story is somewhere that can impact others' people's life because everybody comes from hard times because everybody face that kind of situations in their life where, like, you know, it comes unexpectedly and that's what, like, I feel like, you know, with my story everybody will be able to relate with me. Those who are having the similar conditions, similar situations and I think they will be getting the push to, you know, change their entire life and entire generation. Absolutely and I'm so glad that you found all of those helpful and the other spotlights and modeling after other people who are doing what you wanna be doing.
