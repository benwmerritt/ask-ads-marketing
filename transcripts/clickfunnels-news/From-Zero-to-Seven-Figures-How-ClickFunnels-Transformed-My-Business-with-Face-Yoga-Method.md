Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm speaking with Maria and Fumiko. These women are the co-founders of Face Yoga Method, a proven combination of breath, mindset and face yoga poses to revolutionize the way women treat the aging process. They're also sisters-in-law. So cool. Recognized as best in the industry, Fumiko has certified over 780 students in her method and successfully built her female-led brand around the world. Additionally, she has published six books, two ebooks, a skincare line, a blog and multiple online face yoga programs to help people embrace their natural beauty and aging. Welcome ladies, thanks so much for joining me today. Thanks for having us. So we're excited to learn more about your business and what you two do together and how you came into business. So can you tell me a little bit about your background and how you ended up starting business together? Sure. Yeah. Do you want me to go? Yeah. So Fumiko and I were sisters-in-law. So we met almost 20 years ago and when we first met, I'm very entrepreneurial. So I heard what she was doing in Japan and I was like, we got to bring this to the United States, to the world online. And at the time, she wasn't quite ready because she wanted to start a family. And so we circled back a couple of years later and I at that point had just started, this was in like 2010, 11. And so I had been consulting in online marketing for a couple of years. And so I had a completely different perspective of how we could do the business because I saw what was possible with online learning. So at that point, she was ready and we started. We literally started with an e-book and a zero email list, zero YouTube channel, everything. Fumiko, you want to say from your perspective? Sure. Yeah. So I started my Fesoka journey almost 19 years ago. I was in the mid-30s and I was living in Japan and teaching at one of the oldest women's universities. I just love teaching women, even from then. And then I got in a car accident and that made my body and the face out of alignment. And I started seeing tremendous asymmetry in my face and the body and I hated it. But also mid-30s, I started seeing a sign of premature aging and I had to do something. So first thing, of course, I went to get the creams and I get facials. I never done any procedures, but that's how I started. And then one day I realized that, face is a muscle just like a body. So why not tell my face so that I can really exercise my face muscles and fit my face? Because I've been doing body exercise for a long time. I started actually practicing yoga when I was 10 years old. So I know how exercise responds to my feeling of like feeling good and looking better. So that's how I started. And all of a sudden, really caught the attention from social media. I'm not social media, but then a media attention in Japan. Because nobody was doing, there's no word like a face yoga. It didn't exist. And I started getting lots of media in requests. I did lots of TV shows and I wrote magazine articles and books and life was really good. But it just got to the point that it was just too busy. I had no personal life because everything was just work, work, work. So I left my job at the peak of my career and the people thought I was crazy because I was living all the fancy stuff going in Japan and I came and married to Maria's brother. And when Maria started telling me about the possibility of expanding in U.S., I said no at first because I just didn't want to recreate the busy lifestyle like I was doing in Japan. But when she talked about online, I thought like, oh, that is so nice and cool because I can work from anywhere in the world. So that was something like I thought we can do it. But like Maria said, there was no thing, nobody, there's no word face yoga existed online. And we started from zero. And we even created our website together, sitting next to each other, pick up the color, pick up the font. And yeah, I was over 10 years ago. So cool. I love the business idea. And I feel like it's still probably something so new to other women like me who aren't familiar with face yoga. I've been doing yoga for a while. I've always loved it, but learning about it and seeing your website and kind of going in depth with some of the things you can do to start and how it really can make a difference. I found it so cool. So I have all kinds of questions about the business. But let's start with going into online funnels. Like what led you to creating an online funnel to grow your business? Well, we were a couple years into the business and I heard and we were just making stuff up as we went. I mean, I had heard, you know, I would follow people online thought leaders, so to speak, and online marketing. And then we got to the point where I was like, okay, I need to be more involved. I need more in person help. And I heard this, gosh, I can't remember how many years ago this was, but it was, I think it was maybe the second click funnel hacking live. It was a Dallas, I think, and I think that was the second one. I'm not sure. And so I heard about it and it's so funny to think of it. It was so small then compared to how it is now. So I told Fumiko, come with me to this event and Fumiko, you came to the first one. Yeah, yeah, we did. So we went to the event and that seriously shifted everything for me. And we got the techniques and the strategies, but what shifted most for me personally was when they had people speak on stage, there was one person in particular that had talked about taking their business from here to here to like multi six figures to multi seven figures like within a year. And I, I like hadn't, I didn't, you know, I didn't even know that was possible. It seems so weird to think about that now because it's happened. But I didn't know it was possible. And just to see somebody else that you're just like, oh, that person's just like me, you know, and they did this, that like shifted something in my head that we can do this. And so within a year, we were back at ClickFunnels and we had turned it into a multi seven figure business because of that. And so we used funnels obviously during that year, you know, we use the software and created, you know, kept, we had someone, an IT person that tests out all these different funnels for us, different ways of selling. Wow. I see. Yeah. And that was like opening what is possible and seeing person, you know, of course I read so many books and hard like, yeah, this is possible, but seeing the person on stage and talking about that. And then I think next year, the person like made it bigger, like, wow, what is that? It's possible. And then energy, you know, ClickFunnels live, I love the energy too. And we even took our team members before pandemic, you know, to the ClickFunnels and everybody got just so motivated to make it happen. And that's something I really enjoyed. Yeah. I feel like I've talked to a few people that have had very similar stories where they had already started a business or they had great business ideas, but being around other leaders in the industry and really shifting their mindset to having that belief in themselves is what changed everything for them within that year. So it's really cool that that kind of energy and the belief system and the beliefs that you had in yourself and your business really started to change things for you. So you, I know that we talked about how you have books and ebooks and you had the ebook for the business. So was your first funnel for lead generation or did you have something that you used as a lead magnet to sell a high ticket offer? How did you go about creating different funnels to see success in your business? Well, when we first started, it was just to build a list. It wasn't even a funnel. It was just to build a list. And then it was to sell an ebook. And then we found out about funnels. And so that's when I then, you know, we got somebody to help us make them. And she was so into it. She was just like, Oh my gosh, I can create this so quickly. I can create this one and this one and this one. So she, and at that point we had started creating different programs. We created a membership site. And so we let her kind of hot, you know, we focused on creating content and running the business. And we let her like kind of go to town with creating these different funnels. And so she got really, really good at it. And she tried various different funnels and would just she was very much like a numbers person. And she would just look at the numbers saying, Okay, this funnel is working here. I'm running this much traffic to it. Here's the conversion rates or here's the traffic. And we just went from there. And, you know, and then we would learn, you know, we I think our most popular funnel at the time was the aging habits funnel, when quizzes were so big, which they still can be, but this one like ran so well for us for multiple years, where people would take a quiz to find out what habit they were doing to age themselves and then get a custom result at the end of the quiz that this is the product that you should be using. That was a superstar for us. Yeah, I can imagine a quiz being really successful a successful in this industry where people are wanting to learn more about their own health and wellness and how this applies to their skin and the things that they can do because I was interested just kind of going down a rabbit hole of like, wow, these are things that I can do without skincare and exercises I can do to actually reverse the aging. And I think that that's just like a huge there's so much there for other women like me in their mid 30s that are interested in finding other techniques or other ways to reverse the aging process in, you know, a very holistic way. I think that's really cool. Right. And also you're gonna exercise. Sorry. Oh, no, no, go ahead. Yeah, it wasn't exercise. It was like, you know, aging habit, like unconscious aging habit. Like, if you're talking on a phone always tilting your head, that create asymmetry face, right? Oh, yeah, you have to really be aware and then combine with exercise and then at the end of the quiz, we kind of provide it like here, these are the exercises you can do. But you have to be aware of the habits because you even you do all the exercises. If you don't break these bad habits, you can't really get the great result you're looking for. So I think many people are like shocked to find out what they are doing without even thinking about what even creating the wrinkles in the forehead and tilting your head sleeping on a side and the little things. And yeah, that's very eyeopening. I feel like I'm already trying to bring some awareness to my sense of the things. Love that. So tell me a little bit about your background from ECO and how being in Japan and teaching other women led you to your passion for doing this in your business today. Okay, yeah. So when I was teaching, well, I started teaching at the high school girls high school. And then I just wanted to really help them to think bigger than the box because Japanese society, which is, you know, I love Japan, go bon a race in Japan, but everything was just such a structure, beautiful structure. But I noticed that there's such a limitation as a woman. I was told, you know, I should just get married and have a child and then don't go to I'll let she's okay, but not go graduate school. But I really wanted to find, you know, what I really want to do. So after I graduated university, I went to graduate school in Canada, United States, and I wanted to do something with my experience and help women to really see things differently. So high school would still limit it in terms of what I could teach because I still have to teach them curriculum. And then I decided to teach at the university, which I love it so much. I saw such a shift my students mindset, but then still like something was missing because they're still young. And then they haven't really had the experience in terms of, you know, life experience. And then I was thinking about it, what can I do? What can I do? And then I got in a car accident. So I just shift my career from teaching at university to teaching face to kind of people thought I was crazy, because I had a really good job. And even good friend of mine, one of my friends asked me if I lost my pride, like, you're teaching that and leaving that great job. I said, yeah, because I can't really do it. But the biggest thing is, you know, having Maria with me in a business, that really helped me because I'm creating all the contents. I have a big picture what I can help women, but I need actual input, actual brain in order to make it running as a business. Because you can't just teach people for free. And you can't just do all the TV shows, but you need something. And then the background, me, I have a cultural anthropology. So I was always, always aware the cultural differences and different belief system and also different language use, make your muscle move differently. So when I speak English, you know, I don't speak English perfectly because my muscles are not trained to speak English. But when I look at these differences, and when I, when we started this business online, we attracted so many international women, maybe because we are international company, but also maybe because my background, I'm not a native English speaker. So it's such a, I would say there's no waste in life. Everything I've done, we've done really created this business. And that's what I, that's what I say. And I love it. That's beautiful and inspiring. I love that you've worked with so many women throughout your career. So tell me a little bit about what it's like working together, because it seems like you, Fumiko, are kind of like the character of the business. You, Maria, are the, you know, the business savvy doing everything to make the business successful. And together you probably have just this perfect synergy. What is it like working together? It's great. I mean, I, it's funny because I feel sometimes like we're the anomaly, but you know how you hear all these mornings like, don't go into business with family or with your friends. Cause, and I've heard, you know, the stories, but it's been over 10 years now. And I don't think we've ever had, I don't know, any big discourse over the business because Fumiko is so powerful in what she does and her discipline and face yoga and we trust each other implicitly. So she stays creating, it lets her stay in her creative space. She doesn't even think about, she's learned so much. It's amazing. Cause when we first started, she was like, I don't understand how I'm supposed to teach this online. Like that's not going to work. And I was like, no, just trust me. And now she knows, I mean, she's like an online marketer, like nobody's business. It's, it's so funny. The question she asked just from being in it 10 years, but we've got a whole staff now about, I think we've got 10 to 12 working for us all around the world. So I managed the whole business side and work with them on making those decisions and the marketing and all that kind of stuff, the accounting, and Fumiko doesn't have to worry about any of that, which is really nice. Cause, you know, as an entrepreneur, you know, we wear so many different hats. It's hard. And I, I look at like other people that I know that are going into business and I see them as the star of their business, but then they also have to do all the other technical stuff, the marketing, you know, the accounting, managing the staff, HR. And I just think, wow, like that's a lot. It is a lot. So our synergy together, we're really, really fortunate and that it's so complimentary between the two in our skill sets. I second too, but also I think we have a similar vision, you know, we really believe the mindset and the new science. And I'm very nerd. Like I can really go into like deep that too. So we have a different, you know, skill set, but also same vision. I think that helps us a lot. Yeah. Well, I can imagine the impact that has being able to take some of those things off of her plate and vice versa. And the same thing at ClickFunnels, you know, we all work together as a team to make sure that we're handling so much so that Russell can stay in his native genius. And he's staying in his wheelhouse as, you know, an attractive character. And people have so much to learn from him and his presence and being on stage and coaching and teaching things that it's like everything else needs to be handled by the rest of the team because everyone has their strengths. And it's really cool to see all of that come together. For sure. So I would love to know from both of you, like what are your, what's your biggest piece of advice for somebody who's maybe just getting started out as an entrepreneur or maybe they're in the health and wellness industry and they're like, I want to start a business, but I want it to be online. What should I do? I would say get started as quickly as possible because your mind will always stop, you know, the perfectionist mind comes in or the bright, shiny object state focused on one thing and get started as quickly as possible and monetize it right away. That is a mistake. Got native other things monetize right away. Don't worry, you know, if nobody buys it, that's okay. At least you've started like that and it will grow. Love it. For me is just be yourself, you know, don't try to be somebody else. That's our hardest lesson I have to tell myself because I was scared. Like Maria said that at first, like, I don't want to put myself, I've been teaching for so long. So I don't have any confidence. I mean, I have no problem teaching in front of people. I've done big events, but teaching in English and putting myself online, like I was really scared, but I just have to push myself out of my comfort zone so that, you know, I can just be myself, be goofy or whatever I want to just be so that I attract the people who get attracted to my energy field instead of trying to convince other people. Yeah. And that is our hardest lesson. I can imagine that's such a testament to the bravery that you've had in this business and how you've overcome that and worked together and grown a business that's successful and it's really inspiring to see and I really appreciate you both sharing your stories with us today. So can you tell us last thing where people can learn more about you and your business online? Yeah, faceyogamepid.com or we're on faceyogamepid at Instagram and Facebook and TikTok. Well, Instagram has the bulk of everything. Yeah, for base. I personally look forward to checking it out and learning a little bit more and maybe I'll be in touch because I'm so fascinated by all the things that you're teaching and what you've done with your business. So again, thank you so much for joining me today and letting all of our viewers learn more about your business. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Have a good one.
