## Transcript
Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are back into Funnel Hacking Live mode, so we have a special guest joining us today. Definitely make sure you are here. Say that you're here in the comments. We're going to roll the intro and tell you who is our special guest joining us today. You're not going to want to miss this one. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey guys, my name is Ben Moot. This is... Susan Lennardsen. And we are here with Funnel Hacker TV. We're so excited to have you guys. This time we're talking all about Funnel Hacking Live. I've had people say Funnel Hacker Live all the time. I'm like, no, it's Funnel Hacking Live. And so it's just on the tip of my tongue. But Funnel Hacking Live is just around the corner. And for those of you who are just catching on, from the years past, Russell has always been interviewing all the individual speakers, announcing them. And this year he went a little different. He announced everybody and did the massive announcement. You guys missed it. What we're doing is we are doing these interviews with each individual speaker to be able to let you hear from them, hear their story, understand what it is they're going to be talking about at Funnel Hacking Live. And we are so excited today to have our next speaker. Susan's already heard her. I did not make it to Mastermind and Paradise. So Susan, you're in the know. Oh my gosh. And it was awesome. And I can't wait for you guys to meet her if you don't know her yet and to come and see her at Funnel Hacking Live this year. It's going to be awesome. Oh, it's going to be so good. Now, I don't want to spilling the beans. So go ahead and guess really quick who you think it is down below. But this person is able to get traffic to her Funnels without having to pay for ads. This is how to get paid for the attention that drives traffic to your funnel. This is a whole different way of thinking everything. And today we get to introduce to you Kathy Yoder. Let's go ahead and bring her on. Hey Kathy. Hello. Hello. Hello. We're so excited to have you because as we were just talking beforehand and this is like your foray into Russell's world and ClickFunnels came far before like our traditional like understanding before the books even became an idea. And so if you can tell us like how did you get involved in just the world before? I don't know if ClickFunnels wasn't even a group back in the day. This was a while ago. No. It was back in the dot com secrets day. I think it was back in 2010 and I met somebody that is actually now my business partner. But he had a connection with Russell. Actually anyway that's a different story. But he knew at the back in the day I was had a coupon blog which I actually still do have this blog that was forgo.com. And we were had like a DVD that we were selling like that I was legit burning on my DVD player. It was a how to coupon DVD. Anyway my friend B.J. Wright introduced well he knew Russell and Russell was having an event which was like I don't know five six people and needed more people to fill the room. So me and my other business partner at the time went to his dot com secrets. I think it was two days. Anyway that's where we learned like about who knocking where I could have somebody else burn my DVDs. It was the most thrilling thing in the world. But then we actually even had one on one time we sat in a Russell's office with Russell and Brent and they were looking at our website and looking how we were promoting our DVD and just gave us all of these tips and was I just I just put like two and two together was that the black box funnel. That was what Russell called the black. I think he turned it black box later. Don't even see when a funnel. I don't know. Funnel was invented. It was just old. It was it was yeah 2010 I think. Dang my goodness. So we changed our DVD though we did change our DVD to be the seven secrets of cubanning something like that. So somehow I don't know how but that secrets thing was already a thing and they changed the name of your product. So we did anyway. It's kind of funny. That is awesome. OK and what do people know you for today. So today. So I still have that is the four gold dot com. But three years ago I started why I've had this YouTube channel forever but I just started doing food recipes on YouTube. And then after a few months it was just my air fryer recipes are the things that YouTube started suggesting and started getting search traffic. So now my audience calls me the air fryer queen on YouTube. And I have to tell you I actually don't even like to cook and I have a food channel. So I just don't. But that's why the air fryer is so great because I can just do it so quickly and move on with my day. So yeah. It's exactly I mean how much of the audience that you're listening to doesn't like to cook either like the whole point of the air fryer is the shortcut. Right. And that that creates that. So like you and it's funny like you were talking about so at Mastermind and Paradise you were talking about the different ways that you were testing in order to find out how to make your YouTube channel like explode. So tell us really quick like when did you start publishing on YouTube and when did it actually start to take off for you. So I started in June 2020 was my first few uploads and all summer I was doing two two videos a week and then school started. And if anybody remembers school in fall 2020 like everybody was at home and I had five kids in school at that time. So I was like that was kicked my trash. And so I went down to one video week. And then it was by November is October November is when I went all into just air fryer. And then by December I remember I started December. I think I had right around 3000 subs. And by the end of December I had 10,000 subs. And like the week of Christmas it just was blowing up and I was getting so many comments and and then fast forward to I think it was February or March. You can't remember I hit 100,000 subs. So that was 2021. Yeah. That is a launch that just goes crazy. Once you dialed it into air fryer suddenly everything just kind of took off. I did a few little things that I tweaked and then just explosion. So really quick guys, Kathy speaking of funnel hiking live. And so we're not going to ask her all the little specifics of everything that she tweaked on our YouTube channel to get it just right and how she launched their funnel and her systems with it. We're not going to go into all that detail here. If you want to learn about it, drop your comments. Let Kathy know what it is that you're most important or that it's most important to you that you want to hear. So that was she has a funnel hiking live, but get your ticket to funnel hiking live, Kathy, I believe you're speaking. We're talking about the attractive character. I think you're speaking about this topic exactly. Right. That's the process. I'm sharing all I'm sharing legit like screenshots of my videos, like my analytics. I think the biggest thing that's been for me, especially over the last two years, maybe I'm side, side tracking here, but is just seeing what's possible and opening up my mind. And I've, as I've been in inner circle and just talking to those people and just like freely sharing what's possible. So for me, it's like, I, I hold nothing back. I'm like, here's my stats. Here's like how much money I made on this video. Here's how many views. Here's what I did because I hate, I don't know. I'm just a share. I just like overshare probably. So, um, but I just want people to know what's possible. It's, you know, it's interesting, like in your mastermind and paradise presentation and even just now you alluded to it, like a lot of times for entrepreneurs, it's a slow and steady progression of trying to figure things out. Um, and you're trying at this and that and tweaking and adjusting. And then when you catch momentum, like you were catching, you begin to feel the wave before the wave is there. And everyone tries to talk you out of it. They're like, no, no, no, we need to focus on this. You need to, you need to restructure our funnel and our business and create the whole value ladder when you do this, when you do that. And you're like, I need to stick with this. Um, cause you feel that momentum. Uh, and that's, I think there's, there's something really powerful there. Like not giving up on what you feel is right, but like trusting in that, even though all the voices and all the shiny objects are out there that are going to tell you all the ways you could go. Great. Oh yeah. So then, um, so you're going to be speaking on this at Funnel Hiking Live. What, if there was a message out there that you could give, that would be most like helpful for the people who are coming to Funnel Hiking Live. Like you, uh, when was the first time you came to Funnel Hiking Live? So it's so funny because, um, my business partner forever has wanted me to come to FHL. He's gone several times and I've just always been like, I don't have an audience to sell anything to, but here I was now. I had a very defined audience that was begging for product from me. And so my first FHL was, um, September 2021. And my business partner was going to go, his, his family was all going to go. So I was like, okay, I know somebody got me. Then they all get COVID. And so I'm going to FHL all by myself, which was nerve wracking, you know, anyway, it was crazy walking in the room and that, that energy, like it's, you can't describe, I'm trying to get family members to come. Well, cause number one, I'm speaking, but number two, I'm like, there is a fire there that you have not felt anywhere else. And so I started back, you know, I'm more of an introverted person, honestly. So I'm in the back-ish rows and not, you know, I would talk to people right around me and like I'm sitting in my hotel room at lunch, I'm, you know, doing door dash, going back to my hotel room by myself, going back. So finally by the last night of FHL, I started, I met someone who introduced me to a lot of other people. And like, these are still my friends today, which is super cool. Um, but it was just, so date one, back row. Last day, third row, crying, jumping up and down, hugging strangers. I mean, it was transformative for me, just, just personally going from here to there and like, I won't miss another FHL ever again. It's, it's almost like, I don't know how to describe it. For me, it always feels like coming home to family. Yes. Like the last funnel hiking live, I walked in and it was the day before I always want to get there a day before everyone else starts to swarm because I want to watch them coming through. Um, because it's just so much fun to be able to see everybody. Sorry about that. And make sure that that does not bother. And, and like, I walked into the hotel and I saw all the faces that I knew sitting around tables, all talking to each other, all the extroverts, right? Um, but then you, they're, they're rounding in the introverts and like, everyone's just, it's a family gathering and the energy just starts to build just because they're there. The doors haven't opened. The beat is not hammering. It's not the DJ experience yet. It's coming, but that family experience is already there. And if you've gotten a hint of that from being in the community, from listening to Russell, from listening to FHL, wherever you guys are, whatever you're doing, it is only exponentially increased a funnel hiking life. And it is a coming home celebration and it's a coming home to who you were called to be. Um, and that's, that's really cool because you get to believe in that self and that version of yourself. So really quick, how many steps of your value letter do you have? Uh, because like, like everybody wants to build perfect. Right. Oh my, do you have to? No. No, I, I do have a free opt-in that I finally put into a funnel that has a little upsell now, but for the longest time, I just had a free opt-in to build my email list and then I just have my cookbook and then we have one other physical product we've launched. Um, I still don't have my, um, like my course or my membership. Like I feel like, oh, I'm sorry. But I just don't have it. Okay. Because it's still, the book's still doing awesome. And we just put in our next order of 10,000. So we're close to 20,000 books sold and I haven't done a single ad. It's just all been you to lead generation. I'm just, yeah, go ahead. Sorry. Sorry. I'm back. I had technical problems, but I'm back. Um, but I was just gonna say, I think that's amazing though for you to be in that place and for you to share that experience with everyone, because a lot of the times we see these other businesses that do have all of these things in places and do have all the funnels and we're like, that's so much. It's so overwhelming when you're starting at zero. And to know that like someone like you is that is out there, um, and you have one funnel and you've just focused on growing your community and your traffic. And you have one funnel that you're selling one thing. As far as I know, you're selling your book and that you've just grown and it's still doing well. And I think that's like so much more achievable when you're someone starting at zero and you're like, okay, I can do that. Like I can do that, but I don't know what happens after that. So, um, and you know, Russell even says like, focus on one funnel until you grow it to be a million, right? And so that is what you, you are doing. Russell says by only having one funnel right now. Right. I think that's amazing. Yeah, it's been fun. It's been a lot of fun. And like, you know, we self-published, we've had a publisher that reached out to us and they were going to, they were like, when they heard about what we were doing, they were like, Oh, just keep doing what you're doing. You'll make more money doing what you're doing. Do not publish us. So we're like, yeah, I think so. It's pretty awesome. So then I don't want to make, where do you go from here? Like what are the next steps that are, that are in your business? Like, I just, I'm just interested to know because, like, you have so much upside potential and so many different things that you're able to do. I know it's tricky, you know, because in this environment, there's so many people with high ticket offers. You know, my cookbook is high ticket for a cookbook because it was shipping. It's like 32 bucks, you know, but it's so low scale. But anyway, we're working on a course and then just trying to. Figure out the membership, but you know, they're again, if someone's spending $100 on an air fryer, they're not going to spend $200 a month. You know, I remember, so it's just different. It's just, it's a different business model. But regardless, I'm having so much fun and I love connecting with my audience on that, you know, a membership really allows for much deeper connection. Um, and I love my people. My people are so cool. So one final question. Um, it seems like community is everything. Um, it seems like it doesn't really matter what your offer is. It doesn't matter all these different things. Unless you have a community, unless you're able to put your face out there, unless you're able to get your message out to people who you connect with, it doesn't matter what's on the other side. Um, your job is to be able to create that connection. Um, what is one tip that you would give everybody other than going to funnel hacking live, um, to learn all the rest, but what is the one tip that you would give people as far as beginning to understand who they're, who their people are understanding them better? I think for me, like specifically on YouTube, I just respond. I know as much now, but I wrote in the beginning and actually even really up until a year ago, I responded to every single comment. Like there, there's so much gold and comments and getting to know people. And then they feel validated and they're like, I didn't think, I like, I actually just got one the other day. I didn't think you would respond. And I'm like, yes, you know, we, I just, people are important and people deserve to be heard. And on the flip side, I'm, I'm just a mom of eight kids. You know, I mess up all the time and I'm just like, I'm going to be me. I'm going to be real me and authentic on the camera. And if I'm messing up food or, you know, I'm, I just, I'm a self-proclaimed lazy cook. So I just feel like there's so much connection that can happen when we're just vulnerable and we like validate people and listen to them. It's not that hard. Yeah. It's not that hard. I love that. Um, oh my gosh. Okay. Kathy, you've like, there's watching your mastermind in paradise. I have my notebook right here. And I was flipping through and reviewing my notes from when you were there. And there's so many things that you said in that short timeframe on that stage, that I was like, oh my gosh, this is awesome. Like I need to do all these things. And I cannot wait for you to be on the funnel hacking live stage to share it to the bigger audience there. Cause you are, you've, you've done amazing things and you are sharing amazing tips that people need to hear for, for creating a community and growing YouTube channel based on the, on your niche.

So make sure you are subscribed to the notifications. You'll know exactly when we're going live and you guys can come join us. We'll see you guys next time. Bye. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating, it's pulsing. I made for something more. We get scared. And then fear hits us. A little voice is in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that's made me all of my money. My best selling framework. Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82 percent of customers trust in blue and search. Better blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this one precious life? You wouldn't be able to tell, but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. Wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People build a sense of belonging here. It feels like home. I'm still encouraging because if they can do it, so can I. They thought, I'm saying, hey, next year we're going to get that. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer ever. You find exactly what your business is missing. It's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. And one day they're telling people how they met you. Oh, I can live change my entire life. Because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be black. Your legacy's going to be black. Movements are about to be burned. My story hopefully gave women permission. I don't believe it. Stand your feet. You do not have to be great to get started. But you have got to start if you ever want to be great.
