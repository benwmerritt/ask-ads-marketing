Patricia nice to see you, Laura nice to see you. Let's go ahead and get started. Should we introduce who's coming on today officially? Oh my gosh, this is awesome. Like this is, I mean, if we can't have Russell come and kick this off, I feel like this is like the next best thing, right? Is that right? I was wondering who's gonna pick the first slot. Yeah, no, I don't wanna say it. All right. You wanna say it? All right. Welcome to the show, Steve Larson. Where's the app? Where's the app? Where's the app? There it is! How's it going? It's going good. How are you? Very good. I'm excited to be here. Thanks for having me, guys. Good. I'm gonna be honest, I freaked out for just a second. I was like, holy crap. I'm losing. What happened? He ran out to go fix the internet real quick. Exactly. I guess I'm another socialist. Yeah, dude. Okay, so here. Awesome. Yeah, it's nice to have you, dude. Okay, so here's a couple things. So we're all loving the swag at this point. So if you guys don't know Steve, Steve's the capitalist pig, man. He's been teaching offers, launches, how to be able to do all these things. I watched the last YouTube video that you put out, I think this morning, about what was it? It was content. Like, actually, like, no, it was the publishing machine on the engine. Like, how do you actually fulfill? So listen to that. Got our newsletters because you're doing linchpin stuff. And so I don't want to take the wind out of the air like you've got so much stuff to talk about. For those people who haven't been, like, blessed into the community, have not been here since childhood, can you introduce yourself? Let everybody know like your funnel hiking journey. Yes, I was born wearing this t-shirt. And I was a top hat. Yeah, so I was much, you know, I was broke as a joke and I was in college and couldn't figure out how to feed us in the long term and didn't know what I want to be when I grew up. And, oh yeah, there we are. This little baby face, Steve, right there. You need some hair on the other side of your head, kid. Anyway, so basically, though, I went and I created my first funnel and it didn't work much like most people's don't. And the only education piece that was out there was the first version of dot com secrets and that great book. But people have so many more answers than I did when I started. I was just in college just putting these things together and, you know, it took, it was hard, you know, there just, there wasn't a lot. I was definitely the annoying guy in support, you know, like I would support twice a day. How do I do this? How do this? How do this? And part of it is just ClickFunnels is still such a brand new young company. By a crazy turn of events, I ended up working at ClickFunnels after my first funnel hacking live and I traded funnels for plane tickets because I was so poor. Funnels for hotel nights, funnels for the event tickets and actually the very computer that I'm on still right now, which is very old and I just keep upgrading the insides of I should probably just get another computer. But I funnel building is such an incredible skill set regardless of what you choose to do with it. You know, if you're going to stay the route of being a funnel builder or you're going to just use the CEO and you realize I don't want to build a funnel, but I need to understand them so I know how to get one in my own company. Or if you're going to be a marketer and realize, hey, I'm going to go in and learn how to drive tons of traffic to all these funnels that people are building. It's one of those, just a universal language now, but it really wasn't when I started. So I ended up working for Russell and for two years and sat next to him and we built a ton of funnels, like an ungodly amount of funnels. And once, then after that decided it was kind of, it was within the year after I left that I decided I was going to go in and teach offers and then go down this capitalist pig routes and that's awesome. You guys are wearing your swag. You have to. Yeah. So this is a little backstory. I've done a lot of stuff, a lot of things, offers, funnels, launches, content, you know, a lot of the mindset stuff. You have the newsletter now, which is great. Yeah. Anyway, yeah. The amount of people who've been able to sit next to Russell during that period of amazing growth, like we're talking about tripling the user base for quick funnels and more and just like being able to do all these things, being able to see him grow from book to book to book, being able to be somebody that he reaches out to throughout all of that. Like there's very few people who got to sit in that seat and be able to be you and be able to see it and be able to be somebody that he got to like geek out with. And so like there's so many cool stories and things that you've brought up in the past that I just, I've, I've ate up every single step of the way. And so I appreciated you like pounding the publishing drum and just, you know, getting, getting us out there, those of us who are afraid of publishing and all the rest, like it's beautiful. I gotta tell you, it's one of the reasons I go so hard is that like that role doesn't even exist anymore, you know, and there were so many little insights. I mean, I have a marketing degree, but come on, I didn't really go to marketing school until I sat next to him. And, and it was interesting to, to observe the, and this is true for all people who have a skill set and teach it, right? The way you can teach something from stage versus the way you actually apply it is slightly not that it's different. It's just you get to see how that thing gets applied and all these little nuances. So for the first two comic of coaching program, right, that we put out this before two comic of X, that took me six months to put that program right there. And I was the only coach for 675 students. That was so many backgrounds, so many scenarios, so many origin stories and offers and does this funnel work for me? What funnel type should it be to go really deep in that and then through the one funnel way stuff, it's 50 or 60,000 people that I got to bring through live on that. I have a lot of affinity and empathy and have seen the backgrounds of a unique amount of people. And so it's a good one. A unique amount of people and scenarios on how the stuff gets applied to the marketplace. And so that's where a lot of my passion comes from is I was really broke once. And, you know, there's a certain few number of steps when applied in the right order that really increase the probability of winning. So that's, anyway, just side note that. Yeah. So we have seen you now. We've been seeing some footage popping up. You have been to the last four FHLs speaking on stage. Speaking on stage, yeah. Okay, so you've been to eight, so you've missed just the first, no, no, no. Missed the first one. No, I missed the first one. I was broke. Okay. So this is your fifth year speaking. What's kind of brought you back to the stage this year? First off, Russell asking. Yeah. I'm excited for what I'm going to talk about. During the pandemic, I was, if you guys have been following it all, you know that I like to study stories of rich, dead, most, and most people who are not. If you guys have been following it all, you know that I like to study stories of rich, dead marketers. And the reason is because of the reason is because I, the longer I've been down this route, like when I was growing up, I really wanted to be a high school history teacher. I love American history. I love studying wars. That's what I thought I was going to be. It was one of the two routes I thought I was going to go in with the college was teaching history. And so that's where a lot of my passion comes from in teaching, teaching this stuff. So the deeper and deeper I've gone into like all these stories of old marketers, the more and more I've realized that there's really no such thing as internet marketing. And this is like what I think trips a lot of people up is they're like, Oh, am I really one foot away? Yes. But you're not one marketing thing away. You're going to do a lot of different marketing things to that one funnel. And that's the part that most people get really, really stuck up on is they sit back and say they don't understand the role of a funnel. They don't understand the role of marketing. They think sales is marketing. I think entrepreneurship is marketing and a funnel and they're all different things and they don't pieces fit together. So I believe that there is marketing. And then there is the internet, right? Two separate things. One is a distribution channel. The other is how you get leads and attention towards your business. And we just, when you're going to be a marketer, sometimes it's best to learn what that was like before the internet. Otherwise, the internet can kind of become somewhat of a crutch. And so, and we start to think to ourselves, Oh, I have to know Facebook really well to in order to be a marketer. I still don't know how to do Facebook ads. And that's not a brag. It's just to say the point, right? That marketing is not a platform on the internet. We just use the internet as a way to distribute marketing. And so like the one you're just showing, the one of Russell and I were co-authoring a book together right now called Dramatic Demonstration. And the whole point of the book is look at what it actually took to market in old times. And you actually have an easier time seeing what the raw principles and steps of marketing actually is. That way, when you go apply it to the internet, you don't start thinking that the internet equals marketing because it's not. It's just a way to reach people. And so this year, I don't know if I'm supposed to say what I'm talking about, but I won't. This year, what I'm going to be talking more about is, again, okay, cool. So this year, what I'm going to be talking more about is a speech that I gave to the category of Kings mastermind. And at the end, Russell was like, that was good. And I was like, that was the stuff I wanted to say at the last FHL. And he was like, really? And I said, yeah, but we only have 45 minutes and there's two of us. It's not a lot of time. And he goes, you should get on stage. And I was like, done. And what it is, is I struggled for a long time to figure out how to make hooks. What is a hook? And it's one of the most important pieces of page one of any funnel or really anything you put on the internet. That first line, that first title, a headline. We refer to it as a hook, but only if it meets certain things. And so I realized, it's kind of backpedal. Let me go full circle here. Sorry. During the pandemic, the beginning of pandemic, I started listing out all of these stories about PT Barnum and all the things I had gone deep on. I got to meet Joe Vitale. He's so cool. That's awesome. He's super deep in PT Barnum, obviously. But yeah, we, I started noticing that there was a pattern in how Barnum would launch a product without ads. And it was the way that he would approach different distribution channels on the internet. I mean, I'm sorry, without the internet, right? Because there's no internet. So the wit, and there was this model and he would never email his list first or the equivalent of that, right? He would never reach out to his people that he had, he had control of traffic on first ever. And that's often what he, what the rest of us all go do is we make a post, we do an email. Boom. I launched my thing. That's not a watch. That's an announcement. Right. And so I started telling Russell more about this. I was like, check this out, man. This is like these, this pattern is really nine steps. The first time I pulled it out. And it was in every single one of his campaigns. And what he was talking about in the campaigns is what I wish I had the time to talk about at the last FHL. And it's this hook formula. And this hook formula is, is amazing. I've used it on so many of my clients now. And I first noticed I was doing it about three years in writing hooks for people. And anyway, just started noticing that like, wow. We write these sales messages. But if I ever go on Facebook live and I just start telling a sales message, answers are it offends people and they walk away. Wait, why? It's my sales message. And even if I'm talking to a pocket of people who are potential buyer of mine, why does it offend them? Right. Same thing. If I go out and I start just talking about my offer, same thing. Right. They didn't give me permission to pitch them. And so I was like, there's, there's a step before sales message. What is that? And it's hook. The role of the hook is to sell the sales message. And then it's the role of the sales message to sell the offer. But too many of us go to the open marketplace and say, here's my sales message. Here's my offer. Here's my funnel. Here's my thing. And it's annoying what you're supposed to lead with. And what I saw in Barnum and all these other guys is you only ever in your marketing only ever spread the hook. Never the sales message, never the offer. And when they say yes to the hook, then they're saying yes to let me hear the sales message come pitch me. So last year at funnel hacking live, like you got to be on stage with Russell. And you were talking through a dramatic demonstration, which is part of the Lynch pin strategy, which is everything the funnel hacking live is this year. Like it's 100% the Lynch pin, how to do it step by step with Russell and the best businesses that are implementing this piece by piece. Like, I almost expect this to be like part two, like part one is like, here's a bunch of examples that we did of this from PT Barnum and from Russell talked about the guy that he liked that like would like who's that wrestler. And then you guys gave the two comic book award to PT Barnum. Right. And so like, I almost see this as like part two of that is that appropriate way to think of that like, like, or this is like how to understand this and better context or is it just entirely separate. It's no, it could call it part two, but it's not to say there's only two parts of this, you know, but it's certainly a follow up. Yeah. That is cool. Yeah, super cool. A lot of hook writing formulas for those of us who are not copywriters. And that's Russell's three stuff right hook story offer. And so we can be able to play with that. That's going to be a blast dude. I was like, I get ranting about the stuff. Sorry for talking too long, but it's some cool crap everyone. He should come to fun hiking life. This is epic, epic crap. It's going to be absolutely awesome guys. If you don't have your tickets you need to get it go to funnel hacking live calm go and get your tickets to like to be frank. I've been to a lot of events so like you the very first fun hacking live I didn't go to I hadn't invite had a ticket. I just didn't go. Because I'm like, I don't understand how to I was in a broke mindset. It just wasn't going to happen. And it wasn't until I changed and shifted and things started to change for me as I did that. That suddenly like you like you go every year. Once you go like once you step your foot in funnel hacking live you never want to not be there. It becomes a reunion and every year is a little different. And so it never loses that pizzazz and this year is massively different. But like you've put on your own stuff to like this is this isn't your first like event by far like you've gone through and created multiple events. I remember the very first offer mind. Yeah, that's beautiful. Thank you. I went too deep on it. That was 20 events ago or 19 events ago. It's not going to be my first crazy. That is nuts. So there's some that always stick out to me like I always remember the very first offer mind always remember. The time that you taught this principle you're speaking about funnel hacking live like you talked about a piece of it. Several while I think I tried to go to every event that you were throwing. And I remember like the iterations and we actually talked about the hook itself and how to do the rest of everything else. And it's beautiful. It's going to open up exactly what you need to hear for the rest of the event. Like this is the door that swings open wide your ability to be able to make your sales funnel get traffic, make it get moving. And like, I remember when you did that. I remember when Russell came. I remember when Dave came. I remember when when you started launching again like there's just these moments that I will always remember. And I, yeah, super, super cool dude. That's awesome. Yeah, appreciate it. So, really quick correction me if I'm wrong. Are you doing a bonus for funnel hacking live is that what we heard. Oh sweet cherry pie you know I'm gonna. I don't know where you came up with that one like you popped on stage. That was not planned I just was saying something I don't know when I can tell that what I've been teaching has been really thick for a while. I had a coach tell me you got to learn how to break it up. Otherwise, it's like eating Thanksgiving bread all day long and expecting this to not take a nap. And I was like that's good advice. So I just do something stupid to just bring the room back. Otherwise kind of get lost sometimes. And it's sweet cherry. Very effective. It's great. All right. Sweet cherry pie is beautiful. Let's see if you get higher. I don't know. All right, so tell me really quick. So like Russell has his offer. And with his offer for fun hacking live, you're going to be able to get the tickets for funnel hacking live. You get, you also get like a whole bunch of other bonuses including the marketing dot AI installation into your quick phones account and get that integration. You get a whole bunch of swag. It's ridiculous how much swag you're going to get. Interstitial bonuses including all the replays from funnel hacking live from 2016, all the way through to 2022. You can hear every time that Steve has spoken and be able to catch up entirely on this. But the question is like, you wanted to provide something on top of it. I'm just going to let the floor be yours because I appreciate that. That's, that's yeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah. So my bonus this year is the offer mind 2019 replays just my speeches. It's, which is it's a deep dive but not not as deep as that first offer mind. That was deep. Russell, Russell made fun of it. He was like, did you went deep and then he looked down and he goes, like, so deep. I was like, okay, sorry, the 2019 is not nearly as like, not nearly as nerdy. But what it is though is how I view the world of a brand new startup as they kind of wade through the questions of making the first offer for that company. It's not necessarily for new entrepreneurs, although it can be. It's just the key questions in the order you should ask them to really make a an offer that is attractive for the marketplace to make sure that there is a marketplace for what you're creating, how to make the offer how to price it those types of strategies and and it does dive a little bit into some of my traffic stuff but it's mostly about offer stuff. That was the one that 650 people at the event. That was a good one. Yeah, that was the one here on Monday. Yeah, on a Monday. I was at that one. That's awesome. It was really cool. Yeah, that's a good I like that. I'm proud of that one a lot. And then, and then I thought it would just be cool. There were the next offer mind we did out of my own studio and so most of the Godings was virtual but there was some in person. And this is right when Dave was what was going through the middle. No one has seriously was it. And he's like a second father figure to me. And so I thought it would be cool to just put his keynote. He was already getting kind of stick in this and so he is hard for me to talk about. So he. So we did like a sit down side by side interview and he gives him just really good life advice. And so I thought it'd be cool to toss his keynote in as well. So, yeah. I think it's just just drop a thank you or you know like I don't think anybody realizes how amazing this is. 2019 replays are spectacular. Being able to hear Dave. And this is not like a traditional like discussion with Dave. This is something very different than Dave's normal. We all follow Dave we loved hearing Dave when he was going live every single day and he was sharing the message that he felt was his calling to share. And it's just kind of presentation and it's one that I think a lot of people. It's going to bless a lot of people. So dude, that is absolutely amazing. Thank you so much. Yeah, it's only I feel like it's the best way to prep for coming. Otherwise you look at all these marketing strategies and you're like, this is cool, but I don't have a thing to sell. And those of you guys who are in that category, I have affinity for that I get that. So this will help you have a thing. I think it's the best way to offer mine. Okay, put the offer idea together that way the marketing ideas that you're hearing and the funnels strategies that you're seeing you're like, I have a thing to do that too now. Otherwise, I was falling into a trap for a long time. I was like, this is cool. But like I still don't have a product I'm confident in. Right. And that's so that way we show up you're like, I'm ready. I think that makes it so much easier. Like what we're going to be walking through is all the pieces once you've got kind of that figured out you get to now figure that out before you're at funnel hacking live. Plus you get all the recordings and all the jazz. Dude, Steve, thank you so much. Appreciate it beyond compare. If you guys don't have your tickets. This is where you're going to go.

All right, we'll see you guys later. See you guys there. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences. But all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life. And I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating. It's pulsing. I made for something more. You get scared. And then fear hits us. There's a little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven, are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized, I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I had gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that made me all of my money. My best selling frame. What? Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust the influencer. This better blow your mind and allows you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning to begin. Who do you want to become? What do you want to belt and experience in this one precious life? I can pass. I can pass. I can pass. You wouldn't be able to tell, but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People build a sense of belonging here. It's like home. I'm still encouraging because if they can do it, so can I. They thought, let's say, hey, next year we're going to get better. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer he ever lived. You find exactly what your business is missing. It's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day they're telling people how they met you. I can live change my entire life because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be blessed. Your legacy's going to be blessed. Movements are about to be burned. My story hopefully gave women permission. You do not have to be great to get started, but you have got to start if you ever want to be great. You
