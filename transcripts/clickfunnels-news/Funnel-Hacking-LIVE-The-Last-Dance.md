## Transcript
Ladies and gentlemen, this next individual I'd like to introduce is the reason that we are all here this weekend. About eight months ago, he brought to the marketplace something that we all desperately needed. The ability to make professional looking sales funnels in a matter of hours as opposed to months. I was really nervous and nobody was going to show up. We opened the doors, it was packed and we filled the whole room. Since then, ClickFunnels has had over 7,000 members and over 200 people are joining every single day. I remember walking into this event space and I didn't know what it meant and now I do. I remember coming to my first funnel hacking live with Just The Dream and I remember this rumbling that only comes from people who are wild enough to do amazing, freezing things. This is your tribe. These are the people here to pull you up and to push you as you go. I find this member saying, man, that one person said that one thing changed my business. I started asking God to start bringing women because men are not the only ones that change the world. One year we had more women speakers than we had men speakers. I resonated with all of the women that took the stage and that was the day that I was sitting in my chair and I felt healed. Drown yourself to the dreamers, the doers, the believers and the thinkers. Most of all, drown yourself with those who see greatness within you even when you don't see it yourself, which is what family is all about. All of a sudden our doors are getting backed up and backed up and backed up. We got people yelling louder and louder. There's this camaraderie that you can't find anywhere else. It's electrifying. I was scared that I had risked everything and my husband came up behind me and said, keep climbing. I just came off that stage and we did it. This event is a major pillar in my becoming story. If there was anyone who loved Funnel Hacking Live the most, it was Dave Woodward. I wish you could be here to see the ultimate conclusion to what he helped build here. We feel him here. He's never left and I think he'd be really proud of where we're at right now. This is all Dave. All he wanted to do is be here. There's nothing better in my life than having the opportunity in helping change other people. As you've gone through the struggle and as you've gone through all the pain, the suffering and the learning, you start to realize what you do matters. It really does matter. There's something magical about Funnel Hacking Live. It's like, man, we did it. Being the last gives those of us who are actually here something special. We can say that we are here at the last dance. Funnel Hacking Live was the pick me up. It was the answer. It was the movement. My wife would be like, when was the last Funnel Hacking Live? I don't know. I think it was a couple months ago. She was like, you need another one. All of you guys are somewhere in this wave right now. Some of you guys are at the top riding it. Some of you guys are at the bottom. Some of you guys are somewhere in between. But if nothing else of this event, like I wanted you guys to all understand, no matter where you are, there's hope. We're the fighters. We won't stop. Won't quit no matter the cost. Our kids, they see their parents chasing their dreams. It shows them that it's possible for them too. Thank you for an incredible decade. These events have changed and saved many lives. It's sad it's the last one. But I don't think that magic goes away. We're going to carry the torch. Did you hear me? A thing isn't beautiful because it lasts forever. The mission stays the same. It's just going to look a little different. And that's okay. Thank you, funnel hackers. Russell, Todd, thank you, team, everybody. We wouldn't have our story if you didn't have yours.
