This is something that we want to have together. If you weren't there, this is something this is you don't want to miss this. Like this is going to be a wonderful, wonderful episode. So let's go ahead and start. We both got there on Sunday and we recorded like our journey to and it never made it online. Yeah, it never we you guys you guys noticed our our episodes while we were there. They didn't quite go as we planned mostly because Internet was a problem. So yeah, we did record our journey getting there. So I'm do we have I don't even know Ben. I don't think he was even told me do we have that today? Put it together yet. No, and so like all I have is us going live and we can play the Monday video on Monday. Super late. We got together and we walked around. Is this playing for you guys or is it not playing? It's not playing. It's not playing. All right, let's go ahead and pause for a minute. I want to go ahead and I want to make sure that we get this up as much as possible. So let me go ahead and re share this file really quick because this is important. I want us to actually like go on this journey together if we can. So we went there we are. Turners in the comments still recovering. Still recovering. Yeah, no joke. And it is a recovery. So Monday night we walked through and showed you like everything and how it was set up. So that when you joined like, you know exactly what's happening. We got to highlight all the different things and show you all the cool setup that that goes on. It was so need to get there before the madness hit. We got there on Sunday. None of this was up. They set it all up like Monday morning and see it all come up. We got to see it all be put together. The swag shop was set up and it was just cool to be able to walk through it with you guys and show you like all the different spaces. What was Monday like for you? Because I was crazy busy working on PowerPoints with Russell and Todd and members of the team. Like what were you doing? That's a great question. Monday was so long ago. Oh yeah. So we were we were waiting to get Funnel Hacker TV booth set up. We were right. They got that set up for us and we're like, okay, we got to go get all of our stuff. Monday was us just primarily figuring out like how is the rest of this week going to go? And even then it didn't go as we as we expected on that front, but it was so awesome. Anyway, and it was getting to know the staff because the staff was all there. And actually it was really cool because a lot of you die hard. Funnel Hackers showed up early like some of you were there walking around in the hallways, checking things out, trying to get sneak peeks of stuff. But I got to have a lot of conversations with with you guys Monday and Tuesday. We'll get to Tuesday. But it was kind of cool because there wasn't a whole lot of people there. I wasn't in a rush to get anywhere. So actually had some really awesome like a little bit longer conversations with some of you that were there. That was really fun. Yeah, that was cool. Like having conversations with you guys is one of the coolest experiences. A lot of you guys like gave us stuff like I have a chain mail like what is that called? Bracelet that you guys gave me. I've got shirts. I've got letters like there are so many things that you guys gave us. You just made us feel like a million dollars and this was for you like ours. Our goal to give to you. So first off, thank you for coming in saying hi. We appreciated it. But we hope you had an absolutely amazing time because it just went crazy. Tuesday morning. I don't know if you guys know we woke up crazy early every single morning and on Tuesday as an example. Let me go ahead and make sure they audio. Not one on that one. We've we did a recap video. This is for everybody that was not that wasn't able to make it out live. We did this for for our team members that weren't there and just kind of showed what was going on. What it looked like. This is Wednesday morning right before registration. So this is us getting ready and you'll see a video really quick from Russell and Todd and they're talking about just, you know, how great it is to be there. And they're just kind of talking us through like what's going to happen today, how it's going to go. And we recorded this just so that way the people who weren't working at Funnel Hacking Live still felt like they had some semblance of being on the team. Know that we're all in this together. It was really cool. But being able to hear from Russell and Todd like in the morning was really nice. Number one, to know they're human just like us. It was exhausting getting all the pieces together. But then they like were able to take that to the next level and talked about like what it is that we're going to be doing step by step. I'm also shared a couple of things. Buddy, I'm here with Nora and right now we are walking to a special VIP dinner with our inner circle. Yeah, so they had a VIP dinner with the inner circle and it was so cool. So did you, which you didn't see this VIP? Did you Susan? I did it. But we all ended up at the same place. I'll tell you what. So we all went to Universal Studios that night and it was so cool. We were able to go through, go see Harry Potter World specifically walk through. Is it Diagon Alley? No, not Diagon Alley. Where was it? Hogsmeade. Hogsmeade. Yes, that's it. We went to Hogsmeade. Yeah, that was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun. And I think was it right before that that we did Funnel Hacker TV? We did like Twas the night before Funnel Hacking Live and just kind of like talked about what we're doing. Because like we give away a lot of stuff. I don't know if you guys know this. Our trivia and treasure thing became legit. And so we gave away a whole bunch of stuff and talked about or showed all the different things that we were giving away. And so we give away copyright secrets. We give away follow up funnels. We give away all this different stuff and everybody was able to register and sign up for those of you who won. Let us know if you won, but you didn't grab your swag. Let us know as well. And we'll get you guys all taken care of because it was it was crazy. It was fast turnaround. It was quick. There was a lot of stuff going on. But this was like the Comber for the Storm. We did a little bit of registration. We got to go to Harry Potter World and I got to ride the Velocic coaster. Did you do that one, Susan? No, because you told me you're going to have to take your glasses off. And I was like, I'll pass. I need my glasses to see. That's going to be very disorienting. Next time though, if we end up there ever again, I'll make sure I wear contacts. Oh, we give away these linchpins. And they were a big deal. Oh my gosh, I was a huge hit. Everybody loved those people were seeking us out. Like, is this where you get the linchpins? I think we gave away all of them. I think three ended up making it home in my bag that I didn't realize they were in there. So I have a couple extra maybe we'll give away one on the show. They'll be cool. Those were fun. I don't even have one. Like I got a get one and I was just like, here you go and gave it away. No, I don't have one to save one for me. I have one for Ben. Big ones, one of the bigger ones too. Awesome. Okay, so every single day of Funnel Hiking Live, they did like a recap video. That's like super, super cool. And we wanted to show those to you. So let's go ahead and show the very first one because it was good. Let's go ahead and roll that day one. Who are the most excited, the most passionate ones who were willing to leave everything to come here and be part of this because you have a dream. I'm going to be here one day. One day. One day. One day. One day. One day. And my goal is to help you give you the tools and the assets that you need to make those dreams become a reality. That's what we do here at Funnel Hiking Live. This is a rock concert for entrepreneurs. Are you guys all right with that? I say take ownership. Take ownership of your mission. Take ownership of your job. Take ownership of your finances. Take ownership of your future. Take ownership of your life. Take ownership of your life. Take ownership of your future. So that was they showed it right before day two but because of day one I wanted to show to you guys. Like, final hacking live is always emotional. Like it always hits you in that point where you're not quite sure if you're ready to get hit. And it takes you to that next level. And it was really cool to be able to see this in such a structured manner. And like take it step by step. So day one, let's go ahead and see if that Wednesday hype video will play Christian that we have there. Let's do hype and see if the hype will work. Nope, hook it up. All right, just a moment. I'll go ahead and do that really quick. So what we did is we did Funnel Hacker TV, but as we were going, we had all the different things going on. Excuse the audio for a second. There was so much going on. It was such a blast. We had Russell speak. We had Brad and Ryan take the stage. We had Perry Belcher. Perry Belcher over delivered. We had Eric Thane and then we ended with Choco. Susan, what stood out to you from that day? Because that day was heavy. That day was, we started midway through the day. And it was still loaded. I think of the feeling that I was getting from everyone by the end was like, oh my gosh, every speaker was amazing. It was just stacked. I mean, like you said, we had amazing Brad, Ryan, Perry, Eric, Choco. Russell kicked us off that first session, was streamed into the groups. You guys may have seen that first session where Russell just nailed it. It was awesome. Like, yeah, it was an awesome way to start off the event. Because I mean, I don't know if you guys know this, but Choco was going to be, like he was intended to be like a keynote, right? Which is typically like later on in the event, but the only time that he could do it was day one. It was the only time that it fit into his schedule. So we had like the keynote, like at the beginning of the event, which I actually think worked so well because it really kicked it off. And then we had an amazing speaker on day four, which we'll get to anyway. So two amazing speakers. Well, it was cool because like, so if when you go through the linchpin, day one, like the first piece of the linchpin itself is his foundation series. It's like understanding that you need, like the pieces you need in order to make this work. I loved Brad and Ryan's talk about the movement. Like you never have a traffic problem if you create a movement. Like the movement will propel it forward. And it's creating that movement. That's your differentiator. It was so moving, so, so cool. And Perry just massively overdelivered. Like the AI tools alone that he just listed as he was running through, I already have people reaching out like, when is the replay up for that one available? I'm not gonna take it. So yeah. That's all the pictures that they needed to take. Yeah. If you've not gotten your tickets, you need it. I mean, so yeah. So Perry Belcher, say that 10 times fast. He actually kicked off the, so Russell was coming out in between most of the speakers on most of the days. And so that was really when like the linchpin training began. So Russell was doing his, like your call to adventure was what his first session was called. You know, you got to answer to the call. And then Brad and Ryan come out. They're talking about how like, you know, you really need to have a movement if you really want to like build this thing. And then the actual like linchpin train started. So Perry was talking about newsletters. Having a news, having an email list and a newsletter is, Russell puts that in. If you guys have ever noticed, when you look at the linchpin, there's this little skinny bar at the bottom that says two comma club foundation. That's where Russell puts this of like, you know, the foundation is your email list. You need an email list. You need to be emailing them. So that's where Perry came in. And then, you know, you've got to start getting traffic in some way. So that's where Eric Thane comes in of short form video content. And that was as much as that they could fit into day one because then they go into more traffic stuff on day two. And then Jaco of course comes in with his extreme ownership stuff. And it's like, you know, you got to just, you got to just be responsible over how your life is and take ownership. It was a lot to do with them, like, with your teams too. Like taking ownership over your responsibility with your team and having a team. Yeah. As you guys are growing your businesses, you'll start to add team members and do all these different things. Like Jaco's talk was spectacular. You want the replays, trust me. And the fact that you get the replays with this is an amazing bonus. So go ahead and grab it. We wanted to go live right before Russell went on stage because he went on stage and he presented live into the Facebook group. And we wanted to be able to go live beforehand. That did not happen. We were helping registration. And so we ended up going live later that night with several certified members. So Malia Bircham and with Cohen DeWitt, we got to interview both of them. And just have a really good time talking about all the speakers. So if you guys wanted to catch that, that is available for you guys on the ClickFunnels Facebook page. So go to the official ClickFunnels Facebook page. You'll see all of these available for you. You can catch up on all of them because that was a really fun. Like I didn't think that the interviews at the end were going to be as much fun as they were. The first one was draining. We went for like an hour. Each one afterwards, it was like, it was just fun. We got to hang out with other funnel nerds and it was blast. Yeah, it was. And it was really awesome. Like, you know, this was the first time I was actually meeting Cohen and Malia in person. And just to hear their take on what happened, this was at the end of day one. So half the day, right? There was so much to talk about just from that. Yeah, it was crazy. With that day two kicked off, let's go ahead and jump over to the day two recap and watch that video because that was crazy. You can only get so much watching content. At some level, you have to engage with each other. What Russell and Todd are about to reveal will truly revolutionize the way you do business. The vision of ClickFunnels 2.0 is massive. Whatever you guys need to accomplish your goals in your business, that has been the primary focus since the beginning on ClickFunnels 2.0. The reason why you understand is that if you are doing the business way that most people aren't doing, which is great, you have all these tools that you've learned, but if you're not doing it correctly through this lens I want to share with you guys today, then you can actually have a business that pays you, that's a lot easier, a lot less stress, and you can be successful. Last round, here we go. Come up! Come up! Come up! Come up! Come up! Come up! Come up! Come up! Come up! Come up! Come up! Come up! I loved Day 2. Day 2 was like, I felt like Day 1 was a lot. Day 2 was a flood. It was so, so, so cool. So I'm going to do a quick rundown. I'll let you do the rundown for the next day, Susan. But like this day was heavy. There was so much that happened. And as usual, we did our Funnel Hacker TV. We did one in the afternoon, finally. So we finally got one that worked. And so like we got to do one from inside. We got to do one afterwards. But we, Russell came in and talked. We had Stu McLaren. We had Garrett J. White. We had Miff. We had Dan Fleischman came on. Kathy Yoder. We had Katherine Jones. We had Russell and Todd shared all of the 2.0 releases. If you guys want us to, let us know in the comments. Do you want us to go through those like later on this week? Do you want to see kind of like how to actually install those? Let us know like if you want us to walk through the features and just kind of show it to you in 2.0 because it's nuts. So we can go ahead and do that if you want. Just let us know. Steve Larson and Russell Brunson went on stage and just had a great time as always. We had Mason Bridger and sorry, Mason Brains and Bridger Pennington. We had Nehemiah Davis, which was epic and spectacular. We had Satyama Ghali and we had Dan Kennedy and Jim Edwards. And we ended the day with geek out hanging out with Susan and with Dan and with Andrea. And it was, it was really, really cool. Yeah. It was really cool. Dang. That was a fun day, but loaded. There is so much that I can't believe there is. Oh my gosh. Six, nine, 12, 12 presentations at least or no 13 because Catherine got moved today too. Right. At least the 13 plus, you know, I think Brussels probably got interjected in place. I don't know what I can't remember. There was so much, but so I don't know how much we want to go into it. But like, so the first part of the day was a lot about continuity, right? You don't have a continuity. You don't have a business. That's the saying now, right? Who's the original person that's quoted? Russell says it, but he's quoting somebody. No, no, you called it out. I can't remember. I know our brains are too tired to remember. It's okay. We'll move forward. So continuity, then Russell does Mifki Mifki a Mifki presentation. So awesome. And then we go back into traffic, right? So that was traffic with Dan Fleischman, Kathy Otter. And Kathy Otter did a great and Catherine Jones. And Catherine Jones with her GV. Oh my gosh. And Catherine Jones was spectacular. Excuse the audio. There we go. Yeah. Catherine Jones was spectacular and she just killed it in every single way. Yeah. Everybody, everybody was so good. I was asking people in the hallways like, okay, what was your, what was your standout? Who did you love listening to? And like everybody, everybody got named. Like everybody was so amazing. Then dramatic demonstrations continued in traffic. So it was a day of continuity, traffic, dramatic demonstrations in the overall topics of the day. Anyone that you wanted to zero in on for this recap, because there's so many, I don't think we can talk about all of them. Like you guys really just need to go buy your tickets and get the, get the replays when you get your tickets. Cause there's, there's no way we can talk about all of them. It's not possible. So like if we talk about the morning, being able to have Garrett White teach actual business strategy was totally different than having him yell at you for, you know, for not manning up or, you know, however you want to put it, it was entirely different. It was so cool to be able to see that and see how Russell like installs each of these ideas or something that Russell's installing. So as he's like giving you this theory, he caps it at the end with the perfect presentations like, by the way, this is how I'm installing it. And it made it all click. Like this was the best training. So Garrett was really cool. Catherine Jones was stellar. Kathy Yoder had a blast. I love seeing Kathy Yoder just dance on stage, have a great time. And share some amazing insights. I'm like, oh my gosh, that's, if I had to do it again, that's exactly what I would do. Dramatic demonstrations with Russell and Steve were cool. Seeing all like, how do you get your message right? With Steve Larson was really, really powerful. Yeah. Then it's a different way of looking at it. And so that's like, I don't know what to do it on. Like, what do I even name my challenge? This is how you name your challenge. It is the perfect, you make a dramatic demonstration that, that is entirely like, it's so good. Nehemiah Davis came on number one, the energy was super high. But he delivered so much value so quickly, you have to watch the replays in order to take good notes. It was so good. Temma came on and was spectacular. And Dan Kennedy and Jim Edwards, class act. There was like audio visual. There was all these different things. It was absolutely spectacular. And I don't know, like, so there's something really cool that we did when we got to hang out with a geek, geek out, geek squad in the evening. Let's not use maybe the potentially trademarked name. My potentially trademarked. Please forgive me. We're not going to spy. In geek out was spectacular. And we got to talk about all the different things that have been released inside of 2.0. If you guys want a full overview of that on Thursday, let us know again. We're happy to do that. There was so much gold that dropped. We had to recap it with you. And we had to go through it. So if you guys want to see what that is, let us know. We'll do another one because it was crazy learning hubs, communities, all the different pieces just changing the game all over the place. ClickFunnels is like taking its chair at the rightful place. So it's really, really cool. Let's jump in a day three. Shall we? Let's play that video. In my mind, the way that the world works. If someone's living a normal life and somewhere along the line, they get into marketing. They get into that. They're like, I can make money. And they start this personal development journey. They usually end up wanting to start their own thing. And that's the way coming to my work. What y'all have in this system is one of the best systems ever. I made more money when I started doing ClickFunnels than I ever made on stage at one time. You are one funnel away. You guys have seen all the pieces now. Step by step by step. Just write them down in order because that's exactly what you should be doing for your business. This isn't the time of your life you have to start becoming irrationally passionate. You have to start going deep on something. You've got to be obsessed with it. Find something that you're excited by and then go all in. One last time, I can. I will. I must. I can. I will. I must. I can. I will. I must. I will. I must. I must. Man, like Eric's morning presentation, Eric Thomas's morning presentation was like gospel for ClickFunnels. That was, it was so heavy and it's so good. And it just got everybody off their feet. It's something we've ever had in like morning panels where somebody comes in and right away. It's like somebody getting you up off your feet and you're like it's instant wake up. It's like caffeine. It's audible caffeine. It was really, really game changing to be able to hear him right off the bat and just come in and just make that. Make his presence known and get everybody into the ClickFunnels and just this is your calling and it's time to go. It was really, really cool. Yeah, I got, I heard a lot from a lot of people that they just loved his presentation. His, yeah, it was so good. All right, should we do a quick rundown of day three? Yes, please. Also, while we're doing that, like, yeah, Nathan's in the comments. Love Eric Thomas. Let us know who's your, who's your stand out. Who's your favorite in the comments? Okay, so we had Eric Thomas, then we had Nehemiah Davis back again. We had Barry Baumgartner, then Hardy, Jody Moore, Russell Brunson mixed into there. And then we had what they called the attractive character power hour, which included Kailin Pullen of Ladyboss, McCall Jones of charisma hacking, and Kevin Anson talking about attractive character ads, and they all knocked it out of the park as well. That led to later in the evening, there was the all roads lead to speakers, and that was Doug Boutin, Andrea Pier, Tim Shields, Chris Foss, Miranda Pierce, Dominic Perron. So day three was also packed. It was just crazy how many, how many people they jammed in here and it was so good. It didn't feel like it was too much. It was like, exactly what needed to happen. It was amazing. Okay, so day three, do you want to go over like, okay, we've talked about traffic, we talked about dramatic demos, a little bit, and then we talked about continuity a little bit. So it was kind of the day three topics. Yeah, so like, so day one was like, in essence, like your foundation, right? Day two was creating your first product in the best ways to sell it both number one to your audience that you've already created number two, how do you actually start to scale this like this is how you launch the business number one you get your initial funding and then number two you do your dramatic demonstrations with traffic to be able to start scale it. So day three was like, how do you take this now to high ticket. How do you actually like live into this into the high ticket format and so like having Barry come on and speak was spectacular because Barry is like the powerhouse behind not just funnel hiking live but multiple events with Dean Grousey O.C. Tony Robbins, just so many different people that you don't know she's there but she's there. It's a game changer. She was absolutely spectacular just behind the scenes with us and taking care of us and making sure that we were in the right mindset and we're able to support you and in the know, and then she had other teams are just one of three different teams that she was managing. It was impressive. I'm going to be able to see her like breakout how she does it was really, really cool. I love the attractive character power hour but for me Dr Ben Hardee's was really cool I love. I love how he breaks things down. So he teach he taught 10x is easier than two X actually gave us whole bunch of books we got so many books during funnel hiking life guys. This is my stack of books behind me right here all the books we were given. And so, like, they just gave us so so so much that it's just it's unbelievable 10x is easier than two X is Dr Hardee's book, and it was spectacular it was on point it was clean it was. And it was really like the calling to level up how do you actually level up and what is the process to do that, so that way you manage it appropriately. Because there was so much like we had Katelyn Poole and McCall Jones and Kevin Anson all just come out real quick within the power hour. We took a break, and we're able to speak with Tara Tang, and Tara is so cool so she did the, we did a breakout where we talked about all the speakers with Tara. And she talked about getting her ticket, getting tickets for her daughters to come to funnel hiking live, how she sold it to them and what how they were liking it so far. She's able to talk about her roosters back at home. There's just, it was such a cool interview. It was real. It was she's like this is the second Facebook live I've ever done am I going to do okay. She did awesome. It was just a blast. It was a blast. A lot of fun talking with Tara. And then daughters were there watching, cheering her on. It was really fun. Yes, they're watching their smiling and giggling the whole time. It was great. Absolutely awesome. And then we got into the all roads lead to panel and holy smokes. This is something that is new, like this, this way of bringing these presenters together into this. It's called so funny. I was like giggling at how it was on our staff. The staff agenda of the day, it was like all roads lead to panel but not really a panel with very but not really with very. So funny. So it wasn't really a panel. They all got to come out individually. They all had about like 13 to 15 to like 20 minutes to speak on the topic that Russell asked him to speak on. And it's called all roads lead to which means all roads lead to click funnels to 2ccx to what Russell's doing to Lynch pin like this entire ecosystem of things that are happening over here. So every one of them spoke about how, you know, one of those things or another have led to the success in their business. Yeah, Doug came out and spoke about how he was able to multiple years in a row be the dream car winner with a small, a small community, a small compared to most of the of the other people that are you know winning 2 comic club awards and he's also now won a 2 comic club award. So how to do it with a smaller audience. Andrea came out and spoke about how, how we've aligned our agency with Lynch pin and how she started. She got the start of the of her career and what we do now, joining 2ccx. And she just nailed it. Tim Shields talked about how he run, you know, goes around and does webinars and really cool places so dramatic dramatic demonstrations. Really, really cool there. And Chris boss he, oh Chris, he came out and he spoke. Do you want to take this one Ben, I think that it's appropriate for you to share with Chris. Yeah, Chris bosses was very, very personal. So Chris bosses all about return on relationship you create those relationships and that's a great way to to JV. But it also is key like Chris talked about like when he was in the hospital how he was getting letters from from Dave and from Russell, and from these people that just like he built a relationship with. And how much that means when you actually start to try to build it into more of a business relationship and how you build the relationship first. That's what dream 100 is all about. And he shared a story about Dave that just had everybody in tears. And it was just beautiful and it was a lovely lovely dedication and is his family approved of it beforehand so it was all good but it was, it was spectacular. It was really, really worth watching the replay over the replays there was two other ones after that too. Yeah, so definitely go the way the only way you can get replays right now is to go get your tickets for FHL 10 and in doing so you also get a free virtual ticket for nine and a half, because one is happening at the end of this year and then the live the next live in person FHL is happening in February of 2025. And that is going to be amazing to all come back together after such a gap between but go get we'll get the replays because then there's two other people that came out during this all roads lead to section Miranda Pierce. And did you catch Miranda. Were you in that one you want to talk about that one as well. Miranda's Miranda spectacular every single time. She kind of hinted at what she was going to talk about with us, which was really nice. So we kind of knew but Miranda talks about like how do you take the messages that would tear you down and turn it around so it not only leverages your traffic like you explode but your community feels like they're in the fight with you. And it was an amazing because we're all afraid to publish at some point. This is how you make sure that you don't have that fear this is the best way to overcome it and it was beautifully beautifully presented and very clean I, it was wonderful. And no people don't know she was also doing a launch at the exact same time so she got off the stage and then was like taking calls and like closing so she was spectacular. Dominic Brogni.
