Well, hey, we are live. Yes, we are. Hey everybody. So we are live again at our usual time. And today what we're going to be talking about is we're going to be talking about the Mifki concept. And we're also going to be having a bit of a race. We do have the funnel games going on. In fact, today is the last day. Later on, they're going to be going live. And it's going to be very exciting. But we thought we'd do kind of like a little mini race today. And we want to thank our ambassadors who joined us today, Madison, Dan and Ritty. So we have them on today. Yeah. And this is a little bit of a new sort of concept that we kind of came up with a while ago and thought, is this something we could possibly do and get away with? And we're hoping that we can. So if you're watching live, let us know in the comments, if you're in the place right now, we're going to kind of put you on the spot a little bit, right? So, you might know a little thing about click funnels. Hopefully you've all got click funnels like available and you've got access to it right now, right? And so a client's just literally walked in. And this guy's really impatient. And he's like, I've got this crazy futuristic drawn company. And I was reading this thing from Russell Brunson. And he talks about this Mifki. And I would really like to set up like a monthly membership for my drone company, right? So I want to get people to subscribe to this recurring revenue thing and give me money every single month. It sounds great. I've got lots of drones. I've got unlimited drones. They come in all shapes and sizes, right? I've got this click funnels account and I've signed up and I've got this book and I want one of these Mifki things. And I got told that you guys are the experts. So can we create some kind of Mifki concept that will get people to sign up to a monthly membership for like drone enthusiast club? He wants to run like this monthly recurring club for people who love drones, right? So I don't know what they're going to give them in there. He just says, Hey, I've got drones. I'm the client. Do as I ask. And you guys are like, Oh man. So all you've got available at this point is a crazy guy who's got a company with futuristic drones. He knows he wants one of these Mifki things. Ready? Who is the audience? Is this normal people like us or like drone nerd? Like who want to know everything about drone? Drones, right? They're drone people, right out there. So present something on a click funnels page so folks can sign up and get this offer and take this Mifki and you've got an hour and you've got click funnels AI in your imagination. And Andy and I are going to kind of come round and find out what you're thinking. If you leave right now, we know what you're thinking. If you're still with us in a few minutes time and you open up click funnels and you've got some idea and you sketch something, draw it, AI Photoshop it, put words on the screen, create a concept, whatever it is. You've got a crazy guy with a drone company who wants to get drone enthusiasts into a monthly drone enthusiasts thing and he wants to give them one of these crazy Mifkis that Russell Brunson keeps talking about. That's it. That's it. And quite often that's what you get from your clients. There you go. Get me one of these things and I'll pay you whatever you want. Do you think it's even possible? Because I've got an idea for this. I don't know if you guys have got an idea for this. Is it even something you can pull off? You've got like literally a concept, an idea, you know what a Mifki is and you've got click funnels AI in your imagination. So this is really awesome. We were just talking about right before we went live amongst ourselves. We're talking about how much you can learn from especially from the funnel games, watching some of the experts and hearing their thought process of how they're going through the some of the decisions and how they're deciding on a headline and why they decide on a certain color, even all these different things go into building a funnel. And and I don't know if you're like me, but I love watching and hearing and just seeing how experts approach their their build. And so what we're going to do this is great for anybody that just starting out if you're just starting out with click funnels 2.0 or even click on those classic is going to be great for you. We are going to be building on click phones 2.0. But Danny, can for anybody that's brand new, what is an MIA? What is it? MIA? Yeah, go over into more detail. So the idea is encourage somebody to take your recurring monthly membership. You offer them the most incredible free gift ever. And you say, my membership and you stick around. We're going to tempt you to join by giving you this box of goodies or this digital stuff, a gift that's worth a bunch of money, right for free. You take this gift and all you need to do is say maybe to my membership and maybe you offer them a trial of that as well. So all the risks on you. It could take the the MFG and they could cancel because they thank you very much. But the hope is that that gift is so cool and so awesome that they stick around. Right. And that's what Mr. Drawn Guy has just realized. Whoa, I could have a club of drawn enthusiasm. I saw these guys doing this thing every month and I could charge them for it. And maybe I could offer them, I don't know, pilot lessons or maybe I could offer them downloads or maybe that could offer them discounts or maybe I could offer all this stuff. But I know that if I give them this gift to get them started, they're likely to stay and likely to keep paying me month on month. So this concept, this this MFG, something that's highlighted in the Lynch pin book is something that Russell uses in all of his offers, right? If you've signed up to a challenge, you've signed up to secrets of success, you've signed up to any of these things. You get a box of awesome goodies to start you off. Right. You get maybe get a t-shirt, right? You get some books, you got the cookbook or whatever it is. And that is kind of like this welcome gift starter pack that encourages you to either, you know, stay subscribed to ClickFunnels or stay subscribed to a membership site or stay subscribed to a program. And this guy has realized what he's saying. Well, I've got physical products and some information products. How do I do this, you guys? What could you build realistically in an hour with ClickFunnels AI and your imagination? Yeah. So I think we've all seen different types of free offers or free downloads. And there's some really good stuff out there. But the MFG concept is that you are going above and beyond. You are providing some of the best valuable material that you, you know, it's the most incredible free gift ever. So when you see, oh my goodness, they're giving us this, this, this and this. And wait a minute, it's free? That's amazing. And what that does is, you know, especially if you've read something like dot com secrets, it's, you give somebody a free gift like that. They're blown away and they're curious and they just jump in and they want to reciprocate, right? Yeah. I love some of the principles that they talk about in dot com secrets where they talk about, you know, giving the free gift offer. And then somebody is going to want to give something back, right? Or maybe talking about some of the different elements on the page. For example, the headlines, that has to raise people's pain points, right? And really identify where people are struggling. Adding testimonials on a page. That's something that provides social proof and makes it so that people see, oh, wow, this and this and this company are using this. Or this, this person has said this is a wonderful membership area. So it's really fascinating. And I can just see the gears working on all of our ambassadors right now. They're just working away and it's so cool. Yeah, really dancing a little bit. You've had a bit of a head start, right? But we'll start the clock now. And where would you go if this just landed on and the guy was like, look, it's unlimited amount of money, right? I don't care what it costs. Do something. Dance like he'd need that money to pay me to do that. You know, you save people in reverse relationship to the amount of time you cause them to get it done in. So an hour that's a million dollars. A million dollars. It's a pretend million, right? It's a pretend million. Give me a month and a thousand bucks. Yeah, big difference. But is it possible if you if you walk up in the morning and said, I know I've got an amazing company and I've just read the linchpin book to get something at least in draft on a clip from those page within an hour. I think it is. And I challenge you guys to have some fun with this and see what we can do in 60 minutes with AI your imagination and an offer for drawn enthusiast that involves a Mifki. What do you think you guys are am I crazy? I think that it's it's easily possible with ClickFunnels 2.0 in the fact of maybe I shouldn't say this. Maybe I'm tipping my hand a little bit with having pages that you just have to customize. I mean, templates you mean. Yeah. No, no, no, not templates pages you have already built. Oh, well, OK. It is easy. You could already perhaps have a page that might have been built for something that you could customize, but I can see people moving and drawing and doing stuff. And, and you're going to have a go at this. Oh, I don't know. Let's go. Come on. I don't know if I'm ready for it. It will look like a kindergarten or made the page. So you're saying it'll be better than mine. OK, great. So I think that Carlos is in the chat saying templates and still have to have something of value that people want right Cheryl saying so it's still got to be in keeping with the brief. Terror's Live and Navneets Live, Brandon saying member only competitions. The stuff that we can do. Everyone's getting crazy about this right. And I'm going to come around to everybody give you a little minute to kind of focus on this. If you want to turn your audio off so you don't listen to Andy and I talking as we move through. But I know that things are going to start to happen because I can see you typing and your brains are wearing and you're writing things down already. And I'm already thinking of stuff. The fact that you've got a I as well to help. It's quite a cool time to be doing things like this. And with things like chat GPT and things like mid journey or other image creation software, you can get cool logos and graphics and pictures and bits and pieces for your funnel real quickly. We've still got to kind of come up with an offer. What would somebody want in the drawn membership and what could you use as the most incredible gift without going broke in the process is like, hey, there's $1000 drawn. Well, that's not feasible. Right. I don't give away my thoughts too much. But as we move in a few minutes, I want to kind of come around and find out what everybody's thinking. And if you want to share screens, you can load them up at the bottom and I'll bring the screens in. And if this works and it's fun, we'll do it again. And if it doesn't work and it's horrible, we'll never do it again. And we'll delete the video. Right. Does it sound like a plan? And Andy's drawn the club says Carlos. And that sounds fun. I'm not sharing my screen. I'm not sharing my screen. It's surprise at the end. The stuff happening though. Right. So it was like at the end, it's like, ah, you got 448 minutes. And where would you even start? Yeah. So where would I start? So myself, I'm not a, I wouldn't consider myself a funnel expert, but I've seen a lot of funnels. I've seen a lot of different sites and campaigns in my career. And, um, and if I was someone, if I had the drone membership, I think one of the most, just a couple of ideas for some really valuable things and someone that has a drone myself, I would say some type of drone maintenance guide, like a PDF, that would be awesome because I have, if you've ever had your drone come up with some kind of weird issue, it does happen often. And, and so something like that, some type of drone maintenance guide or even like drone repair, basic drone repair guide. Ooh, that would be amazing. And as someone that has, that loves drones too, that in fact, this is a few minutes before we started this, we were kind of coming up with me and Danny, we're kind of coming up with the idea and what, what, what, what do we want to present for the ambassadors to build, right? And this was my idea of the drone. So I can't wait to see what the ambassadors are building right now. But yeah, the other ideas, I must say, didn't pass go. We arrived at drones, but this is Andy's doing, right? Right. This is literally two minutes before we came on. We said, Andy, give us an idea, give us a concept to see how much can we actually accomplish. Knowing what we know, based on what we've been taught and what we've seen and what we've got available to us. Because if you accomplish something in a week, you know, that's a big thing, right? It's like, whoa, I've turned an idea into a page and a business. Is it viable? I'm not sure we can go and run $10,000 worth of traffic to it. But it's the, the thinking and the process that I want to try and unpick with folks. And I'll give you a little bit longer to do that. I'm also doing something myself at the same time, which hopefully I can do and talk, which adds an extra level to it. But what would the club look like? What would the gift look like? And then how do you layer that on a page in a quick way so that anybody looking at it would understand what am I purchasing here and what am I getting into? That's kind of where my mind goes. And we've already talked about templates where he's got a surprise for us. Dan's never been so quiet on a live. There's a period of thought going on. Is there going to be even chance, but Madison's going to make a video. I don't know where this is going. And what's, what's the thinking after that initial few minutes, Madison? She's gone. I had to get to the right screen. I thought it was muted. So, um, yeah, I have some, obviously, uh, we all come with our own expertise, right? So I know, and we'll see if Danny and I get to the same spot with this. I know what works for us and for our business and for our customers. And so this is kind of just shaping the approach that I have to it. So there's already some, obviously knowledge of the kind of funnel or the kind of thought you would do. And how this would, would work for you. Really what's in the, what's on the pad? You draw any clicking? I can't see what's going on down there. He was writing a bunch of stuff, right? We talking to. Really? Now it's time. Everything's done. Next step is copy. The car, when the copy gets done, we're going to get physically files. Oh, so really he's got a concept. James has just joined us because I mentioned Mifki and he's like in the middle of the town. And somewhere and like no laptop available. Maybe he has James is. Yeah, I know a lot actually. I don't have a laptop. Nice. Is it possible to invent some Mifki concept for a crazy drone company? In that wants some kind of monthly subscription in the next 40 minutes. While you're in there though. Yeah, it's always an option to invent a Mifki. Is it, is stop what he's doing in the middle of town. Join us by satellite link to take part in this right now. And do it, you know, what can you throw together? You've got your laptop and you've got internet and you've got AI. Well, what's the concept concept? I'll repeat for anybody who's just joined us and for James benefit, right? So rewind clients just walked in. You see this. He's got a drone company that sells crazy drones. He's heard about this Mifki off Russell Brunson and a guy called James. And he wants a Mifki concept that would get people to sign up to his monthly membership. He's a drone enthusiast club. You following? Yeah, I think that you ship a box like, you know, when there's drone races, they have these like gates that you go through. I want you to build it. Yeah, yeah, you could, you could have this like marketing gates and things so that, you know, a drone would probably be too much money. No, you don't give him a drone. He's got stuff he can give. But what would you do with this brief if you had an hour and you compete in against these guys, literally now live on the show with click funnels, AI and your imagination? Yeah, I'd, I'd ask the AI what the customer really wants. I would define the avatar as a customer with what it wants and then build out some headlines and images from that. I'm literally asking you to do it. I'm like, Oh God right now. I don't know. Yeah, that's what, that's what we said, James. Can I, can I jump in here? Cause I'm having all kinds of computer problems. So I don't think I'm going to get much of a jump. So can I just throw some ideas of what you could throw into a MFK? Yes, of course. Because the first thing I thought of immediately was because you said there's, they have all kinds of different drones. So why not the drone of the month club? So every month you send them a drone kit and they put it together with their kids. I mean, that's the simplest one to start with. But then you also give them the ability to buy all kinds of different accessories to go along with these drones or, you know, build their own hybrid monster creation of a drone. And so you got all kinds of ability there to send them all kinds of sell them all kinds of physical products. But then I was also thinking, and what James said there about the racing, I guess I've never really heard of that before, but I've seen airplane racing. And you're right. There's some sort of cones or something on the ground that the airplanes have to race around. So why not? Similar kind of thing is, I don't know how they do it tracking beacons. They do it with GPS. However they would do it. I would guess GPS because I know, I know I've seen on some of the TV shows that there are certain areas of you fly your drone up to. It'll get to there and boom, it'll like basically send it a signal to come back to its base because you were trying to fly over a government installation or something. Which they could have used that football game last night. But the couple other things I was thinking of is, Yeah, you ever see where they fly them in massive formations? You especially saw this over in China, I think for the Olympics or something. You could give them the programming for that. So okay, over the last 12 months, we just gave you 12 different drones. Now we're going to give you the software that is going to allow them to fly in formation. And then also to have the light shows going on with it as well. And then of course we can get really high tech and we put rocket launchers and flamethrowers and things like that on them. And then it gets really cool. What else did I have here? Yeah, you could have synchronized flying, make different patterns, all that kind of stuff. But yeah, I really like the arms race factor in this here too. Get some weapons out there. Turn them into a weapons platform. We're ready to go. Is that a thing? Yeah, well, hey, yeah, actually, look at our military, they're flying drones and they can do some nasty stuff. Well, quite a lot. I prefer the light show. Oh, it's a light show. The light show, right? So these ideas, definitely. And I know you, you computer will sort itself out then you're under even more pressure. Yeah. It's tough going on. It's tough going on. The client doesn't want to hear excuses. He's got a bag of money. I had a real client. You look quite a million dollars. I'm busy on this like Andy, what's your thoughts? Yeah, well, while everybody's working away, I mean, I love those, those ideas that you had Dan, some amazing, amazing ideas and there's different, you can even have in the membership, you can have different levels to right. For example, there might be a level for beginners. But then there's also, you know, there's so many things that people do with drones, like there's the drone swarms and the light shows and, and things like that. And, and it is true that there's, there's laws, right? You got to, you got to obey a lot of the laws because just like Dan said, if you try to get too close to a stadium, or for example, where I'm from, if you get too close to Disneyland, you're in big trouble. Okay, your drone is going to shut down and is going to start coming back and you get in big trouble, right? You could get fined. So that's also another thing you can have a level for the different laws and making sure that people are complying and learning about the different laws. There's another level of laws for drones for people that are using drones for commercial purposes, because there's people that sell their footage, right? They'll take a video and you've seen some of the like the beautiful, beautiful videos that, you know, drones can produce these days. It's amazing. And so, but if you're going to sell your, your videos, you got to get a different license. You got to get a commercial license and you got to go through a course. And guess what? It would be even cool to offer some type of course for commercial licenses for drone users as well. So lots of really great ideas here. And I mean, there's, yeah. And the cool thing is that we, when we first described, we left it a little bit broad. We're kind of, you know, going into the details right now, but I'm excited to see what people thought of and like, you know, just the different things that, that our ambassadors here are going to come up with. So really exciting. Well, just on your point, Andy, about using it for commercial purposes, my neighbor, talking to him a couple of years ago, and he was running a company at the time of drones. And what they did is, you know how you got the big high tension power lines. They used to have to fly helicopters with men in them out to look at these high power lines. Well, now they just use drones. And that's what his company did is they just fly right through there with the drones and send back the footage to APS. That's what you're talking about. Right. The advancement of technology right now in, you know, obviously we're talking about all this crazy stuff with drones, but if you think about AI and the things are going on, you know, in click funnels, 10, 15 years ago, the fact of, hey, let's turn an idea into, you know, a concept and then get it on the internet. That is not a job you could do in one hour, right? That would never have happened. You really take your months. And I guess this is one of the cool things about the world that we're at right now and click funnels and all the stuff that we were using on a daily basis is that you can take these things and you literally can. Maybe it's going to take a little bit longer than an hour or maybe do something for fun. But you can literally take your idea and turn it into a concept and actually get a minimum viable product in a very short period of time that people could potentially start to give you money for. And then you've got the ability to use things like short form video or tick tock or reels or whatever it is to get that out there real quick. You've got things like Facebook ads. All of this stuff would have just been a crazy notion. And now we've got this stuff at our fingertips. It's definitely the time to be considering creating something online, right? And, you know, we live and breathe this stuff. What's everybody's thoughts on that? And, you know, what were you at with that kind of notion in, you know, your business, your clients business, give us a little bit of around that, you guys. Yes, how's that? Everybody's like stuck in the computer. James, what's your thoughts? I found out about you, but no, we're good. We're good. No, it's ridiculous. The ability to use AI. Like I've told this story before, like I did a funnel that was for semi-gluteide, this like weight loss injection thing. I've never heard of before. And I wrote all the copy for it using AI and the client said their critique was like, yeah, the font is too small. Oh, man. Wait, I'm sorry. What was the critique? The font was too small. That was it. Yeah, meaning that the copy was fine. The copy was fine. I had no idea what this concept was. I used AI, a generated copy and was able to deliver a product that was so good enough that the client didn't even notice. I didn't know what the hell I was talking about. Yeah. So the only criticism they had was that the font was too small and that's something like super to fit. Exactly. Yes. Yes. What's going on on the computer of Madison and Riddie right now? Is this stuff happening? Have we got ideas where we are? We don't have enough screens and probably enough computing power. Have you got enough more than you can chew? How much time do we have? Who's first? How much time do we have? How much time do we have? You've got 40 minutes. 40 minutes. Oh, perfect. So we've got concept done, we've got branding done, we've got images done, we've got logo done and now we are on to copying. Riddie, do you think it's something that we can see right now or did you want to wait till the end? I can show you a logo. Okay, cool. Nobody said anything about a logo. You're killing it. I don't know, hold on, hold on. Because if I show my copy it will reveal the whole idea. Don't you have to give it away? I don't want to. You know what, it's great and you will have fun. You'll be amazed with the thing I'll get you, get the interview. It will get in trouble for being better than Funnel Games, right? The pressure is on you guys and in a week it's an hour. Madison, what's going on in the crazy world of AI right now? Like four or five different things. There is, I mean it's crazy and that's the hard part about it is not biting off more than you can chew. And trying to get, like that's the thing with AI, right? Like you can have it, like I can have something being done over here on this screen, the copy being written for AI and these other things going in the background and it's like, you know, three people. Yeah. Would you have been, you know, six months, 12 months ago, would this even be possible? I'd still be scrolling through stock video or stock photos trying to find a logo. Like easily for like another like hour or two. So it's definitely, you know, the right time to be bringing your ideas to fruition. What's the chat room saying, Andy? What's going on in the chat right now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, we got, we have a bunch of people that are commenting right now. Looks like Tara Tang is here. Hey, Tara. Yeah, also Carlos, who's on our team. He's a ClickFunnels member. Hey, Carlos. How come Carlos isn't on this call with us? He's got the link. He's got the link. He's got the link. Carlos, if you want to join, actually, I think we're six, I think six is the limit. I could do 10. Oh, we could do 10. So Carlos, if you want to jump in. Oh, don't subject Carlos to this. Cheryl, Cheryl, I think when we were talking about the MIFKIS, she, she mentioned, still have to have something of value that people want. Yes. So, so true. And then we had a question. We had something about, oh, another comment from Cheryl. This is an idea that when we were talking about the different MIFKIS that you can, you can, you can present. She said, a chance to win a contract for a year drone business, photography, hunters, sport events, real estate, tourism. That would be really cool. So yeah, we got a bunch of people visiting us right now in the comments. Thank you so much. And what do you think so far? How would you, if you were in this contest right now, this race, how would you structure your MIFKIS? Do you have some more ideas? Is there anything that you want to maybe throw out there? Love to hear. And people in the, in the comments or people on the, on the video? On the comments too. But anybody else too? Yeah. I think there's, there's lots of stuff going on right now. And I'm like, oh man, I've just got another idea and another idea. This is definitely something that folks should sort of like try, I think, and like open up your click-funnels account, go chat GPT. You know that chat GPT can actually create images now, right? And it can also browse the web, which is crazy. And you can even use it to create your own, like, GPTs, which is even crazier. We can't get into that right now. But if you do a little bit of research and any idea can become possible as long as you don't corrupt the framework and you try and stick to, you know, what you've learned in the linchpin book. You've learned in dot com secrets, expert secrets, because a lot of these things are, you know, just the tool to get the idea and turn the idea into money, right? So you can go and try and do something and test yourself. So right in the next two hours, I'm going to make a concept. I'm going to bring this thing to life, at least even if that's just for your own viewing pleasure and your own testing of your abilities. It's an exercise that everybody should kind of go out there and try at least, you know, do it on a weekend or whatever, right? Yeah, exactly. I mean, using AI is going to be pretty mainstream very soon. But if you're one of the early adopters and learn how to use the tools, number one, it can make you a lot of money in your own business. Okay, if you're an agency, wow, I mean, of course you're going to use AI, right? Because this is just going to make your workflows much faster, not workflows and click funnels 2.0. I mean, like your workflow in general, it's just going to make things much easier. It's so efficient. Just like Danny was mentioning, and Danny showed me this the other day, it was really cool, but with chat, chat, GBT, you can upload your own documents and it will learn your style, like documents that you've written in the past, and it will learn your style and write things in your style. That is so cool. It is indeed. And people are like creating their own personas and assistants using AI right now, deploying them in the business. We've seen this with newsletters and all sorts of crazy things that people are doing right now. And this is an amazing time to learn a little bit of something using click funnels, using AI, using some imagination and bring an idea to life. I can't wait to see what people are going to do and what people are doing. You see James, he's like, oh, there's like Dan's got stuff going on. Really says she has a logo and copy and all these things. I've certainly got a page and I've got a concept and I'm still talking and at the same time. But if within the next sort of 25, 30 minutes, four people, five people can all put together a concept into click funnels and prevent it in a way that's half viable in an hour, right? What could you do in a week or a month or a, you know, three months, whatever. Oh, totally. I mean, you can totally spend a lot more time, first of all, thinking about thinking about the headline, the copy, your strategy in general, using something like, you know, like Garoo to test out your funnel or use other types of tools. I know that I know that right now, Dan even mentioned something about mid journey. So I know that he's using mid journey right now. And you'll, if you had more time, you'd be able to spend a lot more into the thought process and also into the testing process. You'd be able to interact with your customer a little bit more and say, Hey, is this, it might go in in the right direction. So I know that this is not pretty, this is normal and it's kind of fun watching our ambassadors, you know, racing and their thought like just watching all the gears going in. They're really diving in right now. So this is really exciting. Just like you said, Danny, to see what they're going to be coming up with. And there's no prize. We're not giving away a prize. There is a prize. There is a prize. It's Danny's special prize. You keep working. I'll figure something out. I want to see it right. It's got to be prize worthy. Right. I'm sure we can, we have some swikes somewhere. I'm sure. Let's see what we can come up with all the prizes. We do this again. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord. It's going to be a surprise, right? Right. Have you guys ever tried using Claude? No. It's an AI. I think it was Catherine Jones. I first heard mentioned it. And in, in YouTube, you can attach, I think it's called glass. There's an extension for Chrome. It's called glass. And it works in YouTube. And you can put in chat GPT or Claude or both. And I found actually that Claude works better in there. So what it'll do is it'll transcribe your transcribe your video. And then it will. It'll give you a summary of it and bullet points and whatever you want. You can tell it all to do it in one click and boom, it pops it out. That's pretty cool, right? Yeah. Yeah. And I think Madison's doing something like that, aren't you? Who's, everyone's like, I have, remember it came one day to, to the geek out call and I'm like, man, if I could only figure out how to get things from YouTube and they're like, you've been in Monster Land too long. And they told me all about it. It's like, the possibilities are endless, right? And if you could get something viable online using all of this crazy technology, like, what would it mean if you had your idea ready in a week? What would the impact be? Anybody who's watching or, you know, thinking, oh, man, these guys are crazy. They're actually building stuff right now on the, in like an hour with like no notice of what any of this stuff is going to be. We didn't even know. I just said, Andy, give me an idea. Right? We absolutely know, like, idea what this was going to be at all until we joined the call and we've been in meetings all day. Right? So it's like, the possibilities are endless, but what would it mean for your business if you could just get something online in a week, two weeks, never mind an hour, right? If you do it in an hour, that's probably the coolest thing ever. Let us know in the comments that we're interested to know. I know what it means to me and my family. We can do it in hours because... She's ready. Ready? Really, really talk to us. Fighting talk this week. We can do it in hours because like, oh, we are all magic. No, I'm kidding. We have just, we have just spent too much time learning. That's why. That was just going to say that. Yeah. Yeah. Just for the record, really, how many hours of Russell Brunson content have you consumed? It's now 3000. 3000. Oh my goodness. That's amazing. I have no idea how many hours of content I've consumed. Let us know in the chat how many hours of content have you consumed to help you grow your business, right? That's also an important thing that you keep consuming content. You keep learning stuff, but then you've got to put it into action. So, having loads of books, you've got to read them. You've got to implement this stuff, right? And implementation is probably the key. James, what's your thoughts? What you're doing? Are you working on some stuff? Things are going crazy over there in the middle of the town. I'm definitely working on some stuff to be continued. I'll send you a link and you can show it. Because my internet is crap. Oh yeah, I'm working on something. Keep going. Keep going. I want to see it. I want to see it. Tara Tang says, yes, to have your abilities is priceless. A MIFGI for your combined knowledge is priceless. So yeah, I mean, the people that we have here, they are ambassadors. This is what they do every day. And so yeah, somebody like Ritty could do this in a couple of hours, something really, really good. And like any of our ambassadors, to have your MIFGI and to have something ready to go, oh my goodness, that is so valuable and so priceless. And being able to apply these concepts is something that if a business just learns a few of these things, they're going to add money to the bottom line, right? And to be able to generate new ways of operating in a world that's like super competitive. You've got competitors everywhere, but not all of the competitors understand this stuff. So you're kind of like getting into the world of click funnels and the lynch pain and Russell Brunson's teaching. That's, man, every time I give Russell money, I make loads of money, right? So it's weird, but this thing seems to happen and that's like income disclaimer. This results are not typical. But if you just figured out a few of these things and tried to apply them slowly in your business, surely you're going to see a shift because Andy, every time we speak to someone, they go, oh, man, I did that thing. And this happened. What's everybody's thoughts on that as I render this video? I haven't even gotten to rendering a video yet. You've got 20 minutes to saw. Everyone's panicking now. Is it panic attack? 20 minutes. 20, 25, maybe. I'm done with my proof of concept. How's that sound? You're rocking. It'd be a proof of concept. It can really suck. It's allowed, but it's the taking part that counts right now. Participation trophy. That's an idea. Yeah, the participation trophy. And hopefully it comes to life and it kind of illustrates what is, you know, possible. What is possible? Dan works very, very quickly. So yeah, he's pretty much got most of it down right now. I wouldn't go that far. But going on what you were talking about, Danny, about putting your knowledge into action so important. I mean, I've known many people that even outside of what we're talking about right now, there's, you know, I've known people that could tell you they can explain details of, you know, something, but they haven't actually done it. And to not put your knowledge into action is such a shame. If you've read the trilogy series, if you've read the Lynch, Lynch pin book or any of Russell Brunson's other books, all you got to do is take steps every day. And soon, because I know that it can be overwhelming sometimes sometimes you don't know where to start right you open up, click funnels and you're not even sure where to start. Should you start with a template? Should you start with a blank page? But taking small steps and putting that knowledge into action so, so important. And eventually you'll, if you do it often enough, you'll be like ready and, you know, be able to do it in just a few hours. That's the hope. And we want to see these things come to life real quick. And if you can get it on to life and a piece of paper real quick and you're able to do that, you'll be able to bring it to life online. And then you can go out there and you can test it. And then once you test it, you know, whether it's worth like investing in, right? Because you can get instant traffic these days with ads, which is like very cool. You don't have to wait for the radio advertisements to be published. So I dropped, I dropped the live link into the, into our personal, what do you call it, private chat here if you guys, if Andy or Danny, you want to show it. I think Danny's working so maybe Andy can show it. Sure. It's, you know, because otherwise if we get up against the end, we're not all going to be able to share. So I'll go first. Yeah. So Dan's got something already. And you want to bring that up, Andy, and I'll share up the screen. He has to make sure it's appropriate first. Yeah. Come on. It might, it might not be appropriate, right? It's T rated. Keep working on it. Keep going. Keep making it look good. And do what you can. Dan's probably got some like crazy cord or something that he's, he's adding to this that no. No, no, no, you didn't have time for that. Anything's possible, right? In this, this crazy world of click follows. I'm bringing this thing up, Andy, checking it over the, the, the judges are. Let's bring it up. Checking these things over, right? Well, yeah, I can explain very, very quickly. We'll scroll up the top of the page because I only did the first couple of seconds. So, um, well, see actually on my coat, because this is so squished down, you have to scroll down a little bit to see the big drone circling below it. Well, you got a drone cycle. Oh man. So it's like this. I go back up on the page first. So the top headline here is spy on your coworkers with the latest drone spying technology. So I just typed that in. I put it into the AI in click funnels. And then it's been out to that paragraph below it, which I haven't really read. But it's just that quickly it spits it out after I gave it a headline I was working on. I didn't tell it to rewrite the headline. It just gave me this paragraph. And so then if you scroll down, then you got the animated GIF. That's all that is. And then here I put in, I saw this image here and it's pretty cool. If you watch this, it folds up and lands in your hand or something. I don't know. And so I said a personal drone in the palm of your hand took that, put it into the AI inside of click funnels. And then I put it in the text where I did the AI in here and it spit out that paragraph below it. And I just broke it up into sentences to make it a little easier to read. And then if you go down to the next one, I just thought, oh, use this for your neighbors. So your neighbors will never sleep again. So again, took the headline, dropped it into click funnels, AI, and it spit out that text. And again, I just found that image online. So obviously don't use images. You don't have copyrights too. We're just doing this for fun and entertainment. And no children or rabbits were hurt in this experiment. And so then the last one that I managed to get done here is start your own drone business. And all I did was Google real quick is like, what can you do with the drone? And they're like, ooh, drone selfies and drone racing. And then this girl here is clearly having a drone party. So that's all I got done. Awesome, awesome. Looks good. Yeah, the rest was just and and just to let you know, the rest of this here was just a boilerplate template. I pulled out a click form was I just saw that building and I thought, ooh, yeah, drones spying on your coworkers. And I went from there. And literally in 30 minutes or 35 minutes, you've got a bunch of stuff going on there that would, you know, some folks are going to be like taking a long time to put together that. Yeah, I mean, the thing with the AI is you can drop in a headline like that. It can spit out a bunch of stuff and you just go, OK, half of this works. The other half doesn't work. I can rewrite this sentence a little bit and boom, we the other night Susan Lennardson and I were working on a script for a video that we had Madison make for our entry into the funnel games. And that's exactly what we did is we had a concept of what we wanted. And we spit out some AI. I don't know what Susan used for that. And we massaged it and rewrote it. And within an hour or so, I was I was editing video based off of what we had just created with the AI. And then we send it over to Madison and she worked tirelessly for 48 hours straight in the six hour period and got it done for us. And someday maybe she'll show it to people like maybe maybe today. Maybe. Maybe. But out on the show, some other show, maybe today. Maybe who knows another show coming. It's like, look, in less than an hour, Dan's created that and the stuff on the page online using click funnels. Looks great. Here's the other thing. So I use somebody else's image. Well, okay, so that gets me going. So now I got to make sure I have an image in the background that I have the legal rights to use. Yes. Because this came as a click funnels template, I would guess I have the rights to use that you guys can correct me if I'm wrong. But if you don't have that, just mock something up, put something in there. And then after the fact you come back in, you find a you find an image that you paid for or you got somewhere where there's no royalty issues or anything. You can just edit yourself using something like mid journey. So just get something on the page so you got something to look at. Yeah, that's that's key. Right. And I think once you can visualize some stuff, you're able to work with it a lot better. And it's so important if you've got an idea. You don't want to be somebody who sat there going, oh, one day I'm going to launch this thing. And in a minute, three or four more people are going to launch the thing. Right. And you've got an idea. You've got a concept. And then you kind of in business. I always think when you've got your logo, you've got your your concept, you know, you're actually taking action and moving in your business. That's a very cool thing. And otherwise it's just an idea and it is sort of one day, one day maybe I'll do this one day maybe I'll do that right. It's like, now is that day. I think that in ClickFunnels and a bit of AI and some imagination, Dan's put this cool thing together in a short period of time. That's like amazing. And I know he's probably going to still be working on it on the on the like his live page. And let's see where this gets to you literally got funnel hackers you've got 15 minutes left to wow everybody with what you can achieve with ClickFunnels AI and imagination for the drone guy. And then hopefully this is going to pop off and everyone's going to love it and it was going to open up ClickFunnels tonight. If they don't have ClickFunnels, they're going to get a trial and they're going to go and practice from AI stuff. And then by Monday people have got a minimum viable product. That'd be like the coolest thing ever. Right. What's what's the chat saying, Andy? Yeah, so we got we got some more stuff in the chat and oops. Let me see. We have someone says, Hey, JJ Barrett, the purpose of these lives is teaching ClickFunnels 2.0 to build sales funnels for online businesses. So looks like JJ is here and visiting and kind of wants to know what we're what we're up to. And JJ, if you didn't get to see us in the beginning, these are ambassadors and they're building a Mifki concept. They're building a page with the Mifki most incredible free gift ever. And they're doing it in an hour. So it's kind of like a little race. In fact, we have a big giant race that's going on right now. Today is the last day. It's called funnel games. And that's really exciting. And actually, some of these ambassadors are going were in that funnel games. So we might even see them later again today. Indeed. And so many amazing entries to funnel games. If you've not seen what's been going on, then there are yours on the ClickFunnels official page. I think some have been streamed into this group and pinned to the top and you can kind of follow along the 15 minutes a day. I just started out with a brief and then people went away and built funnels real quick and then they whittled it down from a bunch of funnels to 10 funnels. And now I think we're in the top four. And this is going to be pretty cool. So are the announcing the winner later or is that going to run a little bit longer? Where are we up to with that? I need to plug in and catch the later. I think they're going to be announcing the winner. I think what it is today, yeah, today is getting cut down to the final two. Yes. And so we got the, we had the ability to do any little final tweaks that we wanted last night. We only changed a couple of little very minor things. And then so they're going to narrow it down to the two today. And then if we're one of those top two or whoever is one of those top twos, they can put in a modified version if they want. And then I don't know if they're going to just do one more 24 hour period of running ads or if it goes all weekend. I have no idea. So they literally are running ads to these pages though, right? It's not like we're judging this stuff. It's like we're just trying to get the traffic real people to real pages with real conversion results. And the person who got the highest conversion is ultimately going to be crowned as the funnel hacking king, right? I guess, or a queen champion. I don't know what we get, but. And if you've noticed the ads on the No BS newsletter have drastically increased. Yeah, I have them all over my Facebook feed. There's ads and the multiplayer. As they say, and I know that people getting super excited about this. It was great feedback about this. And it's a pleasure to see everybody come competing. And it's awesome to see this building up. And I think just like we've got here with the pressures on and people creating stuff and everyone's going crazy. It's been an experience. Because the screens are going off over here right now. Everyone's like losing the mind. Are we going to have something in the next 15 minutes? You guys ready? I just dropped a link. I just dropped a link. James is dropping links. Yes. So let me go ahead and bring up James's link. All right, here we go. It's in there, Danny, if you want to bring that up. Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Right. Talk us through this. I mean, it's self-explanatory. You match the skies with exclusive drone deliveries every month. Who doesn't want that? I generated the images with the journey. I use the ClickFunnels template for the majority of the stuff. The guy was there. Danny's chat GPT for all the copy. Awesome. Pretty cool. So we're actually, this is almost like an about a section that introduces the guy behind the business. Okay. And then we have a list of what people get in the drone kit subscription. So look at all this. My goodness, a huge stack. Huge stack of stuff. They got the button again. And we got some testimonials. Pretty cool. James, did you, how did you get these images? You know, and by the way, of course, you know, right now, because of time, these are not real people and these are not real pages, but, but how did you get these, these photos? Those are in the ClickFunnels to VSL template. Gotcha. Okay. So they're already there. Very cool. Going through the list of values here. This is like crazy stuff, right? Very cool, James. So this is like, you know, not far off of being viable, everything that we've seen so far. And we've picked a crazy topic, right? Most people are selling like some information product to whatever it is. The people in the chat think that this is like possible if you, you know, put a little bit more thought into what you're trying to do, because these are amazing and the AI is amazing and the templates are amazing. And if you saw that online, would you be tempted is the question, right? This is, this is fantastic work, James. And obviously, Lynch, Payne, Mifke, all of these things are your bag, right? And is this, is this something you want to do again? Is this, is this crazy? But look at this is some of what you'll get from the drone kit subscriptions. Oh man, this is awesome. Each of our ambassadors and you know, everybody that is a funnel builder has their own style and it's really cool to see, you know, see just the different approach. I love to do this again with some more, some more bandwidth, maybe. Totally, totally. But yeah, it's really cool to see the difference between, you know, Dan's approach and then seeing James's approach here. Very cool stuff. It's looking good. It's looking good. Looking really good. Yeah. Are we on track to have something like 10 minutes at the most and then we're off over time, right? So we started a little bit late. Is people in the chat enjoying this? Is it if we put a little bit more thought into it? Maybe folks in the chat could suggest some of the topics that we literally went and created some stuff because it might be, hey, we need a sales page. You know, we want this thing. We want that thing. You know, what is the thing that folks want right now and then maybe our ambassadors could jump on and create some stuff live to show you the possibilities with ClickFunnels AI or imagination or whatever else it is that you're trying to do because I know what's possible with this stuff. But unless you see it happening in like almost in real time, then you might struggle to believe it's possible. And if you struggle into believe it's possible, you might never do it. And that's where the danger rests, I think, because if people don't think something's possible and they never do it, that's, I don't know, is it a big bunch of regrets? Is it like, you just, they'll never know. I don't know. I don't know, but it's for me, it's so important that if you've got an idea and you've got a dream, especially if that involves helping people, then you need to go and give it a try. And I wonder how many folks are like out there right now, we've got the most amazing idea and they'll just never try. That's like, sad to me, right? How do we encourage that in the world? ClickFunnels is like the way for me because it enables you to get it up on the internet real quick and go to all this teaching and training and learning and more. But the main thing that drives all of this stuff is you, right? And being able to go out there and do this stuff and get it on the internet. What are your thoughts on that? And we've been one hour since we started, 15 minutes left at the most or even less. Can I share my screen real quick? Because you wanted some custom code put in here and it's not fully coded, but I'll just, just to make you happy, Danny. Let me share my screen. Let me just, let me just do the entire screen, that'll be fine. So it's nothing, it's nothing that great, but I, It's something right? I took my, can you see my screen now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so what I did is I took one of these, I took one of the drones and put it inside of this, whatever this is, a shopping mall or library or whatever this thing is. That's all I did. I just, I just thought it was funny. It actually looks decent. Because before it was just the drone without the background, right? Well, yeah, it was just, yeah, it was an image and it's a drone and I put the drone now inside of the image. I love the idea of spying on your coworkers. And the title that you, the description underneath the headline, if you, can you read it? It's kind of small, but is it hilarious, especially the last part? Yeah, well, as soon as I saw this building, I thought, well, that looks like some sort of government building to me. So spy on your coworkers with the latest drone spying technology, spy on your coworkers discreetly and efficiently with the latest drone spying technology is sophisticated, unobtrusive and equipped with state of the art surveillance features that provide seamless and real time monitoring capabilities. Get the definitive edge in office politics and stay ahead of the game. There you go. Definitive edge. Get those pictures of people doing stuff they shouldn't do. Can you see, can you see the entire picture that I have here now with the drone below it? Yes. Or is that cut off? Okay. I've got a drone going around on this on the screen in the middle. Yeah, yeah, that makes that was because when you were showing it, Danny was only coming down to right above the drone. I quite have the same effect of the drone flying over as you scroll up on the page. But the facts of what you've achieved in, you know, almost no time is crazy, right? Yeah. And, you know, here, a personal drone in the palm of your hand. Now, like I said, I didn't read any of this stuff. So here introducing a personal drone that fits right in the palm of your hand. There's tiny technological marvel is a game changer designed for convenience and functionality. It's powerful, easy to operate and so compact that it can go wherever you go. It's like carrying a personal flying camera with you. I mean, come on. That doesn't suck. I'm convinced. Yeah. I saw that image. I was like, oh, that is so cool. All right, I will relinquish the screen here if I can relinquish the screen. We're coming into the lecture. Last five minutes. Thank you. The link. Right. Do you want to share the screen video? You ever said you've sent us a link? What have you got? I can share my screen. If you want to share your screen, more than welcome. Why not? It would also show. There you go. All right, let's have a look. Ready? Let's stage. Try the drone ship. Looking good. Talking. The ownership name. Okay. So this is the membership for drone enthusiasts who loves to play with drone, loves to do work with drone. This is for them. And this is the place where they can learn from the experts. They can learn the social media and all the hold off. I have to read that again. Okay. There are courses that teaches them how to use the drone and use it at the best capacity, the tricks techniques, and there is a job board or the place where they can get a gig jobs and those kind of things. So basically, take your drone passion and turn it into your business or life or profession. That's what drone ownership is. This is crazy, right? So you've got this amazing website that's been put together and you've even got an order form on there, right? Yeah. Products are there. Just order form. You could literally though in three minutes you could even add the product. You've got three minutes if you want to finish it off. Yes. You can see we have over bits. Yeah, I'm fine. It's okay. Are people seeing where the possibilities are with what you've got available inside of ClickFunnels right now? And no AI has been used in here. No way. No way. No AI has been used. No nothing. Yeah. From the range. Free big app that I have premium off. Yeah. Image from those free big apps. That's all. So I'm hoping that this work at my side and hoping that I've done. The image is stupid. I did have time to reduce the size of it. It takes some time. Hoping that it's, you know, adding these last little bits and pieces, but you've got an amazing page there with the background. You've got a drone up there. You've got a concept and you've done that in literally one hour, six minutes we've been on this live. Right. And if you had longer really, what would you add to this page? I would add a longer copy and more stuff that like making it really live. This is just a concept page, but if I really want to sell something like this, it would need some, it would need a long sales page. Yeah. And you want you to go for the long sales page approach. Some people may be going for videos, dance gone for animations, things flying from site. There's stuff all over the page. James, I know he's might have been cut off or if he's in the middle of the town and he managed to build a website, which was amazing. Like, if folks getting this, I think he's the, is the question, right? Is the ability to literally come up with a concept and add it to click funnels and use AI and some imagination to actually build something that's tangible in a short period of time. Oh, I think, I think there's a lot of people getting this. In fact, you can see in the comments right now, people are just going nuts. And, and the cool thing about it is, I don't know about you and probably you guys watching right now, but this gets me excited. This gets me wanting to like get into click funnels and like start building some stuff. And, and I mean, even Tara says this live has been inspiring to utilize more of the functions in click funnels because sometimes there's, there's just a lot of people that are just going to be like, I don't know, there's, there's, there's, there's so many things in click phones 2.0 that that you I haven't even used yet or I've, you know, barely touched on. So there's so many different types of tools right now it's incredible. And there's nothing wrong with that. Don't worry if you're, you know, using click funnels and you got a certain style and you have some tools that are that are that you're comfortable with. So go ahead and do that. There's no reason that you need to use something else. But if, if you want to, there's so many different abilities tools, little ticks, tips and tricks that you can do in click phones 2.0. So yeah, I'm inspired. I can't wait to get in there and start. We're going to get a chance to look at other other people. Yeah, I've got one that's like two seconds away now and we're literally approaching that last minute. Madison, what have you got? Well, mine is going to have to be shown in stages because I definitely do not have enough time to upload the video to you've actually made a video though right. Yes. Yeah. Wow. Which is cool. Which is, is like, you see, you've done a video, you've got a concept, you've got like a big bunch of stuff ready. Do you want to show, do you want to show your screen and bring this together? We'll wrap this up because we're 15 minutes over and big thanks to everybody who's supporting us. If people are enjoying show must go on. Yeah, the show must go on. Maybe we do this over two hours next time. We don't drive everybody crazy. We have like a little bit of prep time to prepare some assets. We'd also be nice if we could like get our software up and running and make sure we can actually find our login information and stuff before we start. It makes it a lot easier. Yeah. I could get into my discord account. We're trying to get into places and do a bunch of stuff. Right, Madison. Have you got the screen? Yes. Right. Let's let's see where I, where is it? Madison, right. At the stage. So my concept was something to attract somebody who is brand new into drones. So I used our lovely fishbowl funnel strategy because we know this is the best way to get leads. And so to give somebody this giant DJI package with the Maverick to which I think is currently selling on Amazon for over $1,200. Give or take. And then the MIF key part comes in, which is get a hundred extra entries when you take our skybound drone video club. And so the concept is it's not a MIF key. It's a minby. So it's the most incredible mystery box ever. So you don't know what's going to be in it. So it can have customized drone skins, which then allows us an e-commerce aspect to then sell those. We can also have extra propellers, landing pad. And my big thing was to go with like, they're called lots. So basically their color overlays for video. And then when you take the free trial to Skyward bound video drone club, it's $97 a month. You're going to get all that. You can cancel it anytime. And so basically like here's what's in the club, so on and so forth. And full disclosure, we did. I did. This is a build we did for one of our students in our monster Academy. And I just made some tweaks to it. So there's a couple of references there. But right up here is obviously going to be a video. And hopefully this works. See if it works. You'll see a screen. Minimize that one. Okay. Let's see if the sound works on this. Can we hear it? This is like the video, right? Technology meets passion. The drone club convenes. Once a month, the skies become a canvas for these pilots from beginners to veterans. All find a haven here. Remember, it's not just about flying.

I didn't have enough time to listen to it back to the real AC repeated himself a couple of times, but that's it. Oh my God. No. Oh, man. You did it in a marketing message. Wow. Well, I think that clearly shows the power of what we're doing here, right? And if anybody thinks that like click funnels, two point all doesn't allow you to do things quickly or there's some crazy bugs. I'm not running to it. In fact, I've just discovered a new feature and I don't know if it's because I've got a feature get in my account. There's been a lot because I'm fortunate like that or it's a lot for everybody, but it is like one of the coolest things ever. And I've just had to take a moment to pause and I can't tell you what it is just in case it's locked for everybody. I don't know what set everybody, but it is going to change my business. What I've seen is right. So that's like super exciting. And I've literally just added, it's not that it's not the best, but I've just added the last image. It didn't come out quite as I wanted it to to a little page that I've thrown together in the time and talks and listened and watched and all the rest of it. What do you guys think of that? I think we've been on for one hour for I said it'd be one hour 15 minutes exactly. I'm going to share the screen and bring this better show us what you did. Share the screen and hopefully it's going to work. So not exactly what I wanted, but it'll do in the time I've had. Right. So hopefully it's working. Is it working? I'm sure I'm going to see you.

Well, I got a question before you go on here. Did you just create that video? Yeah. You just created that video in the last half an hour. Yeah, I did everything that you see there in that page, the Photoshop image, the logo, the copy. Okay, I get the rest of it. But you actually created that video in the last half an hour. Well, I didn't create it. I created it, right? Yeah. Well, you hit, you told it to do it. You hit the button. I pressed it. You didn't, you didn't pull that off of YouTube. Maybe that's a better way of asking the question. You created that. Yeah, it's uploaded to my account. I don't know if I'm going to get a copyright strike and get shut down. But if anybody wants it, it's in the private chat and you can see the... Well, I just wanted to be clear on that because I wasn't sure because the first one I started playing, I thought, oh, well, that's like just a YouTube video. And then I realized you uploaded it to YouTube in that same half an hour that we were all just working on it there. Oh, I mean, that's just crazy. But let me, let me just show you, let me share my screen here because as you know, I was in the funnel games with Susan and who do I work with? I forget. Andrea. And Madison was instrumental in helping us with this. Now, my version of the site got left on the cutting room floor because the girls didn't like it because it was too dark. So did my other videos that are better than the first video? So Dan, we're in the same boat. Well, that was more of a, we ran out of time to upload the new video more than anything else. But here, let me share my screen real quick to show you my version of it. Because again, I think it's a good example of, let me just, just do, let me see, yeah, this window. I think it's a good example of what can be done. And again, we had 24 hours to do this. And so let me show my page there. So I'm not able to see you guys anymore. Can you see my page? Yes. Okay. So this is a video created by Madison. In fact, let me reload the page here because as you can see on the page, it auto plays. So we got the header up here, got a big image in the background, which is actually the same image off of the video headlines and such. And then as you scroll down, he, the video, of course, this guy scrolls up and then you get this top bit here that we, we did all this again, taking what they gave us for the original page. The control and making it all a Christmas theme. And with essentially Santa Claus talking here. So I just wanted to show people what you can do in 24 hours if you want to. Very cool. Well, we covered a lot in that right so we've literally had like 12345 funnels because James with was with us as well five funnels in two. And with crazy imagination for a business that we never had or with videos logos, Photoshop copy everything in one hour, 20 minutes maximum. That's how long we've been on the live. Should we do this again? Yes. Let's ask the chat if they want. What do you say if you write us a check? Is that what she said? Write a check. No, let's ask other people in the chat in the chat of this live live video if they want to see us doing this more. Of course, yes. Yes. So you guys can decide this like the 15 people on or whatever it is right now we've been up we've gone over time. But do you want do you want us to do this again? Let us know. Did you get value from that? Obviously we've produced a big bunch of stuff for drone businesses. So if everybody's anybody's got a drone business and you need videos and logos, you can write a check and we will of course furnish it with mine. Jack, I mean, I also take PayPal's and then most and a CH transfers. Yes, we do. I'll take crypto. I don't care. I'll take crypto. Carlos is saying every Friday and two point all funnel Fridays. That's that's that means a lot right coming from from Carlos and JJ saying that looks epic down Cheryl saying we're absorbing. Yes, more. And this wasn't pre recorded right we literally turned upon a live through an idea out that Andy invented two minutes before it went on and we did five funnels with videos copy logos download a big bunch crazy stuff or the forms I even made a product on the order form. Like all this stuff. Don't sign up to Andy's drone club because it doesn't exist, but it might. My Monday. We got the video. Yeah, Andy's got a drone right this is like free business Randy and maybe not free. Where's the million you promised us a million. So we need to get a million. Yeah, I know. Well, these ideas are worth a lot of money and and I just want to say thank you to the ambassadors. I know that you guys are busy and you took some time out of your busy schedule to jump in with us. So make sure that make sure that we you know we're thankful in the in the comments as well. And for anybody else that wants to see this if you enjoyed this. Yeah, we do this. So first of all, Danny and I go live every Monday Wednesday Friday at 10am Mountain time. Now we are hoping to have more times in addition to that. We haven't actually you know we kind of been saying it but we haven't gotten it gone into it just because we've been very busy as well. But if if you want to watch us, we do different things all the time. For example on Monday we're going to have an open Q&A you can ask us anything. Okay, and we'll probably throw in some stuff if you sometimes at first we're waiting for people to come on and we might you know just pick a topic. But it's an open Q&A. In fact, you can ask questions anytime we're live. And then next Wednesday we're having another ambassador. I think right let me just double check that we're not doing this again on Wednesday though right we've got right ambassadors join us throughout the stuff but I think we'll do this once a month or something right so it's intense. Right. Right. And also remember next Friday is black Friday so. Some of us will be available like me. We'll be selling stuff for standing in the shop and oh yeah. Oh yeah I'm at best buy it for a year. I mean, without a doubt I'm one of those guys. Can I suggest a little something. Sure. Yeah. So the people who are watching right now, if they love what we are doing, what we did right now on this call. Can they make a post in Facebook group and like just share how did they like it and that's how we will get more people watching this next time. Good. Yeah, go and give it a share and like get attention on this you welcome the replays in the group at the top. Monday Wednesday Friday, not Friday, not Black Friday will be selling stuff. Yeah, we've probably create some crazy ideas of things can sell and I might open a drone club. But yeah, that's been a pleasure. And you guys are awesome. Awesome guys so I think we can end it right there. But yeah, we had a blast and I hope everybody else enjoyed this. I'm personally inspired. Definitely going to go start that drone business very soon. And I hope everybody has a wonderful weekend. We'll see you on Monday. Yeah, thanks so much everyone. It was great. Bye bye.
