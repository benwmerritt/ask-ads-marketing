## Transcript
Hey, all right. Hey, Danny, that was a really cool new, new graphic videos. That was sick. It was so festive. I liked the jingle bells in the background there. They really made it. It was serious, serious times. This is our funnel race. Andy was super excited, right? So excited. Glad you're here. So most of the ClickFunnel staff is taking the day off today, but we're not. So I want to thank all of the ambassadors. We have Madison with us. We have Navneet, Dan. We got Winter Jones with us. We got Dany with us. And also right over here on to my side is Danny Walsh, the super ambassador and myself. I'm Andy. Really glad to be here. So it's almost Christmas. Merry Christmas to everybody that's celebrating. Happy New Year as well. And yeah, what we're going to do today is we're going to we're going to do a funnel race. We've been really excited about it. So Danny, can you kind of explain a little bit about we did this a couple of weeks ago, right? So go through what we're going to do today. Yeah, so the idea of today is our ambassadors and myself, I'm going to try and have a go at this as well. Andy's going to referee and kind of keep everybody in order between us. We've literally got an hour to build a funnel inside of ClickFunnels and hopefully have something that's viable. So it's not just a case of just, you know, hey, this is a template that I've changed two words on. Want to try and have something that's viable that you could effectively put out so as close to launch as possible, right? I don't know how close to the launch we're going to be able to do. But I have this like idea of like, hey, how are we going to do this? And let's do a lead funnel or let's do a, I don't know, a challenge funnel or whatever. I'm messing around with like different ideas. And I thought, hang on, this is not going to be fair if I know what it is, right? So what I thought we could do is spin the festive wheel of funnel and ignore any ads on there that are endorsed by ClickFunnels. It's a free thing that I'm using. So you've got to build something on this show, ambassadors, you could either be launching a book, a free plus shipping offer of some description. It could be your own holiday season, flash sale, depends where the wheel lands, right? You could be promoting a mini course or it could be your choice. If it's your choice, we'll add on that one. You do whatever you want, but it's got to be a minimum of two pages, right? So like an opt-in page, a thank you page and I want that looking good. And it could be something for your continuity program. It could be an affiliate bridge page or a challenge funnel or your own MIFKI or a webinar, right? So I put a bunch of stuff on there. And it's where the cookie crumbles where the wheel lands is going to tell us what we're going to do, right? So there's a bunch of stuff on there. James is twisting the cap back ready to get going. Is everybody understand those funnels? Do you need like draw for expert secrets? Is everybody kind of ready for this? So when the wheel spins, it'll land on one of these things and it'll kind of go, did it, did it, did it. It'll announce the topic. Once it announces a topic, that is when the time starts, right? So we're literally going to spin the wheel and you can open up click funnels. All you can use is click funnels, AI, your imagination. And if you've got any, like if it's your own thing, graphics or any of your own logos and stuff like that that you might want to do to make it nice, it kind of makes sense to do something for yourself, for your own business, if you like, but you can feel free to be imaginative or invent something if you don't want to use your own business, right? So you've got a little bit creativity, but it's got to be around that theme. You've got click funnels, AI, and imagination to do that. And we want to try and get it done within an hour. Does that make sense? Is that that scary or is it exciting? I call it. Let's see what happens. It's business of our choice then. Yeah, pretty much. If you want to do something for yourself or a brand, your own personal brand, or you want to do it for whatever, right? Just come up with something if you don't have your own brand or your own idea. And big shout to Chico in the chat says that we are all amazing. We'll see if that still stands in 60 minutes time, right? Andy, any words before we spin the wheel? I'm really excited. And also, we've gotten a lot of great comments and feedback from the last time that we did this. And also, even when people like Funo Hacker TV, Ben and Susan, what they did yesterday where they create an offer, you know, right on the fly, that was really cool. So people love watching this. And it's really cool to have all of the ambassadors who do this pretty much on a daily basis. They're funnels all the time for their clients. Really, really fun to watch. And yeah, let's just get started. Yeah, you ready to, are you ready to spin? Everyone ready to spin the wheel? Everybody ready? Let's do it. Let's go. So one of these lands is basically what we're building. And once it lands and it announces, your time starts, so you can open up a browser, you can go inside. And what we're going to do is kind of come round each person individually and say, Hey, what are you working on? Show your screen. So it's not just some template that you've sat on for an hour and then go, Da-da, we want to kind of see some working in progress. That makes sense. Sanfer, we can use templates though, right? You can use AI, click funnels, so there's templates inside of click funnels. Do you think we want to kind of show what's possible with click funnels in an hour, even if you don't know what you're doing, right? So there you go. No idea where it's going to land. There you go. So promote your mini course and that can do it however you want. Can we explain real quick what a mini course is versus just a course? Just a course, a little course. A mini course. It's a small window size. Yeah, it's just a small, it's just a little course that you could sell inexpensively rather than having, you know, 600 modules, but you've got to promote a mini course. So it'd be nice to see a course with a couple of modules in it. But is that possible? Can you do that in an hour? Time's already started. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'll turn this off the screen. Really quick, Annie. I think it is a good idea for us to talk a little bit about what the difference between a mini course and just a regular course is. In my experience, I've actually bought lots of mini courses. They're usually, most of the time when somebody comes out with a mini course, it's almost like a tripwire offer, right? It's one of those offers where it's just, it's priced, it has a sweet spot pricing. It's not something that you have to go talk to your spouse about. It's not going to, you know, you're not going to have to take something out of your 401k or anything like that. It's super easy. It's usually like $7 or $19 or even $47. Something that's affordable and usually a mini course might even be part of a larger course, right? So there's lots of different ways that people sell courses. There's people that, they give, you know, for example, just the other day in our last show, somebody asked about, you know, how could you sell a course? Should you offer a 7-day trial or a 14-day trial? That's a really good question. Sometimes people do offer trials for their course, but another thing that you can also do is you could just sell a mini course. So it's like a smaller version of a larger course. And so, you know, yesterday, Ben and Susan created some offers right on the fly for the Grinch, right? If anybody watched that, it was a lot of fun. What they did is they picked some holiday movies. Like the first movie that they picked was the Grinch. And they said, what would we do if we were coming up with an offer? So they didn't do an entire funnel. They just came up with the offer, right? And what they did is, what would we do if we were going to create an offer for the Grinch? What would he want? And what they did there is they came up with, you know, digital freebie and then there was, you know, from small items and then there was upsells to larger continuity programs. So they got really, really in depth into the offer. And so I'm curious to see what our ambassador is going to do right here because there's so many different ways that you can create an offer for a mini course. Yeah, with that, I doubt. And I think having just like a few modules rather than, you know, endless lessons and modules, you know, a mini course could be on any topic you want. And it is short to the point and inexpensive, right? Now, it'd be cool if folks could come up with something that, you know, they could actually sell for real, you know, that would be cool. And I don't know what everybody else's thoughts is on this. I'm already like, I've got a form of a funnel laid out, even just listening to you talking with you right now about to make a logo. You know that Mid Journey 6 has just come out, right? And that it actually does text now, right? So wait a minute, you can text on like an image or a video or how do we get that? How do we enable it? You go into Mid Journey, do forward slash settings in your Discord and you put settings and then in there, there'll be a thing that says version. And if you want to do text in inverted commas, right? So like, ah, you can do text. It's not exactly. So one little thing, I have a question about just the rules, right? Obviously, I just want to make sure that this is clear, Danny. Obviously, you don't have to create the course, right? What we're doing is recruiting a funnel for the mini course. Yeah, a funnel for the course. But if you want to make a course as well, look, you've got all the time in the world, right? There's like 50 minutes here. This is click funnel. It's not like WordPress, right? So anything's possible. Can you make a course and the funnel to sell your course in 50 minutes in click funnels? Time will tell, right? But if you've got a funnel and you're kind of able to show this off, then yeah, do as much as you can, right? I just want to see some creativity. I want to see some flow. I want to see folks with ideas. Maybe you can have a workflow in there, right? It's like, you know what people are going to do. Everybody's like, no one knows it's live. We're 11 minutes in. Oh, wow. I've got a pretty cool logo. Awesome. Very cool. Danny's got the logo already. That's cool. So I know that a lot of people, what they do is they use AI and we've all been using AI like crazy lately. It's great for, I mean, what you could do is you can probably produce the text for a course or a script for the course in what, a few seconds? That would be easy. So all you would have to do is really just go in, try to get some descriptions for the course, try to get the headline for the course, and then even produce the video script. I mean, all of that is so easy. It's amazing what we have available today and what we can do with AI. I mean, you mentioned the images. I know that last time we saw people, we saw a couple people create videos using AI in like a few seconds. You just type, type in what you want and a video is created and it's like a, you know, two minute video. It was amazing. So there's so many things, so many different tools available for creating all kinds of stuff these days with AI. Yeah, 100%. And I know with AI in mind, I can see Winters screens doing a big bunch of crazy stuff. I can see it at the bottom and there's things happening. Yeah, you can share if you want. So at the very least, there's something visually on my side since there's no camera. What are you up to there, buddy? Me? I am right now. I am on stage one. So researching the stuff that Andy talks about. So I was doing some notes. So I'm going to do a tripwire, sweet spots pricing at $8, $1.7 low commitment. And it's going to be a smaller version of a larger course. And I just asked Chat UTP 3.5 here some questions. It's coming up with really bad names. But I have the basics of an offer and email sequence and some pages to create. So I'm going to now jump into creating the logo and the brand design. And then that will inform the design from here on out. So I'll just keep doing that. Pretty cool, right? And then you have a journey to make a logo. Yes. So you're already well underway with your thought process and your design. I guess people watching this are like, oh, man, how do we even get started with some of this stuff? And the more we can share as we move around, definitely the planning and the research and trying to get a structure. But you was into Chat GPT. Now you're into mid journey. AI is upon us and it's making things so much easier. It would take an edge to do this normally. Yeah. I usually get writer's block when, you know, I think all of us get writer's block when we're trying to think of a description or a headline or, you know, how to get started with a script for a video. That happens to me. That used to happen to me all the time. And now, like, you could just go to Chat GPT and get so many different ideas in it. Even if it comes up with titles for your course and you think they're terrible, at least you know which direction not to go, right? So there's so many different ways that AI can help you these days. Now, I got a question for you guys. Is everybody using Chat GPT? I know that there's other chat or other types of AI as well. There's Google barred and there's the Microsoft one as well. I know that Meta is coming out with some of their own AI. Are most of you guys using Chat GPT or mid journey? I'm using Chat GPT is the one that I have the most experience with. I tried some of the others and I feel like my whatever skills that I have don't translate readily. Like there's a bit of a probably a shift in perspective. But generally when it comes to this stuff, I'm not on the leading edge of this. Like I didn't even get into Chat GPT until like probably like March of this year. People were into it last year, you know, so I then I want to go hard on this thing like nothing else exists. I don't want to see any shiny objects. I want to produce with it. And then if something is very obviously like the better thing and I hear everyone talking about it, then I'll finally be like, okay, what's this other thing? And then I'll lean into that. That way, I'm not always looking for the next thing, you know? Yeah, totally. I've tried a few different AI like apps on your phone. And I know what you mean. Like sometimes they they're a little bit different in the way that you have to communicate with them. So sometimes, you know, you try them out, doesn't really work out doesn't really come out the way that you wanted it to. So I've also stuck with Chat GPT and also Napoleon inside ClickFunnels too is works really well as well. I see Paula is mentioning that Bing, she's using Bing in the comments. Very cool. I haven't tried that one yet. But I've you know, actually, I think I signed up for it. And then I got a notification and I haven't actually used it yet. But I'm curious to try it out. It's basically Chat GPT because Microsoft bought into OpenAI about like a year ago for a heck of a lot of like $7 billion to utilize it mostly in Bing. So like if you if you have Chat GPT for and you put in a URL and have it search the URL, you'll actually notice it'll say using Bing to access that URL. Fun fact for the day. Yeah, very clever. I think what stood out there though is the amounts of money that are actually, you know, flying around in this industry right now, because it's not just some little thing, right? This is super impactive and super important. And, you know, a lot of people are making money with AI tech right now. And I think if you're not using it, and you still sat on the fence thinking you know, maybe this is like a passing phase or whatever, you need to get this stuff checked out and go in there and have a go at least have a play with this stuff, right? And if you're taking some time off from work or away from business or whatever over the holiday period, you know, maybe it's a good time to go and open up Chat GPT or, you know, go and investigate some of these things and see what they can do and see how they can help you, right? Because there's so many cool things you can do from writing a book to a course to whatever, right? So there's lots of benefits in doing that. But you've got to like with anything you've got to actually do the work. Yeah, Chat GPT isn't going to do the work for you. You've got to you've got to put your ideas first in there. So you have to come up with the concepts and, you know, and then let it go. But yeah, there's it's just amazing how many new things are coming out. I think I think pretty soon AI is going to be just an integral part of our lives like our phones, right? The internet, my goodness, I could I can't survive a weekend without the internet. I mean, I could go to a mountain go do some hiking, some camping. And once you get back home, the first thing you're doing is you're checking your notifications and sending messages and stuff like that. So very cool to see all of the new technology. Paula says, actually, I am not a Microsoft fan, but I have to admit that Bing has a box built into the Edge browser. And it is great to drop questions and you get results very quickly. I have to check that out. I don't like Microsoft Edge either. You know, I like their operating system, but but not so much the the browser, but still nice. I can't wait to check it out. Who are Edge? It's like it just gets opened up, right? Just to download CROB. Feels like he's being used, but he's yeah. But yeah, it's there. I think we're proving though over and over again that you can literally take an idea to mark it in a short period of time with a few simple tools and an open avneats or ITIS is dropped to maybe you'll come back on. But we are we are moving. How's everybody else doing, James? What's going on? It's like deep deep in thought. Well, we could come back to James, but yeah, it's it would be nice to see. Does anybody have anything that they can share right now? Maybe just get a glimpse? I have a logo. It's not very good. In fact, I'm just going to be done the logo because it's gonna I'll just keep going. If you can see my screen. I'm in mock-up land, so I can show that. James, I'll add you then I'll add Windsor, right? So is James? So I just created a mock-up for my course. Very nice. And I used this service shots.so for creating mock-ups. What I love about this is there are real actual devices with the proper dimensions and everything. So you get a high polished look and feel when you're creating mock-ups or things. Very cool. So that's Ryan. Very cool. Windsor and bring your screen on. What are you up to? So I asked Mid Journey for a whole bunch of icons. They're not very good for like, but I just picked one of these. And then the AI came up with some names. So I just chose Productivity Power Hour with Giorgio V. Samson. So at least there's a human there. And then the Chatcha DPP's got some stuff here. And then I've asked it to come up with more about the so there's going to be a lead magnet funnel, which is I don't know, one, two, three, three pages in this funnel. And yeah, and then I think right now I'm going to actually start working on the actual ClickBalls page. I have like a brand here. So I have the basically everything I need from a color perspective and design perspective to continue on to actually jump into ClickBalls. Very cool. Very cool. It's amazing that how everybody's approaching this slightly different. Give us a second. I love something. Just show, Madison, what's going on in the in the back here over there? Lots of different stuff. I think that it really this really shows like having like an SOP and in so many like understanding like the reason we're able to do this is because obviously we utilize this software. We have our processes. But for me, what I love about ClickFunnels 2.0 is how it's broken down, especially for like a beginner. If you don't know what type of funnel to do, there's a video from Russell breaking down all the steps and then the templates. So thinking about it from a beginner perspective, I went with one of those templates to start with and I went with a video sales letter. So that's what I'm working on for an AI product that then I will turn on ads later today and we'll see if we sell any. Very cool. Very cool. Going down the affiliate markets in mini course routes. For me, I have my own little AI buddy right now who's creating all the pages. So he's creating me three pages and offer page, a tripwire page and then a core offer stage page. Is this your Barnum bot? Yeah. With all the teeth, I think like we owe it to the community to have a little bit of a peek if you're cool with that went to. I want to see this thing do it. Yeah. Right now, he's just doing an automation where he's just building some stuff so it'll be done in a second. You're on the screen, but you've gone to like a whole new realm. You can kind of see it blurred in the background. Like he's like it's clicking around. Okay, now it's done. So this is what it did for me. It created a conversion funnel, a lead magnet page, a tripwire offer page. And this is just now just a mock up. It didn't actually create the funnel for, I mean the actual design for me, but it will do that for me now. So I have a do have it in the opposite order than I wanted it, but I will shut up about that. Just for in terms of what we're building, lead magnet page, tripwire offer page, core offer page in terms of what this AI. So this is what the AI is telling me to do for my awareness stage, offer stage, and then and then we're going to try and feed some of this stuff into more AI stuff and have it build stuff for me. You've actually got the AI to do it for you, right? Yeah. I have a little, a little buddy right here. So winter backup for a second. Let me for anybody who doesn't know you, you, you have worked at ClickFunnels as a developer before and you actually created your own AI bot that creates funnels. Is that correct? Yeah. So he lives right now. He lives inside of you right here. So this collaborative editing, you can do a ClickFunnels, but this right now you have a little bot named Barnum. And so he can create a new page. He can do some revisions and he can rewrite the page based on some things. So right now what I'm doing is the basics of the page and I've had it so that you can select a product and then a page type and then a formula. So, but first, since I don't want to have to keep telling the AI what my product is, I made a little thing here where I can just go here and start writing my product. And I'm going to just fill this stuff out real quick because I need like a logo and then I need some images so that way it has data to start building it out and then I'll do that real quick and then we can jump back and we can watch it start creating some stuff. And then once it does the basics, then I'll do the polish on top. So I'll push the AI out of the way once I've done it. So, so Winces obviously a genius and a show off. We're all overy doing this the hard way. I noticed Dan Harvey's quiet in this shot today. What's going on in the mind of the big man himself? What's going on, Dan? Frustration. Here's the problem. So the last time we did this, I went in here and I was like, I'm going to play with the AI tool. Went in there, did a bunch of AI. It's been a great content for me and the AI tool built right inside of ClickFunnels. Now because of my slow computer and my internet access, I can't get the AI tool to turn on. So, so yes, frustration at this point. So yeah, that's where I'm at. You can catch up. You can make something good. You still do it. I'm working on it. Yeah. You said this last time and then there's like drones hovering around the peg. I would trouble with that too. So, yeah, all sorts of crazy stuff going on. Hopefully. I'm on a struggle bus. I'll survive. No funnel hackers were harmed in the making of this. All right. So I don't know if this is going to make people more nervous or, you know, maybe it's a relief, but we're only halfway done. So we have 30 more minutes. Everybody's working like mad. I can see Madison. She's just, you know, looking at both of her screens here. Dan is just super concentrating. So is James. Nav need. I don't know what. I think we lost. He threw in the towel. But I think that the beauty of ClickFunnels is that you can produce a lot in a short period of time, right? And to be able to do this compared to what you used to have to do to get even like halfway to where we are now, this is like amazing. And I can't wait to see if I can get this done in 30 minutes, but it's looking good so far. It's looking good so far. And the other thing in the real world is you're not streaming at the same time and have a greater ability to open up all the different tools that you would be using. And you probably have a little bit of time to, you know, think about what the subject is. Generally speaking, you're not going to have to get it done in 30 seconds. I'm sorry, 30 minutes. So you might, you know, might have a day or two to do it. And you actually have a chance to really think about it. Well, day or two. It's like, can you do it in this time? But I think yes, day or two usually is better. But I think you take the idea from, you know, concept to something on paper in an hour, you know, you add a few more hours and you can definitely polish this thing up, right? Yeah, also, I know that Dan mentioned before we got started that he's actually working on a new computer that's, I don't know if it's even new, but it's, let's just say it's not what he's used to working on right now. And Dan's not the type to make any excuses, but definitely usually he's working on a different device. So yeah, I'm using it on an M1. And this is a computer that's six years old. Yeah, there you go. You're doing it on a six year old computer though. That's awesome. I could go to my other computer over here that was actually, what is this, a 2009 model is the one to my left right here. So that's, but you know, it's Wisconsin because it's so we're kind of like back in the Stone Age here. When I get back out of Scottsdale, I have fiber optics and M1s and stuff. So, you know, totally different world. And now the dog's coming down to visit too. And thoughts, let us know in the chat, is this stuff scare you? Is it like, oh man, these guys are just doing stuff and nobody knows, we don't even know what they're doing. There's just lots of movement on the screen. What, you know, do you think is achievable in that amount of time? Right? Because there's a lot going on, certainly in my mind, but what do you guys at home think who are watching this right now? Do you think we're crazy? Let us know in the comments, Andy. Yeah, so I do see some comments. I can't really, I can't see on my screen who said this, but one of the comments says, guys, this is such fun. It feels like ClickFunnels have turned the corner into a whole new amazing world. Yes. I'm not running to any bugs. I'm like, I've got the bunch of pages and like crazy stuff going on over here. And, you know, it's, it's working. Like talking about these bugs, but I'm not finding them. And we're making money with this and running challenges with this and I've got a product and I want to add some other stuff. Yeah. So for anybody that's brand new or doesn't know what we're doing, we're doing a funnel race right now. Each of these people, except for me, are funnel builders. I'm just the referee for today, but everybody here is funnel builders. They usually have clients. They do this every day. So it's really fun to see what they're going to come up with in one hour. We picked a topic at the beginning of the show and the topic was creating a mini course. And so in a few minutes, we're only halfway done right now. So a few minutes, about 20 minutes, what we're going to do is we're going to ask everybody to show us what they've created and time will officially run out. We do this for fun. We're not, it's not really a contest. You know, everybody's going to get, what we did last time is everybody came up with some really, really cool funnels and each of these ambassadors, ClickFunnels ambassadors, has different unique talents. In fact, what we did is we seek out different ambassadors that have different talents. There's some people that go live in the Facebook group. There's some people that answer questions in the Facebook group. So that's why these people are ambassadors. And in a few minutes, we're going to get to see what they actually do. I do see another comment that says, guys, in reality, this is good for those who are starting out. Yes, definitely. It shows it takes creativity, work, and inclusion to do what you guys are doing. So yeah, definitely. In fact, the last funnel race that we did, it was two weeks ago. And, you know, I kind of mentioned this in the beginning, but we got a ton of great feedback. I think everybody right now, there's so many people getting ready for Christmas packing their, their, you know, wrapping their presents right now, or maybe scrambling to, you know, get to the store before madness tomorrow and Sunday. But, but we appreciate everybody that's watching right now. Paula says, racing on course creation and membership areas with Dan will be a tough race. Yeah, definitely. Yes, it's definitely up Duns Street. Well, if I was building an actual membership area, that's one thing. Yeah, yeah, you haven't seen anything yet. I've like, I've like part of a headline that's that's pretty much it. I can see some stuff just appeared on James's screen. It looks like there's a lot of stuff going on down there. What's what's going on? I've got, I figured we can just show something visually. I'm literally just building the funnel. There's nothing super fancy going on, but I've used a two step opt in template. I'm doing an opt in for the free course. Mine's going to be a lead magnet. And so let me show the front page is the front page is pretty much done. I haven't done the pop up yet. I just realized. So that looks good to me. It's going to be really, really simple. And now I'm going to, because this is a luncheon, I'm going to invite people to go join my, my, my math key funnel or check out my challenge or whatever. So I'm just going to replace this with existing stuff. But I figured let's just show something on the screen. You know, you're doing good looking good. Starting times. Loads of stuff going on. And look, there's templates in click funnels. You can style these things afterwards, but to get a basic template open running and viable in, you know, 35 minutes is very good going, right? It's like amazing what can be done inside of, of click funnels right now. And I'm quite happy with where this is, where this is going. Looking good, looking good. But I think there's, there's lots of folks we get questions from Andy in the group, right? And they're like, where do I start? And, you know, it seems to, sometimes you get the technology just gets in the way, but you don't actually click anything. And I guess what's everybody's advice to folks who might be just worried about, oh, man, what's the best place to start inside it, inside a click funnels? You might not have a fancy AI thing like winter, or you might not have XMAT years knowledge and skills. But if you're just at that point where you're just about to start, you've opened up click funnels, you've got a template. What's, what would folks say? Let's try and help people get going. My simple answer to that is turn on the software, go into the editor and just start clicking on stuff. You know, drop in a section, drop in some rows, drop in some elements, and just start clicking on stuff. Look at the layout, look at the, the, the, the, the, what am I thinking here, the breadcrumbs, some of my favorite things that they put into 2.0 and just start clicking on things, moving things around, just seeing how it works. That's, that's the best way to go. And then you just keep building on that and going out, you know, going out a little further in all directions from there. But you got to, I think the best place, easiest place for most people to start is just going to the editor and just start dropping some stuff in and see what it looks like. Yeah. Yeah. Don't be afraid to just get in and start experimenting. You know, click funnels is not going to automatically publish and notify your friends or anything like that. Just go in and start creating stuff, you know, mess around with the different tools. The editor in, in my experience is amazing. I love the click funnels 2.0 editor. It was really intuitive for me. Once, once you learn the principles, the basic parts of how to, you know, how to create rows and then how to add elements. Once you get that part down, it is so much fun to just experiment creating different types of pages. And, and there's templates too. I love using the templates because I, I actually, let me back up there. I, I rarely use templates on my own stuff. But what I'll do is I'll download several of the templates to take a look and get ideas from them. And then from there, I kind of like to build from scratch. But, you know, everybody has their different preferences. But if you do find a template, why not use that template? You can change the colors. You can, you can get, use the style guide. The style guide is amazing in click funnels 2.0. You can get your colors and your font and everything ready. And then download a template and then just switch the colors and the font in the template with a click of a button. So it's super easy. You just got to get in and get started. Most people, I know that most people get started by actually reading the secrets trilogy, right? That's what introduced me to, to Russell Brunson and click funnels. And then once you understand those principles, just get in there. We have the ClickFunnels official Facebook group and we do this all the time. We have these shows. So anybody wants to join in and watch us. We're, we do this every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, except for next week. I'm not sure what we're going to do next week. Daddy, we can talk about that. Yeah, we need to talk about that, right? And maybe we could play some, I could schedule in some of the ones that we've done previously because there is a big bunch of stuff that we've already done. So yeah, that's always a possibility. We could have some pre-recorded stuff and play in the new knows, but yeah, we are generally live three times a week, right? And it's a pleasure working with everybody on all of these shows because, you know, we get so much insight and ideas and cool stuff coming up every time we do this. Yeah. And then we also get really good questions that are, you know, really, really good questions that a lot of people want to know. So if you have a question, you know, don't think that, you know, it's a silly question or anything like that. There's probably a hundred people out there that need to know the answer. So any questions that you have, we're always available for that. And by the way, next Wednesday, we will be live. I think we just need to talk about Monday and Friday. And then after that, we're going to be on a regular schedule every, you know, pretty much every day, seven days a week. There's something happening in the ClickFunnels group at the same time at this time right now, seven days a week. Yeah. And fun like a TV is on as well. So you're not short of some content, right? So we've got lots of content, lots of cool stuff going on. And of course, all of those videos are stuck up at the top in the feature section. So even if we're not live, you can go and watch all the previous stuff that we've done. Check it out. Check it out. Where's everybody up to? Madison. Going crazy. Oh, I was going to say, Andy, as we were talking about the other day, something else that they can do is of course take the one funnel away, weight challenge and the your first funnel challenge and the five day lead challenge and all the rest of that fun stuff. Yeah, there's no excuse. There's so many different resources that we have available. Yeah, there's several challenges available. And just to go into that a little bit more, the one funnel away challenge is something that we used to have at ClickFunnels. And then it was replaced by the your first funnel challenge, which is only a week long. But the OFA, one funnel away challenge is 30 days. It's a whole month of training. There's different levels. There's also a VIP training. So that's very highly recommended that you join the VIP training. But yeah, definitely so many different ways. Even if you're very busy, you can always watch the replays. Our shows are recorded as well. So you can always just go up to the ClickFunnels Facebook group up the top, you'll see them pinned to the top. You can search as well, just click on the little magnifying icon and you can find the content there. So yeah, there's tons of ways to get started. I was trying to make it easy for everybody to be able to use ClickFunnels to go out there and build a business, right? It's like nobody wakes up in the morning going, I can't wait to be stuck with some complicated technology. You just want to get your idea and turn it into money and help people and do stuff like that. So it's like, this is the fastest way to market for your idea and turn it into a viable product. Don't sleep on it because somebody else will go out there and take your idea, right? So I've used ClickFunnels for a long time and it works very well every single time. I'm just getting into that training and kind of get your idea moving. Kind of at the critical point now. We're coming around the home stretch pretty much. It's still 15 minutes left, right? Still 15 minutes left. Yeah, we still got some time. So I imagine that most of our ambassadors have a couple pages mostly built out and they're probably adding the last touches right now. Can't wait to see what everybody has. This is crazy, right? And I don't think the style guide is going to be featured in my build today, but definitely got the components what I would think are viable for actually selling something which I'm super excited about. So we got a question from Paula. This is a really good question. She says, will the OFA challenge be offered again? It was bad timing for me to take it now in December and I totally understand Paula. I'm with you on that. December is kind of a crazy month. But hey, we got January coming and I think if I'm not mistaken, I believe that the OFA challenge, it's a monthly cohort and so if you sign up right now, you'll be able to join in January. Is that correct, Danny? I think it does start regularly. It might even be every Monday that they start a new cohort. It's definitely frequent. The best way to do that is to go to the website and get your name and email in there and get signed up. If you do get stuck, we can always tag Jay-Z and the team in the group and get some attention for a problem at all. I think support might be having a rest and the over the festive period, right? But there's always somebody answering emails. So if you do need to contact support and there's also the help page as well, right? So it's like help.myclickfunnels.com. A lot of information on there. Hopefully that answers everybody's questions. Yeah, there's some departments at ClickFunnels that are pretty much 365 days. So our support team, while there might be a few people that take some time off, our support is still available. So you don't have to worry about that. If you have a question, you get stuck on Christmas Eve, just send in the email and our support team will be there to answer. And I see in the comments, we got somebody from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which is so cool. I've never been to Vancouver, but I have a couple of friends that are from Vancouver that constantly inviting me. In fact, I met a couple here in Mexico. I'm actually in Central Mexico right now, living here for almost two years. And I met a couple that invited me to go hiking with them here in Mexico and they're from Vancouver. And ever since I did that last year, they've been bugging me to visit them in Vancouver and I can't wait to visit. But I heard it's beautiful. I know that the weather is very similar to Southern California, which I'm from Southern California. So very cool. We also have another comment. Does the group have any sessions that discuss traffic and conversions? Well, guess what? We can put that on the topic. We can actually talk about that. If you're interested, that's actually an amazing topic and something that a lot of people I think would be interested in. Without a doubt. A couple of weeks. Yeah. Yeah, we can definitely do that for sure. And it's always good to get folks ideas. And we are actually putting the list together for the stuff that we're going to be doing in the new year. So we'll kind of talk about that a little bit more. But if you do have any suggestions, leave them in the comments in the chat. We can obviously take those on board and do those as best we can. No problem at all. In fact, I think we should do that in a couple of weeks. So not next week, but the week after the first week of January, it's probably a good time for us to do that. And we don't always create events like we did for today, Facebook events. So today we did create one. But look out for that. We'll probably create an event for that topic where we discuss traffic and conversions. But yeah, thank you for that. Let's do that 100% because it is definitely. And I think we do have things that do touch on traffic. And of course, the challenges talk about traffic as well. What's everybody else's take on that is it's traffic is the one thing that we never seem to talk about. It's like, hey, these are the things we're doing. And now you will launch them. It's like, what does a launch even look like? Definitely be worth getting into. Because I know doing stuff with you guys individually as well outside of ClickFunnels, everybody's kind of got a piece of information to share around traffic, right? It was like, yes, I'm building videos. We're creating stuff over here. Well, I don't know how you do it, Danny, working on a funnel and having a discussion at the same time. I don't know how I do it. It's like, we're doing it. That's for sure. And we've got what, 10 minutes, maybe 15 minutes left, Andy, because we're 48 minutes in and we have five minutes at the beginning, right? Right, right. How's everybody else doing? Talk to me, people. It's always lovely when you bite off more than you can chew. Who thinks that they could come on a live and challenge the ambassadors? It's kind of like the Chaser. There's a game showing the UK, right? It's like, it's called the Chaser. And somebody comes and then there's like, there's some like super intelligent person who sits at the top of this like big old ramp. He sits at the top and they've got lights that go up and down. If they get one right, the light pushes down. And if the customer gets one right, it pushes up. And they've kind of got hopefully, they don't get knocked off the map at the bottom. And they ask a bunch of questions, whoever gets the most questions, but then they lose the money if the Chaser catches them, right? So it's a similar thing. Who thinks that they could jump on here and go live with us, right? And it was like, if you could beat the ambassadors and do it before the ambassadors, if you could beat Winter Jones, because he's got the fancy AI thing. And what is now in the chat, maybe we can look at something like that as well? That would be cool. So right now, so there is a question that says, by the way, hey, Tara, great to see you again. She says, can't wait to see what you've done. And then there's another question that says, are you teaching AI generated websites? So we actually talk about AI pretty often in our, in all of our shows. And in the beginning of this show today, we did talk about how they're using AI. We use AI all the time. So if you're not using AI, watch our shows, we talk about it all the time, we talk about different types of apps, mid journey chat, GPT, we're talking about Bing, we're talking about Google Bard, and some of the other ones and how to use them. But yeah, everybody here is using chat, GPT or mid journey or something like that, some type of AI to create their headlines, to create the content. Winter Jones shared his screen, and he showed that he pretty much had like everything, everything related to the mini course, the promotions, the, the actual content of the mini course, the outline for the mini course, I mean, everything. So, so yeah, this is in, in just a few minutes, we, we have about nine minutes left now. What we're going to do is we're, we're going to stop the clock, everybody has to get away from their keyboard, right? And then each person is going to take turns showing us what they did. And if you could show us how you use AI, that would be pretty cool. I'm interested in learning about that as well. Okay, well, I can share now because I can't get my AI to work. I'm pretty much, I'm done that way. I can share now and then everybody else can share their magnificence. I can show, I can give you the idea of what I was trying to do. And then we can go from there if you want. Yeah, cool. Let's, let's go ahead and get started with what Dan came up with on his outdated computer that he's very, very little. Let me show you, share the screen. You show your screen, I'll bring this on. Dan got like three computers going, feeding the dog at the same time. It's like something's still going on. Oh, the dog was down here. My mom was down here. I'm in my mom's basement, so I feel very millennial. I just, I aged in half. So now I'm only 30, so I guess that's not too far. But so the whole idea was on this year, I wanted to, because it had to be a course, I figured why not give the reindeer flying school. So headline I just wrote without the help of AI was, is your young bot take to the sky and lead Santa's team without the risk of battling the abominable snowman? I guess I'm should be snow monster technically from the show. And then tired of always losing the reindeer games, want the young does to swoon in your presence. And I got Danny Walsh's email address on there, just in case anybody wants it. email.com. So just hit them up there. Even though I doubt if that's it, actually, that might be it for all I know. It's close. It's close. It was better than putting mine in there. Cause if I, if I click on that, then you get a whole dropdown of all my email. It's the other, it's the other Danny Walsh. The other one. So the whole idea was obviously, besides having a sales page here is there was something I was working on last night. It was just a very minor animation, but I was like, well, it's already on my page. I might as well use it. The whole idea was when you get to this point here, you're going to click on the, the button or the link or whatever. I couldn't get this to work either for some reason. But when you do that, then this is what's going to happen if you watch my screen. And again, my computer's running slow, so the animation is kind of jerky. Let's see if I can get it to work. So then there's page folds in over the top. And then on the background of this page here, then I have a Christmas video playing as a full screen or full height on the section. And then there was going to be some more text and click the button and go into the membership area. But so that's, that's what I got. Not too, not terribly exciting. No animated videos, no talking dogs or cows or anything. But so I'm, I'm expecting a talking reindeer from one of you guys. So it's all I got to say. Damn, Madison forgot. I was like, talking cows, I should have done that one. Dang it. I'm going to do that. Talking cows. That's like cool. The fact that you've got all this like you've even got a video playing in the background. And, you know, we've still got time to spur. It was like, if you created that and then spent a little bit longer on it than realistically, that could be launched within the next few hours, right? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, first off, if I had a real product, that would be better. So the reindeer games, that would be fun. But based upon the one we did a couple of weeks ago, where we were doing it for the drones, I just thought, okay, well, we're going to use drones to spy on people. And so I found some government building looking pictures and I found some animated drones and they were flying around on the screen. So it was an animated transparent GIF. And then using AI, I just went in there and I typed in a suggestion and it spit out paragraphs of text for me and a bunch of different headlines that I just put in there, grabbed a bunch more transparent videos and other videos with drones on it, popped it into the page and there you go. So I mean, that's how quickly you can definitely mock something up. If somebody comes to you and says, you know, tomorrow morning, I need to see what you can do regarding blah, blah, blah product, you can whip something out good enough, especially with all the templates inside of 2.0, you can whip out something good enough that you can show somebody six hours later a proof of concept so they can say, yeah, I will write you a check for 20 grand. No, no can come claims here, no guarantees, future results, blah, blah. That was also not typical. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go show up the screen, show up the screen. Right. What have you got, James? All right, so two page funnel. I bought a domain on GoDaddy as part of this. I wanted to make this as complete and as possible. So I bought lindbyncrashcourse.com. I put it in the click funnels, DNS, DKIM, like everything. So that's like legit. You win. Yeah. So wow, this is, this is it. I mean, it's real simple. There's like, this is as basic as it gets, right? But it would work. I think I can get leads with this today. There's no course yet, but I think I can get leads with it today. So there's that. It's mobile optimized. And then on the thank you page, I'm giving people the option to come to my MIFKI or if they want to join any of my two dramatic demonstrations, they can do that. These are real links that go to real places. So this is like legit. Let me go to here. I did the actual automation. So the first thing I do is I tag them, then I rolled them in the course. And then I have an indoctrination sequence that I have that is a separate workflow that any one of my lead magnets will do its thing. So like I create different responsibilities. First responsibility for this workflow is to tag with the specific things that are responsible, that someone gets from opting in. And then I have another workflow that is going to do the indoctrination sequence, all my warm up stuff. And then I think over here, here is the beginnings of my actual course. It's a Linspin crash course. I've got the four different modules. No lessons yet, but I created a thumbnail. So with a couple, basically, within two hours, I could record, put this out there and drop the link and actually get people to get value really quickly. You've done a course in 58 minutes. Yeah. Now I already have a course. So I already did all the work to get this to go somewhere and this to go somewhere. So that was nice. It's already on brand and everything. But the fact that you can leverage previous wins to create new content is a strength of the platform. Without a doubt. Is that amazing? Down in James is what they've done in the last 50 minutes. Yeah. Well, yeah. And the thing that James really showed there is the ability to be able to not only be able to save realistically elements, elements, rows, sections to save everything, but also to be able to use different funnel pages in different funnels. If you got a OTO page that is killing it, you can take that OTO page and you can put that in five different funnels. And you can be killing it in all five of those funnels. And it's something you definitely could not have really done simply, easily in one point out. And I don't know if you could do that on other platforms or not because I don't use them. It's very cool. Very cool. Who else has got something to show? We're buying on the hour mark. We've probably got two more minutes that we can give for the intro. But let us know who else has got something to share. And we can... Mine is done, but it's nowhere as good as James's. We've got to show it anyways. You ready? Yeah. Madison, you're buying you some extra time with whatever's going on on the on the on the computers over there. What was AI created for you, dude? So my little AI buddy kind of failed me halfway through, so I had to do it manually. So I was panicking for most of this. But so I'll just do the processes. I asked the chat GTP for some outlines based on what Danny was saying. I mean, Andy was saying, and then we went into my journey just to make one icon and then Photoshop to make this bad logo. And then once I had that, I had a color palette over here. So like it's interesting to see the different processes because obviously I started right away with design. Like I couldn't even do any line of copying until I had colors and a logo. Then once I had that, then we outlined the funnel here, except for I started to panic and like forgot what a trip wire even is. So like it may not be what it says it is. So let's just go through the funnel here. Let's see if this even works. So maybe as often, super simple. Let's just see if this would did it and then you would opt in and then it would go to the next page, which is terrible. But this would be the page that would sell. Let's just see if the copy made sense actually. So unlock your productivity, tense time saving hacks for busy professionals. Get your free guide either way and then go here to get your power hour and 60 minutes. So it'd be the mini course was just a one hour course. Like so it was built what Andy was saying where it'd be like an intro course to a bigger course. So for $8 you get, let's see if it shows up. For $8 you would get the one hour power hour course for productivity and then you'd get upsell to the bigger course. But yeah, the design is nothing great. And then once you bought that, it would go to the thank you page, which is also not great. I was panicking. So your order is complete. You'd say what you did. Here's what you expect a link to go to it and then a really bad upsell kind of thing down here. One thing that is cool though is that we got the like James, we got the actual automations kind of outlined. It's not great by any means, but let's just see if we can edit the email. So you'd probably get kicked off of spam sending emails this bad. But hey, it's there. Oh, I forgot the link, but these other ones have the link. So and it does have a full pro real product in there. So technically, if I had payments, AI set up on this account, which I'm not sure if I do, but either way, this would be a full funnel. It wouldn't be the best, but it would be complete, right? So I did it within an hour. Well, I'll say what I found interesting, the winter said is that he can't start building until he does the design stuff first. So he has to build the logo first. He has to do find the colors first and all that. Whereas I'm exactly the opposite colors don't matter to me images for the most part. I start building out the structure. And if I'm using any kind of specialty code, I write that first. Then the drudgery is the rest of the part. Yeah. And like for me, like I was spending way too much time on this logo and then, but it's not even good. So that means that I could spend the whole hour and come up with a logo I don't even like. And then be like, how long should you get done in the funnel? Nothing. I didn't like the icon. I didn't say it was bad. I just said it was a totally different. No, no, I know exactly. Like that's why I like appreciate people like the way you approach it in a way James approaches it because James went straight to the marketing and then I go straight to the design. You go straight to the technicality. So like almost like if we were all doing a project together. So if someone's watching this, you do need a technical person, a design person and a, you know, like the market or those that's what Click phones is actually just a little tangent, but the first three co-founders, my brother, Todd Russell were that three people, the designer, technical and marketer put those two people together. Anyways, that's it. Thank you so much for the AI. He failed me. He failed me a few times. Keep going with it, brother, because it's amazing stuff. And what you've done there, I think what everybody would have seen so far is, is, is super cool. I know a few folks about to go, but we are bang on time on the and I'm done. My listening. Yes, I'm done as much as I can do. You ready? Yeah. So what I actually started with is I created a buyer persona. And so this person is Alex Turner. He owns a small, small business growing online. Here's his problems. Then I could go through and use this. And I said, what would be a good lead magnet? Told him what my product was. And it created this a book. So it is Discover the AI video formula that's revolutionizing online marketing. I put Dan's email in here, so he's going to be able to get the book. Yeah, because I wish that was about you. I put that into something one day and Madison's going, how did you get that email address? I just made that up. So, and then I created this. I mean, really, I utilized a ClickFunnels template. And what I'm doing is I'm selling an aspect of our bigger course, which is the Storyteller Express for $47. And this is not my best work, but Welcome to a pivotal moment in your digital journey. Ever wondered why some messages captivate while others vanish in the digital noise? Introducing Storyteller Express live training recording your gateway to mastering the art of impactful communication. It's not just a training. It's an awakening. Imagine diving into a recorded session rich with the secrets of narrative mastery. This isn't about mere words. It's about crafting stories that resonate, influence, and inspire. For just $297, you can access this treasure trove of knowledge, witness the transformation from a passive communicator to a storytelling maestro. Storyteller Express live So that and then I can always come down here and slash the price. I forgot I put $297 in the script. And then I can go back to, so I also, the AI also wrote in this chat, which is where I got a little distracted, the first chapter of the book, the ebook. And then I just kept going down here. And then when I got down to the end, I was able to ask the AI for the copy for the sales page. Let's go through and then the OTO is for the whole course. And then there's a workflow and everything. And the beauty of ClickFunnels, right, is that I already have this course built kind of as like a section. So I could, I just was able just to say just enroll people in just this part of it. That's awesome. You did a great job. That was one thing I had to do to speed it up, was to go back to the first page and save a section and go back in the second and then add that section for like the footer and the header, just to save some time. I'm not sure if that's what you're referring to, but no. No, I meant, so I have, when I designed this as we sold this as a whole package, basically a bundle, I was like, okay, I don't want to put everything in one course. So what I did is I broke these sections apart, and then they can access all of them through the customer center, which was not available in 1.0. So now I can go through and I can sell just aspects of that bundle that we sold to everybody and be like, okay, I'm going to pull off this part of it. Now all I have to do is enroll that person in just that course, because it's all kind of like independent. Right, that makes sense. That's awesome. Very good. Very good. Very good. One more to go. Yeah, that's any. So look, inside of ClickFunnels, I didn't use a template about everything just from scratch, so it's not styled, but that could be a job. But this is a mini affiliate marketing course, three steps. And if you go to the first step over here, it loads, it's got that nice beach effect. Somebody's made the millions with affiliate marketing, and some of my real numbers down there as well. And a little bit of blurb, you don't need a great deal, but the compressor button, and they can sign up, they should have a pop-up. If the pop-up didn't open, I can sort that out. Everyone click. But we do have a video. Picture the power of earning passive income, all while sleeping, sipping on your favorite drink, or even while on a vacation. Now, imagine achieving this through affiliate marketing, a strategy that hardly interrupts your day-to-day activities. This is what our affiliate marketing mini course offers you. And guess what? It's absolutely free. This course is a goldmine of valuable insights and practical steps designed to kickstart your journey into the world of affiliate marketing. It's not just about the theory, it's about helping actionable strategies that can turn your affiliate marketing dreams into reality. By enrolling in this free course, you stand to gain a wealth of benefits. Firstly, you'll understand the nuts and bolts of affiliate marketing from choosing the right products to promoting them effectively. You'll also learn how to build a loyal audience, an essential ingredient for success in this field. But that's not all. This course will equip you with the skills to maximize your earnings. You'll learn the art of crafting compelling content that not only draws traffic, but also converts visitors into customers. And that is like a two-minute video, right? But that's crazy long. I fixed the pop-up so you can actually sign up, put your email in, and then it will go to the next step in the funnel, which looks like this. And it says, do not press back, do not reload your page, cause access is being created. Choose an option below to continue to the members area for support. You can press the green button because there's a help button in the corner. And on there, we're saying, do you want to get the full training while you're here? I would put a video on there if I had more time. But if they say yes or no, the yes is an order form. There's products in that order form as well. Your screen isn't changing. We're still seeing the video. There you go. So you should see that. So it's stop. Before you take the free training, would you like to unlock the full course? I would put a video on there, right? And be like, hey, this is before you go. Before you go to the free training, you want the full training. And if you say yes, they can choose it here for $97, you press next, and you're about to put your details in and all the rest of that stuff. And then you could go through and there's even a bump on the next bit of that. So you put your name and email. There's a bump before you pay for some extra stuff, what you're going to get in that course. If they don't want it, they could just say no. And it will take them to a thank you page where they can then go and access the actual course. There's a workflow for each of those things, which we've got set inside of ClickFunnels. So each of those has got a workflow. And they've got emails and triggers and all the rest of that stuff, an email that goes out, the trigger enrolls them and all the rest of it. There's one if you just opt in for free. And then there's one if you are actually a buyer. So we can take people off that one and just send them the buyer workflow to do decide to buy. And then of course, on that thank you page, let me find it again. When you're on that thank you page, you've got an option to go back and upgrade if you missed it, or you can go to the members area, which is very crude, but it's done. And there's actually modules with, I didn't obviously record the videos, but you can go in there and get free content. There's the first video. And then if you go bought the paid stuff, the prepared content as well. So in an hour from nothing, you've got three step funnel, and you've got the triggers, you've got the workflows, you've got a video done with in video AI, you've got a concept, you've got products, you've got some custom graphics as well. And if you saw the thing over here, you see down there, I've got the little iPad thing with numbers on it, and some copy and a concept and all the rest of it done with not one single bug. Okay, I got one question for you. That very first video you showed, A, did you create that video in the last hour? That's fine. You did create that video in the last hour. And what did you use to create that? In video.ai. And this is the platform. So you go up here, you say create an AI video. And so make me a video about sales funnels, you press generate video, and you drink your coffee. And in 15 seconds, it's started the process. It's analyzed what you want. It thinks for a little while. And this thing will make shorts, it'll make reels, it'll make anything you want. It's about 20 bucks a month. And you can probably get 20 videos out of it for 20 bucks. So this is actually doing it like as I did it on the thing. So you can build your funnel, have a video, put your own script in there from chat GBT, you can change the voice, you do whatever you want, right? It's like this is one of the coolest things ever. But yeah, we've got everything you would need. And now it's like, what, who do you want? Sales professionals is the, you know, minimalist, you press continue. It's actually doing the video right now, just to prove that I didn't have that set on YouTube anywhere. And I've uploaded it to YouTube and wrote the emails. Everything else has been kind of done by Anders. We've moved, but we are, I think every one of us completed a viable funnel. So the only thing that you seem to not do, uh, did you do emails like the actual email itself? Because you have like literally everything. It's impressive. Well, what is, what a slacker. He didn't get his emails. Well, I know I just wanted to do this because like I was like trying to get these bad emails in and he got the longest emails. But you need the upgrade, go back ready to all that. Got a capital E and I have to go back and change that. And yeah, I got all of that. I got the enrollments in or even got the tag in there and everything. Wow. I think the first email is a little bit more comprehensive. No, as long as like you have the complete system and that I think that is like wonderful that you have like you touched every part of this, like membership, everything. Yeah. And there is actually a logo too. So the logo, but that's what we did with mid journey six. Damn. Oh yeah. You even asked it to write mini course and it wrote the mini course. Yeah. It wrote the word. We didn't write a affiliate marketing. I wrote that in Photoshop and then saved it. On my logo, that was the first thing that jumped out at me. I didn't, uh, is the text on the, the clock was right. I was like, wait a minute. One, two, three, four. I was like, wait, what's going on here? Well, anything's possible. And just to go back to the thing, this is now 25, 20, 30% in for our crazy video. And you should see a video before we end. What was it? What was that program again? I missed it. I'll drop you the link down. In video is called in video.io. I'll put it in the old private chat for everybody to go and spend the holiday season making videos. And I owe stands for Indian Ocean. That's right. Indeed. You could do that. If you, if you can do the videos like Madison, you can combine the two, right? So now you can use the script and stuff and then you can add the talking AI and your logo's from mid journey six. It's like, it's a great time to be building businesses and, and doing stuff. But I guess the speed of mark to market, you could actually sign up to that course now and there is a video in there and you would get an email and it is viable. Could like literally launch that now and you would see an affiliate marketing video within probably another hour. And I could have enough stuff in there to make the 97 or whatever it was viable. So if you like thinking, oh man, I caught launch my funnel. It's going to set me six weeks. There's five of us have just shown you that you can launch within within a day. Right. Let's, let's be, let's be fair to, to everybody. Yeah. I think if we had the brain in real world scenario, no one's going to say, hey, come up to the offer, come up with the brand name, come up with everything from just create me a mini course with no like idea. Like where if we had like the same spec, like the same product name, product name, product logo even, then we, then I think we would all excelled a little bit for just because like for me design was like maybe 30% of the work. But anyways, I think it was amazing to see how different approaches and like, and everyone got something done. And I think that's like the most amazing part of this. Like we've had logos and book covers and concepts and animations and AI going crazy and MFG's and like all these different elements that we talk about. Sometimes you just need to see them in reality, right? I mean, Madison's still working on this thing. It's going to be out there to be male. Yeah. Go get it. Yeah. Oh, we appreciate it. Winter and, and a big thanks to everybody. I know that James said that he had to go. So he's already gone, but thank you, James. Navni, I'm not sure what I hope. Navni, it's okay. He joined with us in the beginning and then he dropped off. But, but great, great appreciation to each and every one of you, Dan, a winter Madison. Thank you for doing this with us, Danny as well. I know that, you know, sometimes you don't have all the tools with you or you don't have, you know, the optimal situation, but you guys came on no matter what. It's a couple of days before Christmas. So we really, really appreciate this. And I also want to say for everybody that's watching, thank you as well. And yeah, I hope everybody has a Merry Christmas. So we'll, should we watch the video and see what it says? Have you ever wondered how a serious interest turns into a success? Can you hear him? Yes. It's full sale. The secret lies in a powerful tool known as the sales funnel. Imagine this. You're at a carnival drawn in by the smell of popcorn and the sound of laughter. You spot a game, a large funnel with a small hole at the bottom. You're given a ball, a chance to win a prize if you can get it into that tiny hole. The larger top of the funnel represents potential customers, while the small hole represents the final sale. This is the concept of a sales funnel, but instead of a ball, we're guiding potential customers towards a purchase. Sales funnels are a step-by-step process. It begins with awareness where potential customers first learn about your product or service. This can occur through various channels, such as social media, word of mouth, or an online search. Next, we move to the interest stage. Here, potential customers start showing interest in your product or service. They might follow your social media page, subscribe to your newsletter, or visit your website to learn more. The decision stage follows. At this point, potential customers are considering whether to make a purchase. They might compare your product or service with others in the market, read reviews, or seek recommendations. Finally, we reach the action stage, the small hole at the bottom of the funnel. This is where a potential customer makes the final decision to purchase. But the journey doesn't end here. Post-purchase, it's crucial to maintain a relationship with your customers, encouraging repeat purchases and referrals. This could be through follow-up emails, customer loyalty programs, or personalized offers. To summarize, a sales funnel is a systematic step-by-step process that guides potential customers from the awareness stage to the action stage. It's a powerful tool that helps businesses convert interest into sales. Remember, the top of the funnel is wide, representing a large pool of potential customers. As we move down the funnel, this pool narrows until we're left with those who decide to make a purchase. But a successful sales funnel doesn't just focus on making a sale, it also emphasizes maintaining relationships post-purchase. After all, a satisfied customer is more likely to make repeat purchases and recommend your product or service to others. So the next time you're at a carnival, look at that game with the large funnel and the small hole at the bottom. Picture each ball as a potential customer and imagine guiding it towards that tiny hole. That's the magic of a sales funnel turning potential into success. Thanks for coming. Wow, that's crazy. My only question was, what do I got to do to get the iStock off the middle of the screen? Yeah, you just pay your 20 bucks or whatever it is. When you export, it takes off all the watermarks. Oh, when you export it? Okay. Okay. So when you export now, it's going to say, I've used 30 of my 80 licenses and it requires 19 more. And every month it resets. So you can go all in, you can pay them hundreds of dollars or you can pay them 20 bucks. I've had 20 bucks and I made a big bunch of videos. These are longer. If you go in and you get like the shorts and try and do like a YouTube short under 60 seconds, you're probably looking at like five credits, which is insane. You make a big bunch of those and they are the other aspect ratio as well. They're sort of that way. So you can you put them on. Paula also was asking about that. So you had to buy credits for Storyblocks for the video clips. It's all done within in video. Yes. Yeah. This is still in video and then it said Storyblocks. So it's slightly confusing. So it pulls from Storyblocks, iStock. Those are all stock video sites. Oh, Storyblocks is a stock photo. Yeah, it has like API access with them. So you'd honestly be paying more money to get that footage just from Storyblocks because I've paid it before than using in video and you can replace the footage in it too. That's crazy. Yeah, that's like the coolest thing ever without selling somebody else's software. But if you go edit, you can actually upload your own pics or you can search other stock and then like replace. They won't replace that with I don't know whatever it is fire and we won't find you a bunch of fire and you press whichever video you want to put it in there or photos or whatever. You can make a really good bit like fire. So hey, let's put this fire in here, whatever it is, right? It's like going to have fun with that. It's the holiday season. It's like and use it inside your funnels, click funnels, you get your trial at clickfunnels.com and you can build a business in an hour and be making like money or selling your mini-course or whatever it is in the new year. That'd be fun. Mind blown. Absolutely crazy. Yeah, let's do it again sometime. Danny, last question for you. How many funnels in 2024 do you think you'll build? To be fair, not many. I think it's kind of like getting the structures always there, right? And I think I want that lucrative one funnel that's just working. Yeah, that's a great response. Now live videos is a different question, right? It's like I think I'm on 250 hours of live since April or something ridiculous. And the long way that continue, I've got a plan for that. But it's less building, more creating, if that makes sense. So it's like more of the actual this kind of thing. I love this stuff. Right? Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. And there's thousands of funnels that are sat there that probably are viable to be fair. I just need to be like run some traffic. That's the bit where I fall down like, oh, now I need to do something with this funnel. Let's build another one. And it's like, oh, why do we do that to ourselves? Who knows? All the best, everybody, really. Thank you so much. Happy holidays. Peace out, everybody. Happy holidays. Thanks so much, everyone. Bye-bye. Holidays, Merry Christmas. Bye-bye. Bye, everybody.
