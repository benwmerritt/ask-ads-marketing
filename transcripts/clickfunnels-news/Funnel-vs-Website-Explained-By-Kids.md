The difference between a funnel and a website is a funnel is you can just like look at stuff. A website is you can go to stuff. Wait. Yeah, it's the other way. A website is just a page. Everything's laid out and you scroll down, you learn information. There's so many options that you don't know what to do. It's like a maze where they can maybe get to where they want to go. Since they can't find what they want and then they're just gonna leave. For websites sometimes I feel like it's a lie. If you have a website you're just hoping. You're hoping that maybe someone comes. You build it and you hope that they will come. A funnel is like a huge expansion on websites. Taking the viewer straight through the process of actually buying the product. Pretty much a website on steroids. It's better for the consumer and seller because you end up with more of what you wanted. You can make even bigger of a profit. This is really dynamic and they say, oh this is exactly what I'm here for. It's really simple. Pretty easy to understand. And it's really useful in a lot of situations. You can sell anything. Bracelets. You can sell socks. Smoker needs. Because he doesn't want smoke grenades. As long as you do it correctly you could put anything on there and sell it. You could build funnels anywhere. All you need is a laptop, maybe even a phone. Quick funnels you have all that you need. You just need to place it where you want. It's just a simple click. I've created funnels in like literally 20 minutes. What's nice is I can use my mom's account and I don't even have to pay for it. It's awesome.
