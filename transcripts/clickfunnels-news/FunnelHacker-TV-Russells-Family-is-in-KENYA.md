## Transcript
Hey there everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are so excited to have you guys here. There is amazing amount of stuff going on. We've been talking about what was going on with Funnel Hacking Live. Where is Russell? It's kind of like where is Waldo? Where is Russell this week? There is some crazy stuff going on and we're gonna highlight you. We're gonna talk about doing this stuff instead of just kind of like learning the stuff. How do you actually do this stuff? There is a lot in today's episode. Make sure you guys are paying attention. Let's roll the intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. I'm Susan Lennardsen. This is... Ben Moot. We have a packed episode today. It's a little bit different than expected though. But that's all right. It's gonna be amazing. We have some water cooler moments coming up. Like Ben said, where is Russell right now? But we have some other things to talk about what's going on in the community right now. We also have some hacker heroes, people in the community that we wanna highlight, some posts we've been seeing, and some awards that have been given. We love to see it. And then we also have another user spotlight to highlight, which is awesome. And then we'll end it. We'll cap it off with a Funnel Hacker moment for me. What's going on with me? What am I doing in the Funnel Hacker world? So, Ben, why are we doing this episode this way? So can you share this over to the group? I totally forgot to do that, Susan. Yes, I can. I know you're on it. Guys, so today we were supposed to be speaking with a certain Funnel Hacking Live speaker. That Funnel Hacking Live speaker got sick. We wanna be able to talk about what we've been doing really quick. So let's go ahead and do their speaker moment really quick. Let's do speaker news. So Funnel Hacking Live is literally around the corner. There is a lot going on. And yesterday we got to speak with Ben Kair. The day before that we were able to speak with Kevin Anson. And we've been doing these interviews over and over. It has been absolutely a blast. And so here's the deal. If you guys are missing any of these, you need to catch up on this. You need to be there. So really quick. This is FunnelHacker.tv, my friends. If you guys are not signed up for all the text messages, all the emails that go out, you need to be. Because you can come here, you can watch all the old episodes. So this is our Ben Kair episode. So you'll be able to come over here and watch Ben Kair. It's so funny yesterday. Ben gave us almost like a private discussion afterwards where he talked about how powerful it is to come to Funnel Hacking Live and how you were called to write your own book. And how that calling is like, your book is your life, your story and how you have a meaning that is out there that needs to be shared out into the world. And he talks about that and gave us this little thing afterwards, it was so cool. If you guys wanna hear Ben's story, Ben has Cruzan Syndrome. He's a wrestler. He wrestled with Russell in high school. They were in the same club. And there's so much cool stuff here. He's gonna be speaking at Funnel Hacking Live it's an absolute blast. And then we have Kevin Anson. Kevin Anson is the original editor for Funnel Hacker TV. You get to hear about what he's doing and how he's created a specific formula that works amazing for video ads. And the bonuses that everybody's giving away is just absolutely ridiculous. So here's the deal. If you guys have not gone to FunnelHackingLive.com and you have not gotten your tickets, you need to come here, you need to grab your tickets. They are absolutely flying off the shelves and they are, we're getting an update from the team. We're about 70% full, getting a little bit higher on the hotel room. So we have a suite of rooms that we have saved for you but that is closing, that is going away. And so we wanna make sure if you wanna take it, you need to come and get the tickets. That way you get that suite of rooms. You get all the details in the background as well as all of the bonuses. And they just updated all the bonuses, tossed them all in here. It is unreal. How many bonuses have been given to this? Multiple pages of bonuses at this point for you guys. There is so much in here. Each of these are like just powerhouses in and of themselves. And it's all there to prepare you for FunnelHackingLive. You can watch all the previous ones and do all of that. That's all available for you guys. But the deal is tickets are flying off the shelves. And if you guys want to be able to stay at the hotel, which we highly recommend because of the experience you're able to keep, you need to go and get your ticket for FunnelHackingLive because it is time and the madness is just continuing. Then I miss anything on that one, Susan. I'm so excited. No, I'm so excited for FHL. Man, starting to make plans of when I'm getting there, when I'm leaving, what I'm gonna do while I'm preparing. Oh my gosh, it's gonna be so awesome. Okay, can't wait. And for those of you who are true hackers, Russell asked me to be on FunnelHackerTV and asked Susan to be on FunnelHackerTV because he saw us do one thing that I'd recommend you guys do. I would recommend, if everybody could do this, this should be really cool. Number one, get your ticket to FunnelHackingLive. But the thing that Susan and I did that was unique is when we went to the events, we documented every single day. And so I've already talked to the ClickFunnels team, like I'm renting my car, I'm getting that all rented out. And then I'm gonna be driving down, I'm gonna document the whole thing. I'm gonna be sharing it with you guys as we go. Share with us your journey, share with us the insights, what you're excited for when you're going. Share with us what your insights were every single day. Drop it in the community, do Facebook Lives, let us know. We would love to be able to see you, be able to highlight you. We're gonna be there, we're gonna be doing some really special stuff with FunnelHackerTV. And so stay tuned, there's gonna be some cool stuff, but document that journey. And I used it, the way that I did it, I don't know why you did it Susan, but the way that I did it is I documented my journey and I take copious notes. Like I get these, so you'll get a binder with a whole bunch of notes. And I make massive notes. And I said, if you guys want my notes, sign up on my email list. And I built it as an email list registration process. And so when people actually signed up for my notes, I went back home, I went through and I typed out all the notes that were on my, that were there. And I turned that into a free opt-in for everybody. And it was that documentation was just me being loud and building my list. And I'm gonna tell you, people were dying to get that every single day, it was so cool. So that's how it worked for me. Susan, why were you doing it? That's, I'm just smiling over here, cause that's awesome. I think the first, was it the first year I was at FHL? I did the same thing. I used my notes as a lead magnet. It was awesome, it worked really well. So I think one of the, so how Russell saw me of wasn't Funnel of the Hacking live, but it was Mastermind in Paradise. I was doing recap videos. So I was like, okay, I was going to my community and he just happened to have been in my community, which was awesome, but you could do it on your profile. Like if you want to, if you don't have a community yet. And I just did like a recap. I'm like, hey, day one, here's like the highlights that I got from today. And just sharing that as added value to people, but also it helps people see you like, oh, you're there. There's something special about that. And then I was going to say, there is a hashtag you guys should be using. It's like an official hashtag. It's called Journey to FHL. So do hashtag Journey to FHL on all of your Journey to FHL related posts that you're doing. Maybe we need to, we'll gather some of those and highlight some on Funnel Hacker TV too. So you never know, maybe we'll pick some stuff and you'll find yourself on here. And yeah, like your journey, like getting prepared and booking your tickets, getting your room on the way down. If you're going to drive down like Ben is or you're flying, take pictures along the way, your experience, people, like it's not uncommon to meet people in the airport that are also on their way to FHL. So conversations, yeah, wear a shirt. It's so easy to spot people when you're wearing a shirt. If you've been to a past one and you have a backpack, like that's awesome to have on your back. So just share all of that experience and we'll keep an eye on that hashtag and bring it to the show. Yeah, that's so good. And then, oh my gosh, there's so much to talk about. Okay, let's go into the water cooler moments. Are we ready for that? We are now, Ben, cut me off. No, no, no, this is great. So I apologize if my video is bad guys. I don't know, did I tell the story yet to everybody? No, I don't think so. So water cooler moment, just a Ben, water cooler moment and I'm probably freezing as I'm doing it. But Saturday night, my wife was walking into the house and as she came into the garage, we had a thunder clap, a moment of instant thunder and lightning, which means lightning struck extremely close to the house and my wife ran into the house and her feet and her hands were tingling. She's like, honey, that wasn't right. There was something weird. We're like, what in the world happened? I started walking around. It struck my Starlink internet. So I have a satellite, I have the whole router out there, lightning struck it and just blew it to pieces. And so if you guys are like, why is it wrong with Ben's internet? It got blown to pieces. And so I talked to Starlink, they are sending me a refund actually, they're like, just send us the old stuff. And I'm like, okay, cool. And so they're sending them the old stuff, they're giving me a new one and we'll get that set up and everything will be better soon. But that is coming. So my apologies first off, if the video is weird. Second off. Looking good right now. Oh, good. As long as I don't like make crazy movements. Let's go ahead and jump into where is Russell? Where in the world is Russell? Right now Russell, my friends is in Kenya. He's in Kenya and it is such a cool experience. If you're not following him on social media, you should be. You get to see him, you get to see his wife. For every funnel that you guys publish, I don't know if you know this, when you publish it and you get a hundred visitors to that funnel, a dollar is donated to Operation Village Impact or not Operation, just Village Impact. And Village Impact is a really cool 501C3. It is a nonprofit that is put together by Stu McLaren and his lovely wife. And they donate and build out schools in Kenya. And once a year, Russell will fly out there and he was, he brought his whole family for the very first time. So you're able to see all this. Like you get to hear the women singing, it is beautiful. You should be following Russell. It is so cool, but these videos aren't up for forever. So definitely check it out. It is a really cool experience they're having. So they just got done with that. And now they're on, they're going on a safari. So you'll see in just a moment, they all boarded on a plane, they all jumped on on his family, and they're flying off to a safari experience right now. So if you're not following Russell on Instagram or on Facebook, you should because these things just don't live forever. And it is a really, really cool experience. And it's something that they're donating every time you start having success. So start building those funnels, guys. Start doing that. Every step of what we do here at ClickFunnels supports somebody else. It's a huge giving network. And so my friends, make sure that you are building so that we can give because we've got some really cool stuff. Ah, good, good, good. Oh my gosh. Okay, so even though Russell's in Kenya right now, there's still stuff happening on his podcast. And it's good. It's good. Let's see, we pull that up. So the most recent episode on his podcast on marketing secrets is all about Lynchpin, as you can tell, which is leading up to Funnel Hacking Live, which is also gonna be all about Lynchpin. This looks, it's a part one though, which that's exciting. Yes, so this is a two-part series. The second one is dropping tomorrow. And so if you haven't listened to the first part, so this is a special webinar that Russell did for Anikson Gull. And it's the first time that he ever taught the Lynchpin outside of our world. It's the first time he ever mentioned it. And so if you guys, and when he did it, I actually got to be in the office. I listened to the entire thing. And he stepped off the stage and he's like, ooh, we're like, I think that's the best way you've ever explained this before. So if you wanna understand like why the Lynchpin is a thing and what the general idea is, this is the easiest, like simple summation of what this process is and how it works. Yesterday, the episode from last week talks about how we grew ClickFunnels to where it is today and what mechanism we use to do that. Part two of this dropping tomorrow is how we use the Lynchpin to really ignite that sucker on fire and why you should be doing that in your business. So if you're trying to figure out what is the Lynchpin, why are they talking about a funnel hacking live? Why is it this big thing? Russell's giving you all the details. Make sure you're listening on the podcast because it's good. It's really, really good. Awesome. There's so much value that gets dropped over there. And there's another podcast episode that just dropped. Yeah? There is. What? Okay. ClickFunnels radio. ClickFunnels radio. So Chris Cameron and Laura Demetrius interviewed Doug Bouton and Doug Bouton is a speaker at Funnel Hacking Live. He has not scheduled yet. If you are listening, Doug, you need to schedule a time with us. We love you. Schedule, my friend. Doug is going to be speaking at Funnel Hacking Live, but he spoke because he is, or he's on the podcast. They highlight him because he is a dream car winner. He has a two comma club award. He has a dream car award. And his next moonshot is to go for a two comma club heart award. So if you don't know what that is, that is where you give a million dollars to a charity through a funnel or from your business. And that is what Doug is building. This is a special award that Dave Woodward created because he saw people giving in the community. And he wanted to highlight that as something that is beautiful. And because of that, we have that award. Doug's shooting for it. So if you want to hear how Doug, number one, won the dream car, like what were his biggest obstacles in doing that? Number two, what does his normal day to day look like? Like what is his actual business from which he has two comma club award? Number three, how is he doing all of that and taking it to the next level? It's a beautiful podcast. It's really, really good. Laura and Chris do a wonderful job of bringing the whole story out of him. So go check that out. And as a teaser, we're gonna be funnel hacking with Susan here in a minute. And the reason I'm talking so much is because Susan has been doing something. And so I apologize for stealing all the air in the room. I'm gonna give it back because Susan is doing something really cool. And I wanted to talk about that in a minute. We'll get there in just a second, right? Yes, all good. It's been a crazy week. We'll hear all about it in just a minute. All right, okay. All right, so we do though, we wanna highlight a lot of you in the community. So let's move to our hacker heroes. And we have quite a few posts that have been popping up. So first one. Did that work well when I shared last time? I think it did. Go ahead, let's try it. Let's see if Ben's video works with us and I have the post ready to pull up. All right, so the first one I wanna say thank you to guys. If you don't know, his name is Barack Lando. And I apologize if I say her name wrong. He said that he went live. He did exactly what Russell talks about. And he taught that only the strategy and not the tactics. This is part of expert secrets. But people were really upset. So what was he missing? And so you guys came in, you guys started to give your answers and your ideas and you guys gave tons of feedback around how do you do this right? There's a specific process to way Russell does this. That is super powerful. That is really helpful. And you guys help show him that and show him all the things I love that you guys post. It's absolutely wonderful. There's actually one post on here that I wanted to highlight. Somebody said, well, you know, that book is 10 years old, bro. The market is different now. The answer is no. The market's not different. And so congratulations, Will Hirsch. Thank you so much for this. You're like, look, Alex Hormozzi is teaching me exact same stuff right now and it's blowing up. It's all about the basics. And you stick to it and scale. His business is doing four million a year. Guys, thank you for your comments. Thank you for doing this. There's a reason that these strategies work. Right now we're working on so many different things to try to get this into your hands as soon as possible. If you're not in the community, if you are not paying attention and seeing these or like getting a part of those conversations, you're missing something that's really, really, really cool. And so number one, thank you for asking questions. Thank you for answering questions. And thank you for helping people realize that a lot of these strategies are evergreen. They are really, really, really valuable. Want to show a rant really quick. This is from Michael. Michael Young did a rant a little while ago and it's like, rant's over, this is it. All these people are saying, look, you aren't hustling 12 hours a day. You need to be hustling 16 hours a day. Sleep when you're dead. All this stuff, he's like, look, a lot of entrepreneurs are falling into depression. They're getting divorces. They're losing their businesses due to burnout. It's not sustainable. You can't outwork you. You just need to do something that actually works. And what is that that works? And he gave an absolutely great schedule, which is create a set of systems that create increasing levels of leverage. So use your time more wisely. Number one, number two, three to four hours of focused needle moving work. That is focus time. One decision made every week, a bulletproof habit, focus. You make sure you're getting enough sleep, strict boundaries. This is how you make a three to four hour day a 16 hour day. And I just wanted to highlight that because a lot of us want to go crazy. We like funnel hacking. We like going crazy. We like burning the bridge and not being able to sleep. And we're like, I'm making it happen. As much as we love those times of making a funnel year happen in a week, you need to allow yourself to breathe. Here at the ClickFunnels team, we will literally do a launch. And it will be a week to a week and a half of utter madness where it is long days. But then we breathe afterwards. And there's that expansion time where it's all right. If everyone's going off a little bit early, it's absolutely fine. We're getting the things done we need to because we compress time, but we have planned moments where we compress that time. So organize that for yourselves and make it something that you can do over and over. Two other things really quick. Dawn Markland, you my friend got your two comic club award and you shared it, shared it in the community. Absolutely love us. Thank you for sharing your story. We absolutely love and appreciate it when you guys share your stories of getting your two comic club award, what it looks like. His program, Accountability Now, just hit the two comic club award. Oh, we're so happy for you, so excited. And then one more Tim, let's see really quick. Tom Rogers. Tom Rogers, here we are. Nope, my browser's having issues just a minute. Let me remove this one and let me try one more time. So Tom Rogers also got his two comic club award and he is from the UK. There we go, got it. Yep. Yes. And what was the business's fast lane? It's a real estate business. And so he talks about how they built it, how they did it with their family, all the things you learn along the way. A lot of the reasons why ClickFunnels is successful, my friends, is because we have the tool and we have the things that you need to learn step by step in order to be able to reach that. It's not just about I built a funnel. There's all the strategies that surround it. This is a software platform that helps you win. And so the reason it wins is because of everything that's involved in the community and you guys that are here. So thank you so, so, so, so, so much. One last thing on community because you guys are amazing. We just did a recent user spotlight. That user spotlight is with Carl Weysche. Okay, and Carl, yeah, Weysche. Make sure I said it right. If you guys are not on YouTube, go check it out on YouTube. It's really good. Laura interviews Carl and Carl talks about how he grew his business and what his business is now, where it's taken off and so many other things. It is absolutely worthwhile, absolutely beautiful. And it's really, really cool. He's won multiple two comic club awards. He knows what he's talking about. Everyone just go over to the YouTube channel. You'll see not only the user spotlights, but you'll also see the ClickFunnels radio. We're doing video of that and dropping it in. So if you need that boost, that energy, that moment of, you know what? You're not alone in the funnel hackering of day to day. Go over to the YouTube channel, keep being connected to your, my friends. We are going to continue to highlight you. We appreciate you so, so, so much. So awesome to see all of that. You guys are helping each other. Awards are being earned. You're putting in the work. So that brings us to Funnel Hacking with Susan. Funnel Hacking with Susan. Oh my gosh. Okay. So I love what Ben was saying when he was talking about Michael, Michael Young's post, about how like there's concentrated moments of just getting it done. And then we go and take a break. That's exactly what I'm going through. So in my business, I have business partner, Andrew Peer. Shout out Dan Havy, Nicole Coons. Those are our people in our business. And we just launched a challenge yesterday. We're doing the thing. Usually we're doing it for other people, but we're like, yeah, we got to run our own challenge. So we launched our challenge yesterday. We hustled. I'm pretty sure Andrea was doing slides like up until the moment of, I'm pretty sure she was doing it again today of sliders. Feels very Russell and the team of like, oh, we got to like change this thing. And it's like, well, we have two minutes, but before we go live, what are we doing? But it's awesome. It is so rewarding when you're able to build something and then deliver it and have it resonate with people or not and get feedback. Like it doesn't really matter, but like that you did the thing, like you followed through, you did it. So that's what we're doing. We opted to do a two day challenge. So again, like right, I was like, Ben, I'm doing the pitch today. I'm going to be on Funnel Hacker TV. I'll be ready like right up to the wire. So Ben's throwing all this stuff together because we had a last minute change. And we went and did the thing. It was amazing. And but now it's like, I'm on Funnel Hacker TV right now, right after this, my family and I are going away for the weekend. Like it's like, okay, I am hustling. Like my kids have barely seen me these last couple of days, but I told them, I made sure that they knew like, hey, like mom's doing this thing. It's taking a lot of my time this week, but I promise like whatever day it is, Thursday afternoon, I'm going to be done working for like the full four days of our weekend that we're taking. And so that really, really helps with, I mean, if you have kids and you have to set those expectations, but the important part is like definitely taking the break. So I really appreciate that post from Michael and then Ben, you bringing it up. As far as the challenge goes, it's been awesome. We are using 2.0 for our funnels. We have people signed up for our actual challenge. People are signing up for our offer. Like it's all working really well. And it's just really fun. It's really fun to see it working and happening. And we are so excited about what is coming next. We've actually, this is really awesome. I gotta give credit to Andrea for this because she thought of it and I just love it. But we all know, and I'm wearing the shirt today, ClickFunnels 2.0. We're up there. Yes. We all think of ClickFunnels 2.0 as the software, the SAS. But we realized like ClickFunnels 2.0 isn't just about the product of the software. It's like with 2.0, we have LynchPin. We have whatever Russell's gonna be releasing at the next Funnel Hacking Live that I know goes with LynchPin because I've seen it. I know it is gonna be releasing. But it's not just software 2.0. It's like 2.0 of ClickFunnels and the frameworks. And it's like this whole, we're in this next chapter guys. We're in the next phase of ClickFunnels and the frameworks. And now is the time to really be diving in and learning what Russell and the team are putting out there into the world. Cause I mean, even the post about the comment about the book and like those book was written 10 years ago, the book still holds true, but Russell's expanding on it. He's putting more frameworks to the frameworks he's already put out there. He's giving more ways of how to execute on what he's already given. It's not that things changed. It's just he's finding easier ways of explaining it. Easier ways for people to follow what they should be doing and create their plans and all those things. So if you're not figuring out how that works now, I think you're kind of falling behind. And it is just really awesome to see how it has changed, not changed, but adapted, evolves over the last few years. And that we are in the ClickFunnels 2.0 era. And it is really exciting to be there. And I cannot express to you how excited I am for everyone who is going to Funnel Hacking Live this year and we'll discover the things that we've all been kind of putting into practice over the last year, the Lynch pin model, the continuity, the dramatic demonstrations, like the traffic systems, all of the things that go together because it is life changing. There's new ways of people doing the same strategies, but people are just executing on it different that might resonate with you that nothing else has before yet. And to learn that stuff and to go home and then actually do it is just amazing. And that's my hope for everybody. Learn it and then go and do it, please. Yes. Lynch pin is the way, Justin's in the comments. Yes, that's the way. Yeah, for sure. So yes, I'm exhausted. But it is great too. And you're on like day two of your challenge too. It's day two. It's just a two day. So this was the last day we condensed. We were like two day is what we're going to aim for. We actually thought modeled by Katherine Jones recently of a two day event. We're like, it's the same stuff that you put into a three day or a five day, but we've condensed it. So that's crazy too. Cause I remember yesterday you were sharing with me like images of people who were saying, look, it was just taught so beautifully that they were ready for part two. So one of the reasons why a lot of people don't launch and I want to hit on this really quick. A lot of the reasons why we don't launch is cause we're scared. We're like, oh, I'm going to get out there. I'm going to put my face out there. What if nobody shows up? What if only like two people show up? What if like some people show up here and there, but no one ever talks to me like you are learning the process. You are learning number one, how do you actually throw the darn event? Number two, how do you grab their attention and keep it? Number three, how do you then make sure that you have the process you set up correctly? More than likely the first time you do it, it's not going to be perfect and it's okay. It's all right. I was shocked. One of the things I've been more shocked about being inside of ClickFunnels now and seeing the people that are in the inner circle and in the category King and make, none of them are doing it perfect. Like no one is following what Russell does to the absolute letter T. They're catching the best they can, doing it in their own style and framework and putting their own twist on it here and there and it's good enough. And that's the powerful piece. And so like, I know you're feeling that too because you're just like, oh my gosh, we did it. Oh my gosh. Okay. So like, let me, let me speak about that for a minute. I see also taken perfect action in the comments, it's pitch day. Yeah. So we, right after our challenge yesterday, we went into our community and we did a breakdown. Like we, cause it was our normal live on Wednesdays and we're like, well, let's just talk about like what we just did and we were just breaking down what we went through. We talked about all of the problems that we ran into and we were talking about that exact thing of like, it's never going to be perfect. It's not going to be perfect on day one. It's not going to be perfect on day 100. Like it's never going to be perfect on day one. There's always, there's so many variables that can contribute to it, not working exactly the way that it needed to be. Like we had an issue of, most of them were human errors. Like I couldn't figure out how to make my audio play through my zoom system, like the system audio through zoom. Like I didn't know where that button was, but I went and I figured it out after day one and day two, I had my countdown music playing. Like it was working and people weren't sitting awkwardly in silence anymore. And then, you know, we had some challenges with like sharing a link to people for a template that we had created for them to work through while they were on our challenge and we had a big hang up with that that was kind of a, a hang up for some people, but they stuck through it and then we also stuck through it. Like we went and found the proper way to share that template to people. So we were good. So, and we do this all the time for our clients. We do this for others so often, but then, you know, even when you turn around, like if you've done it a whole bunch of times, you're still going to run into some issues. Yeah, it's never going to be perfect. Just go and do it. Just go and do it. Mark, I see you by the way, your comments like, I went to my first funnel say this is my first funnel and it's going to suck and it's perfectly fine. You're going to succeed. Success is one funnel away. You just keep growing. You just keep learning. That's why there's a secrets of success is because it's having the faith to keeps taking that step one after another and you're like, oh, I slipped on that one.

My name is Russell Brunson and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started and we don't even have gold to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. But because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get what's happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you. It's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you. So if a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way, I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
