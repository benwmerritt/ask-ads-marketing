So if you guys are interested in that, that's also available for you at funnelbuilders.com. Make sure you're going there. That's awesome. Okay. All right. We're doing rapid fire today. All right. Next up is our water cooler moments. We have a couple of fun things to see if you guys have been paying attention, what's going on. The first thing is, did you guys know that ClickFunnels Radio is back? The first episode of it dropped, I think last week, four days ago, I believe is what my podcast app says. And this one's really awesome because it's like an introduction. For those of you that don't know, like ClickFunnels Radio was hosted by Dave Woodward, who's no longer with us. And so they brought it back and Russell's on this first episode with Chris Cameron and Laura Demetrius. And they're explaining, Russell's talking about like, okay, why are they bringing it back? Why he picked these two hosts? What they're doing moving forward with it. And so it's really good. They paid tribute to Dave in this episode. Really good listen. It's like 20 minutes. And you can find that, is there a link? But I know you can find it anywhere where you listen to your podcast. That's right down at ClickFunnels Radio. ClickFunnels.com slash Pulse. Go to ClickFunnels.com slash Pulse. You guys are able to get all the updates there, subscribe and be able to see all the details. I know Laura and Chris have been like, ridiculously excited about launching this and be able to launch it with Russell and be able to get it out there. This is the 669th episode. And this is all about, you'll learn as you get in, if you've spent a little while, ClickFunnels Radio is all about capturing stories, sharing stories, and it's a much faster share than user spotlights or what we do here. And it's much more in depth and personal, and it's ridiculously good. And so to bring it back, they're excited. They have a docket all set up. They've been interviewing like crazy. There's some really cool stuff around the corner for you guys at ClickFunnels Radio. So we're getting loud. How often is ClickFunnels Radio publishing? It's every single week, if I remember correctly, it's every week on Thursday or Friday. Okay, awesome. Absolutely. Yeah, definitely like go and subscribe. Yeah, go subscribe. And a couple of other things that are going on with the water cooler, if we're just gonna sit back and chat for a while. Russell last week was at Bear Lake with his family. And that's the thing that they do every single year. It's the family time. So they go off, they go to Bear Lake. Last year they bought a boat. So this year they brought the boat back and were able to take everybody out on the boat and have a good time. And so you're able to see them having a great time on the boat, hiking, and just spending good quality time. This is like, how often do we wanna be able to do this? This is one of those things, even though Russell is launching, and you know what he's doing this week, he's spending time with family and making sure that these things are important. And it's one of the reasons why we love him. Like he's, you can see he's preparing webinars. This was today. He's preparing webinars and all this stuff. And as he's doing it, they're listening to, oh no, I forgot it. It's the strangest secret by Earl Nightingale. And it is a ridiculously cool listen. And Russell actually talked about it in his latest podcast. So just a whole bunch of stuff that's going on, my friends. We wanna make sure that you guys are in the know. That's what's going on next to the water cooler at ClickFunnels right now. Lots of madness, but lots of good stuff. Sweet. Okay. Next up, we've got to give some shout outs to awesome people in ClickFunnels. We have some heroes. So we're gonna do hacker heroes. Yes. Okay. You wanna kick us off for this one? I do. And here's the thing. So we've had one of these people on before. The other person we need to have on, we're trying to schedule them in, but as you guys know, we've been going crazy lately. So the first person that I wanna highlight and say thank you to is Jamie Smith. Some of you guys know, like Jamie Smith's created CF Pro Tools. We brought him on to Funnel Hacker TV a while ago and he shared how he's using CF Pro Tools with 2.0. He recently just released, this was July 5th. So it's like five days ago, he just released an order form bump script. So if you wanna create an order form bump that looks the way you want it to, you can now use CF Pro Tools in order to make that work. And he's got all this training step by step. He shows you how to do everything. That's inside of the ClickFunnels group. You guys can watch that video and it's extremely helpful and extremely powerful. It's available for you. And he's doing that for ClickFunnels users. And we just appreciate that. We wanna make sure that we are giving to those people who are giving to us. So CF Pro Tools is a go-to tool. I absolutely love it. I use it every single time I do a funnel build for a client. Like it is the go-to. Now, another person that I wanted to highlight today is, it's still the same, can we keep that one up really quickly? And then thank you. The other person that I wanna highlight today is Winter Jones. Now, Winter Jones, we brought him on a ClickFunnels team. His brother helped build 1.0. He plays with the 1.0 code every once in a while and jumps in. He has created and is in the process of finalizing a ClickFunnels classic to 2.0 transfer tool. And this is a sneak peek at it. He's giving sneak peeks over on his personal profiles. Here's the deal. If you guys want this transfer tool, if you want the ability to transfer all of your ClickFunnels funnels into ClickFunnels 2.0, you wanna move classic to 2.0, because you know you've got a lot over there and it's time to make the move. And you would like a tool to make it simple. Tag Russell, tag Winter, and let them know that you guys are excited about it. That's Winter with a Y, okay? And you guys, this is a crazy tool that's coming down the pipeline. And while he's been working on it, making sure that the team is able to do all the things and get it all into pieces, he's created another tool, just because he's sitting on the side, you know, as this is waiting and getting this, and the team is like, you know what? I could do this really quick. And so he went and created yet another tool. This is free for everybody. This is a ClickFunnels membership outline transfer. If you have a ClickFunnels membership inside of 1.0, and you're looking to move it over to ClickFunnels 2.0, you can use this extension. It's a free extension that Winter has just created. He's just sharing it with everybody. You guys can use this and it will come in, copy the flow of your entire membership area and you can go into ClickFunnels 2.0 and just say import. You choose the membership area that you want to, you say the one that I just copied, and you click import and you'll see it. It just starts rapid firing. It just starts releasing absolutely everything. That is available right now. That's something Winter is testing. Okay, now some of these things are in beta, okay? But they're cool and they make life so much easier. And so for those people who are developing with ClickFunnels 2.0, Winter, we've also got Jamie. We've got so many more of you as you guys develop something shared in the community, please. We absolutely love you. We want to highlight you. We want to give out the shout outs. Make sure that you guys are sharing because we appreciate you massively. We know like there's some huge 2.0 updates. We'll talk about it in a second, but there's some crazy stuff. One last thing, if you guys have not checked out, there's a brand new user spotlight as well. There is so much news. So this is totally rapid fire. So you can see Lord Demetrius put out a new user spotlight with Christian and Emile. And Christian and Emile both have a agency building funnels. And so they share their story and how they do it. This is just one of many spotlights we've done. If you are a funnel builder and you're just looking to hear the story of people like you to know that you're not alone, we're capturing those stories for you in video form over on the YouTube channel inside of the user spotlight. And you want to be there because they are really, really good, especially this one from Christian and Emile. Yeah. Well, we've got one more topic to bring up. But before we do that, let's bring the trivia question back up because a lot of you have jumped on with us. A lot of you are in the comments, Justin, Mike, Laura is there. So, okay, so here's our trivia question for the day. You can get a beach towel and a water bottle to stay cool. In the perfect webinar script, what type of false belief does secret number one address? Is it A, internal, B, external, or C, the vehicle? So put your answer down in the comments. We'll bring the answer to you here in like just a minute or two and then we'll pick a winner after the episode. Yeah. And we'll give you the Keep Cool giveaway, which is a beach towel and a water bottle. Yes, yes. Ah, so cool. Okay. All right. How are you guys also like, how do you like this rapid fire style? Good. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Should we never do it again? Or do you love the quickness of it? Okay, last segment, ClickFunnels 2.0 staff. So this is the ClickFunnels 2.0 moment. And this is a lot about the ambassadors. So, then tell us about that. There's some crazy stuff going on. First off, the ambassadors wanted us to give a warning for you guys. If you are spamming people in their DMs, you will lose access to the ClickFunnels group. Watch out, they are smashing it. So be very, very careful what you're doing. But at the same time, we're doing a lot with the ambassadors. Ambassadors have a weekly Q&A that they're doing. So you guys are able to see that every single Wednesday. So there's one on Wednesday, if you guys, what is that, in two days, that you're definitely gonna wanna be a part of. That's an open Q&A with a whole big panel of groups. They bring a whole bunch of people in and they answer your questions live. What questions do you have about ClickFunnels? About strategy, about all these different things. But we've also started a new segment called ClickFunnels Demos, where Andy is getting on with different people in the ClickFunnels team, like Tim, and talking about how do you use ClickFunnels 2.0? What are the basics? What are the step-by-steps? So if you're looking at do that, we had one July 7th, that was the beginners' guided 2.0. We had one go live today. And the one that went today was with Andy and with Carlos. Carlos is awesome, by the way. So this is super, super cool. And there's this live Q&A. There's stuff going on massively inside of the ambassador program where we're just trying to give you more. So make sure you're paying attention to that. And just a quick, yes. As you see, there's a lot of awesome videos that are being dropped into the group, like how-to videos. Like we've got James Curran that you're pointing out here, who's on the ambassador's team. And they're just going, the whole team's going crazy, making videos that are helpful to you guys, to the community, to using ClickFunnels. So if there's anything that you would want to see specifically, make sure that you're showing up to those ambassador videos and letting them know in the comments so that we know what to make for you. The number one reason that, or number one way that you can say yes, you like it, is to put it on the calendar and show up. When you've got a question, just come. Let us know. It might be something super advanced. That's great. We'll ping Jamie Smith. We'll ping a couple other people on there. We'll ping Dan Havy. We'll get you the tools that you need in order to make sure that you're good to go because the ambassador team is prepared. Now, one thing I didn't show here. I have been wanting to do a pulse for a while with Russell. We haven't done one and Russell is crazy. Webinars, after trainings, after like, it's just a mad week. So if you guys want to know what's happening, you need to go to clickfunnels.com slash pulse. You need to see the updates because they are all jaw dropping. And we're trying to find out a way in order to get this information to you as quick as possible. We might need to hack a pulse here at some point, but there's some crazy amazing stuff. And there's stuff coming down the pipeline that you have been praying for, asking for, when is this going to happen? When is it going to happen? It's coming. And the things that are hitting right now are all the things that make that possible. And they're good. They're really, really good. Let me just go over here really quick over to my list of things. I'm just going to list out a couple of these really quick because there's some good stuff. We have more integrations being added. We have analytical graphs inside of orders now. You can filter, you can see the graphs. You can filter by custom attributes. So if you are asking specific questions, you can filter down to everybody who answered a specific way now. Inside of 2.0, you've got a new customer dashboard in the way. You've got reasons for orders and failures inside of like the hover over, like you'll see, oh, it failed. Why? You hover over it, it'll tell you why. You've got new notifications for customers. You've got email merge tags made simpler. You've got style guides. It made much, much, much simpler to manage. It's all getting to be the simple process that we want it. So make sure that you're following everything at quickfunnels.com slash pulse. Just go over and see what the new updates are because they just keep dropping and they're so good. And you know that there's more coming in preparation for FHL. So which by the way, we are in countdown mode. So in our speakers and news segment, this is FHL Funnel Hacking Live updates. We are countdown 79 days away from FHL. So what we have coming up this week, tomorrow, so Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, we have three speakers that are gonna be at FHL joining us here on Funnel Hacker TV. You can come and get to know them. Find out what their bonus is that they're throwing in when you go and buy your Funnel Hacking Live ticket. You get access to the speakers bonuses, which is awesome. We've had so many awesome things so far. Get put in. Anything from, we had Eric Thane give away his 60 second webinar, like his short script. We have someone giving away like their $10,000 value coaching course. Yeah. Full event. It's crazy. And like, So make sure that you're joining us for those. Steve Barsing gave away an event. It's crazy. And so, okay, so the people who are coming, just let me tease this, people who are coming this week. Number one is the person who runs the events for Tony Robbins. Okay. Tony Robbins, Dean Graziosi, you want to hear from that person. We've got somebody who did webinars from the Grand Canyon and does live webinars from different places and kills it at that. Just speaking of funnel hiking live. And then we've got another and they just keep coming. So make sure that you guys are subscribed. Updates. If you guys want text message every single time, let us know. The minute we start to text you too much, just let us know when the message, if we text you one too many times, this is a little too many times. And we'll start dialing back the amount because with the funnel hiking live speakers, we're dropping text messages all the time. We want to make sure that we are respecting your film. And so let us know if we're texting a little bit too much. If you just want to weekly recap at the end of the week for these funnel hiking live, or if you want this to go live, you want to hear every single one cause you want to be there. You guys let us know. We want to respect you, your phone, your notifications. But if you want to be on the end, get your notifications. Right there. All right. Oh my gosh. 79 days. Let's go. All right. We will see you guys back here tomorrow. Trivia. With some FHL speakers. Yes. Trivia. Oh, don't go yet. Thanks, Ben. I'm like, we're done. I'm not there. We're done. OK, trivia question. Let's do the question one more time. Perfect webinar script. What type of false belief does secret number one address? Is it internal, external, or vehicle? OK. The answer is to get the beach towel and the water bottle. Vehicle, right? We got secret number one. They have to be on board with the vehicle. The next one is secret number two addresses internal, and then secret number three addresses external. So vehicle is the answer. We will go through the comments. We'll see who's been putting the answer in there. And we will select one of you to get the keep cool combo of products of the towel and the water bottle. And we will tag you. We'll send you a message and tag you that you are the winner. So you will know if it's you. All right. Now we can say we will see you guys tomorrow for our FHL speaker episode. We'll see you guys later. See ya. My name is Russell Brunson. And I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started. And we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets. We have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happy every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you. It's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you. So if a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way, I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
