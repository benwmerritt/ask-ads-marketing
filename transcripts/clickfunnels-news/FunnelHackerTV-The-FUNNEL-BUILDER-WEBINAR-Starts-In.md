And he's just like, hey, I'm about to get on a flight for 24 hours and he's telling the story about the most like the best question that someone's ever asked him. And it was from Tre Llewelyn. And it was like, what, like all these books that you have, like which two books would you recommend that I read? Like if I could only read two books, what are they? So go check out his post because he also kind of hinted that he might share with you what, with us, what he's reading on his 24 hour flight. Like if he could only take one book with him, what is it gonna be? So go check that out. I'm like, oh, that's such a good question. Like what is Russell reading right now? Right? And it's like, it's been really interesting. There've been a couple of hints about books that he's been reading here and there. He read Good to Great for a while. He's been reading some books by Ben Hardy. 10X is easier than 2X. And what is he reading now? If you guys are wanting to know, you need to be following on social like, he's getting ready to travel.

And this is the same, this is the, like, so Russell's presented this. He's presented this training last year at FOMO Hacking Live. I saw it again somewhere else. And this is the training that I watched to get me into where I'm at today. Of like, okay, I'm on my way to being certified. I am learning all of the frameworks and strategy of all the different types of funnels. It's awesome. And 48 minutes, guys. Like I just verified the link is pinned to the top of the comments.

Yeah, it's gonna be a good one. It's gonna be so good. And if you guys stick around, I'll try to fill up some of the time. There's some really cool ClickFunnels 2.0 stuff I wanna show as brand new. So I'll try not to steal a bunch of time, but make sure you're registered. Yes. All right. Okay, let's highlight some of you. Our hacker heroes in the ClickFunnels community. There are a couple of people that I want to bring up. The first one is Jennifer Hall. She put a post into the community and I just loved seeing it in there. So I don't know why these ones are not working. I wonder if I can share my screen if it doesn't pull up. I do have it ready here. That is so weird. So every once in a while, so if you guys know we're using StreamYard in order to build a lot of these things. And every once in a while, we get all these assets ready and they actually don't play. It's really, really strange. Lena, let's go ahead and do this. Can you go ahead and remove the blog really quick and just see if that refreshes things? Yeah. And in the meantime, here is Jennifer Hall's post. So she gives a great story. It's like she's done a webinar before or something, right? Cause she actually goes through and does a great post of telling her journey in her entrepreneurship life so far. And there is ups and downs and she was really struggling with things. And then she finally like had some realizations and she walks through that on this post and then she actually went and did her first live webinar and she did awesome. And she gives kind of like what happened with that. And then she even, it was asking some questions, but I loved this at the end. It was only one decision away. So go read her post to figure out like, okay, what was the decision she had to make? It has these awesome pictures of her with Russell throughout her journey. And then I just loved, let me see if I can open up some of the comments. I loved seeing how much support was in here for her of just like awesome. Like you did it, congratulations. Thank you for sharing your story. Love seeing all the support happening in the ClickFunnels community. I love seeing you guys give back. It makes everything happy. Like number one is to see your wins, but to see us cheering on the wins as well. It brings that belief. Tim Shields was talking yesterday about how like when you watch everybody walk across the stage, like you have that moment of belief that I'm gonna do that, I can do that. And this is like that mini stage walk when somebody has a small win or a big win celebrating with them is celebrating the success in their life opens that pathway up for you. So thank you guys for giving your spectacular. All right, the next one, we'll see if this one works. I'm preparing for it to not work. For the next one is there's a new user spotlight out on the ClickFunnels YouTube channel. And it's working. Okay, so this is a highlight of Brennan. You guys name right? Schlagbaum. And he is telling his story about how he's a CPA. He's talking about how like, okay, this is what I was doing before. And then this is what I started to do with ClickFunnels once he learned some strategic stuff within ClickFunnels. And he talks about how it totally changed his business. He's now brought in his revenue is like, it's seven figures, he's brought in a million dollars and he's grown his social media, specifically Instagram, I believe, to hundreds of thousands of followers. And his story is just incredible. So make sure that you guys are checking out those user spotlights on YouTube. The stories are so awesome and inspirational. And if you're like out there and you're like, oh, I'm kind of in that industry. I wanna go see what this person did. He used a book, a book of call funnel for his business. Like that's the only funnel he's using. And he's doing that, like he's offering CPA services. So really incredible. Go check that out for sure. That is crazy. You know, it's funny, like every once in a while, somebody has like an inline on like how to do something on TikTok, how to do something on Instagram, how to do this. And like they're sharing it. Make sure that you guys are part of the community. You're watching, you're getting the updates from the emails, all those because gold be dripping everywhere. We wanna make sure that you're catching it. That is awesome. You guys okay if we walk through 2.0 for a little minute? Cause there's a couple of updates that were just amazing. Can we have a 2.0 moment? Let's do it. 2.0 moment. There's like, Ben was showing me the list of all the things that we can't go through all of them. Like we gotta sit. We can't talk about all of them. Russell's like. I can do this. Okay. But the list of things that are coming out for 2.0 is just insane. It's awesome to see. Yeah. All right. Let's see how many I can get in because Russell's gonna wanna keep some of these to himself in order to do it on the next pulse, but let's see what we can do. All right. So first off, how many of you are using email inside of 2.0 at this point? So if you've been waiting like, ah, the system isn't set up. Like it requires me to set up domains. It's doing this weird thing where it says you need DKIM settings. I just went and I created a new account because as of two days ago, late at night, we created a new system setting. So that way when you create your, add your marketing settings, all you have to do when you create your new account now is to update your name and email address, or not email address, your business name and your business address. So that way all your marketing details are there. And we have created all of the settings in the back end. So you can send out an email instantly right after you do this. So you just put in your details here and save, and you can start sending emails in a workflow, emails in broadcast. You can do all those things instantly. It's now available for you. That is unlocked. And so we just made your life, I don't know how much easier, Susan, when you heard this, you were like, oh my gosh, yes, thank you, finally. A lot, a lot easier. Oh, yes. You guys are building for clients. This is so nice. Because otherwise the system was you needed to add a domain. Once you add domain, you need to make sure that all the DKIM settings are set up. And it was the technical stuff that we can automate on the back end. And we finally got it dialed in and locked in. And now it's live. And life is so much easier. So number one gift for you in the email system, getting set up and sending emails is now massively easier done. Number two, we created a couple of new templates. So Russell, once upon a time, Russell, let's see, which one is it? This one. We created this template. Russell said, I want a simple template. I don't want it to be complicated. And it should look like my emails. And so the team created something that looked like this. And Russell said, yes, but no. I want something that works like we had in Classic. And so this is what has been done. So if now if you come over to broadcasts and you create a broadcast, you have a whole bunch of templates that are available. Okay. Then there are three new templates that are available that we've moved over from ClickFunnels Classic to here. They are Classic Email 1, Classic Email 2, and number three. And let me show you what they look like really quick because it's taking a little while. This is the first one. If you guys use ClickFunnels Classic, you may recognize it. All right. So very simple email here, nothing complicated. But it shows you just the basics. And then Russell said, I want the footer that I use that's been working for years. I want that at the bottom of these emails too. So we went and added those in as well. Okay. So you've got this email template that's done for you. You've got this one. You guys remember this one once upon a yesteryear. It's a little older, but the design is glorious. And once you get it dialed, then you can save this as a template very, very, very, very, very easily. There's whole how-to docs for this stuff to take you step by step. But the third one looks like this. So we've created three new designs. They are in there. And I kind of wanted to go an extra mile. And so I spent a couple of hours hitting up the team and saying, you know what? Russell's been talking about the Lynch pin a lot lately. He's been talking a lot about creating email newsletters. What if we created email newsletter templates for you guys? What would that be like? What would it look like? And the team said, yes, let's absolutely get it in. And boom, so I created two of them. Here's the first one. So if you're back in here and you're creating it, just come on up. There's the previews. So there's three are available. Now, if you want to do a newsletter, here's the basic newsletter and then the full newsletter. I'm going to show you what both of those look like. The basic newsletter looks like this. You add your logo, you just put in the title, and then you can put in all your details. This is a past newsletter that is acting right now in the Funnel Builder Marketplace. If you want to understand what the Funnel Builder Marketplace is, go to funnelbuilder.com, sign up for that webinar before it's live in less than an hour. We'll talk all about the marketplace in there. So you're going to want to pay attention to that. But this is one of the emails that we send out to everybody. Lee actually sends us out. Lee is spectacular. Lee has been sending these emails out every single week. And they are a heavy dose of a newsletter. Like it has number one. It starts with tips. Then it goes into an origin story. Like here's someone's story of them doing spectacular. And it talks about how you can do that. A tip from a fellow community member. Here's Alex Hermosi, Maxwell Maltz, James Clear, Napoleon Hill. You got quotes from all these different people. This is just what he is doing for our marketplace newsletter. But the template is now available for you. So if you would like this template and you would like to use it for your own newsletter, it's available for you. It is the ClickFunnels, or it's the basic newsletter template. But I went and also created a fancy one. So I went and funnel hacked a couple of newsletters that I love. I went and started hacking newsletters the minute Russell started talking about it and the Lynch pin. And I went and found this basic template. And this is something we've been thinking of doing is some type of a newsletter. So we've been drafting and playing with it. And this template is now available for you. So that way you guys have a table of content you can create. You can write each one with a hook, a story, an offer. You can do this over and over and over. Make sure that they have all the links for what's happening this week. You can organize this any way you want. This is a template that's available for you. You guys are able to use this. This is available for you right now inside of your ClickFunnels accounts. All five email templates are now available. Congratulations. At no charge. We just want to over deliver if that sounds OK to you. It's so awesome. I love those templates. Really quick. Let me go ahead and add one to this actually really quick. Have you noticed this really quick? So if I select the full newsletter template, there's something that we've made really easy for you. I'm just going to keep laying on a couple of these until Susan's like, Ben, it's too much. Ben, it's too much. We got time. Let's do it. We got some time. Let's go. So when you guys are setting up your templates, there is a process that you can do. Have you, has anyone ever heard of a merge tag before? So a merge tag is something where you're able to insert your customers' details into the page. So that way, if I want to say, you know what, call out that person's first name here and then talk to them. If I want to be able to put that in, we can do that. And now we just made it easier for you. So you don't have to know what the merge tags are off the top of your head. You can do this yourself. So for example, when you're typing in here, there's this tag right here. So instead of, hey, funnel hackers, if I want it to be hey, first name, all I have to do is click on merge tags and then choose which one I want to plug in. Hey, first name. OK. Now, I could, once I got all of this drafted the way I like it, I can do save and exit. And merge tags have now been simplified in the subject line creation as well. So once this saves, check this out. So if I come down, let's go to the subject line and say, hey there. And I click over, see this right here? Merge tags. We've made this simple over and over. So hey there, first name. Check this out. OK. We've made that simpler for you as much as possible so that way you guys can get your email systems working simpler than ever. This is the entire goal of the system. It is we've been doing an overhaul on all these things, simplifying. ClickFunnels 2.0 is a powerhouse. We'll remain a powerhouse and it will become bigger and more powerful. And our job as we do that is to simplify all these things for you so that way you can move forward easily with as little technical know-how as possible. Is that good so far? Yes. There's one more thing having to do with merge tags, though, that I'm like, oh. So this is a feature. Yeah, so as you're pulling it up, let me tell my experience with it. So there's a step. Is that what we're calling them? Inside of the workflows where you can have a notification. And I discovered this really early. I'm like, oh, yes. I haven't had a client who we built a funnel. And it was to book a call. And we were like, OK, well, let's put in a notification step into the workflow so that it emails her every time someone actually gets to this point in the workflow that we know. Actually, it was for a contact form. It wasn't a call. It was a contact form. So it was on her contact page in her hub. And we needed to know every time someone filled that out. And I wanted their details to get sent to her. We couldn't do it at the time. Now you can. Yes. All right, so really quick. So I built a funnel really quick before we went live because I'm like, oh, it's easy to build a funnel in 2.0. So I went and I built out a funnel really quick. And this is the page. So just as a preview, this is an example. OK, so help us build a better community together. Apply to join our animal rescue ambassador programs and more details below. If I want to sign up, I can put all of my details in and choose. Do I want to work weekends? Do I want to work part-time, full-time? You can make as many questions as you want through the entire process. And then when you submit, you go to a thank you page. I already tested this sucker. I already know it works. But let me show you what we did. So now every time somebody applies, it fires off that workflow right there, that email workflow that I've connected. So I'm just going to click on that. Go ahead and open it and check this out. The first thing that I do is I apply a tag to them so that way I can find them in the future and be like, ah, these are the people who've applied. And the second thing that I do is I set up a notification. So let me add a new notification real quick just so you can see it. So when you add a step in your workflows for your email and messaging and all that stuff, you just come down here. You can see the notifications as one of the options here. Click on that sucker. And you're able to create your notification and choose who gets it. So you choose the team member that you want to notify. And then you say, you've got an application. And then I can grab their first name, their last name, and then their email address, and their phone number. It's so awesome. Yeah, so before I was kind of hodging it together, I was like, OK, how can I get them some information that's helpful? And now it's in there. It's great. We get to have custom information in there, which is awesome. It's so much easier. And the thing is, it works. So I went and I tested it. And I just wanted to see really quick. And so I went and tested it and just opted in myself. I got the notification. It's working gloriously. Ben Moot has subscribed to your application. Oh, wow, notification of Ben Moot. And one last thing, just really quick. If you're having people, you have those custom inputs where you want them to fill out the full application. And then you want to filter by that. So if you go to all of your contacts and you go to Filter, you can now create a filter that goes through that. So at the very bottom of these options, you see all of the custom variables you've created. So why are they applying? What position are they applying for? So I want to see everybody who's applied to work weekends. I click Apply and boom. It shows the people who applied for weekends. OK, Ben, Jam and Moot is ready to start jamming. There are so many updates that are just dripping out. That's just another one. The notifications is one merge tags throughout. There is so much happening inside of 2.0. The best way to stay on top of it, I'm going to be absolutely honest, is come up here to this notification icon and just click See All Changes. You can also see this at clickfunnels.com slash pulse goes to the same page. You can find a way to come here. You can see all the different things. We just created a way for you to manage your styles. We just created a way for you to see your bounce rates and to make sure that your emails are bouncing appropriately and healthy. We just talked about merge tags. All the things that you want to stay on top of are here. All the things that you want to request are right here. Make sure that you're sending in your request. Make sure you're paying attention to those things because there is so much happening on the Dev side. We're making some magic for you guys. Is that OK for a 2.0 moment? You guys OK for the lower on that? That was awesome. I see napkins in the comments, mind blown. Justin so groovy. Danny is saying wicked. Awesome updates. And it's like these little things that make such a huge difference in how we can do things quickly and do it more effectively. And so it's really awesome that they're putting those little things out there right now. Exactly. And if you want to be a funnel builder, if you're trying to do this for somebody else, we just made that massively simple. And we're going to keep simplifying the people that we talked to in order to figure that out, the people that we try to understand are those people who are in the agency program and are going through these different things and are getting certified. And so, my friends, if you are even interested in understanding what kind of secrets are tossed around inside of the certification and what it looks like in that whole process, Russell's going live in 28 minutes. You want to be there? Be there because it's going to be absolutely spectacular. All right, we did it. Look, we did it in 30 minutes. Hey! All right, you guys, thanks for joining us today. Make sure you're signed up for the webinar. Go join in 30 minutes. And that's it for us this week. We'll be back next week with a full stack of more FHL speakers that we are bringing on to get to know them. And they can share their bonuses when you go buy your tickets at funnelhackinglive.com. And so we will see you then. See you then. Bye. My name is Russell Brunson. And I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started. And we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnelhacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way. I use the funnelhacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories. MUSIC
