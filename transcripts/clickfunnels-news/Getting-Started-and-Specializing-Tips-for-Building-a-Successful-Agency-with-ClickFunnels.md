Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels, and today I'm speaking with Ryan McCrary. Ryan runs an ad agency called the Funnel Doctor, where he builds done-for-you funnels for his clients and also does ad management and email automation. Welcome, Ryan. Thanks for joining me. Hey, how you doing, Laura? I'm so excited to be here. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Of course. Thanks for being with me. So can you get started by telling us a little bit about your background and kind of what brought you to this point today? Yeah, absolutely. So my professional background is actually in finance, you know, believe it or not. So I went to school, even before that, I went to school in Philadelphia, Temple University, I have a degree in sociology. So like completely different from what I do today. But after college, I was just looking for a job in my field, do like social work or social services, and I couldn't find a job. So nobody would hire me in that field. It was like around 2011, right after the 2008 recession. So it wasn't that easy to find a job anyway. So I actually started working in finance, first working with annuities and insurance products, and then with stocks and mutual funds and IRAs and stuff like that. And after a few years in corporate America, I hated my job. You know, I did not want to go up the corporate ladder. I was doing something I was not passionate about. And I always, you know, had the entrepreneur bug and I really just took a leap of faith and became an entrepreneur. Didn't know what I was doing. I was very naive. And I really didn't understand how hard it was to actually build a company and have sustainable revenue. So the first business I had out of corporate was actually in finance, working with information products, I wrote a book and stuff like that. And that's when I discovered digital marketing and click flicks. I was completely blown away because again, I didn't have my corporate job anymore. So I had to make money as an entrepreneur. For me, it was non-negotiable. You know, I had to make money to feed myself and my family. So just learning digital marketing, learning about funnels, you know, discovering click funnels, literally saved my business, saved my career. Wow. So at what point did you decide that running an agency was for you after having different businesses and being bitten by the entrepreneur bug? What made you want to run an agency? Yeah, that's a great question. So, you know, when I first learned digital marketing, I literally dove head first. So I was learning everything, you know, Red Russ's books. Just learned about marketing and like the online marketing world. And, you know, using it in my other business, I started to get success. And then when I started meeting a lot of entrepreneurs, you know, I would indirectly start helping them. I'm like, hey, you know, you have a landed page. Let me make it a little bit better. You know, let me put some direct response messaging on there. Let me help your ad campaign. Let me do stuff just indirectly. And I started getting good at it. So after I started getting results from myself and then other people, I really thought about like, do I want to actually make this an agency? Do I want to shift business models? I don't actually know how to run an agency. I was definitely scared going into it. But like I said, it just really came from getting results myself and then someone else. And then I made a decision. I put, you know, a flag in the sand. I said I want to actually go to an agency to actually do this full time, you know, as a business. So why click funnels? I don't know. I don't know if you have enough time for that. But you know, for me personally, it's more than just a soft yes to soft. Where's amazing? Yes. It does all the things that we needed to do as an online marketer as far as lead capture, you know, offer, making our offers, OTOs, order bumps, everything, you know, we need to do to increase the card value, increase the lifetime value for our customers. But I love the community. You know, I go to every funnel heck of like ever since 2020, I've been every funnel heck of live since, you know, big fan of Russell's, of course, I read all the books. And I can literally say, I'm not just saying that was cliche. It literally has changed my life, you know, because the amount of money I've been able to make from learning these principles, using the softwares, applying it in my business, I've been able to quadruple my corporate salary just from learning this stuff, implementing it and getting access to the people in the community. Wow. So you were fully engulfed in the community and everything that is click funnels besides just the software. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I mean, the first time I saw like one of Russell's videos, I was literally hooked. I know hook story offer. He hooked me told me a story made the offer to join the platform. But I literally was hooked because it was just like, it was just something about like one of the first videos that I, you know, saw from him. And it was like very relatable and like he really understood, especially us as bootstrap entrepreneurs. I don't have a core. I don't have any funding. I don't have venture capitalists. I've never been on a shark tank. I never did crowdfunding. So me as someone who was like literally trying to bootstrap it, it spoke to me. So ever since then, you know, first book actually read expert secrets before I read dot com secrets. So I read expert secrets first and then I that was the introduction to the world. Then I read dot com secrets. When traffic secrets came out, I read that, you know, I was able to go to the first follow heck of life in 2020. And ever since then I've been going. Amazing. And it's funny how that resonates with so many people, the non venture capitalists bootstrapping yourself, running your own business, like you doing all of the things yourself. And when you think about hook story offer and how you're hooked as a marketer, following a marketer, you not only realize, wow, this person hooked me, but like, wait a minute, this works. And if I'm going to model after this, I know that this is a proven method. So it's really cool. Absolutely. So tell me a little bit about your client base. Do you work with a certain niche or do you have all different types of clients in different industries? Yeah, we work with, you know, various businesses. One of the niches that we do specialize in is accident travel. So we work with a lot of travel agencies, a lot of travel businesses. We found that niche like kind of right after the pandemic because as we know, that was one of the biggest industries hit during the pandemic was travel. You know, so during that time people that were running travel businesses, travel agencies, you know, they had to reflight a lot of people their money. They literally could not travel and it was like a really big thing in their business where a lot of businesses went out of business. But coming out of the pandemic, everybody wanted to travel yet. You know, so if you get any airport, if you travel, you go on Twitter, everything's booked. You know, so we just kind of indirectly fell into that ditch. And we just started, you know, of course, trying to get everyone. But then there was certain travel businesses that we were working with. And we really started getting some amazing results for them. You know, so, you know, three of the main components that we do for them is number one community base. A lot of them have Facebook groups. So we try to use funnels and traffic to, you know, fill up their Facebook community, give our people in there. Definitely lead generation for businesses struggling in general because they don't have enough leads. So for our clients, we, you know, generate tons of leads for them and stuff like that. And the third is just to get their trip sold out. It is as many people as possible. And a lot of that comes through retargeting because most people, especially when it's a cold lead, they're not ready to spend $3,000, $5,000 for a trip right away. But if they join a community, if they get on your list, if they see some more messaging, then they're more inclined to actually book. So that's the three pillars that we work with with our travel agencies. But we do, you know, work with a lot of other companies, but really try to niche down more. That's really cool. In fact, I think you're the first person I've spoken with that as a funnel builder works in that industry or has mentioned travel or working directly with travel agencies, which I think is really cool. So what funnel would you say is the most effective for that industry? Yeah, and we tested a few. The one that's been really lucrative right now is the virtual summit funnel. You know, so we have a client, they actually do one every month. And they have like a different fee, you know, so I think May was around like Mother's Day or something like that. They did one last month around like spring, spring fling stuff when it's fall, they do stuff around fall. So they have different themes every month. I do a virtual summit funnel, it's like a three day virtual free free virtual event. And at the end of it, they launch a new trip. It has been really successful. They do six figures in that funnel a month right there. So the model is, you know, it's free. It's a free summit, you drive traffic to the funnel. Sometimes they do a little, you know, OTO or a little trip wire, something like that. But then once some registers all the messaging is about attending attending attending, attending why you need to attend, then they do the virtual summit and then they make the offer at the end. Really cool. So education about travel going to different places and the offer is about a specific trip that people can sign up for. That's really cool. I can imagine that that's pretty effective being a summit and people can get warmed up and excited about. It is. And another thing I love about the travel industry or just as business specifically is they sell higher price stuff. And as we all know with all this stuff online and iOS and just acquisition costs increasing, you need your bottom line, you need your offer to actually, you know, be substantial. So that's how the people like about it and it's lucrative and we can spend more on the front end because they have a bigger ticket sale on the back end. Awesome. Do you have a favorite type of funnel that you like to build for your clients? Um, that's probably my favorite. Another one is just an online challenge funnel, you know, is another one that we love to build. A lot of people will think, you know, for travel or even certain businesses, we actually did e-commerce one recently as well. But a lot of people will think, you know, for travel, like, how can I do a summit like what, you know, what type of summit or I'm sorry, what type of challenge would I do? Those bags like what result do you want to give me? You know, because most of the time people don't want to travel just to travel. They want to travel because they need more freedom. Yeah. And with their family or wait for family, you know, they need time away from their job or they're stressed out or like whatever, you know, things that go on all their day to day life. There are certain pain points and stuff like that. So we can do a challenge that speaks to that on a given different locations. A lot of people only know certain places and certain trips, but there are tons of other places that a lot of people have never been to. So just sharing their experience as well. Yeah. That's an interesting new perspective on thinking about how to use challenges to grow your business. I like that. Absolutely. So do you have any specific goals that you've set for you and your agency over the next several years? Yeah, absolutely. So we're not going to endure it at seven figures. So we are on track to hopefully get our two common club award this year. Amazing. Yeah, we're almost there. So once we get that seven-figure threshold and of course then it's eight figures and beyond. But really just to be able to help more businesses, iron with people I'm big on, you know, giving other people employment opportunities and that type of stuff. And it's really changed more lives. You know, I love what I do being in years past of just not liking my day to day and you know, just, you know, not being passionate about the work I did. So being able to just do what I love to do and just continue doing and continue to serve more people. That's our ultimate goal. It's a powerful message too. And I think that will resonate with a lot of people who are working those nine to fives where they just feel like they're getting stale or bored with what they're doing or they don't really feel a whole lot of purpose. I know that I started to feel that purpose when I started working with other entrepreneurs and seeing the drive that they have and people that are running their own agencies or creating their own business or selling e-com or learning how to be a coach. It's just so exciting to be motivated by all of those entrepreneurs that are like, this is what I'm doing. This is what I was, you know, here on earth for and they're serving up their calling, which is so fun. So you mentioned being engulfed in the ClickFunnels community and that with that you know a lot about Russell. You've read the books. You've attended all the funnel hacking lives. Will you be there at the one in September? Yes, I will. Amazing. Well, hopefully we will see you walk across that stage and collect that two comma club award. Yes. Do you have any, uh, how are full piece of advice that you would offer to a fellow entrepreneur or somebody who's maybe thinking about starting their own agency and it's just getting started? Yeah, um, no one just start. I think a lot of people, you know, handicapped themselves before the evening started on trying to build things the perfect way. You know, so many roadblocks that just exist in their minds. You know, let's say like just get started for agency specific. And I wish I would have done this years ago was being niche specific, you know, because even in the agency world and the marketing world, the direct response digital marketing world, there's so many different ways you can go. It could be in PPC SEO, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, TikTok content, social media management, funnels, email like SMS, like there's so many things to do. I would say really specialize in like what you are specifically good at. I think that's the way to go. You know, of course, use click funnels for all things marketing, all things landing pages, all things, you know, upsells and any type of payment you have to process and stuff like that. But I would say you definitely just get started. You know, get into the click funnels community of course access to books and stuff like that. And then last thing is be really, really clueless on your apps. That's another thing that I would say, you know, I did it all the way know when I was first starting out. You know, I wanted to serve a lot of people when you know anybody can get this like you want to be really, really specific on who is for understanding the pain points and then being able to articulate how your business can help solve a problem that they have. Yeah, do you think it's fair for people to start their business as kind of a generalist and then hone in on their craft and then start to develop and understand what their niche is or what their avatar is or if they need to get more specific and in what they want to market. I think that's okay. You know, ideally, like you would, you know, want to know that beforehand, but I'm living proof of someone who did not do that. And we still were able to, you know, be successful and still trying to grow. So the main thing I would say is just get started because you also may see what you like and what you don't like. You know, so going in as a generalist, then you can see what you like and then you can also see who you get results for best. So that's another reason why I've been able to find the mission I have is we just saw that we can get really, really good results for this niche. I like working with this niche. And if I didn't necessarily know that going in. So I think it's definitely okay to do that. Just get started, start where you are and then grow from there. Yeah, I think that's really great advice for anyone who wants to start working with clients is like it's okay to not have a specific client type. But if you want to work with people, get those first few clients, work for them, see how the success comes and then determine like what works for you. What do you enjoy? What do you like? And I think that you're living proof of that and it's really cool to see that you've built a business from that and seen success. So it's been so awesome talking to you today.
