How's it going everybody? Welcome to Fuddle Hacker TV. So excited to have you guys here. If you guys have been here for a while, we're gonna talk about a lot of cool stuff. I wanna tease everything, but it's Susan's day. I want Susan to do it because it's good stuff. Russell's been all over the place, up, down, smash. Like, it's gonna be good. So make sure that you guys are ready and share this out with everybody. Let us know that you guys are here live. Let's roll the intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Fuddle Hackers and these are our stories. MUSIC What's up everybody? Welcome to Fuddle Hacker TV. I'm Susan Lennerson. I'm Ben Moot. And we are in... Russell's office. Yeah, we're in Russell's office. We're broken again. The reason why we are here together in Russell's office doing Fuddle Hacker TV is because there's an event happening tomorrow, the groundbreaking of a new building. So we're gonna talk about that more in a little bit, but we're gonna talk about that. We are going to be... Russell was in an airplane not very long ago. Like less than an hour ago. And he landed, he's actually back in the office. He popped in here real quick before we went live and was telling us about the airplane experience. It was so cool. So we're gonna show some of that. And why was he in an airplane this morning? And then we're gonna highlight a bunch about the community today. We have some FHL news coming up that is going to be primarily running our episodes. So we wanna focus a lot today on community. So we're gonna tell you more about what FHL news we're talking about too, coming up. Did I hit all the things? Oh, and we have a trivia and treasures today. We do! Who wants swag? Who wants swag? Every time I come to the office, I'm like, where's the swag? There's gotta be stuff sitting around. What's with me giving away? Yeah. So actually, let's just do that now. Let's pull up the trivia question. We're gonna give away one of these awesome quick funnels, water bottles, mine sitting right over here. I love them. But the question is, what is the Atlas Research Center going to be? So that is what the groundbreaking is for tomorrow. So what is that though? What is Atlas Research Center? So is it A, a research center for Russell to be Elon Demars? Yes, that's what it is. Put your answer down in the comments, right? B, oh, and I totally forgot to tell you guys to sign up for stuff. We'll do that in a second. B, is it a library to preserve the ideas of influential people? Is it C, an event center for influential people to present their ideas? Or is it D, is it both A and C? So let us know your answer in the comments and we'll select one of you to win an awesome quick funnels water bottle, which I love. Yeah. I want it to be A and C personally, but yeah. A and C would be awesome. A, B, S. I want everybody to go to Mars with Russell instead of Elon and then I want us all to be enjoying events. Yes. Okay, so I totally forgot, you guys are gonna wanna make sure you're subscribed to us because tomorrow I think we're gonna be doing some sneak peek stuff. There's a lot of fun stuff coming up in the coming weeks. So make sure you have texted FHTV 22082313797, and then you can also get email notifications and watch all the past episodes at funnelhacker.tv. And then there's some cool stuff coming up. There's some cool stuff. Okay, so I flew in on Saturday or Sunday. I flew in on Sunday night. So I've been here all week and I've been in the office watching everybody going crazy. Like it is just everyone trying to get ready for what's happening tomorrow. For those of you who don't know, the Atlas Research Center is breaking ground. So everybody who has gotten a seat, everybody who watched Seekers of Success, who watched the entire unveiling of the event center, that's happening tomorrow. They are breaking ground. All the people who bought a seat are flying in. They get to go and tour the library. So like when I'm not working, like doing crazy on all the projects Russell has me doing, like he had, I've been running to the libraries and like setting things up. So we set up the PT Barnum display. Today he's getting brand new like canvas images. Oh, so cool. And they are so sick. I can't wait to see it. It's gonna be so cool. So tomorrow's the groundbreaking and it's gonna be really cool. We even have friends coming. Yeah, we have friends coming in. It's gonna be like a half, almost an all day event. It's gonna be crazy. A lot of cool people coming in. So what we thought we would do, if you guys want, you gotta tell us if you even want it, is that we might show you some stuff tomorrow. Let us know. Yeah, do you wanna see it? We're gonna be there. Do you wanna see it? Like this is like, this is as close curtain as it gets. Like people had to spend at least $50,000 to be in the room, at least $50,000 or a hundred thousand or 200,000 or a million dollars to be here. This is not something that we're just gonna be streaming out to everybody. This is not one of those streaming events. This is very closed door. Like I was thinking about actually wearing a shirt with cuff links tomorrow. I don't know if I will. But like it's one of those fancy occasions. And so I'm trying to figure out how much do you guys want to see? And if you guys wanna see it, maybe what we'll do is we'll just do an impromptu live sometime tomorrow, but you guys need to let us know that you want it. Otherwise, we will just appreciate hanging out with all these really cool people. It's gonna be really, really fun. Yeah, yeah, okay. So that's so exciting. Okay. And yeah, so yesterday Russell was preparing all this stuff. Love to see it, Tommy. Wonderful. I'm just checking you guys making sure we're all good. A lot of answers for a trivia question. This is awesome. My friend Joseph, that's, we do not drop links. My friend, that is against quick funnels rules. Love you, appreciate you. Tommy, nice to see you. All right, so, okay. Yesterday, Russell was preparing like the groundbreaking stuff, right? And something happened to his eye. Does anybody know? So Russell's been sharing all this stuff on Instagram. So we're getting the groundbreaking ready. We got actually those two tractors out there right now. And it's really cool. And they're getting everything ready. And Russell was getting ready to record and a piece of metal flew into his eye now. And it's like this shard. And like he went to the doctor and like it had rust on it, all the stuff. So like, I can't, I'm not gonna give you guys the whole story. If you're not following Russell, you should be. Like it's, I was like, oh my gosh. Like I saw him like, he walks into the room and he's like, hi. I'm like, what's going on? He goes, oh no, my eye hurts. I'll be back. And just walks out the back door. I'm like, okay. So if you guys wanna hear the whole story, make sure that you're following Russell because it was really interesting. Like there was rust on the piece and all this stuff. And like he's in healing right now. Actually, he's, he landed flying and ran to the room. He wanted to jump on live with us, but he's like, I'm gonna be recording. He's recording today because he couldn't record yesterday. So really cool story. You guys wanna catch all of it. But Russell was in the air less than an hour ago. Yeah. Why was he in the air? Okay. So if you've been following Russell, he was posting about it. He, great. Like I don't know how long this was planned. But this was like, you know, pops up onto social media and you're like, okay, this is what Russell's doing today. Awesome. So there he is. He's walking out to this airplane. And this is Bill Allen. He has spoken at FHL before. He's an awesome, awesome entrepreneur, he's also a pilot. And so they did a podcast interview. In the air. In the air. So awesome. So he, Russell posted a lot of things about it. You can definitely go watch all of that to get the full story. But yeah. Yeah. He was like, I'm gonna fly and I'm gonna land it. And I'm like, oh my gosh, like we just need to make sure that he comes into the office and you know, he's alive. So if you guys wanna update, like he just posted the updates, like the whole social team was there. Apparently it had like two seats in the front and four really tight seats in the back. So everybody was like, enough space for the cameras. Yeah. So they were all like smashed in there. And like, it was cool. Russell was like, oh my gosh, like I got to fly over my house. I got to, because Bill apparently was doing one of those like drops. Oh yeah. Like the G drops or something like that. And he's like, oh my gosh. The little, the little queasy, but he was laying like, he got to wave at Colette down on the ground. So awesome. We get, that's not on his post. That's what he was telling us right before when he was in his office. So that's why we watched Funnel Hacker TV. You guys get inside information. But yeah, let's, he thankfully has landed. He's back in the office. He's safe. We don't need the cash in on that insurance policy. So we're good. We're not doing that. So Russell's landed, everything's good. So we went from flying to tomorrow's groundbreaking and we've got so much new stuff that's coming. Like we were trying to announce the stuff that's new. So we're about to change Funnel Hacker TV for a little bit. Temporarily. Temporarily. Temporarily. We're going to, Yes, we're going to, we're going to adjust it for just a little bit temporarily. And we're going to talk to you about what that is, but really quick before that, Wednesday, just yesterday, we had our very first Ambassador Weekly. And the Ambassador Weekly, so you guys all know we have ClickFunnels Ambassadors. These are people who have been a part of the community, who have been a part of the movement and who support the movement so much so that we're like, please just go live in the Facebook group anytime you can and give to people. So all of them went live yesterday that we could get on. And they started to talk about, they started to introduce each other person after person after person. So you could see all of them. And then they took questions from you. So seriously, if you want to be able to, it's every Wednesday at 11 a.m. Mountain Standard Time, they will be talking and taking questions. You guys watch most of it. Yeah, so they jumped on yesterday was the first time. A lot of the Ambassadors were able to jump on yesterday. And you get to know them. You get to know who they are. The every one of them told their story of like, how did they even find out about ClickFunnels? Why do they use ClickFunnels? And get to show, kind of tell and show a little bit of what their expertise is. So one of the questions that they were asked is like, okay, what are you helping within the group right now? What questions are you going to answer? And so that's really helpful for you guys. You can get to know each of the Ambassadors and know what questions you could be asking them. And even begin to know and rely upon, okay, if I have this kind of question, then Dan Hady is going to come help me. If I have this kind of question, then Reedy is going to come help me, right? And you're going to get to know them a little bit better. So definitely go watch that one from yesterday, where they all kind of get introduced. There was Dan Hady, Reedy, Penchall, not sure on her last name, I'll have to, Reedy, you got to help me out with that one. Winter Jones is on there, James Curran, Angie Apere had a slight appearance. And then Tim, Pitsenberger, he works for ClickFunnels and he was on there too talking about some stuff. He's been, the whole Ambassador team and Tim have been, and Danny Walsh and Andy Ortega were also on, right? They're running the thing. Everybody's been making short how-to tip videos that have started to show up in the group. So you're going to see all of them on those videos. And if you have questions, the goal is to go and make some videos to show you to answer those questions. Cause chances are if you have that question, other people have that same question. So don't be afraid to pop up and ask. On 2.0 has a lot of people who are arguing questions about 2.0. This is the people that you want to talk to when you're trying to figure out, how do I get this off into work? What do I need to get to my, to get my emails to be going out? What all those different things like, how do I set up a workflow and conditional paths? Or just the basics. Like how do I make this look good? These are the people you want to talk to. They'll create a video custom for you. So make sure that you are reaching out, doing that. If you haven't seen that yet, do it. It's tagged inside of the ClickFunnels area inside of ClickFunnels group. So just go to ClickFunnels group, which you should be watching this and now and just go over there and go ahead and sign up for that and ask any questions that you want. They're going to be doing that every single week. And so we're here, we're showing you everything that's going on behind the scenes. And we're kind of giving you announcements and stuff, which is something we're going to talk about in a minute. But they're there in order to help you in depth with 2.0. We like doing the 2.0 highlights here and there. So we'll still do that. They're like actually answering questions on that live too. Like in real time, they're asking you to put the questions in the comments and then they're going to start. Yesterday was a lot of introduction, moving forward. I think they're going to be answering a lot of questions in real time. So it's almost like a Q&A session. So it's like. It's asking me anything with ClickFunnels power users. And so like, it doesn't matter what level you're at. There's no stupid question. This is for you. So definitely make sure that you're there. One thing that we are doing, we're changing Funnel Hacker TV for just a little bit. For 97 days. 97 days. Why would we change Funnel Hacker TV for 97 days? What's going on? 97 days, we have Funnel Hacking Live. Funnel Hacking Live is hitting in 97 days. And we get to be able to interview the speakers and so starting next week, we're going to be changing the format of Funnel Hacker TV. Every once in a while, we're going to be having a speaker come on and when we do, it's going to be a full on interview. We get to talk to them, we get to talk about that. There will be giving stuff that we talk about, what they're talking about so that you get kind of a glimpse into what's going on. So make sure that you are signed up. It's going to be really good. Yeah. So we have, this is starting next week, by the way. Yeah. Do we tell them? Should we drop the names? Should we? I don't. Okay. Let's drop the initials. So you people know. You guys can guess. So on Tuesday, we have SL. Who is SL? Come in to hang out with us. Okay. Do you remember Thursday's? Thursday is KY. Is it KY? CY? KY. Or CY. I don't know. I can't remember. I have to check. CY or KY. I think you're right. I think it might be C. I don't know. Okay. So SL and C or KY is coming on over. We're so excited to be able to have them. We're going to be talking to them on Tuesday and Thursday. And because of that, that's going to take up our entire episode is being able to talk to them and talk about what they're giving people who are coming to Funnel Hacking Live. Cause believe it or not, they have special gifts for you. We want to highlight that. So number one, if you want to know who they are, your number one job is to make sure that you are signed up at funnelhacker.tv. We're going to send an email out to everybody who's on the ClickFunnels list. So if you're already getting emails from ClickFunnels, you'll get it. You'll get the announcement of who we're interviewing and when for each week. So you will get that. However, if you're not getting those emails, make sure you go to funnelhacker.tv, put in your email there. We will 100% respect you and get you all the details that you want. So really cool stuff happening. And because of that, we might throw in a bonus episode on Wednesdays here and there. So you definitely want to be signed up for the text messages. Kind of a big deal. Yeah. You don't want to miss them. No. Should we drop trivia real quick again? Yeah. Let's show the trivia question. Trivia questions. You guys can put your answer down into the comments. OK. I had fun with this one. What is the Atlas research going to be? What is it? Is it A research center for Russell to be Elon Tamar's? Is it B, a library to preserve the ideas of influential people? Or is it C, an event center for influential people to present their ideas? Or is it D, is it both B and C? Which one is it? Option that isn't available, A, B, and C. A, B, and C. It's all of them. Or wish. It's a wish that we all have. Russell, please just get us tomorrow. So go ahead and answer that. We're going to be choosing in the next little while, we're going to be going through and finding everyone who's answered appropriately and to give you guys, put up, do a drawing for the water bottle. And you'll see that inside of the comments. We will literally come back in the comments and tag you guys when you have won and reach out to you and make sure we have your shipping details and all that jazz we can get out to you. Make sure to put your answer down to be noble. All right, so the next thing that we have is, if you guys aren't following, subscribe to the ClickFunnels YouTube channel. You might be missing the user spotlights. There is another one that dropped. This is Chanel Martin. She is amazing. So I wrote down her brief journey, but you should 100% go watch it to get the full picture. But she went from business owner to starting her own ministry to doing so much asset creation for that and then teaching people how to do it. She wrote an e-book for how to do fundraising. And then she started giving that to people, and then she started making more assets. And then she all of a sudden had this other business where she was helping people to do that stuff. And then she tells her story of why she started. She wasn't using ClickFunnels at first, but she moved to ClickFunnels. So you can go listen to her story about why she made that change and learn more about her. She's an amazing person. She also, Laura, highlighted her for she launched a funnel for a specific offer. I think it was a continuity membership offer type thing. And in one week, she was able to have an awesome amount of success with that, sold five figures with it. It was her first funnel in ClickFunnels 2.0, and she killed it. So she tells her story about what she did for that. So if you're looking for some tips, you might be able to glean something from Chanel on her video. You guys, people are selling products in 2.0 every single day. You can sell your product in 2.0 and build a funnel that is beautiful. So that all works really cool that we're able to highlight Chanel. Chanel, you're awesome. We appreciate you. Keep going. And really quick, because we're going to be doing funnel hacking live announcements here and there, we want to be able to make sure that we were highlighting you guys as much as possible today. So we will still announce the winner. So stick with us. However, let's talk about you in the community for a bit. So one of you won a 2, comma, club C award. You win a 2, comma, club C award when you have made $25 million in one funnel. Use one funnel to make $25 million and you get the 2, comma, club C award. And that award went to Daniel Harvey. And Daniel Harvey shares how he did it. He created an app. Now, this is really interesting. He talks about how you can create a mobile app that becomes the front end. It becomes the lead magnet for the rest of your business. And how that will help take everything off. It's really interesting deep dive. It's short. It's sweet. But it is cold. And it's interesting because I'm seeing how Russell is pivoting with several different things. Several of the softwares that he announced that he's playing with at Funnel Hiking Live last year. He said, we have this. We have this. We have this. He talked about that. You guys all asked questions of Daniel. He responded. You congratulated him. You gave. We want to call out you guys and say thank you for giving. But at the same time, there are secrets and people are giving them out. There's ways to make funnels work for what's happening in today's market. And Daniel's just one amazing example. Yeah. There is so much good stuff in the comments of that post. You should quickly scroll through that right there. But oh, so good. OK. Yes. Another one. Another one. So this other one, I had to stop because there's a picture of a dog. And right now, my wife is taking care of our dog. So I absolutely love her. But I have a whole bunch of dogs. And so this just stopped me right where I was scrolling. It's great. Attention, grabber. This is Carl Parnell. Carl has got a two comic club award. And he shares the lessons he learned from making $2.2 million. And he has one, two, three, four, multiple different lessons that he's sharing with you. And it's just a giving post. This is not one of those raw, raw posts of, look at me. I'm so awesome. You should learn how to do this. DM me. Golly no. That's not what ClickFunnels is all about. We're all here to be able to give and to learn from each other and to build out this community. And that's exactly what Carl is doing here. And so I wanted to call out Carl. Thank you, Carl, for giving. Thank you for being willing to give back to the community. We appreciate you. We appreciate everything you're doing. And I wanted to call out, those last two people have won, like millions, made millions in their business. I wanted to call out a couple of people who are just having some small success. Like when you have your launch, I want you to announce it. When you make your first 10,000, when you make your first 20,000, your first 50,000, 100, whatever number you're making, come out, celebrate it with us. Let us know your celebration and share something you learned during the path. I guarantee you there are people who want to learn about that, who want to be able to praise you, want to be able to support you. The way that you get seen by Russell is you become a giver in the community. The way that you are seen by the community as somebody who should be on Funnel Hacker TV and in other places or an ambassador is by giving. And so we found these just because we were looking at what you were commenting about, what you were reacting to. So let's go to Stockton really quick. I mean, how many times have we launched a phone? And we're like, this could be great. And you get some numbers. You have no idea if it's working or not. Stockton created a $27 offer and scaled it to over 200,000 very quickly. Talked about how he did it and then gave us numbers. Look at the numbers. Oh my gosh. Like I was an analyst before I was a marketer because I didn't believe that making something pretty and all that stuff would actually make money over and over and over again. After I became an analyst, realized online marketing works wonderfully. And then I started following Russell and I've been in this game ever since. So thank you for sharing numbers. It's not often that you just share your stats, and especially in an Excel. As one number nerd to another, I appreciated that a lot. So Stockton, thank you so much. One more shout out, guys. And then let's do trivia. Have you ever wanted your funnel to get seen on a big show? How many times are you like, man, I just wish Russell would spot like this once, or I wish that this would happen, or this would happen. How many times do you wish would happen? About a month ago, I missed this post, and I just found it. This is Ryan. Ryan built a funnel for his client, and it was featured on the Joe Rogan podcast. Joe Rogan was in there going through the podcast, and he goes, oh yeah, let's look this up. They look it up. Boom. Up pops the funnel, and they saw a lift from it. So you've ever wondered, what kind of lift can I actually expect if Russell were to actually like, oh my gosh, look at this or that? What kind of a lift can you expect? How long should it last? All that stuff. Ryan just gives you the details. And that was a ridiculously cool post. So all of these things that we're dropping, guys, you can go into ClickFunnels group. You can go and search for these. They are amazing posts. We appreciate you guys being willing to give. And once again, because we're going to be doing funnel hacker team, their funnel hacking live announcements, and we're going to be doing a whole bunch of other stuff, we want to make sure that we highlighted you guys as much as possible today. Because it's going to be crazy for the next 97 days. It's crazy. And if you don't have your tickets to funnel hacking live yet, you should get it. Like, there is no reason not to get it this year. The amount of information that's just going to be poured out to you is going to be breathtaking. It's going to be absolutely spectacular. So go and get your tickets to funnel hacking live. And we will be talking to SL and CY next week. Make sure you're on the email. Let's go and get the details. And did we miss anything? I think we covered it. We'll do the answer for trivia here in a second. But one thing that I was just going to say is what an opportunity for you guys to learn more about the speakers that are going to be at FHL over the next several weeks, couple months while we are interviewing them, bringing them on to Funnel Hacker TV, kind of like a precursor. And then don't forget or maybe you missed it. But they are all going to be giving you guys a gift. So make sure that you're showing up and you know how to take advantage of that. It's very difficult to get on Russell's inner circle list. But then those people that he puts in front of the audience are people that are giving to the audience. You notice that in community. You notice it inside of funnel hacking live. You've got some amazing things coming your way. Make sure that you're there for it. Shall we do the trivia? Yeah, let's put the question up one more time. Excuse me. You guys, let's see. One more time, you guys have an opportunity to get your answer down in the comments. So what is the Atlas Research Center? The groundbreaking for this building is happening tomorrow. It's going to be so fun. Is it a place for Russell to get tomorrow's before Elon? Is it a place to store, preserve a library of influential people and their ideas? Is it, see, an event center for influential people to present their ideas? Or is it D, both B and C? And I'm pretty sure you guys should know the answer to this. Yeah, I think you got a lot of people coming in. Just based on how I wrote the question. This is great. I want to give you a lot of bottles. It's called a research center for a reason, guys. We're researching things from, and we have one last hint, we're researching things from the past and collecting things for the future from people today. So it's all happening. The answer is drum roll. Drum roll. D. Or just B and C. So like, Ben, I've seen you put B and C. Michael, I've seen you put B and C. All right, so we have Ernie. Appreciate you guys. What we're going to do is we're going to go through and figure out who's won. You'll see that comment just below. And we've got so much going on next week. And one last thing, because we get to go to the open house, which is a ridiculous blessing. This is super private invite. This is not something you invite yourself to. Because we're going to be there, do you want like a private live? So they're going to be doing, they're going to be taking people around to the libraries. They're going to be giving them dinner. They're going to have special speakers that have not been announced at all, like publicly, like Russell has not dropped that yet. We're going to be able to see all of that. Do you guys want like just an impromptu live behind the scenes kind of the thing? If you guys want that, put down below Atlas. Okay, if you guys want it, no, you're not going to get an automatic DM for putting in Atlas. But in Atlas below, just let us know that you guys want us to talk about the Atlas Center when we see it tomorrow. Otherwise, we'll be talking about a Final Hacker TV next week. Yeah, awesome. We have so much good stuff for you guys. Yes. Cannot wait. All right. That's it. Make sure you're subscribed to all the things. And we will see you guys maybe tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow. But definitely next week. So we'll see you guys then. Awesome. See ya. Bye. My name is Russell Brunson. And I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started. And we don't even have gold to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get it happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you. It's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
