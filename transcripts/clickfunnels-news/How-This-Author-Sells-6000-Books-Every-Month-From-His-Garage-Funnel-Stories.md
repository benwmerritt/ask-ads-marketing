## Transcript
Growing up as a kid, like I was super introverted, weird, outcast type of guy. Once I hit like 17 or 18, I became I wanted to chase status, money, career, like all fickle things. Like I was just salivating for anything that would like prove that I'm worth something. Didn't matter what contract I would get, what girlfriend I would get or like, it just didn't matter. It was just always so shallow and it never felt solid. It just felt so fickle and just fleeting. Before I wasn't even looking for a solution to my malcontent and I kind of had a realization that my life is temporary when my step-brother passed away when he was 21 on a motorcycle accident. Then I was like, okay, I've got to get myself together and get myself out of this hole. When I had my son, Noble, is when I was like, oh no, like I've made a lot of mistakes in my life and I want to help him out. And so I wrote this book called Zimpag, and I just took it to my mastermind kind of like a, hey look what I did. And they're like, we love it. We need you to make it available to all of our kids. And you have 30 days to do it. Because like what I brought in was like a draft. It was like not a book. I mean it was like art paper and just written, literally written words. So yeah, I mean that was an accident. I was so afraid of being viewed as like egotistical or like salesy. I was unconsciously rebelling against marketing and how business is done. When I was, this was year four, you know, I was working some odd job and I'm just heartbroken. I've got this message and like I'm not doing what I need to do to get it out. I made the decision that I will redefine however I have to do to get this message out man. And that is truly what I did. All my morning before work and all my morning after work was how am I getting this out? Now I'm going to learn about Facebook ads for four weeks. Now I'm going to learn about Dream 100 for four weeks. Now I'm going to learn about ClickFunnels for four weeks. Just nurturing all those seeds so that something can be yielded that can not only support me but also get my message out. When I started I had no comprehension of a funnel. Back end, nope, repeat business, nope, average cart value, nope. So going into funnel world you learn about all of those things. It's not just about a software, it's about this whole skill set of building up your customer's value. What I noticed when I switched to the funnel was that one, my email list went through the roof. Two, my average cart value was way better and I had more flexibility with like, okay so I have a large amount of this product. I can put that at the next funnel step. Whereas like with a traditional type situation you're just kind of hoping they stumble on this product in this other section of your catalog. So it gives me way more flexibility on like what I want to expose the customer to. When I first started I was selling like average 200 a month. Now I'm selling 6,000 a month so it's like stark difference to what it used to be. But that's nothing compared to where it's going. When I created ZinPig I knew that I wanted the brand to be philanthropic in some way. And you know I was about to have my son and I was worried about organic diapers and organic cucumbers and like all this stuff and it really put into perspective like there's a father somewhere that's trying to figure out how he's going to give his son clean water. And so I reached out to every clean water charity that you can imagine. Like there was one called Moka Club and they were like okay give us this much per book and we can give somebody clean water for a year. And so like that happened and it was like it's been the most amazing partnership because every copy sold provides somebody clean water for a year. Like a kid understands what that means. Over 100,000 people have provided clean water and that is because of ZinPig fans not because of me. I'm so proud of them for giving that to the world. Like that's huge dude. Eons ago on a green grassy knoll lived a pleasant little pig who always seemed quite whole. He enjoyed his life much more than most because he took the time to look at things close. I truly don't care if Noble is the highest paid lawyer in America or if he's a trash man. Just as long as he is sure of himself and confident and resilient that's that's what I want him to be. I just want him to have some some grounding to his existence to his journey. So I just hope that I can show him and not just tell him how to do that. Because I feel like everybody will hit at least one rock bottom in their life. They're just going to it's just part of the human experience. But I'm just trying to make sure that he's got these things in his toolbox in his toolkit that can help him climb out of it to make the right decision and to put one more foot in front of the other to just keep going man just keep going.
