So Red Line Steel was a company that kind of just fell in my lap. Initially, I wanted to purchase something for my son. It was a really cool steel sign and it had a place where you could engrave your name. You know, this guy swinging a bat like this looks super realistic and all I wanted to do is be a consumer. I'll give you the short story. The guy ended up being very backlogged, said that he couldn't make this for me within a certain amount of time. He would reach back out whenever he was caught up. So I said, no worries. Ten minutes later, he reached out and said, oh, crap, it's Colin Wayne. Can't believe it's you. I'd love to be at your level one day. I used to be a fitness model. Landed over 50 magazine covers like Men's Health, Men's Fitness, Muscle & Fitness, Ironman and so many magazine publications around the world. And I was making good money. Don't get me wrong. 30, 40 grand a month doing nothing but doing modeling without a PR firm, without an agency. That's cool. But at what point is like, what's next? Soon as he said that instinctively, something triggered. Like without hesitation, I said, well, maybe I can get you to that level. I do consulting with businesses. And, you know, I see a lot of opportunity. Over the course of about 90 days, it ended up evolving where I wanted to partner. He agreed. And the day he was supposed to sign, he didn't show up. I told him, if you're not here within the next hour, I'm going to open my own company and I'll be your competitor. And so he said, well, I wish you the best of luck. And the very next day, I went and purchased my first Plasmon table. Got a big air compressor, our CNC Plasma. I like this business. I want something that's mine, something that I can build from scratch. See what a thousand labels look like. A lot of customers, a lot of orders. 10,185 and it is 844. Almost 1200 orders so far today. It's just 430. We are around about 58,000 pieces of products. We are, to be transparent, pretty damn backlog. This is from ClickFunnels. Anytime you do over a million dollars in revenue, they'll send you one of these plants. How cool is that, huh? We list four to six weeks manufacturing lead times on the website in some cases up to eight. Today, I'd love to hit $100,000 in sales. Yeah, we signed a 10-year lease for a new building. It's 108,960 square feet. A year from now, things are going to look completely different. The challenges are going to be completely different. Anger from people who never received the gifts they ordered business failed to keep its promises. Some customers have been waiting since Thanksgiving. More problems tonight for a red-lined steel. Red-lined steel. Red-lined steel. 3,000 orders that still need to be shipped. More than $100,000. They have new management and are actually fully stabbed. The last 5% of the overdue orders. We have reached out to red-lined steel several times. Management declined to appear on camera. Naja, it's been about a month since we first told everyone about the backup here at Red-Line Steel, but the owner tells me he and his team are working their hardest and working relentlessly to make it up to their customers. I'd like to first off apologize for anybody that did not receive their order. I'm upset with myself because we didn't get this out. I made a promise to these customers. I wasn't able to deliver. Because of the mistake, Wayne says he expected to get complaints from customers across the country who ordered items online. But Wayne says some people took it too far. Other bystanders and other competitors that are actually attacking myself and my family and threatening my employees. They posted something with my home address and I've got a 2-year-old daughter that's there. To answer the question many people are asking, Wayne says the backup was due to a vital machine going down. A lot of it was out of our control. Wayne says that machine feeds most of the equipment in the company's facility. He says he hired more people and worked longer hours to try and combat the issue, but it didn't work. Now the company is offering those customers a refund and trying to get items out the door as soon as possible. We are going to do everything we can to make it right for everybody that got left out for this Christmas delivery. This year there were some massive takeaways from that. So essentially one of the biggest things was now we're leveraging stock items and bundle packs. So we have multiple shells, Alpha Bravo, Charlie Delta Echo all the way down to a hotel. I've got at least $4 million in raw material ready to be shipped. This is one of my main prospecting funnels. So we ship thousands of these on a weekly basis and those are all prospected through landing pages. And so from this we upsell them on a hope and a love, which we have inventory of as well. And then we'll ship the exact same piece to thousands of customers across the country using a funnel. That's what we've done this year that's uniquely different than last year. Last year it was more how many orders can we get in the door without a clean and precise strategy of what is the KPIs that we can take away from this year. And we're actually using funnels for the first time for retargeting. Whereas we only used it for prospecting, now we're using it and we built several landing pages built through click funnels so that we can leverage our own internal audience to purchase higher average order value costs. So instead of more orders, which is equating to more product manufacturing and flows to the entire shop, I would rather put an emphasis on what can I do as a value perspective to the consumer so that they spend more money. So value tiers. If we're not innovating and adapting to those changes, we're not making it better. We're going to make it worse in the long term. The world's constantly revolving. It's moving. Same with marketing. What's working today will not work tomorrow. This is what's scary, right? If you're using a traditional website right now, it's going to be so expensive for you to market and attribute new customers for growth in the future that if you're not finding good tools to sharpen and get higher conversion rates, you're going to be left behind because these large corporations are shifting their marketing budgets into paid traffic across social media. So right now is the best time to get started. It's going to get very hectic so we're going to have to push out certain Instagram, Facebook. All right, guys, y'all ready to see the past weeks? We have 14 different items that are available now for 24 hours. So all the way until Saturday at 6 p.m. central fair time. This was our most common voted pick out of all of the previous 11 weeks. This is a teal finish, guys. We also have a blue, which is kind of a navy blue. So if you like the dream catcher, let us know when we first started off. I had no clue what I was doing. I didn't start out with this. What you see right behind me, this isn't how we started. When I first started, we actually had a kitchen oven and we hot welded, hot rolled steel together and made our own powder coat oven. When I look back at like three years ago to where we're at right now, it's insane. The difference. Essentially six months or so, we grossed over a million dollars in revenue. In year two, we did close to 10 million and then to date, we've done almost 40 million dollars. Without funnels, we couldn't do that. So for us, we use click funnels in a sense that we acquire customers at a low cost item on a perception of a high retail product. We can sell a 12 inch curse of love for $6 in free shipping, where most companies are like, I can't even get the raw material for this. Well, it's because we trust the process. It's a long term thing. And it's about how can I convert this into purchase three, four, five, six different times to stretch that lifetime value. Funnels is the way to do that. So from a business standpoint, it's allowed our company to grow very, very rapidly. It's allowed us to have, you know, almost a million customers by the end of year three. And it's evolving and the evolution of Redline is going to continue to scale and grow well beyond what we initially envisioned. This is my second time coming here. Third grade, I came here for a field trip and my mom brought me along with my entire third grade class, but I haven't been here since. And to be personally invited by the governor for my business and I can't even put it into words like I'm still in my 20s and we're getting asked by the president of the United States, the local governors. What's great about that is keeping that momentum and keeping it moving in a positive direction. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. So May 3rd, 2012, to date that I'll always remember, I was working out in the gym in the Pactika province in Afghanistan and a 107 millimeter rock had impacted about three and a half feet from me. From the grace of God, I'm still alive. And I'm the type of guy that looks 10 years ahead and wants to support not only myself, but certain veterans. So the big vision is that Redline, essentially what I could see is almost a rehabilitation center for veterans and an outreach program to get them back into the workforce. Building a compound, let's say 300, 400 acres, having essentially everything that you would need within a compound of our own installation. So having Erex where people can live, having some type of recreation center where people can gather and have some type of culture that's continuing to evolve and grow and build. It's not just the money play. I love concept reality and also the humanitarian side where there's a lot of homeless veterans that need the chance. They need something to look forward to and all they need is a small stepping stone. And so I want to be a voice for those people. Unlike a lot of people, you know, we work 80, 90, 100 hours a week. It's literally a whatever it takes mentality. When things are doing great, I tend to throw a wrench in it and we end up making crazy decisions. I thrive under pressure, you know, the same way that our steel is made. It takes literally the air that we're breathing and it has chambers of high pressure tanks, low pressure tanks, and that's what makes our steel. It's the same thing as an entrepreneur that's going through these journeys. We all go through it. Everybody does. Trust me, you're not alone. And that is how growth happens. And that being uncomfortable shouldn't, in theory, push you to be so much stronger. And then that's how you truly learn. You learn from those setbacks. You learn from those mistakes and you say, that's not going to happen again. That setback is a set up for your future. That's how you can scale and build the foundation that's needed to grow a massive empire.
