Today is a dream. I'm like pinching myself like this is my life and this is what I'm stepping into and this is all my friends and family get to share that. I'll never forget the time I first met Russell Brunson. It was February 2017 at the Funnel Hacker live conference in Dallas, Texas. He was just so considerate. He said, JP, how's your business? How can I help? Business is going awesome. I'm using ClickFunnels in my membership program and I have no complaints with the one area of my life where I would love more satisfaction. It's my personal life. I told him I'm 35 years old and I'm not married. He leaned into me, looked me right in the eyes, and he said, JP, you're just one funnel away. And I want to share this with you what Russell shared with me that helped get me married using ClickFunnels. So he said, JP, what you need in order to get married is a basic tripwire funnel, webinar funnel, high ticket funnel. First off, I captured my future wife's email, got her to sign up for an easy offer. It was a free dinner plus shipping. She paid for the Uber, but I paid for dinner. That was free for her. Then I funneled her into my webinar funnel. The move beyond heartbreak of failed relationships, be happy forever and thrive by dating JP Webinarme. By the way, if you look at the title of that webinar, I used two commas. So I think that qualifies me for the two comma club. I don't know what the big deal is, but I want my plaque. She registered for the webinar on a Monday. I sent email reminders on Tuesday and Wednesday to build anticipation. Did the live webinar on Thursday. I was very heavy on the trial closes. I had a webinar replay on Friday. And then on Saturday, she signed up for the dating JP package. Then from my webinar funnel, I funneled her into my high ticket funnel, which was my matrimonial mastermind marriage package. Understand, this is all email is all automated. Super easy. And here's the offer. First off, I wanted to use scarcity. There's only one spot available. Pressured her with time. The software expires in 24 hours. And I value stacked. So, OK, this includes 2.5 children, a house, financial support, and we'll spend holidays with your family. You know what she did? She said yes. Friends and family, we are gathered here today to witness and celebrate the sacred union. Two days after my wedding, Russell called me up. He said, JP, congratulations. I'm so happy that ClickFunnels worked for you. What are you going to upsell her on? I said, well, I didn't think of that, Russell. I have no idea. What do you think? Then what he suggested is make her an open relationship offer that became the upsell. This is an annual offer where I offer Amber one new incredibly female partner is allowed to come into our marriage. Anyway, that's how ClickFunnels helped me get married. And I'm just so proud and I want to thank Russell for his expert advice. And I want to thank the whole ClickFunnels family for helping me get married.
