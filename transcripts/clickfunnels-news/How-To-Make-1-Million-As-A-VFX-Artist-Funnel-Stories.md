You might have twice been out of experience with someone else, but that's not in the budget, and I've got to respect that. So no matter what I did, I capped out of the number. So the next two years, I went up to $250,000 a year, and then two years after that, I went up to almost half a million dollars. This is me working as an artist from home on regular projects. So a lot of what I do is mixing physics with artistry. So we're always trying to figure out ways to do things, and it starts out while we're on set, and it ripples all the way through to the final render or the final frame that we're putting out to film. There's so many different challenges, and every project has its own different challenges that we need to figure out how we're going to do it, what it's going to look like, but how we're going to pull it off in the timeframe that we usually have. I'm Alan McKay. I'm a visual effects supervisor, and I also teach a mentorship for technical directors in Hollywood on creating visual effects. I started working in the industry when I was 14. I left home. I started working in different cities, eventually different countries, and I enjoyed that. I love the fact that while my friends were in high school, I was working all these big studios and all these big projects, and by the time that they were in college, I was lecturing at college. When I first moved to LA, I'd been fortunate enough I'd worked late hours and I'd put in the time and I'd worked on my first feature film, which was Blade, and I did all the vampires turning to ash, and I then received an Emmy for our work out at Super Bowl. Bit by bit, like everything was coming together, and all of these things were happening on speaking of events, of putting out products, and for a lot of people, it looks really cool. You go to events and you're autographed to people and you're doing a little stuff, and it's so cool to look in on that, but secretly, while they're out having a life, you're there working late hours, you're letting your health decline and just constantly stressed and barely getting by knowing you have to hear about that, and when it does affect lives and when it does damage reputations and relationships, that's when it all can fall apart. I still remember working on God of War, and that one is still one of the most proudest projects I've ever worked on. It was one that I produced as well as Supervias that I worked on set, doing all the visual effects for the project. We had very tight deadlines and it was a lot to get through. That project for me, it was my personal hell. The amount of hours I was doing, I was starting to get back pain, bit by bit, I kept ignoring it and it got to a point where I should have been hospitalized months before that and I decided to keep going through and I wouldn't sleep for days, I would continue to work, but it got to a point where I didn't think I could ever work again just because I couldn't sit at a desk anymore, I couldn't do anything anymore, and it made me realize, like, this is the stuff that a lot of us are going through, and when I started to tell other people about what I'd been experiencing, I realized that it's common, a lot of people, both physically as well as mentally, they'd burn out. And what do you do when you're working late hours, you're at a point where you're so stressed, you're losing your family, you're losing everything, you don't have savings, you don't have anything, you're getting by, check the check, and at the very end of it all, when you burn out or when you lose your health, everything else goes with it. And as I get older, as I get further into my career now, I don't want to look back with no memories and thinking that all I had was my work and that's all I cared about. This has always been really critical to me, is realizing that there is that work-life balance, and if we're able to take a step back and think about, well, what I'm doing right now is this aligning with where I want to be down the line, is this aligning with what I want to do? We have our work, but what's the strategy if you're just reactive, if you're just running around getting job off the job, like, where does it end? And that's exactly when I discovered this whole other world for me, and it meant that I could actually change normally my life, but I could change other people's as well. Big news for everyone who's doing the Avengers course. This is a way to stand out. You've got to go out there, you've got to hustle, you've got to put in the time for sharing all the assets, Thanos' character model. I taught some classes in the past where there were like six-week courses, and I never, for me, felt like that was enough time to really help people. I always had this idea of I'd love to build a mentorship, and if I can help them in six weeks, what could I do if I had a year to actually help really make an impact on their lives? Okay, so welcome to the FXTD mentorship. When all the training I'd ever done, like little DVDs and things like that, I think I'd made, acumatively, over 10 years, about $80,000. But when I put out this new course, I think there was a day that I made $23,000 in a single day, and then it quickly showed me, like, I'm stressed at work, I'm ready to puke my guts out, and meanwhile I just made like $20,000 without doing a single thing. And that made me think, like, well, what could I do if I actually put more time into this? I decided at that point I wanted to launch my mentorship. At the same time, you know, I've been an artist my whole career, but I didn't really know about marketing, I didn't know about sales, I didn't know about capturing an email address or any of these things. So even though I feel like I'm a pretty technical and savvy person, I was going to hire someone just to be able to do something that was outside of the spectrum. I've spent tens of thousands of dollars hiring developers to do something, and even then it's not quite right. And then, unfortunately, something breaks and I've got no idea how to fix it because they built it, and I feel completely disconnected and out of control. And that's when I discovered ClickFiles, and it instantly made sense. I don't need to be a savvy designer to be able to make something that makes sense, but instead of it being a learning curve, it's just drag and drop and start putting things together. And it's instead of hours to make instead of getting bogged down, trying to figure it all out and having things break all the time. As artists, we have different tool sets. You know, whether it's a paintbrush or a pencil or a pen, we have the different ways we work. It's the same thing with our business that there are certain things that we rely on that not only allow me to get more done and get it done quicker, but on top of that, I know that stable and reliable is really critical to my business. So using ClickFunnels, it allowed me to not only do my launch, but host the courses, all the videos, the content, and get people to then be able to go through the whole platform in one ecosystem. So I loved it. It just became so intuitive, and it has allowed me to focus on what's more important, which is teaching others and being able to take care of my business. Oh wow, what do you got there? Something from ClickFunnels. I just got a pretty cool package in the mail. Infamous 2, Club Award. You hear this all the time that, like, oh, it's not about the money, it's about getting to give back or whatever it is, but for me, it was more money equal freedom. For the first time in my life, I wasn't chasing next paycheck. Any time you do over a million dollars in reminale, do a million dollars in sales, I assure you this is possible for average folk like me. I remember being so stressed throughout most of my career where I'm constantly chasing the next paycheck, just trying to get by, and now I feel like I go all the time in the world, and it's more about filling it up with the things that I want to do, as well as more importantly, give back and help others with their careers as well. It sounds crazy, but like, to me, this is exactly what I pictured and what I've always wanted, and I love getting to spend more time with my wife than I would be if I was working late hours and doing late nights all the time, and these days I get to see my students' names on the big screen. I get to enjoy seeing their achievements and their success from going through the course and success they have in their career.
