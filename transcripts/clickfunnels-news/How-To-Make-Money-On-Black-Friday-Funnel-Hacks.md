Highly recommend starting now reaching people while pockets are full. Guys, there's a massive strategy, massive goal going into this. We're definitely thinking, how can we further serve this audience that's hungry for everything in the kitchen sink? The Biggest Possible The Biggest Possible The Biggest Possible The Biggest Possible The Biggest Possible The Biggest Possible The Biggest Possible The Biggest Possible The Biggest Possible So one of the most important things you can do to have a successful Black Friday is to build audiences, create a wait list where people can put in their email address and we send out emails that just build the suspense and tease them drives crazy, crazy excitement for the actual Black Friday sale. Shut up and take my money! Send them a text message every day based on a seven day period before hitting Black Fridays so that they're already an active customer. So one of the things that we've been talking a lot about is the beauty of like a no brainer offer. A $77 offer featuring all of our best stuff. We're also going to have an order bump, $15. All of this leads to the next page, $49 for those different advanced trainings. 365 content prompts, top performing ad swipes, email swipes from the past four years, 50 plug and play lead magnet titles and 52 plug and play YouTube video titles. What we decided to do is we created stick packs of our products with a shaker for $27. And then we order bump, we give customers the option to upgrade to a full size bottle plus a shaker. Then proceed to offer one click upsells. We're starting Black Friday Cyber Monday a lot earlier than normal to kind of beat the rush and beat the crowd of everything. Right now we have something going on called 10 Days of Christmas. So what we do is we warm them up based on a seven day period before hitting Black Friday so that they're already an active customer. Every day I update what is today's release, tomorrow's release and what they've missed out on in the past. We spent about $12,000 on retargeting ads and we're seeing returns in the range of four to eight X. Our ad spend for this offer is going to be less than $1,000 and we do that intentionally because we are targeting our warm audiences. We're projecting multiple five figures in one day in revenue and profit, which is even cooler. We're spending around $18,000 to $22,000 on average daily. So on average is around 2000 to 3000 orders. Black Friday Cyber Monday, I mean, I'm expecting to do about 75,000 orders total. I think it's really important to have a Black Friday strategy because people are looking to spend money on Black Friday. If you aren't offering something for Black Friday, they're going to be looking to your competitors to provide them with whatever it is that's going to scratch that edge for them. Black Friday is so, so important because it just brings an influx of new customers. Most people, myself included, going through school, I've always waited to the last day to pre-plan. If you're watching this video, that could be you and that's okay. Knowing what you can do this year is going to set you up for success next year as long as you do it right.
