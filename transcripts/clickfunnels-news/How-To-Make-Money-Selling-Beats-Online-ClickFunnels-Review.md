## Transcript
We've interviewed a couple of producers, we interviewed Gabe from Legion Beats and Anno Domini and they've kind of, right now they're kind of pushing this new way of selling Beats online through sales funnels. You know anything about that? No idea. No idea about sales funnel? Yeah, yeah, so I mean for you and the people that aren't, you know, short. Gabe, it's Gabe! He's killing it! It's somebody that is making a lot of great noise in this system that he has presented to music producers and it's helping a lot of people move the needle, including myself. Gabe is somebody who has absolutely crushed it when it comes to selling Beats and I know a lot of you guys out there are trying to get to that space. They got a plaque because they made 1.2 million in the last year. You my friend are a genius. Got the internet going nuts. It was an honor. Have you ever heard of anyone making 1.2 in a year off of just YouTube? Nope. No. And he actually has a practical way for every producer out there to actually do it. It's not getting lucky, it's not getting some major placement. It's like combined? You didn't know? No, they both actually have their own. Oh, they both made 7 figures? Yeah, and the plaque is from ClickFunnels which is a very reputable company, you know what I'm saying? Like... Gabe has already won the game. He's doing what he loves. That's why it was kind of like, damn. He's feeling fulfilled. This is the spirit of people we need to leave. He's excited every day to do it. I'm gonna have to eat them up then. And he's generating a s*** load of money doing it. I mean, all you need is those four. Music producing really is about, to me, is really about problem solving. It's really about listening to a song and being like, oh my god, that sounds amazing. But then saying, wait, what about that sounds amazing? And then really breaking it down. My name is Gabe. I am the founder of Legion Beats and basically what we do is make music for artists. I'll be going and then throw some drums on there. I think there's sort of this thing that almost all artists and musicians have which is like, I wanna do my art. And I don't wanna do business or marketing. Like it's this thing that sucks that I have to do. But what's great about this new model where we actually can create this music and then we give the opportunity to multiple artists to use it. How we can reach so many more people. We can reach so many more artists, so many more fans. Our music is now being played like right now there's people playing our music all over the world. Building this type of business has made that possible. I always thought that my big break was gonna come from the record label cutting me a big check. I realized eventually that this is really not going to actually turn into something that's sustainable. You kind of assume or I used to assume that, hey, if you've worked with some big artists that's a household name, then you're on, you made it. But the reality is even if you've gotten a couple of those places, you've worked with some of those people, you might only have made a little bit of money once and that's it. And now you're kind of waiting for the next one. Ten plus years of playing that game. And I was feeling stuck. Like I was approaching 30 years old, still living at my dad's house, couldn't afford to move out. Like I hated talking about what I was doing with music where I talked to friends or family or whatever. And it felt like they would see me as somebody who's chasing this pipe dream or like the starving artist or something like that. And so I just didn't feel like that respect. I didn't respect myself, honestly, at that point. Lying on my bed, in my room, at my dad's house, just like feeling that anxiety. You get like the, you know, like somebody's pressing down on your chest. Like at that point it was like, I got to give up. Like I got to, I got to do something else. I got to get a real job. I got to, you know, figure something out. Luckily, something made me think, OK, let me, let me try shifting from this sort of industry game to actually selling beats online. And it was something I had never done before and certainly wasn't the first person to do it. I mean, people have been doing this for a long time. There's literally hundreds of thousands of producers doing it, but it just hadn't been something I tried yet. And so I was like, all right, this is sort of like my last ditch effort before it's time to, time to call it quits. And kind of went into looking at, OK, well, what are other producers who are selling beats online doing? And what it was, was mostly trying to grow a following on Instagram or YouTube and then direct all of those potential customers to sort of a traditional website or beat store. And so I tried that. At first it was like, cool, you know, I got a couple sales. I was like, all right, this is better than chasing after artists and A&Rs and whatever. And it felt like I had a little more ownership, but it still wasn't going to pay the bills. It still wasn't going to get me out of my dye sauce. I kind of looked at what every other producer was doing. I was really, I started, I started geeking out on it a little bit. You know, I was like, OK, maybe I can learn a little marketing tip or trick or something that will get me a couple more sales. At this point, I had never considered myself an entrepreneur, never thought of myself as a marketer. Didn't even really think of myself as a business owner. And eventually I was scrolling through Facebook and I happened to notice that a producer had posted a link and it was to a page. And I didn't understand what I was looking at or what it was. But what it was, was he was actually using funnels to sell beats. First time I'd ever seen it. He was using funnels. I clicked on one of his links and I was like, oh, it's anodomni.clickfunnels.com. I was like, huh, I wonder what ClickFunnels is. And from there, completely changed my life. So for the first time in my life, I applied some of that creativity and passion that I'd want to only put into my music. And I started putting into my marketing as well, using sales funnels, order form bumps, upsells, focusing on growing my list. Actually, craft a process and really create a journey and an experience for my customer. Creating a true offer instead of trying to sell a commodity like basically everybody else in my niche was doing. They're going to see this page first. They're going to see this page next and I'm going to build rapport with them. OK, instead of selling a commodity like a single beat lease, let me package them together and let me create like a beat pack. It's this whole bundle of products and services, this concept of a true offer. And because I was doing those things pretty quickly in a couple of years, I was able to climb to basically the top of my industry. I'm not hearing nothing in the can. Yeah, check. Check. I hear the beat now. A little bit of me. Tamia. Tamia. Gabe. No more. No more. So the company's talking about you got some beats for me. So I'm going to talk to the crew and let's see what we're doing and what I do. Watch how I do it. I'm changing the gang. The gang. No time for no rest. Got a legion to train. Chillin' just something like Dylan. You got a whole squad and I'm raising the building up. Loving the feeling of innovation. Got to keep moving. Can't be complacent. Successful filming or both adjacent. I feel that my heart is racing. Got it from Russell and made it my own. Steped on the field and I made it my home. Me and money in a circle is growing. Now I pull up and I speak at the forum. The music industry has evolved so much in the last five years, 10 years, 20 years. It's something that's really changing constantly. And I think for a lot of people in music, the feeling is that the good old days are done. You know, it's dead or whatever. And what's really interesting is in my opinion, this is the best time in history to be a musician like hands down. The opportunities that I have, the things that I've been able to do, I wouldn't have been able to do 10 years ago, probably even five years ago. We are so lucky to be alive at this time because of the opportunities of technology, because of the way things have evolved, because the power has shifted. We can put out our own music. We can create these sustainable, profitable businesses ourselves. The breakthrough that I was looking for came in a completely different format than I thought. I thought that breakthrough was going to be getting a big check from the label or getting some big placement, working with a record label. And what it ended up being was learning about this whole world of entrepreneurship. You know, we've been able to build this studio. We've got a business that not only am I making a great living from, but we've got a whole team of people actually all over the world that are making a living doing this. Career and music is really tough. It's something that's certainly not guaranteed. I mean, it's just like starting a business where it's something that a lot of people try to do and some people have a lot of success at it and a lot of people don't. If I could like go back and let myself know, hey, that breakthrough that you're looking through, it could be just around the corner.
