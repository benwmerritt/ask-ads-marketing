## Transcript
It was like I wasn't breathing right. It was like all the colors faded out of everything and it got to the point where I was driving over a hundred miles per hour just hoping my little Honda would spin out of control and that'd be it. I'd be out of the pain because I could not stop the pain. When I didn't think things could get any worse, I get this middle of the night phone call from my brother telling me that our dad had passed away. Every day when I woke up it would be the first thing I'd remember. I blamed myself. I knew his health was poorly. I didn't say anything to anybody because I myself wasn't doing very well so I didn't think I was in a good place to tell anybody. I came across this article where all these people who had way bigger tragedies than I experienced, what did they do? And that was keeping a gratitude journal so I whipped out my notebook right then and there and I just wrote, I got to see my dad before he died. My last words to him were, I love you. My mom's going to be okay and I just kept writing and I thought well I got to keep doing this if I don't do this. I'm going to give up like I gave up on everything else. Two months into it I realized my life had turned around but I'm sure it turned around way before that. It just took a long time for me to realize it, to wake up from the fog that I was in. And I thought well what was the magic bullet that I did? I thought it was a pill or a diet or something or a book I read and then I realized it was that journal. Well I wanted everybody to start a gratitude journal and that's when I decided to make the gratitude app. I'm the first woman to launch an iPhone app. At first I was trying to juggle this side hustle while working at NASA and when my kids came into my life and we worked really hard to get those kids in our lives I wanted to be able to raise them. I didn't want to outsource motherhood to an agency called Daycare. I just got up before work about 4.30 in the morning and took the development tools and the design tools and tried to figure them all out and then by chance I found this developer in India who helped me develop it and I figured out the design piece and we got it out there. Because I was the only woman at the time it grabbed the media's attention. New magazines would pick up on it, Oprah, New York Times, USA Today, newspapers and radio programs. All these big publications found it. All of a sudden my phone was blown up and people were asking me to interview and I had no idea how to interview. Carla White, one of our tech experts, she is the CEO of Gratitude Labs. Back with us this morning. How are you? Good morning, Carly. It's so good. Other people who wanted to make apps were calling me up or emailing me, asking me for help and it just eventually started to grow and grow and grow to the point where I was making more with my app business than I was at NASA. So I wrote a book called Idea to iPhone and a woman in Colorado had gotten that book and she contacted me saying this would be a really good lead magnet for a funnel. But I have no idea what a lead magnet or a funnel is. So I went to Funnel Hacking Live about two months later, still didn't know what a funnel or a lead magnet was. Doors flung open and I said to myself, whoever I see next is going to completely change my life. And I was blown away because for most of my tech life I was just in that app world. Then I was exposed to this whole other world where you resell to customers, you take them on a journey, you get them together in a live event. When people download my app, I get their email address. So I had this database of like 100,000 emails. So I thought, oh, there's all these things that can be doing with this tribe of people. ClickFunnels has allowed me to understand what people are wanting right now, what they need in their lives and how to deliver it to them and how to take them on a journey where you're truly impacting their life. So before what I understood was I sell them an app and good luck and please don't contact me again. And now my app, that's just the start of the journey. You get my app, you're going to hear from me, I'm going to introduce myself to you, you're going to hear about my story, I'm going to invite you on a journey together. Hey, write to me, I do want to hear from you. And it's helped me find my voice. It's helped me make even more of an impact with the people that I wanted to touch already. And it's taught me how to create products, things that people really, truly want in their lives and what the world really needs right now. You're called? Oh, no, no, no. Gentle. It's a microphone. Can you sing in it? Can you sing? I want to build a snowman. No. What of the others? When I first started writing in my journal, I really wasn't sure if I was doing it right. I'd write the same thing over again. I woke up, I showered, I had something good to eat and it was pretty boring stuff. It wasn't anything riveting. I remember that girl. I remember her being pretty scared and hurt. I remember her really well. When I look at the photos, completely different face in those photos. A couple months into it, things were changing. It wasn't, I just woke up, I just showered. I had five minutes with my kids. I had a good meal. I woke up today. You know, I got so many friends that aren't going to wake up next summer. You know, I get today, I get tomorrow. And I always tell myself, like, you don't know how to feel full if you have never felt hungry. You know how to feel healthy if you never felt sick. Like, you don't know the contrast unless you felt these things. So I would not know how blessed I am right now if I hadn't had these hardships. I mean, I lived out of my car for part of my life. I mean, I had to eat leftover food from somebody else's plate. It's a shame that we are conditioned to think that we don't have this in our lives. We have so much. We all do.
