## Transcript
I remember the first time I decided I wanted to work out. I was walking with my mother. She used to walk me to school at like 5 a.m. Because she had to catch the bus to go work downtown Chicago. And one day, when we were walking, and we see this guy was coming towards us, right? And, you know, he was wearing a big hood and a big jacket, which is normal. We didn't think any of it. Until he pulled out a gun. Man, he put it in my mom's face. You know, it's like, yo, give me the purse. She just froze. Then he put the gun in my face to give me the purse. And she gave him the purse. And I don't remember a lot after that. I do remember the feelings like, yo, I don't want them like that to happen to my mom. I was real concerned about being strong from that point on. It wasn't for looks. It wasn't for health. I wanted to be able to defend myself. But it became so much more than that. When I saw how it changed my personality, it changed. I feel like I have more confidence. I saw everything change just from working out. It was like the spark. And then I started helping other people at that point. I saw how it changed them. And what I noticed is they start to think, man, what else can I accomplish? And then they start setting bigger goals in other areas of their lives. And I fell in love with that feeling of helping people. I was going to do that in some capacity for the rest of my life. Welcome, welcome. Thank you so much for coming. I want to welcome to the stage and I want to get a loud round of applause for Brandon Carter. Let me ask you, I don't want to make no assumptions. Why are you here today? Being in the game for I won't age myself for a long time. The online training situation appeals to me and I'm in the process of doing some other things that I think I could integrate it with as well. Okay, cool. What would you do? So I'm like, I want to be. I don't want to cut off that compliment. What about you? Um, I like that idea of looking at you online. I like that idea too. What about you? I want to be able to help more people, but I'm stuck at the gym all day long. There you are. And I can only see eight people. So I want to take that online and see who I can help around the world. I don't know what it's like in Canada. Probably similar, but in America, they just say, hey, man, you just got to work hard. Work hard, work hard. Like, how many guys work hard? How many guys work hard? Come on, man. All right. Now, how many of you guys are financially free? Maybe working hard ain't the only thing. I was a personal trainer in college and even after I got out of school, I was a trainer. You know, I was waking up at four training people in the morning. I was working like 12, 14 hours a day, seven days a week. I was at the point of like giving up and I just knew there had to be a better way. So I thought, okay, I'll just get personal clients. I leave the gym. The problem is that, you know, sometimes clients ever cancel you guys. Who's ever had a client canceling? Yeah? As a personal trainer, you only make money for the time you're training. In fact, you're literally selling hours of personal training. So you're getting paid by the hour. There's only so many hours in each day. It puts a limit on the kind of money you can make. But maybe more importantly, it puts a limit on how many people you can help. How many of you guys, like, want to go online but you're not sure the steps to take? Yeah? Yeah, because that's where I was. I had to stop thinking like a trainer and start thinking like a businessman. So I figured I needed to go online some kind of way. I started reading books. I started going to events and I got some mentors. I tried to come out with little courses. You're one of those, man. Big credit card. I'm not getting this flicked ten minute effort into downing the workout. And I took every course I could. It was a huge learning curve. Because one, how do you market it? How do you sell it? What a price point do you sell it for? And then how do you train people online? I knew there had to be a way. I knew it wasn't like a barber, right? I can't give them an online haircut. And I figured out, actually figured out how to get people better results. But a simple, I'm telling you, 25 clients paying you $80 a week for 52 weeks is $104,000 a year. Once you get that, man, that's going to give you the what? That's going to give you the freedom. Once I cracked that code, it gave me the freedom to quit all my other jobs, quit training people in person, and then start building my other businesses. I had the time, the income, and the freedom to do some other things. So that's when we built out our supplement line. That's when we got into selling some apparel. That's where today now I have 15 employees. We have a big penthouse office in Manhattan. I just started the Mill Prep company. Customers all around the world. And we were able to keep building, but it all started with online training. And now trainers come to me, like, hell, how do you do it? How do you do it? Because they see the lifestyle that I have, and they see that I do what I love for a living, and I came from nothing. That's one of the reasons we put these events together, because now I know how to do it, and I've helped a lot of other entrepreneurs do it. And I tell them, yo, we got to start with online training. You got to start with online training, and you need that simple funnel. So how do you get those people? How many of you guys went to build a website? I've been trying to build a website. How long have you been trying to build your website? Six months. What about you? A year. A year. Who else is trying to build a website? Three months. Three months. You guys have been in almost a year trying to build a website. My students get the website up in an hour, right? But it's not just a website. It's a funnel. That's different than a random website. This site is designed to do one thing, make sales. That's it. It's a funnel. And instead of six months or a year, it's one hour. I have all different kinds of funnels, but what works best for personal trainers, not trying to sell them online. There is a lot of competition in this industry, right? You want to do everything you can to give yourself the best opportunity to succeed. If you're just trying to sell online training just from a website, I've never seen that work in practice. You want to have a funnel to get leads, but also to book calls and the simple appointment funnels where you need to start because you have to start with online training. It's the quickest path to success. They come to you and you like what you see on the application. If they fit the kind of person you want to work with and you feel like you've been helped them, then you invite them for a 10-minute call. So it's the same kind of sales call you were doing in person. Now you're doing it on the phone. All right, man. Yo, congratulations on joining the program. I'm really excited. I'm really excited. Where would you put this thing? It's really just taking the whole process of prospecting that you were doing in the gym and sales that you were doing in the gym and taking that online. So one can tell me about exactly what you're trying to accomplish. We were at this conversation one year. And it starts with the funnel. So the first funnel you need as an online trainer is one to get leads and book appointments, right? And I give all my students a click funnel template. I have it. It's work. It's proven. Here's the template. Plug it in, change everything, and you're ready to go. You can be ready to go today. You can help more people, charge them less, and make more money. Man, now you're making as much as a doctor. So now I train personal trainers on how to do this. And that's kind of been my focus because the beauty is, instead of me just changing other people's lives physically, now I'm building an army of people who are doing that. So now it's almost like a bigger mission. It's kind of like this thing where all these people are going out, changing other people's lives. And those people's lives being changed, they're going to change their families' lives. Those people's kids are going to grow up in better environments and become more successful as a result. You know, I really feel like what we're doing by helping trainers do what I did, because I know how many people I've helped. People always ask me what I wanted to be when I grow up. And I would say personal trainer. Because you couldn't do this. Imagine YouTube didn't exist, Facebook didn't exist. There was certainly no click-phone or nothing like it. You couldn't do it. But now it's like I have a hard time trying to figure out what you can do.
