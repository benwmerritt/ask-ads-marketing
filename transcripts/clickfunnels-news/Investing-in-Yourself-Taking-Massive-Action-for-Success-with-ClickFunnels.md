Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with FlickFunnels and today I'm speaking with Jean Hollander. Jean is a young entrepreneur and expert in webinar automation and is the founder and CEO of Webinar Agency. He's generated over 800,000 leads, over 10 million in sales, is a 2,000 Club Award winner and was in the 2,000 Club X coaching program. Welcome Jean. Thanks so much Hi, hello. All right, so let's kick things off. You started off by letting us know that you are a young entrepreneur. How old are you exactly? Yeah, so today I'm 21 and I started this journey three years ago just after high school. I was in like the 2,000 X coaching program two years ago and this changed everything for me because like I've the best advice that I found when I was like following the coaching, like Russell says like do a webinar a week. Yeah, do a webinar a week before you eat the 2,000 Club. If you were a final that did not like done $1 million in sales, just do one webinar a week. So and constantly in the program Russell was saying like do what Russell says, do what Russell says. So you did it? Yeah, exactly. I don't know how much webinar I've done but so I've run an agency so I have like different clients. I have like five clients and each of them are doing webinars a week. So I've done like I think two or three underage webinar because I have like three, four webinar a week. So it's like a lot of webinar but yeah, this is working, you know. Yeah, you will work. Yeah, we're happy when you said this is cool. So how did you come to know Russell and become a student of his? Okay, so I think like when I was in high school, I have like this period of like self-development. So I read like all the Tony Robbins book Extra Extra and after so I discover expert secrets, dot-cup secret Extra. So I was in like my boarding school in Paris in the night like reading Russell's book Extra. So this was my first step into this world and I saw like YouTube video Extra Extra, one for the way challenge and yeah and after I saw like the 2C6 watching a 2Comerclub conference like from my own during the COVID period because everything was shut down. So I was like 10, 12 hours a day on my computer like learning and they're creating thumbnails Extra Extra. So yeah, that was my first thought. Yeah, trust me. So fascinating. I have so many questions for you because I'm so intrigued and fascinated by your age. So tell me a little bit. So obviously you're in France and you got started really young. So at 18 after high school, you already got the jump start on becoming an entrepreneur, which you're light years ahead of so many people even older than you are. Would you say that being in France while learning from people here in the States, has that been more of a challenge or would you call it an advantage from where you are? I think it's both because like the French, the French is like a small market. So you have to get into France like to being in the United States. But one cool thing is that I think you have like a couple of events about what we are doing right now in France. So we can just watch what are you doing in the US and the United States and take it and like do the work, you know. So if like you are a fast action taker, it's really cool because like you're alone. And I think I was one of the first person like to do a webinar which in France because like everybody was doing it, but one time in three months, you know. And now like everybody is doing it one time. So yeah, this is changed. But yeah, this is a good point because like we have time to see what you are doing in the United States and take it. But like the mindset in France is a couple of different you know in the United States. So you have to, it's not like really marketing extract. So you have to be more kind and try to find the right offer. Not too pushy, but like it's different. But I think yeah, it's a good point. But yeah, it's cool. Well, in Europeans, I know love to vacation. Would you say that you're a hard worker every day, 365 days a year? Yeah, because I think I was like really passionate about all this work, you know, like Phinell XTAR. So yeah, I'm just working like all time because I love this, you know. So I love this game. It was like, again, you know, you have to put $1 in the ads and take $3 and you have to make the best era XTAR. So it's like really passionate. And I didn't watch my time, I watched time, I worked XTAR out. And now I have a team with seven people, you know. So it's like the agency is killing. And yeah, I just love this. And I love this journey. Amazing. So what led you to pursuing webinars? There are tons of different types of funnels. What made you think I want to do webinars? I want to do webinars weekly. And then what led you to building an agency solely on webinars? Yeah. First of all, I think when I saw the Russell presentation, when it did like $3.2 million in like TEDx presentation, I was like, whoa, there is something happening. So I have two thesis. And yeah, I think I really like this thing when you say to one too many, you know, you can make like a ton of money during two hours. It was like when I've done my first webinar with clients like two years ago, I was just like testing, you know, the nature, the offer XTAR, so the first webinar. But she had like a really huge audience. So when she she did the promotion of the webinar, we had like 2000 leads. It was like but lead, you know, because they were a ton of the group of the rocks. And the webinar is going crazy because like more of 1080 people just chugged on the webinar. We've done like more than 100k in sales. So for the first webinar, that was like just so huge. And I think this power to say one too many to have like thousands of people in front of you and sales you offer just to give you your messages is like so powerful, you know. Yeah, I really love this for now. All of them are incredible, you know, but yeah, I really I love this for now because it's like really powerful and you can you can like do so much lead because if you do if you're doing it like one time a week, one time a week, you're just you have the summer to week that exists from English, you have like so much lead and like summer sales. So you can scale it fast. And this is like a good point. So is that how you've generated over 800,000 leads yourself by just having people opt in for webinars? Yeah, I got to use this just webinar in like different niches, you know, I have like my first clients just is like speed reading, you know, I should learn speed reading. And it's just like it's gone totally crazy, you know, in his like mail, a base mail actually he have like 500,000 leads just himself, you know, it's like speed reading, learning extra at the niches is like incredible. And we're at it has been two years now that we have done like a webinar a week. And each week we have like one 2000 person live in the webinar. So this is speed reading that's interesting. I know they say that the riches are in niches and I would say that he you found some interesting niche clients there. What exactly was it that led you to click funnels? I think like gross selling is like an inspiration for me. So I've like fun all the solution, you know, on the market, um, Gajabee click for not extra extra, but click for now as such a community, such an incredible energy, incredible passion extra. So this is totally different from other just SaaS, you know, as a services, because it's not like a SaaS. Yeah, there is a community, there is like learning, there is like experience, there is event extra. So this is a difference. And so when I saw this, it was just abuse for me. So yeah, I agree. Amazing software aside, I think the community, the training you get along with it are well worth it. Yeah, exactly. Well, you are, you seem to be living proof, especially at your age of taking someone's model that they've seen success with applying it to yourself and creating your business and seeing success in it. So it just proves that like taking the model and doing the work. Yeah, it was just really cool. So on that note, what advice would you give to somebody who is maybe still in grade school or high school or even college who is like, maybe I don't want to do that, I go the traditional route, I want to be an entrepreneur. What would you tell them? I think nowadays, with like every, the information is every year, you know, so your job is to take the right information and to go massive action as a ten-year-old, to whatever I've been saying, you know. So I think one advice I can give is to buy time. When I say buy time is like invest on yourself, because when you invest on yourself, you are going to make action, you know, because information is everywhere, but it's free. And when it's free, your brand is considering it like it's like it's no value, you know. So you have to invest on yourself. And when you invest on yourself, it's like a contract you're signing with yourself to say, I'm going to take massive action to do the work, to put the force in, you know. So yeah, me, you know, like the versatile question program is like, it's high-tickets, you know, you have to put like a lot of money in this. And me, when I was like 18, my parents, my, yeah, maybe my brother say, just your, your fault, your fault, you know, like, what are you doing? Yeah, I've made, I think like, yeah, 30, 30, 30 thousand dollars. So it was like a lot of money, and I spent like everything in the, in the Tocomac, but it's like the, the ROI that you have after this is incredible because we have no choice, you know, you have no choice, you have to, you, you, you put that money in. So you have to do the work, you have to get results extra. So buy time, like you, you will buy time in investing in yourself, and you will like really, really, yeah, it will be incredible because you have good, you can do this beside of your study, like one, two, two hours a day, you know, you don't have to drop out now. Me, I drop out, drop out as of school when my business like was generating like constantly for one year, you know. So don't drop out now, you have time, you have time to do this, just breathe, breathe side your business, invest in yourself, learn, and yeah, it will be okay. I love that. Really, it's really actionable advice rather than just start now, putting the money in, putting that financial investment because you're holding yourself accountable. Did your family think that you were crazy when you invested in this at such a young age? Absolutely. But now it's like, it's obvious for one, you know, to invest in mastermind or in, you know, other learning. Oh, I'm sure they're done questioning you now. That's amazing. So tell me, where can people learn more about you and your business and what you're doing with webinars? Actually, I do not like, I don't have content because like, I just have like five, six clients. So I take like equity in their business. So I'm paid if they're doing a lot of money, I'm paid if they're not doing money, I'm not paid. So I don't have like so much content online, you know, I've been Instagram if you want. But yeah, I do not really have like content online. Okay. And your business is webinar agency? Yeah, webinar agency. Well, yeah, so I have a website if you want. Great. Awesome. And then is there anything else that you can share with us before we go? I don't know. I think, yeah, I think it's okay. Okay, great. It's been an absolute pleasure meeting you, John. I'm so inspired by you. I wish that I would have known the things that you know now when I was 21. It's very powerful. It's a really cool message that you're sharing. And I wish you all the best. Will you be at Funnel Hacking Live? Yeah, yeah, I was like lefty. Great. Well, awesome. I look forward to seeing you there and I can't wait to hear more about your success. Yeah, thank you so much, John. Have a great day.
