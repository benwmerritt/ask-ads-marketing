## Transcript
Hi, my name is Jascha Ostaus and I dreamed about this like five years ago. This is when I started my entrepreneur story. I'm from Germany. I'm 28 years old and yeah, I'm running a consulting company and like a coaching business. And mostly we teach like other businesses, mostly agency owners, photographers, videographers, how to scale their business, how to get clients online, how to hire their prices. And we became the number one company doing this in Europe. Like when it comes to this niche, we have a team of like 15 people and I started the company just by myself like three years ago, working like non-stop. Now I have actually a pretty decent lifestyle. I travel around the world because the company is built completely remote so we don't have an office. And yeah, we're scaling pretty fast like 200-300% every year since we started the company and hope my story inspires some other people too.
