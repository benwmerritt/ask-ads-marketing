So really quick in order to show off some animations. Tell us really quick what's your Funnel hacking live experience has been like in the past So like when you because you this is not your first time going to funnel hacking live I've been to every funnel hacking live with the exception of san diego I've been to every single one. I've got all the the I got it all man. I got the swag. I got all the name tags. I got all the things that you know, it's like it ran out stomach to have all the things and all that stuff and You know, I've said this from stage. It's it is the finest event If this is your first event this will ruin you for every other event you go to as far as the way they treat you The quality of the venue the quality of the speakers the quality of just Everything from when you check in to the very last moment and even as you're leaving the just everything is first class everything is wonderful and if you've Never been but you've been to other events You're going to love this and be pissed at the people that have sold you tickets to other stuff in the past because it just can't match Uh, and it's just it is the finest event you will ever go to in this space bar none bar none The first time you spoke at funnel hacking live I remember you took the stage and you talked about copy blocks and you talked about like the basics of copywriting And you play with it like legos and I've always remembered that like you take this lego piece You put this together and it made copy make sense and it was like It was like funnel scripts baby style like it was a very simplest like anybody should be able to understand how to write copy after that And then the next year after that you came on stage I don't know if it was a year later or when two years later. I think two years later. Yeah You came on with the full outfit, uh, which was absolutely wonderful How did you come up with the idea to come out with the unicorn outfit? so I Just was trying to think of something I could do And I don't drink by the way. So it was not alcohol induced or anything like that I'm just trying to come up with a cool idea of of how to have a hook I mean, it's all about hook story offer And my whole thing was a hook a story. It was all about stories and then I made an offer And uh, even though you're not supposed to but it was to raise a bunch of money for o u r Yeah, but um, it was just what could I do that would be a hook? And so an eight foot tall inflatable unicorn suit was the logical answer And then when I had to pull myself out of the thing Luckily, I had practiced at home getting out of the thing And and then I but I didn't practice with the microphone on and so then when I was getting out of the thing Everything was great except for the fact that my microphone fell off But I was yelling so loud everybody nobody knows Oh, yeah, we were everybody was good. Um, okay So I'll introduce this for a minute because having you come back on stage of funnel hiking life is absolutely awesome You've been doing the breakout sessions very often and talking about copy there And I said sat in the room from people like This is genius and they're just dying like they don't know like I will whisper to somebody in the back Like oh, this is like this script and this thing they're like respect the room This is amazing. So like It's appreciated every single time but This year is different. Um, and so to tease us out For the past year you've been interviewing. Uh, someone who is an absolute legend in the industry Um, something that I wish I could say I went to his events back in the day But I was a child like I did not know a thing um, I didn't even know this world existed and suddenly Like being able to watch all the replays and all these different things is like, oh my gosh You were in the room Russell was in the room and you see all these different people that were in the room learning from this man What has it been like for the last year being able to interview the man dan kennedy? So it's it's kind of like I I told my wife They only have a couple of regrets as far as people I've never met. I I never got to see frank sanatra in concert And I don't want to go see willy nelson now because he's a shadow of his former self and I'd rather you know No 70s wilson. I mean 70s then you know 2023 for for some reasons, but you know dan kennedy is not only an og Of copywriting. I mean he's right up there with david ogle v and eugene schwarz and and joe sherman and those guys but he has also been at the forefront of Most of the things that we take for granted like he was doing interviews to sell on tv He was doing infomercials. He was doing direct response. He was doing selling from the stage. He was doing selling what you would call like a A dinner sale type thing that we would think of as a webinar stuff like that He was doing all that stuff in a world where you didn't have the internet You didn't have easy media. You didn't have the ability to drive tons of traffic with facebook and other things I mean he he was doing it in the world when it was tough and When it's just it wasn't like it is now. That's number one number two You can't name me anybody that everybody thinks is like an og In the in the world, you know even russell Uh and and some of the other names out there people that have been on his stage big names Have been on his stage that didn't study at the feet of dan kennedy Dan's been doing it since the 70s man. I mean and you weren't even born in the 70s I was a child in the 70s but um you know dan There is nobody I mean even somebody like john carlton who who's a big time copywriter you you see pictures of John learning from dan and them collaborating and stuff. I mean you can trace Like it's like adam and eve. I don't know who his eve is but I mean you could trace everybody back all roads lead back to dan From 1970 something forward You know guthy renker any of these big companies you you've heard of A lot of people you haven't heard or you have heard of that would not admit dan But he's the guy they bring in the back door to to straighten them out so You know being the student of his And when I first heard of dan kennedy, I couldn't afford to go to his stuff. Y'all need to understand what a Privilege it is what an opportunity is to have this dude be there And you not have to pay thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars to be able to sit there and listen to him and So over the last year one of the things that I've helped out with is interviewing dan I write a column for the no BS newsletter As well. It's the copywriting secrets column But then I also get the opportunity to interview dan for an hour each month and um, sometimes it's you know, russle interviews him for an hour interviewing for an hour sometimes minds in there sometimes it's russle, but It's been interesting to be able to It's kind of intimidating a lot of people would be intimidated like who might ask dan But I've got just enough hoots putt to be like You want me to interview him? I got to get some good stuff out of him So other people like oh, I'm scared to ask like no I get up in his face and If you saw the day with dan last year um You know he was coming at me and I'm like bring it son And so we that was where we kind of came to an understanding, you know, it was kind of like, okay When I messed up his joke he was a little pissed so this year He told me um, he's like now look You got to stick to the script this year because I messed with him last time I didn't stick with the questions I didn't ask him a single question that he was expecting and he oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody do that But I refuse I was like screw it. I may never do this again. So why not? So I started asking him the questions I wanted to know And uh, but Russell didn't get mad dan didn't storm off stage so So But this year we're doing something really cool. We're going to be talking about dramatic demonstrations And this is really key. This is important. This ties in with the miffy This ties in with with the lynchpin all the cool stuff that that russles teaching and it's all going to kind of come together here at funnel hacking live One of the most important parts of all that is doing a dramatic demonstration And I know that you know other people have talked about this I'm not going to be the first people ever to talk about doing a dramatic demonstration But dan's perspective on this is amazing and here's the thing he helped to coordinate Some of the most dramatic demonstrations in direct response So it's not like he's just yanking this out of his nether regions. They're going to talk about it for 88 minutes But we're actually going to talk about real stuff and give you real tools and real Concrete things that you can take And go because that's what i've always been about is about it's not just we're not just going to talk about it I'm not just going to like teach you something for the sake of teaching you something My whole thing is to give you stuff you can Use You don't have to read the whole book to be able to get something out of each chapter You don't have to be able to to do the whole thing to get Something concrete out of a single script. I mean i'm about giving people results that they can walk away with and get a result that night because I'll never forget You know you talk about my origin story with a with a funnel You know, I started selling in 1997. It wasn't until 2001 I was exposed to the idea of a one-page sales letter, you know the big long sales letter and so I learned about that in an afternoon That night I went up to my hotel room I converted my 40 page sales letter into a one-page sales letter and my sales went up 250 overnight literally overnight Wow, and that changed my life and I will never forget that By taking by giving somebody something they could take action on giving it to them in a way that they can take action And then inspiring them to take action on it right now You can change your life and I guarantee from this interview with dain Kennedy That you are going to learn stuff that you could literally go up to your room that night whip out your phone whip out your computer Keep your pants on and whip nothing else out whip out the phone or the computer and take some action and change your business Guaranteed guaranteed you will walk away With the nuggets to be able to do that Because that's important to me and I know it's important to Dan too and that's why you should be a subscriber to the no BS newsletter as well Okay, just as an aside Well, that's awesome So this is going to be a little bit of a different format clearly from you're not coming up You're not speaking on stage, but you are interviewing Dan Kennedy Talking dramatic demonstrations. It's going to be awesome guys if you Don't have your phone You really need to go get it, but you're wrong You're wrong if you don't have your ticket, you're wrong. You don't like your kids You don't like your family. You hate money. You're not you don't take your business seriously You don't want to make a difference in your own life You're just not serious about everything in your life, including your fitness and nutrition If you do not come right now go over there get your ticket get a ticket for a friend reserve your hotel room and be there early so that you can network in the hall if you don't do that, you're not serious Jim Edwards everybody. Thank you very much for that It's actually true like we can't I I'm not going to be the person who says that you don't care about your kids But you if you're looking at your future and you want that better future and you don't have a ticket to funnel hiking live You are stunting yourself You're you are on purpose trying to block yourself from success because the amount of things like aren't I already know dan kennedy's got like the blueprint of what he wants to talk He's got the script. So you already know this is going to blow everyone's socks off I'm a living I am living proof that a single event can change your life I am living proof that You go to an event with a high expectation You learn the thing you're supposed to learn and you apply it It will change your life and this event can be that event for you if but you got to show up You got to show up physically to the event step one step two You got to show up with an open mind and step three you got to show up ready to take action Immediately whether it's imperfect action or not, but taking action show up physically show up mentally show up ready to take action This is the event Plus no cove those plus all the coven craps over and it's amazing and as an aside I was just at that hotel At the marriott um last week. I was at an event Um presenting an event there. It's a great facility Really nice facility. They got a cool water park. They got cool Pools they got pretty good the weight room sucks You don't want to go there. I'd say that it's actually really nice, but I don't want y'all there because it gets really crowded and stuff They got a great running track No gators will jump you on the on the running track. So I mean it's a great facility. It's a great place It's just it's just a wonderful experience all the way around So there's nothing I literally was there There's nothing like an event that takes you out of your regular world and puts you in a future world and Future casts you into a place where you can see where you can be And like and how you can get there and it bridges those two realities that when you walk away Bridging it in reality for yourself becomes so much easier because you've literally lived it Um and it's it is an absolute awesome. So here's the deal You haven't even mentioned the networking mention the networking mention the people that you'll meet the connections You'll make the potential joint venture partners the potential people with lists the people who can help you to spread your word And everything out there to the world that in and of itself is worth showing up.

Uh, do you want to tell everybody what that one is? so I told you that The thing that changed my life From that event and it was in february. I remember exactly where I was it was in boulder, colorado in february Of 2001 so that was 22 Over 22 years ago But I remember it like it was yesterday and the thing that changed my life Was learning how to finally write a sales letter how to do sales copy on purpose That's what launched me on this journey that i've been on now for almost a quarter of a century Over a quarter of a century the first four years of which not selling so so hot I was doing okay, but not to that level what changed it was a sales letter Your ability to write to create to put a sales letter on the web Is the difference between living the way you are now and living at a level that you might not even dare to dream to live And so what better way for me to give back Than to teach you exactly how to write a damn good sales letter in an afternoon See most people when they write a sales letter, they'll take weeks or months Jerking around with it never get it done The hardest drafts the first draft we have tools to help you do it But the biggest thing is understanding what actually goes into a sales letter why it's why it is structured You mentioned the building blocks the lego's why it's structured the way it is There's a whole psychological principle behind each part I'm going to teach you that I'm going to show you how to create that first draft in an afternoon so that you can change your life as well And the cool thing is that you can actually do that before you even get to funnel hacking a lot So you get your sales letter done get it over into a funnel and then take advantage of all the things you're going to be learning To help you take that funnel to the next level So that's how I can help you the most other than telling you you need to make sure you sign up for Funnel scripts because if you're not a member of funnel scripts, you're wrong So that's how's that for a call to action. Yeah, you suck if you don't know in front of me just play um, but That's like that's the over the top close. I mean that's the but but in all seriousness This changed my life being able to write a sales letter All those years of doing it and doing it and doing it and doing it I've written sales letters that have generated a million dollars in sales 5 million 10 million 20 million dollars in sales. Okay I'm gonna show you how to do it not promising. I can't promise you you're gonna make a million bucks Can't promise you're gonna pay off your house. I'm not gonna promise you you'll buy a Rolls Royce and later Give that Rolls Royce to your friend Which I've done, okay I've just I can't promise you you're gonna wake up next to a supermodel or have millions of dollars in the bank But I won't tell you you won't But the difference is Being able to write a sales letter and so that's gonna be my gift to you Is how to write a damn good sales letter in an afternoon Awesome.
