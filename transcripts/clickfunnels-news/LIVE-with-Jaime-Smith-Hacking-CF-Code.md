Like we have so many segment ideas, talking about ClickFunnels 2.0, showing you how to use it more often. Talking about funnels, things that are really cool that I've been hacking and I wanna talk about. Going through highlighting other people, highlighting users more often, highlighting different people who are gonna be speaking. We wanna go through all this stuff so there's a lot happening. If you want more, please just let us know in the comments. So that way we all know we're here. Plus it's nice to let to know that you guys are here. So go ahead and do that. And let's talk really quick about what today is. Today is a special day. A lot of you guys may know who our speaker is today. If you guys already know, let's find, go ahead and put your details down below. And let us know your guesses. But I wanna say it was like four years ago. It may have been five. It was a while ago. In the ClickFunnels group, used to be something a little bit more different. It was a smaller group. It was much more compact. It was much more personable. And we were all able to be able to give and be able to receive. And it was much more personal. The people who won the two Comical Awards came in and they like showered down rain on all the things that they were learning after they got their awards. Like it was this cool place. And it was this place where it was kind of like the wild, wild West. And some people were giving and dropping massive value. And one of those people started to share a lot of the ways that they were hacking ClickFunnels. They started to show all the ways that they were creating new things with ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels didn't create a promo tool. They created a promo tool. ClickFunnels didn't let them move like a column underneath a button. They let it do that. Like they made all these things work and they started to give away a lot of these things for free. And we were like, holy smokes. And it just grabbed everybody's attention. And everybody went crazy. Now today they've built 87 unique scripts that you can use inside of ClickFunnels 1.0 and 2.0. We wanna talk about that. Plus they did that. This person is like single-handedly helped people make millions of dollars online. There are two comma clubs stamped on the back with made by this tool and this person. Like there's processes that would not exist. E-commerce as Funnels would not be the same without this person today. There are so many different things that this person has done that when we started to develop 2.0, we asked if he would come in-house and help us make sure that we develop this in the right direction. So that way it was able to help you the most because he was listening to you. Today we get to listen to and be able to introduce to you Jamie Smith. Jamie Smith, oh my gosh, I'm so excited. It's so wonderful to have you. How are you doing, dude? Hello, hello. Well, I don't even know how to follow up on any of that. That's like, wow, thank you so much. It's the truth. It's funny. Like every time somebody asks like in ClickFunnels Classic, how do I do anything? I'm like, you need CF Pro Tools. You need CF Pro Tools in order to make it work the way you want it to work and be able to make this a conversion engine and make it like scalable and talk to Facebook and talk to all the systems. Like it was pivotal and it remains pivotal as we keep moving. So dude, thank you so much for everything that you've done. My pleasure. Yeah, I was just thinking back to you said it was like four years ago, five years ago. I remember jumping into the Facebook group in 2016 was the first time I started getting involved in the community. It's been a while. Yeah, I think you and I met the very first time in San Diego in 2016. Yup. There. So yeah, I saw you in ClickFunnels Classic in late 2015, like November, December. So I missed the very first phone on Hacking Live but I've been to every one of them since then. Super excited about the one coming up. Just love the community. Love everything about, you know, the entire company I've worked with ClickFunnels for years and love everybody. So it's amazing, amazing place to be. And we're gonna talk about this in a minute but you haven't been as active in the group and there are reasons for that. And it's mostly because your attention has been pulled. Like I know how often Russell messaged you and says, can we make this work? Like I have this idea and I may or may not have been an issue that causes those ideas to come up. And you're like, Ben, why did you say that? But like, I know how much you've been working in the background. I'm just excited to have you here and to announce what it is that you're up to. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so I'm super excited as well. And yeah, it's, you know, the, like you talked about the Facebook group at one point it was a much smaller group. I think, you know, I remember back in the days when it was like 35,000 people. Now we're like, hey, what, 400,000-ish people? So it's, you know, it's grown dramatically. And so of course that brings on the headaches of having to manage all the comments and kind of keep things under control. But I just reached out recently and talked with you, talked with Danny Walsh and ready to jump back in and start sharing some of that value and some of the learning, some of the things that we've done and be able to jump in and go live. And just if somebody's got a question, be able to actually provide back a video response like here's how you do this thing. So I've already got some good ideas. I, you know, I'm in part of the Fulmer Builder Certification group, the Circle Group that's kind of behind the scenes as well. So this morning I saw somebody post a question in there and I'm like, I'm pretty sure we can answer that. So let's, you know what? And everybody else needs to know about that too. So I've got some ideas already for jumping in there and really helping people jump in and start using 2.0 to exposed advantage. Yeah, super excited. So let's, so the announcement is, is kind of basic, but it's, it goes beyond this. So guys, what I want you to do is I want you to stick around and I want you to comment what it is that you would love to learn either about ClickFunnels or about CF Pro Tools to help you grow. Like what is one thing that if you could ask Jamie a question or any of the ambassadors, what would it be? Because there's something new that all of the ambassadors are doing every single Wednesday. So today's Tuesday, every single Wednesday, there's going to be a live from the ambassadors where they're going to be answering your questions. So you drop all of your questions, the ambassadors are going to be creating little videos. We're going to be able to do that for you and be able to make sure that your questions are answered ASAP inside of the ClickFunnels community. So make sure that you are paying attention in the ClickFunnels group for the Ambassador Hour. That's going to be happening. And Danny's going to be running that. And I know like we're already like signing up a whole bunch of the ambassadors in order to join in. And Jamie has officially joined the ambassadors program because we know the value he gives. And we would love to be able to have him be able to give value to you guys. So if you guys have questions, so in specific you want to know, let us know down in the comments. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I loved, you know, honestly everything I've ever done has been built on the back of customer requests and comments and questions inside the Facebook group. I mean, you know, like you mentioned, we've got 87 different kind of custom scripts that, you know, C approach tools provides. And those are all based on comments or questions or feature requests from people, you know, some of those directly from Russell, some of those from Dean Grazio, see Tony Robbins team, some of those from some big people that are also using ClickFunnels. And are like, oh man, I would love to be able to do this with my offer. And so we try and build those things out. So the more things you can ask about and say, hey, is there a way to do this, especially when it comes to 2.0, like we're still building new stuff for 2.0 when it comes to C approach tools. So knowing in advance, like what are you struggling with? What can be a little smoother? What can be a little bit better? What features maybe don't exist today, but would be really great if they did. And then we look at how can we support that. I've always said, I've talked with Todd and Russell, you know, all the partners about this, I've always felt like C approach tools is a partnership with ClickFunnels in that, and especially with the engineering team, I see that like the engineering team's job is to solve the big problems, the problems that everybody has, you know, make sure that things continue to operate and function and work the way they're supposed to and build out the kind of core foundation of everything. But there's always kind of those 10% of problems, right? There's those things that, okay, not everybody needs this. So we really don't want to take away priority from the engineering team to work on this thing that maybe only, you know, a handful of people will use, but C approach tools can. Like I can do that. I can build those things. And then that allows the engineering team to focus on what they do best and allows me to kind of quickly, more quickly kind of roll out some of those things. And so, you know, as 2.0 comes along, those are the sorts of things we're looking at as well. It's like, okay, what are the things that aren't there yet? But man, it'd be really cool if it was. And if it falls in that like, okay, yeah, the engineering team really has other bigger fish to fry. Let's see if we can help that out. So like there's, I wish we could show you guys like what's coming. The closest you guys can get is when you get in, go into the ClickFunnels account. I'll show you this as we're going. But in the top right hand corner, you're able to click and see all the notifications and everything that's happening. You can go in there. You can vote on the features that you want. So you can make sure that the ship is moving in the direction that will help your business the best. Vote on it. Let us know that it's important to you. And then watch Jamie, because Jamie just might sweep in and make something that just answers all the problems. So first off, yes, I see you guys asking questions. So number one, we love having you. Absolutely appreciate it. And we're going to go through this in much, much more detail. Number two, this is not a place to drop links. So we appreciate you, but this is not a place for link dropping. But it is a place to ask your questions. So let us know what questions you guys have as far as 2.0 and all that. And if you guys are OK, we want to go through a couple of news things really quick, super quick. And then I want to talk about what scripts CFOtools used in order to invent the idea that we needed 2.0. Like what part of 2.0 is so cool because it installed things that were inside of CFOtools. And then I want to talk about the new scripts that you've got for 2.0. Is that cool? Yeah, absolutely. Cool. All right. Absolutely. So first off, first piece of news is did you know that we just passed a milestone, everybody? Let us know if you know what milestone we passed. So yesterday, we passed the 100-day milestone. Today is day 99. And it is time to get ready for Funnel Hiking Live. Yes. Can't wait. I'm freaking out. So like Jamie, I've been to every single Funnel Hiking Live except for the very first one. And it is something that you need to experience. This isn't one of those like, Susan, how many, I know you were there last year. How many times have you gone to fall? Oh, are you muted? I'm not hearing you. God, I was muted. I was pointing. I've been to the last three. I also have three hanging up right there. But they have all been amazing. And I cannot wait for this year. This year is going to blow them all away. Right. And it's like, so we have an inside view on what's going on. And you guys should have that as well. If you guys have not watched the announcements, the things that are going on, you need to. The speakers are being announced. All these things that are just amazing are coming. Funnel Hiking Live, for me, for the very first year, like it was the very first year I went to Funnel Hiking Live. In 2015, I was on ClickFunnel staff. And I wasn't on staff for very long. I was on staff for like four to six months. So I was there long enough to go to Funnel Hiking Live, support everybody in certification program, and then I was out. And then I became a freelancer and an agency. And I started doing all this myself, building my own info products and all that jazz. I went on my own entrepreneurial journey that Russell tells us that we should go on. And following the doctrine, making it happen. And the first Funnel Hiking Live, I went there. I was just an employee. And it was our job to make sure that you had no stress. Like, this was supposed to be a party. This was supposed to be nothing, but just this absorption of the very best of the best. And we loved building that for you. It was exhausting. But it was massively important, super, super powerful. And every year has just been a step up from that, with everyone giving and all the steps. Susan, what was your first Funnel Hiking Live like? Because you've heard the hype. Oh, man. Yeah, I went the first year that I jumped into my business. My mentor that brought me into my business originally was a speaker at FHL. So I was like, oh my gosh, I have to be there. She's my mentor. Shout out to Lauren Golden. And then the next year, another one of my mentors was a speaker. And then the year after that, another one of my mentors was a speaker. So we are three for three. I'm pretty sure we're going four for four this year, which is going to be amazing. Because we have McCall speaking again. She was one of those. And so it's been so fun just watching people grow, people that have mentored me grow. But the first Funnel Hiking Live experience was just like it just blew me away. I had been to a lot of different types of conferences and network marketing type events, which are a little bit different than your typical business conference as well. But none of it compares to Funnel Hiking Live. And it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And in a good way, it's like there are so many people that are there that you can always find people that you can become friends with that need what you have, that have what you need, and that you can talk to. So it's just the Funnel Hackers, the hardcore Funnel Hackers are there. It's like that moment where you're waiting for the doors to open and everyone's either sitting on the ground or talking to each other. You meet everybody that you never expected to meet. You've got people that are doing spectacular. You've got people that are just getting started. You've got somebody who would love to do a collab with somebody who's really good at something and doesn't have the thing that you have. And they're all right next to you. This is not the awkward Facebook discussions, just trying to make things work and hoping that the person on the other side is actually who they say they are. This is legit networking even for the introverts. I mean, come on, Russell's putting on the party. So it is spectacular. I remember the budget for last year was like $3 million, and it's been up to $5 million. And so it's going to be a party. Jamie, you went in 2015. That was the year. That was San Diego, right? Oh, muted. Yeah, we lost your audio. Oh, I can't hear him. No, I think we lost his audio. Oh, sorry. I turned my, I thought I was unmuting my mic, and I actually muted it. 2015 was Vegas, 2016 was San Diego. That was my first funnel hacking live. And I was just, it was a few months after I had started using QuickFunnels and kind of got into the Facebook group and really kind of got to know the community. And man, I was so excited. And honestly, every year that I go since then is that same feeling. Like I'm so excited to go back. It's always fun to see the people that you've met at past FHLs and talk and get to reconnect with people. Again, but it's just as exciting, if not more exciting, to meet the new people that you, like you said, you didn't even expect to meet. But it's like, oh man, like we were meant to be here together. Like there's a reason why we were all at the same place at the same time. So it's really the coolest thing. And I saw somebody post in the comments and say, hey, you know, this is the one event to go to. If you can only do one event a year, this is the one event to go to. 100. Really is. It's like I like try to recreate the playlist so that way I can capture some of that. But it's the last time I went to Funnel Hacking Live, I was on the team again. And I was, I walked into the room where everybody was there like the night before. There's just this vibe that I don't think you can express. Like you've got people who are in there who are changing lives were in front of thousands, if not millions of people. And they're all there to learn how to up their game, how to connect with each other and how to create. There's this vibe that you've never felt before. And I just messaged Russell and I box him like, dude, I forgot how great it is to be around our people. And he just mess back to you as that's our people. This is the place. It's going to be so, so, so cool. So if you don't have your ticket, you need to get it. Yes, for sure. For sure. And I will say I've been there both as an attendee and as a staff member as well. I was on the staff of ClickFunnels for five years. So I've worked a lot of the events as well. And I will say is everyone should recognize how much effort the ClickFunnels team puts into this event. It is no small feat. I mean, we have dozens and dozens and dozens of people that are working in the background, some that you don't even see that are there running support and running, making sure that everybody has everything that they could possibly need. So the team works so hard to put it on. And it is by far the best run event that I've ever been to and been involved in. And it's the one you get the most out of, the speakers. And every year, I'm like, OK, how are you going to top last year's speakers? And every year, it gets better and better. So yeah, absolutely. It is a must-have. Got to be there. Get your ticket, whatever it takes. Get there. Chill out. I still remember Steve Larson. The first year was also 2016. He was like, yep, I can't even afford a taxi to get from my hotel. I couldn't stay at the hotel where the event was. So he rented a bike to ride the bike to the event center. And then stashed the bike in the bushes so that he would have to ride back to the hotel at the end of the night. And it's like, whatever you have to do to get there and be there and be in that room, definitely do it. And he traded funnels in order to do it. Like, he learned to fund a game. Yeah, absolutely. He traded funnels, and they paid for the tickets in order to get in there. This is something like it's not a question of why I can't. It's a question of how do I. Because it's a guaranteed we'll change your life. You'll see yourself in a moment, seeing all the things that brought you to this point and where your life can go if you're willing to believe. And that's what the whole event is about. And it's not just a rah-rah. This year is a revamp of magnanimous proportions. I know how to say this. This is like the groundbreaking, how do you do it step by step? How do you structure your business so that way it's built today? Like, nobody knows how much, like, ClickFunnels spends like, if I remember correctly, ClickFunnels spends like a million dollars a month on ad spend. That's like a stat that was like over a year old before I was on the team. So I don't know if that's, I know that was what it was then. I can only imagine it's gone up. You want to be in the room with some, with these people that are all changing the game with a company that is changing the game is going to make an experience. You don't want to forget and telling you the way to build your business in a way that will withstand everything that's coming. So it is, it is cool. All right. Oh, man. OK, so that's in. OK, we're counting down 99 days to FHL. But this week, there's something exciting happening on Friday, not in Florida, but happening in Boise, where ClickFunnels is located. Ben's here. I'm here. Jamie, do you live here? I'm here as well. So all the cool people are at. It is. So if you guys have been watching Russell's stories and his reels and like just his social media lately, he's been teasing a lot about what's coming up this week. It's no secret. It is the library and Atlas Research Groundbreaking happening on Friday on the screen right now. There's a video showing this was just posted yesterday, I think, to his stories. And this is he's getting everything all set up and ready because people that are coming to this event, they're going to get a private tour of some of his collection. And so he's getting it all set up. This is good. This is what it's going to be be like when people are walking through. They're going to be able to look at all of this stuff. One thing I wanted to point out is that I think in just a minute, I think in the same video, you might have already seen it. I think it was last week. He put a story up teasing like a pocket watch. Right. It was like he was like, if anybody knows who this pocket watch belongs to, like let me know. And I don't know. Did any of you get it right? Because he actually revealed the answer in the can we play that video one more time? Yeah. So take a quick look. See who you spot. OK, there was a clue right there. Who is this that we're seeing? Yeah, P.T. Varnum, right? The there's a pocket watch right there. So I thought that was really awesome. I did not get the answer right, but I think it is so awesome that he has all this stuff and that we get to see it either virtually through these videos he's been making or if you're going to be there this coming Friday, so that's what's coming up. And then then I know that you have been a bit more behind the scenes because you were actually in the office right now and we're yesterday. So what's been going on there? You brought up the pocket watch. I'm here in the office and I'm just going crazy and enjoying stuff. And it was lunch and I told Russell, like, if you have anything you want me to do today, let me know. He goes, you want to go to the library later? I'm like, yes. And so he's like, OK, cool. So we go and work and it's like end of the day. Everybody is going home and Russell comes out and he's like, all right, you ready to go? I'm like, yeah, he goes first, we need to take this there. And he picks up the pocket watch and is like, can you hold this for me so it doesn't break? Such responsibility. It's like so we went there. We like reorganized everything or to make sure P.T. Barnum's stuff was shown like so much better. And like, I don't think you guys understand what he's collecting like there are. There's success magazines like people will like buy success magazine for $10,000, $25,000 and they'll put it like on the wall as like their gift, like the thing that they are extremely proud of. Dan Kennedy has three of them that he has on his wall. Dan Kennedy went and visited the library that he's going to be showing at the groundbreaking on Friday. Russell has everyone he can find. We're talking well over 50, well over 80. I wouldn't be shocked if it's over 100. These are beautiful, crisp, well taken care of like pieces of history. And he's like, this is the very first one just yesterday. He was just sitting down and then geeking over the little things like, this is the first one. Do you know the story behind this? For those of you who are coming to groundbreaking, I just want to hype you up a little bit because it's going to be absolutely amazing. I'm so excited for you guys to be here. I'm excited to be able to be here along with Susan. It's going to be... We talked about the times that we both learned about secrets of success. And Russell showed on the stage, all the pieces that he's collected, or just even just a small piece, just on the other side of the stage, on the other side of the wall, am I on the right side of the building? Yes. On the other side of the... No, other side of that wall. That's, there it is. On the other side of that wall is where it's all being built, where the groundbreaking is taking place. Everyone's going to be able to come in here. They're going to be able to listen to one of the people that's helped Russell build out this library, somebody that everybody knows in this industry. It's going to be an event like none other. So if you guys want, and this is just an option, it's going to late, like it starts at noon, and it's going to like eight o'clock, nine o'clock, plus all the networking, it's going to be madness. But if you guys want, because Susan and I will be there, maybe we'll do like an impromptu just hang out. Then we'll just kind of do a recap if you guys want. If you guys want that, you guys got to let us know. Because it's so cool. And I cannot wait. And I can't wait for Susan. I can't wait for everybody. It's going to be a party. And it's going to be a party well worth coming to. And I can't wait for you guys to come. If you guys can't make it, watch out for that, because that's going to be cool. We may not send out a text message. So the text message might not work, but definitely follow us on Thursday. Definitely follow us on the go live on Thursday and next Tuesday, because we'll talk about it as we keep going. All right, maybe you'll see us Friday. Yeah, maybe this is Friday. You guys let us know, though, we're here to help you guys. This is your show. This is the Funnel Hacker show. You guys are the Funnel Hackers. We're just two nerds. And so who we get to bring on really cool people every once in a while. So yeah, let's talk about that. Yeah, it's because they're speaking of the really cool people. Let's get back to Jamie. Yeah. All right, so we've we've heard a lot of how CF Pro Tools got started. Obviously, it was because of ClickFunnels, now known as Classic. So we've already mentioned a little bit about how a lot of the CF Pro Tools add-ons in Classic are not actually needed in 2.0 anymore. And I think we've got a list of those. We're just going to highlight a few of them of what's not like what we needed to have in Classic, but because of your efforts and because of the demand and like showing the necessity of these, you worked with the ClickFunnels team to just get them built right into 2.0. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, definitely. I think there's some of the big things. You know, one of the things that in fact, Russell shares every once in a while, a funny little story, when we were rebuilding, this is when I had actually joined the ClickFunnels marketing team. I had Russell last meet to come on the team and work with him on the marketing team to help customize his funnels and kind of add features and do cool stuff. And I was like, man, that'll really I was like, yes, of course, I would love to do that. So we were going through the traffic secrets when that book was launching and we were building out that funnel and kind of thinking through the structure of the offer of what's on the order form, what's on the OTO pages, what's OTO2, all that fun stuff. And he's like, man, what else can we do? You know, for you funnel hackers, you understand this. Sometimes you're like, OK, how do we increase my average cart value on the front end so that I can spend more on ads to acquire more customers to get more people to go the rest of the way through the funnel? That's what we do, right? And so we're doing that with Russell. And he's like, what else can we add to bump up this average cart value? And I said, well, you know, we could just add another bump. He's like, wait, what? You can like add multiple bumps. And in classic, you can't really do that out of the box. And I said, yeah, but we have that NC approach. Well, it's like, yes, we can add multiple bumps. He's like, oh, well, we've got to do that. And now it's just like everybody needs to do that. If you have a bump, you should have two bumps. You probably don't want 50 bumps, but you should at least do what you can to increase that average cart value. So they've taken that and just made it part of 2.0. Like to be able to have multiple bumps, to be able to do the things you need to do, to increase your average cart value so you can afford to bring in more customers. And so being able to put your products in and, you know, other things like being able to reorganize your products. In classic, it was like the order you created your products in is how they showed up on the page. But now you create and manage your products separately, and then you can drag and reorganize the products on a particular page. So if you want to show them one way on one page, you can do that. We're showing differently on another page. You can do that. And so, you know, just a few of those like little things that were so critical that people needed, we just built them into 2.0. So and being able to, you know, really customize your order bump content to kind of make it stand out a little bit more, you know, just a bunch of cool stuff that, you know, things that Russell was doing on all of his funnels. It's like, okay, if Russell's doing it, then we really need to make this part of 2.0. So they've really worked hard at doing that within the editor. Yep. And it's, it works seamless. Like this is a seamless process. So I rebuilt the, uh, I rebuilt an order form here real quick. And so like you guys can see, I've got multiple bumps available here. And if I've created multiple options, I can click on an option. Same as you kind of see this option right here. I can see that in order bumps as well. That gets right. That's like two or three scripts that you built that are now inside of 2.0 automatically. And it's not complicated. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really cool. Yeah. Thank you for bringing it up. Like the bump quantity selector and the bump selector, all these things that we, you know, have to make to work in classic 2.0 just does it, which is great. So yeah, super excited for that. Really cool stuff. Um, another thing, remember when we have, oh, so we talked about rearranging products. We talked about bump images. Like, do you guys notice like there was bump image in all of these, right? So like if you go to step number two, it has an image inside of here. It can have the custom description that you want. You can organize all of that inside of 2.0. You don't have to use any custom scripting anymore. That's because of Jamie. Jamie said, you know what? That's important. This is helped. This hasn't helped. He knows so many people have used CF Pro Tools and said, as they're doing it, Jamie, we're trying to get it to do this. Jamie knows what's working. And so he's been able to adjust and tweak and be able to make sure that these things are built for conversion inside of 2.0 out of box. Yeah. That's the, you know, I, I've been extremely blessed to work. I was actually, you know, looking through it. At this point, we've had over 30,000 people go through and use CF Pro Tools at some, in some way or fashion. In the new system that we built that we rolled out here a few years ago, the kind of software based version of that. We've got over 14,000 accounts in there. We've got one customer, one of our customers has over 2,000 add-ons. He's running hundreds of funnels and they all have multiple add-ons on each of those. And so I've been able to see a lot of funnels and work with a lot of people and handle a lot of customer support requests and just, you know, hey, it'd be awesome. We can do this or is there a way we combine these things to make it even better? And so trying to bring those things forward to everybody is so, so cool to be able to, you know, take that feedback and just help the entire community benefit from that. And so guys, if you guys have questions about 2.0, about CF Pro Tools, make sure you're dropping those down. We want to give Jamie a list of things that he can continue to talk to you guys about and be able to support. So that way you guys have all the tools that you need. One thing that I loved, you came out with this tool, I think it was like a year and a half ago called the magic mover. And like it let me put like, so in ClickFunnels Classic, when you build a section, you have rows. And once you build a section with rows, I can't put rows within rows. Right. It's just, it's not an option. Yep. 2.0, it is an option. Yes. And so like that's built in. I didn't know you're still, I want to know kind of like why, because I believe it's available for 2.0 as well. And we'll talk about the ones that are available at that point. But it's, it's so, so cool. So just as an example really quick. So if I wanted a three column, here we go. If I wanted a three column underneath this button, I can come up to settings and just say, you know what, make sure that all of the sections can also act as an element. And so now when I come in here and I say, add an element, I come over to blank. I'm able to see a full page section, a wide section, a small, extra small. So I can build out a whole section. I can put three columns in it, or I could put a flex column in it. I could put all my images in there and it's all customizable. It's all working. And it's, it's simple. You just need to understand that that is available inside of the settings for you. And it works. Really, really well. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. It's, it's amazing in that and the flex container element that you can add where you can do some of those things and really, really tweak your desktop version versus your mobile version. Like the new editor, it has just these amazing features in it that are, I'm super excited about. And I'm actually building out like one of the add-ons that will be rolling out. Hopefully this week, fingers crossed, I saw Matt King is on here. He's going to be helping me test it out. This week is the Chromo Code Pro add-on that allows people to do promo codes, discount codes in 2.0. And so we're in the final stages of testing that. But as I was building out, like the look and the feel of how you are able to input that promo code and have like a nice apply button to be able to click the button and apply the code to your order. Flex containers, man. It's like, oh, this is so cool. Like we, we doing this in classic took a ton of custom code and style sheets and CSS and like really being on the wrap certain elements with other extra code. It took a lot of work, but in 2.0, it's just, no, you just click a few things and you say, Hey, I want to flex container and I want to, I want to lay out like Rose. And here's what I wanted to do on mobile. Here's what I want to do on desktop. And it's just super, super cool. So I'm really excited about the kind of the way they've organized the editor. It's really what I needed for a long time. It's great. The crazy thing that I love about the magic mover too, or any of these that you do is you like give like full on training. It's not like here's how to do it. You give a training on how to install it. Like these are the elements that you'll use this. So if you want to master class, not just on funnel building, but like how to actually make things work just right not just for the scripts, but for if you want to be a master funnel builder, see approach rules is one of the places like I go to because it's just, it's so much fun and it works. Um, yeah, one more thing about the magic mover. And this is, this is why we have it upgraded for 2.0 as well. Cause there are a lot of things that, you know, that they built that they fixed with the 2.0 editor where that's no longer really needed. But there are some things where I've seen people that are using it for very specific things like the checkout elements. You still can't like insert custom things into the checkout elements itself because it's all kind of this contained, very logical thing. But you can use the magic mover add on to say, Hey, I want to insert a custom field on my page and then I want the magic mover to insert that into step two of my checkout form. And so then you can collect those extra things like T-shirt sizes or, you know, what's your favorite color or whatever those custom input fields that you want to be part of your checkout process. You can do that with a magic mover add on. Well, there's, there's other things too. Like you've been playing with like one of the things like that I love is right now in the ClickFunnels editor, I can build an order form and I can make it be a one step order form, a two step order form or a three step order form. Yeah, I can make it do all those things. And right now you're creating scripts to make sure that I'm collecting all the data every time somebody goes through each step. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's something that, you know, existed in classic that hasn't quite made its way over. It's on the list, but you know, it's again, engineering needs to focus on the bigger foundational problem. So we'll be rolling out again, hopefully this week, an add on that will allow when somebody puts their email in on step one, that we collect that email address immediately. So then if they don't complete the order, you can do that follow up with them, that abandoned cart emails and the workflows that are associated with that. So that's going to, that's going to be super cool. And I think a lot of people will benefit from that. Yep. And there's like, there's so many other things that we could talk about. Like I remember when we, you created traffic, when Russell built the traffic secrets funnel, the idea was that on the upsell, they wanted to, if you didn't take one of the order bumps on the, on the first page, you wanted to, you, he wanted to show something unique on the upsell. Like you want to be able to add additional things as order bumps inside of the upsell and be able to give people an opportunity to do that. Based on what they bought on the previous page, that wasn't available now inside of ClickFills 2.0. You've got custom paths. So like you can state, did somebody buy this yesterday or no, if they did send them this page where it's formatted different. You don't have to do all the crazy coding that Jamie Smith did to make it happen. Because I rebuilt that traffic secrets funnel at least 10 times, both for myself and for others. Like, yeah, it's beautiful. But man, that's a script. Have fun. Yeah, it is. Yeah. There's a lot of add-ons that make that happen in classic. And so that is one of the super cool things with 2.0 is being able to have those conditional paths based on what somebody has taken action, what they've done and show them different pages based on that. So yeah, super cool. And, um, yeah, I was, that was a fun one to work on. I really enjoyed that. In fact, when you jump into the CFO Tools dashboard, um, you'll see on the dashboard itself, we actually, I actually recorded like five hours worth of training. So you scroll down a little bit on that past the add-ons, you'll see there's a whole training and resources section. I actually did a full like five hour deep dive into how we built out the traffic secrets funnel. Yeah. And so like you were saying, if you really want to get in and kind of understand like a funnel building and like thinking through the offer and like how the pages should work and the things you can do, those are great kind of resources to jump off with. Yep. Absolutely. So yeah. And we'll be doing more and more of that stuff with, you know, 2.0 is we, is we getting in and digging more there and we see more and more funnels built out in 2.0, like here's the way these things are actually accomplished. So before we talk about like the ones that are released available right now in 2.0 to call out the obvious, we know that there are lots of other funnel building platforms out there. We know that there are all these other things you created, you made CF classic something that made the internet marketing world like pay attention to it and E-Com and in all these other things, like it just, uh, there's no way to minimize it. Right. And so I can't imagine there's got to be people locked on the door. Why are you still on the click funnels bandwagon? Like, cause it's a bandwagon, we're having a party and we're going to change the world and those who are on it know it. Right. But why are you here? Yeah. Honestly, I will, I will say this. Um, there are several reasons actually I had this conversation with Danny, uh, Danny yesterday, uh, when we were talking about the ambassador program, I said, here's the thing, Russell has talked about this and I am a whole hearted proponent of this same philosophy and that is, yes, there are other options out there and those other options may be less expensive. Um, in the short term, but in the long term, they're going to be more expensive because there's no way that they can continue to provide the level of support that click phones they would provide because they don't have the community. They don't have the training. They don't have the education and they aren't charging enough to actually be able to keep the lights turned on. So when the lights go out, the lights are going to go out for everybody. Um, and that's a very, very bad thing. Click phones is not going to have that problem. It may seem like, Hey, this is a more expensive option, but it's not expensive if you use it right. It's actually a best investment that you can make. Um, and so knowing that, Hey, we have hundreds of people on the support team alone that are here and ready to help you get these things done right. Um, and we've got this huge community of people and we've got this huge, um, you know, educational platform that Russell has built out. Um, that's the biggest reason I don't click phones. It isn't going anywhere. I have legitimate concerns about some of the other platforms and whether they'll be able to, uh, make it to the long haul. And then the other thing is the people at click funnels themselves, like Russell, there's a reason that funnel hacking live is like the best party on the planet. It's because Russell attracts the people like he is, and he is a genuinely phenomenal person and he cares and he's genuine. When he talks about, he wants to change the world. He wants to make, you know, the entrepreneurs are the world changers. Um, and he wants to do everything he can to support them. He's a hundred percent genuine with that. The entire team is a hundred percent genuine with that. I've never worked with a group of people that I have loved more than I'd love the click phones team. Um, and I don't, there's no reason that anybody could ever give me that I should abandon that family and move to another family. I mean, would you ever do that? Like, Oh yeah, you know what? My kids are cool. My wife's cool, but you know, I'm just going to abandon them and move to this other family like, no, nobody does that. That's, so it's like, no, they're, they're my family. This is, this is, these are my people. You guys are my people. Everybody in this community is my people and that's, this is where I'm staying. So a hundred percent. I get that question all the time. Like people ask me every day, like, why haven't you started building for this or that or this other thing? And I'm like, why would I like, there's so much of a community here. There's so much more opportunity for everybody where we are. Why would I jump ship and go somewhere else? It makes no sense. Absolutely. I very well said it's everybody knows it's a season of transition and like we've been moving from click funnels classic to 2.0. And now we're taking 2.0 to where it's going to go. I cannot wait for everything that you guys get to see, like being able to hang out with the devs a couple of times for the last couple of months. Jamie, you don't know the stuff, but like, you know, it, there is stuff coming down the pipeline that you don't want to miss. And when you jump out of the family, you're going to wish you hadn't. Yeah, there is. Oh, so excited. Anyway, enough of the hype man. Cause I love. So, so I want to hear about the stuff that you're working on now. So we already heard you talk about two of the add ons that you are hoping to release soon, but I think a lot of people don't know that there is already stuff in CF Pro Tools for CF 2.0. Yeah, absolutely. I get that. That's probably the biggest question we get recently. In fact, at last FHL, that was the question everybody kept coming up to me and asking like, Hey, is it going to work with 2.0? Like, yes, absolutely. The concept is the same. It's a platform. So every, everything that we can upgrade or is still necessary, we will absolutely upgrade to work with 2.0. We already have about 14 different add ons. We work to upgrade and test with 2.0 specifically. So if you're in CF Pro Tools, you can go in to the add on list and you can type in CF 2 and the, for the tags. And I believe it's that actually, yeah, click on all add ons and you should be able to put in, built by tag there and click on CF 2.0 and it will show you all the ones that we've already upgraded. And, you know, like the type headline is one that's really cool. People like that to be able to, you know, if you, you know, Russell talks about like you have to test out all these different hooks. Well, how about if you could have five different hooks on the same page at the same time, like that's type headline. It allows you to have that kind of, you know, type out a headline. I use this on the CF Pro Tools landing page for a long time and it converts like gangbusters, you know, and content tag where we'll be able to do like FAQ sections and things like that. The magic mover we talked about being able to do, you know, and you scroll down a little bit farther. I think I've got one on the tip of my tongue that I'm trying to think of hover pairs, you know, you can mouse over different things. There's all kinds. Well, the big one that we upgraded first was the Vimeo add-on, the auto-play add-on. This is one that Russell used on every funnel we ever built with Classic and then also with 2.0. And now there's a Vimli involved that does the same thing. But that was the way you get that video to kind of auto-play the motion and then have the sound muted and then when you click it, it would restart the video back in the beginning so nobody misses the hook. And so, you know, things like that, we've already gone through the Slick Slider being able to do image carousels, testimonial sliders, you know, that kind of automatically moved through testimonials, you know, those things that are kind of helping engage the audience. You know, we've got all those things kind of upgraded and we're continuing to, you know, move forward on upgrading everything that we can and everything that's still necessary. You know, we won't have to do multiple bumps because multiple bumps is already building into 2.0. So the ones that we don't need to upgrade, we won't. But they'll still be available for Classic if you're still using that. And that's not going anywhere. And then anything that we, you know, is still kind of a necessary feature will upgrade. And then I'm really excited about digging in and seeing what are the new things that we can build that are 2.0 specific? Like what are the things, you know, how can we grease the wheels along the way? What are things that are people trying to accomplish? And I know just based on years of experience now that there's going to be people asking questions about 2.0 specifically. They're like, Oh, yeah, we've got a unique way we can solve that problem and building out some cool new stuff. So that's, that's why I'm super excited. It's like, after a while, you know, we've got 87 different things built. And that's just ones we've released. I probably have another hundred that I never actually released things that I built for Classic. And it's like, you know, eventually like, oh man, I feel like I've done all this stuff, but now it's like this whole new sandbox I get to play in. So it's very cool. Yeah. And in the comments is saying, oh, so that's how he does it. I think when you were talking about the Vimeo autoplay one, I was going to say, if you see Russell's funnel doing something, you're like, I don't know how he did it. Chances are it's a CF Pro tool add on. Go in there and check, check for it. Yeah. Yeah. That's the one thing, you know, Russell is amazing. I appreciate working with him so much. But yeah, it's pretty much, you know, we kind of make the joke that pretty much everything we build, every funnel he has has some sort of CF front tools on it. It's got some sort of customization. Yeah. Yeah. Same goes for us to like any funnel that I build, it has something, something from there on. They're so helpful. There's everything, you know, a lot of it is like almost mechanical, like it's changing the order form. It's changing how something is behaving. But there's also ones in there that are just changing like the magic mover, right? It's changing. The you can change the look of something from it too. And so there's, there's so many fun things in there to explore. So really quick, Jamie, what has been the experience for you just building apps for ClickFunnels? I know we've gone on for a long time. We've got to cut off at some point. Yeah. Yeah. But like, like for those people who are like, who are tech savvy like you, who've been able to kind of love the ClickFunnels idea and want to play with the idea of developing these things and making those things like, what has it been like to be able to like, I don't know, just work with ClickFunnels because it is, we were doing a lot. All of one, all at one time. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. No, I think it's great. I think the beautiful thing about ClickFunnels is that, and I love this about classic and this is what made it so much easier. You kind of know what to expect, what's built into the pages to begin with from a JavaScript framework perspective. So this is probably going to get super geeky for some people, but hopefully for those that want to hear it, it's the right thing. You know, so jQuery is kind of baked into every ClickFunnels page. So if you understand that, it makes it that much easier to develop upon. And so having that and knowing that it's always going to be there, then you can build these kind of consistent, reliable add-ons and these scripts that do these things. You know, the CSS frameworks they use are consistent and repeatable. So once you kind of learn and understand how things are structured, then you can easily jump in. And I always say like, you know, ClickFunnels really wants you to customize your pages. They inject multiple opportunities for you to inject your own custom code, whether it's tracking codes for Facebook and Google Tag Manager and whatever else, or it's your own custom style sheets, or it's your own JavaScript or whatever, there are multiple places to inject that and plug that in. So they know that people want to have that ability and need that ability in some cases. And so it's there and definitely take advantage of it. And some things are just, you know, some things are just easier if you can get in and tweak the code just a little bit, you know, versus playing with the thousand settings and trying, you know, not getting to quite where you want to get, but I know it's close. But man, you know, if you, if you really can kind of get in and learn that kind of custom style sheets and JavaScript, you can really go a long way with ClickFunnels. All right. Really quick, guys, if you've enjoyed Jamie, please let us know in the comments. Please let Jamie know that you appreciate him. And I know you've been all over the post. I appreciate you. Ann's been loving your software for years just like us. Like it's just, I appreciate you guys. You've been playing with going live a little bit more in the Facebook group like an ambassador and being able to share a couple of things. So if you guys have specific things that you want to learn about, questions that you have, see approachable scripts that you would like to see used, how do you use it, what are the different things? Let Jamie know because there might be some stuff coming and that's going to be really, really, really cool. Thank you, Jamie. Appreciate it. Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. My pleasure. Yeah. So awesome. Yes. Definitely. Please let me know anything that we can build and then we can help with anything, any questions you have. That's what, that's what we're here for. That's what lights me up. So awesome. Really quick. Tomorrow is Ambassador Weekly. It starts at 11 Mountain Standard Time. So we start at one Mountain Standard two hours earlier. That'll happen. So make sure that you're there for that so you can see everything else that ambassadors are doing. And then we'll be here next Thursday in order to do, we'll be able to highlight the community, be able to talk about all the juicy things of what's happening in the world, the click funnels and if you have ideas or want to see something specific, let us know. And on Friday, after the groundbreaking, if you guys want us to be able to do this, a fun recap, let us know in the comments. Guys, we appreciate you being here. Make sure that you get, if you are not signed up for text messages, you text FHTV to 208-231-3797. That's 208-231-3797. Make sure that you guys sign up for that and get the email, Recaps, at funnelhacker.tv. We've got more for you, more to hype you up, more to keep you going, more to keep that fire burning. Jamie, thank you for being here. Susan. Thank you. It's a blast as always. We'll see you guys later. My name is Russell Brunson and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started and we don't even have gold to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happy every single day. And it's happened through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you. It's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you. They have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
