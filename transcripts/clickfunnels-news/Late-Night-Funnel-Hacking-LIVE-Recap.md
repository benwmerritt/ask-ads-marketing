## Transcript
Hey everybody, we are live welcome everybody to funnel Hacker TV. We are so excited to have you guys. We're doing a really cool episode today and we're just doing the recap. So we did an episode already this morning. We covered a lot of things that we did this morning today. We get to hang out with geek out now. Susan has heavy and geek out like when Russell brought him on like, I don't know why you just don't have Andrea make Susan do this like they got this. And he's like, then stop selling yourself out of the opportunity. So Susan can you introduce everybody really quick because this is fun. Yes. Okay. So we've got Dan Havy here. He is the like coding CS wizard within click funnels. You can make it do whatever we want it to do. And we have Andrea Peer. She is like the mastermind of all the things that we do and customer journey genius. So let's go ahead and roll the intro and we'll get into it. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are funnel hackers. And these are our stories. Hey there, everybody. We're so excited to have you guys here really quick. If you guys are following funnel hacking live, what we want you to do is in the comments, let us know what else you want to see. So I'm going around grabbing assets, we have the team going around and doing that I have images and videos galore. What is it that you want to see so that way we can give you guys the vision that you want now we can't present everything. Like we're actually trying to make sure that this is a little shorter than what we did last night because we went on for like an hour last night. We're trying to make this a little bit shorter because we did do the live earlier today. So if you missed that, catch it and there's a couple of other things that we did, or that just happened at funnel like the night that you should be caught on to. So first off, why don't we start with going through like what happened today. So we all sat in I everyone of us like has something that we really remember. So first off, Russell came on this morning and did the introduction and kind of introduced us back into the linchpin and started talking about all the different things that are involved in linchpin. So we brought us in yesterday was mostly a foundation day it felt like. Like it was getting foundation and mindset and things like that. And then I totally forgot about this stew came on. So yeah, stew came on he was awesome. It was quick. Yeah, but it was really, really awesome. And then this morning, right? Yeah, that was it. It feels like a blur. And it's crazy. Like this is truly fire hose. It is absolutely madness how much there is. But we had Garrett White come on now. Who listen to Garrett like Dan, what was like, what did you pick up from Garrett White? His Garrett White was Garrett White, but it was different. Well, Garrett was really talking about he's been doing this for for many years now and he's been doing all by himself. He's been trying to just be a coach. And he was a one man band more or less. I mean, he had assistance and whatnot. But what he realizes is in order to be able to really be able to teach his people, he had to bring in facilitators. Yeah. So what he can do is he can create the content and then get a facilitator to basically get everybody on the zoom call, play a video, give them the content, make them work through the exercises. Excuse me, I'm losing my voice here. But he can be as he said today, he's here speaking while his facilitators are taking care of his people. So it's definitely a way to extend your ability to be able to bring more and more people into your world. The cool thing that I thought from that was he said, like, we've tried just having a basic program. We've tried having coaches. And now we've done facilitation and facilitation is getting it done far better. People are actually doing the thing far more than any of the previous things they've done in the past, which is almost like a secret power. Yeah, I think when you get people in a live facilitated situation, and you say, okay, here, watch this, and when we're done, we're going to give you an assignment. And you're going to do it right now, you're going to write it out, you're going to figure this out. And then they got it done. Yeah, instead of leaving them on their own, it's done. And they now ever have to do that again. And one of the breakout rooms, especially as that part of that like the ability to like, now you've done it on your own, now we're all going to talk about it in a group, you have 10 minutes. And so there was just a lot of cool stuff. I'm like, in Russell's working all this into things that you guys have seen, if you're in juicy CX, you know what we're talking about. And he's going to talk more about that tomorrow. So I want to ask Andrea, what was your favorite of the day or the standout one of the day that you wanted to talk about? Well, okay, so I loved actually, I did love stews, I have to say, so I'm 30 year career fall. I did love stews just because I do think I love the way he talks about the MasterCath and having him on stones. I know we all talk about that a lot. And I really appreciate the attention on that. And then, and then Steve Larson and Russell came on. Yeah, and it was just fantastic. I, you know, I mean, anybody who's been in this space for, you know, any amount of time knows Steve really well, right? But it was like a new layer of what he was presenting today. It was fantastic. And he was talking about the hook offer. And that actually the offer is the hook. And he took us through this exercise where he was really going into like the hard emotion of it, and then creating the URL based off the emotion. And the like, the hook is the first thing that sells. And we've all heard hook story offer, but I think we hear it so fast, that it's like, I feel like he really slowed down the wings of the butterfly today and was like, let's really hone in on the hook. You know what I mean? Yeah, it was so good. And James, the best at these off on free. So cool. Like, one of the things that I really liked is like he talked about how the advertorial needs to be its own stealth contains story. Like the advert is its own story that's disconnected from the offer. It gets the information it sells the idea that the rest of the presentation is based on the drop, rest of the fall. And I have to say too, just because like, I think a lot of times in marketing, we do this like, it's like, I think we, you know, the way he talked about gaining into the emotion, it felt like it was appropriate and like, let's really dive into the emotional aspect of it. And it wasn't oversensationalized. It was accurate and honest and truthful for the emotion. I thought that was so good. And the way he so something he may or may not have shared, I can't remember Dan, we've heard some similar presentations to this in the past, but not a final I can lie. The way he he's almost pulling it out of people. So like, this came from that this came from them. So often it's like, we have what it takes, we just haven't spoken it out enough and organized it. So it's just getting it out there and then allowing maybe a third party to help us put the pieces together in order to create that. So it's cool. Alright, so really quick, we also had Bridger, Bridger came on. What's it out to you? What was your Yeah. Okay, so Bridger and Mason, they so I thought them I think they were in a circle that we heard them present at first, was it in a circle? Yeah, I was like, it's an inner circle or master all the things. And they so they took what they presented an inner circle that I saw and then they added to it. It was like really, really cool that they added a lot more to it. One of the cool things that I took from theirs though, is that so Bridger and Mason, they have like a what is it fund launch is their business. But they came on stage to talk about how they use dramatic demonstrations like short they call them short form dramatic demonstrations to drive traffic into their well, sorry to sell their offers. And they use like so they'll go and find what the current events are happening in the world. And then they'll just like create content to create their their ads according to whatever is a tournament. So like, for an example, the Olympics were going on. And so they went and they made like, they were they ran their dramatic demo as a, what was it called fun fund, fun games. Because they couldn't Olympics was like trademark thing or something. So they called it fun games, they ran ads. The other piece was that they talked about how they run ads. They go find legendary ads. And then they just like mimic it for their thing. They showed a lot of examples. They had a lot of fun with it. It was like, that's that they just kind of bootstrap together. Like this is not a dime budget. This wasn't complicated. But it's something that created that growth. Now it's just not even a contest that they ran that I thought was very simple is take a guess of what the Dow is going to be on a certain date. Right. Anybody can do that. It costs absolutely nothing. You can make a new entry every single day. And it keeps people coming back and being engaged with you on a regular basis. Yeah. So was that a dramatic demonstration like webinar funnel mixed with a fishbowl funnel? I feel like it was mostly fishbowl, telling the end product that you want people to get. Then they would get on to a webinar. Oh, they did the webinar. And then they would pitch them on the web. So they're a fish and are fish and are fish and are it's literally like Steve Warsh talks about it's the hook that's a little dramatic demonstration against people to the one that you want. So yeah. So then, Neo, the Amaya Davis. Oh my God, she was crazy. He came out running like he literally just came out and just I got the wrong video. He did. That's like Steve. Yeah, that is Steve. Oh, you know what? I wonder if I didn't load it up. So you don't see it. So yeah, yeah, well, I've been thinking, look, so Nehemiah Davis, he's actually speaking twice at this FHL. So today was his first one. He's speaking again tomorrow. Today you want to tell him what you talked about? So today was really funny. I was sitting with the staff and he got everybody up on their feet and believing and loud and excited more than I think almost anybody else has this entire time. Who isn't Russell? Because every time Russell was like, we love Russell, but like it was crazy how he increased the energy, how he used his story in the right spots in order to increase the energy. Just the command of the room was brilliant. It was really, really cool. But then he talks a lot about he did like seven different ways that we can get traffic and he gave them rapid fire and they were simple things that you don't think about like ways that you can use Instagram and things that you can hack and things like that. And it was, it was just really, it was brilliantly put together and organized and it was really quick. And I feel like I almost wonder if people missed the goal. It was really fast, really rapid fire. It was really fast. That's why we replaced eventually, right? Yeah. Just buy the tickets for next year. I was going to say, if you sign up, you'll get them. Exactly. Love how it works. So we got that piece. And so Nia was great, but it was really cool and I'm excited. So there were a couple of ideas that he dropped and one of my favorite ones was like doing an infomercial overnight. So use your Instagram to replay your testimonials and your sales pitches while you're asleep, because we know infomercials work. So just have them play in the evenings as if it was an infomercial and you'll wake up and you have sales. I was like, what? So there's a whole bunch of ideas. They were just magic. So have to watch the replays in order to grab that. It was, it was super, super sick. In short, like we got everybody, we're not going to talk about Dan Kennedy this time because it's still raw. We're still trying to figure out what we really want to talk about on that. So let's talk about what happened this morning. Shall we? Because something happened this morning and this is true. Something happened this morning. Talk about what happened. OK, so I think I want to start with the question of what are you? What? OK, overall general thought of what was given to us. Like, are you feeling, are you feeling on top nine? Are you feeling like, like, where are you at with? OK, that is such a good question. Maybe it was the wrong one for this show. Well, it's OK. Kind of mixed emotions in some ways. Because it's like, holy cow, they gave us a lot of stuff. And holy cow, we got a lot of stuff. Yeah, like, like, I want to go to the question to a room and just like dive into it, you know. I can't wait to get home just so get into it for real. I think it's and I think it's why I just continued to be so committed in the ClickFunnels community, because I think all of us, I think, share the sentiment in that I think when you're developing software and giving it to the masses and have this like massive gold of region million people, that is not an easy thing for any company. Right. And I think that they have just to run in the self with the best talent. I mean, to have Andrew Carver from, you know what I mean? Andrew Culver jumped in and just changed the game. Yes. I mean, and just to like put that much emphasis on the architecture of the platform and making sure because you have to have a really great architecture behind you in order to make the platform just be infinitely scalable to all of the masses. And so I think for Mio's first and foremost, just for Todd and Russell to share the stage with him and put that much emphasis on product and the architecture of the product. I think that's enormously huge for the growth. And we'd back the right horse. Well, Ben and I would say if you want to give a little heads up as to who Andrew is because we just threw his name out there and I don't mention who he was at all. No, I don't think we did. So Andrew, Andrew does so much. So Andrew is so the way that they introduced him is a lot of the stuff that was built in ClickFunnels classic and especially ClickFunnels 2.0 was built. It's on Ruby on Rails is the system. But there was this there was a software created that helps you code better with Ruby on Rails called Railgun. Yeah, I think it's and and or yeah. Don't bullet train. Bullet train. Thank you. They're in the bullet train. Yeah. And so and so they were like, we love bullet train. This is great. And when they all sat down, the way Todd explained it to me is like, we all sat down and it was time for us to actually build this out. We had to describe like who do we want? And he's like, it would be so nice to get the creator of bullet train on board to be able to build this right. And he's had successful exits in the past. He understands how to be a founder. He's built all these different things. And it was so cool to be able to have him come on and be able to like explain why it's important to be able to have himself. Andrew is spectacular. Yeah. And it's really. And in the crew, people that he ended up bringing in with them. It's a whole cadre of people that he's known over the years, worked with over the years and is bringing them in to help along with it as well. Yes. And the cool thing was, so like behind the scenes, like he's able to be like, this is what we need to get talent in this, who follow bullet train and already he knows where the people live that we need. Yeah. And he's able to like, it just. Oh, my gosh, which changes the game because then at that point, we can actually attract people that we need because I don't know how many. We have like 107 developers on the quickmost team out of a team of 374. That's amazing. And to do that with no investor capital. No, that is phenomenally unheard of. Amazing. Yeah. It's incredible. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. It was really, really cool. Yeah. OK, a couple of the features that stood out for me. I am still really excited about communities. And learning hubs. Yeah. Like I love that piece because of the simplicity is going to provide to people. A lot of us want to create our courses. We want to make it so that way it's this huge build out system that looks just like Russell's and a lot of us have no idea the work that goes into something like that. Yeah. And we're like, why can't this just work with one click? I said, you know, this is like Russell builds pristine A level systems. How can we get something just up? Yeah. And that's one thing that Todd talked about with the goal between learning hubs. Yeah. Yeah. That was cool. And I know you're interested. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, so much. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, yeah, like I said, I just I don't want to dive into it all night. It's like if we could get the developers onto one room and have an extension. Yeah, that would be pretty cool. It would be pretty cool. Yeah. So that would be really neat. And it's like learning hubs and what I love is the progress tracking. It all lives like I can have a course now that I don't have to design. I can have communications in there and I can have it inside the community as well. So that way I have a home. Yeah. For my people. And it's one home. Yeah. And you're missing one important piece. So in order to make this amazing, right, you need your content hub, you need your community, check, check, right? Now it's there and you need a nurture path. And the nurture path is with all of the animations, which they also improve. And so it's like the trifecta of what you need to have a great learning experience is all right there. And I mean, I don't know. But the workflows are point. The workflows are great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's it in there. So you're falling on the levels where it flows a little bit. Okay. So this is so funny. Don't get it started. Don't do it. I am. They're definitely great. And just what they announced in terms of the amount of new triggers and new features that can go into an automation and just the vision that they shared for automations and to be able to get super creative with them. I mean, it's huge, right? It's a game changer. It's how you actually make really great customer experiences is to be hyper targeted, hyper segmented and involved. Yeah. Yeah. And all the integrations that go along with that. And the heading on of Zapier, which we were told for sure it is pronounced Zapier like happier. Follows apps. We don't follow. And also the opening. Yeah, yeah. So you can integrate with just about anything. But for me, I will say this, though, the the thing that just kept I kept hearing over and over and over again when they were talking about the membership sites, the what you guys call the training center learning. I'll just make up a new term here. Learning, learning hubs. Other they must have brought this up half a dozen times. Every time they said it caught my ear, which was and you can use them to sell. Yeah. You're selling from within the membership site and it's like multiple ways. So you get somebody in. It's not done at that point. You're just starting at that point. Yeah. And you just keep upgrading them, ascending them, getting them into more of your products. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk about something that that I'm excited about that stood out to me. And it wasn't I guess it's kind of it's probably phase one, though. So they rebuilt the two step checkout. Oh, yeah. And now there's a version that it's what they call smart checkout. It's called the mark checkout. So it's it's the two step checkout that we know and love from classic, but it's so much better. The coolest part, there's there's really cool things about it. But I'll just the name one of them for a sake of time. Because we're all focusing on continuity right now, right? We got to get continuity into our businesses or we don't actually have a business, right? So the ability to the smart checkout is going to be able to allow someone to like quickly like it's going to recognize that they've been there before. They're going to be able to quickly put in like a code that gets sent to their text or their email, and it's going to recognize them. And then it's going to know if they've already purchased the product. So if you're selling like your level one continuity and they already bought that and they land on the page where you're selling that, it's going to recognize that they already have it. And instead of that being the end of the interaction, it can offer them to upgrade to the next level and it will upgrade them. So aside from that, there's going to be like the ability within the system to when someone's going to be able to upgrade and it's going to be a true upgrade, not a start a new subscription. And then we got to go cancel the other subscription, which is what we were doing, which is a manual process for your customer service team. So and the the ability of the recognizing and doing like an auto suggested upgrade is no one else can do that. This is the only software platform. Yeah, the automatic cancellation, the automatic cancellation. It's our cancellation funnel, I think. They can't put it in the auto. It's automatically built in now. So one click and you don't have to worry about it. It's supporting true continuity, right? I mean, yeah, it's amazing. Yeah. And so imagine trying to sell your Mithki offer. Yeah. And you go to click on it and you're like, how many times have somebody bought something multiple times? You know, like, oh, my gosh, this gets rid of that. So you don't have duplication anymore. But then it also you try to sell this one thing and they forget that they bought it because we're all rabid buyers. Yeah. Follow Russell. Come on. Yeah. And it sells them automatically the next upgrade instead. So you're like, there, oh, by the way, did you want this next thing? You have this already. Amazing. Did you want to take it to the next level? Yeah. So I don't know. Are we going to wrap up because I kind of wanted to end something up something. Okay. All right. There was, was it about a week ago that I found out? I think, I think I found out some things ahead of time. And I didn't, I didn't share anything, but I actually went to, was it both of you or maybe just Andrea? And I was just like, I'm so excited because they're literally building a platform that is supporting Lynch pin. Like, which pin is the platform? The platform is Lynch pin and you cannot separate them. And you, if you, like if anyone wanted to follow Russell's frameworks and follow Lynch pin, they couldn't try to go do it somewhere else, but it's going to be incredibly difficult or cost them an incredible amount of money to go hire somebody to build it. And ClickFunnels 2.0 is built to implement the Lynch pin framework. Well said. Yeah. So well said. Yep. Let's see. Do you guys have any other like final thoughts, awesome things you want to share before we, I just, I mean, if you have ever been in doubt of like, you know, which, which company has the absolute best in terms of funnels and is looking up for the client and it's just out and drowsed for support. And just, if you want to get serious about your funnel game, like I, it's just today, I mean, if we do nothing else at Funnel Hiking Live, that to me just like secured it and like check. Yup. Decision made. The one thing I would add, and we're going to go back to the features just for a second here is one that I thought was really huge, especially for people overseas. Direct PayPal integration. Oh yeah. That I think is going to be really huge. There's a lot of markets out there and they were talking about a lot of improvements to payments AI so that if, if, if, if strike for some reason doesn't want to accept a payment from a certain country, it'll flip you to the country that are a bank in the country that will accept it. Right. And that's, that's huge. Again, just from the sales standpoint, because they're talking about an extra 10, 20%, especially with PayPal and, and I don't know, well, I want to say something because I'm not sure this is your venture. I won't say it, but yeah, just PayPal alone is going to help so many people around the world. Yeah. Okay. One more thing. Let me go all the way. One of the biggest complaints that we see all the time in, in our group, in the ClickFunnels group is with payments AI and I, oh, why don't we have to use payments AI? Why can't we just integrate directly to strike? Go watch the stream of the state of the union. It's got, it was streamed into the ClickFunnels official group. Um, and Todd addresses that exact thing. He lays out, here's the cost of payments AI by itself. Here's the cost of payments AI plus strike. Here's the cost of strike by itself and all of the hidden fees and spoiler alert. Stripe costs the most by itself. Like by itself, it costs more than the other two. So if you want to go see those numbers and how they laid it out and any of the other things that we've been talking about that we didn't even, we didn't even talk about. Yeah. Even half of it. Yeah. One percent. Yeah. So go watch it. Um, it's, it's. We're not sleeping. Yeah. Why are you taking the puzzle hacking live? If you're not finding the video easily typed like search state of the union. It should be popping up near the top because it was just today. So make sure you go watch that. So doesn't get lost. You don't forget about it. Like go get updated on all of the things. Um, and, uh, anything else you want to add? No, nothing else I want to add. Literally there's so much coming and it just keeps coming. You want to stay tuned to make sure that you text FH to B to two zero eight two three one three seven nine seven detail. They're below. Uh, and we will keep giving you guys updates in the mornings and or in the afternoons when we go live and if you want to hang out for the late nights, we're here. We'd love to have you guys. Thank you for being on. This is great. Yay. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Thanks for being on the. Thanks for having us. You guys are awesome. Great. Can't wait to hear you speak. We'll give you a recap. Bye everybody. You too. And just tomorrow. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating, it's pulsing. I'm made for something more. We get scared. And then fear hits us. There's a little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven, are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that's made me all of my money. My best selling framework. Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust in influencers. This better blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning to begin. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this one precious life? You would be able to tell but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People feel a sense of belonging here. It feels like home. I'm still encouraging because if they can do it, so can I. They thought, look, saying, hey, next year we're going to get better. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer in the Everland. You find exactly what your business is missing. It's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you your life. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day they're telling people how they met you. Well, I can live change my entire life. Because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be black. Your legacy's going to be black. Movements are about to be burned. My story hopefully gave women permission. If you believe me, stand your ground. You do not have to be great to get started. But you have got to start if you ever want to be great. I'm not going to let you down. I'm not going to let you down.
