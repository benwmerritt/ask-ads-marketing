Hello and welcome back to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm joined by Mark Nolan. Mark is in the sports education industry and he's the longest active kicking and punting football coach in the U.S. Very cool. He also runs the site The Kicker Zone and I can't wait to hear more about his journey today. Thanks for joining me, Mark. Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon. How are you? I'm doing great. How are you today? Awesome. Awesome. Another day above ground, as we say in the Army, is a good day. I'm happy to be alive. Excellent. Well, I'm happy to have you here today. You are the first person I'm speaking with that is in this very specific industry, which is sports education. So I'm excited to learn more about how you got started. So if you could give me just a little bit of a background on how you got started in this business. Sure. Well, you know, I was a kicker and a punter and I became pretty good. I had a bunch of offers and then I went to school. I went to a little school out in South Bend called Notre Dame. And then I quickly got into teaching kids how to be kickers and punters. I had one young man named Joey Castle, who was our friend and my brother, who said, Hey, would you mind helping me out with some kicking? I was like, Yeah, I sure what the heck, right? He was going to college at a place called Weidner University up in Pennsylvania area. So I helped him. And for that money, he didn't give me any money, but I said, Look, I like you who chocolate mix drink and I like American cheese. So my first fee was a six pack of you who and a quarter pound of American cheese with, you know, some slices of white, white mustard on it. So, you know, I think payment and cheese and chocolate as well. It was awesome. It was like, Okay, okay. So I started on my journey of really coaching young kids and then getting involved with parents because the mayor of our small town in New Jersey said, Hey, could you help us with the baseball team? So we were like the bad news bears coaches me and my buddy Kevin Mahoney was another young guy. And then from there, it just went into they wanted me to start a soccer program. I started the soccer program was a pretty good soccer player back in the day. And then I just started training kickers and punters. Even when I went to military in the army, I would go to service bases and I would help kickers and punters kids just helping out. And then I worked at my name just got out there. So I guess about 30 or so years ago, I really took it more seriously because I was in technology. I was a CEO of a technology based consulting company. So you're familiar with SAP and Oracle and JD Edwards and PeopleSoft. And that's what we did. We were implementation partner for the law, those people. But I always loved helping kids out, always love to help them parents out into crazy parents, you know, they're funny. I even wrote about a copy of my book. I have a whole dedicated chapter just about them. And I do a podcast series as well called Don't Not Kick Your Coverage, where I deal with parents as well as athletes. And it's the only podcast dedicated solely for high school athletes and their parents as I go through this journey. So as I kept on getting more and more kids in the college, at one time I had five guys. I think there's about six or seven guys now still playing in the league in the NFL that I've worked with and trained in the past. And a couple, I don't know how many kids I've actually trained, but I looked at this when I started doing my book funnels, I've trained over 4,000 kids and their parents to the tune of over $200 million in scholarship money. And then I was like, okay, I'm going to retire. I'm going to retire from my company, chill out, go play pickleball every day like they're supposed to or golf or whatever else it is that, you know, old farts like me do, right? Walking around my veterans hat on and go to veterans lunches and fall asleep at three o'clock. And it's like, no, no, I'm going to do something else. I got to do something else. And then all the kids I was training, they couldn't get scholarships because and then the NCAA, which I tell athletic association, you know, they, they wouldn't let us get scholarships because they had the transfer portal came in and they had this six year eligibility. And I was like, that's it. I'm going to write a book. I'm going to write my third book and I'm going to just expose and help the parents out who are really desperately seeking a way to find out what is going on with college athletic scholarships. What is this whole transfer portal thing? What's this NIL, which I call now it's legal and then other things. So I was like, you know what, I'm going to write a book. And that's what I did. So I wrote this book and Tony Robbins is an old buddy of mine from like a hundred years ago. I fire walked with him in 1986 in New York. I like two o'clock in the morning. So he sent me like, you know, emails and this and book this and book funnels and like the heck is a book funnel? Right? I was like, you know what? So I got my book published by a guy that Russell knows very well, Rob Cosberg, from a BSP publishing. Right? And I was like, you know what? If he's doing it and Tony Robbins is doing it, I got to find this out. So you know what I did? I dove in, I got on a challenge. I was on Pedro's five day challenge at Russell. I think Russell, I think I bought, I bought the whole package. It was like $7 million. But if I sign up today, it's only, you know, a couple thousand dollars, whatever was I did, I dove right in. I'm like, I'm going to get into this. And I think quickly I was like, wow, this is awesome stuff. But it's too confusing for me. Right? Like I know what I know. And I know what I don't know. And I didn't know this stuff. So I reached out to the community, like everybody says, and there's some awesome people in the community. I mean, just great people, Carol and Brandon Henry and other people that just wanting to help you out. And the more I kept on trying it, the more I kept on saying, look, I've jumped out of planes, I've repelled down helicopters, I've done these kinds of, I can kick footballs all over the place. But you know what? I cannot get this thing down. I'm not going to, I'm not going to do it. So I said, I'm going to reach out to the community. And I went to click funnel, I went to funnel hacker live. And I started reaching out to people down there. And the more people I talked to, the more they did and the more they helped me out. So I found the great young guy that helped me out from the Netherlands. And he's helped me build my first, my first book funnel. And then the webinar side. So it's awesome to be part of the community, the people are fantastic. It's just that, you know, when Russell says, oh, my 10 year old can do a book funnel, I'm like, dude, that's great. But that ain't me. Right? So I hope that answers your question. Very cool. And you mentioned that you were in the military as well. So a lot of getting started in athletics, like, did that come before being in the military? Like, No, that came from all the way high school and beyond, it was always athletics for me growing up. I came from a family of seven kids. Me and my dad, we were going up. He was a World War Two veteran, he would jean McGrath canal is a Marine. So what he would do, he would build trophy cases in our back room for all seven of us, five boys and two girls. And God forbid, Laura, you came home without a trophy after the football banker, the baseball bank, the basketball banquet, you know, you better go buy one out of the sporting goods store with the fake mock-up on it, or steal from the other kids. Right? You don't come home empty handed. So that's how sports became such an integral part of my life. Right? Just growing up around it, you know, three sports. My mother always said, listen, if you're not outside playing, I'm going to put you inside. And when you come inside, I'm going to have you cleaning. Yeah. Cleaning windows, cleaning the floors. I'm like, okay, well, I got two choices. Outside or inside. I think the outside part is better. Yeah. So that's how my journey really, and it's funny because I've actually had like the greatest part-time job ever, which is training kickers and punters and helping kids out. That's, I've always said, that's my greatest part-time job. And I believe that's what God wanted me to do all these years. You know, Laura, and I know Russell's big on God and a lot of the people are click funnels, but really, regardless of your faith, I believe that what God kept on calling me, he kept on calling me to do this. Yeah. And my thing is I kept on saying, God got a busy signal from me because I'm saying, hey, I'm too busy raising my family. I'm too busy taking care of my business. I'm too busy doing this. I'm too busy doing this. And he kept on saying, okay, all right, I'm going to keep on doing things in your life and put people in your life. It may not be now you're going to know about it. It might not be 20 or 30 years down the road until you find out how this thing that God did or he introduced me to has helped me out. And I think that's what this journey was all about, honestly. Yeah. Yeah. So what was it that got you to finally answer that calling and pursue this as a business? I, you know what? I think I've always been a very strong believer of faith. And I've always been a strong believer that God's kept on tugging me to do this. And then I said, you know at the NCAA, everything else. And just a lot of the people who were so shell shocked, the parents who have spent five, 10, 15 years of getting their kids ready for the next level of college, were all sudden saying, Mark, I don't have any scholarships for my kids now because all those kids are supposed to graduate. Now I've got a six year eligibility. So now the coach just told me my son's not going to go on scholarship next year because little Johnny who is supposed to graduate college and go on his life is staying for another year. So that's what I was like, okay, that's my calling. That's really my calling from God that I got to help these parents out because the people at the high schools didn't know what was going on. The guidance counselors didn't know what I'm going, God bless them. The high school coaches didn't know what was going on. So I was like, you know what? I want to take this on because I believe this is what God wants me to do. Very cool. And what was it specifically that led you to using ClickFunnels? I think the Tony Robbins, I think that just the email trails going back and forth and then actually, you know, I'm getting one from this guy Dean Graziano and actually I don't get somebody else and somebody else and someone, what the heck is going on here? Right? And again, it's a God thing. He's going on that entrepreneur rabbit hole. Yeah. Yes. And it's like, okay, God's like, dude, okay, send you Tony Robbins stuff. Okay, here's this guy Dean sending you stuff. There's another guy. And I think, and then, and then meeting with Rob Cosberg, we had a meeting with his whole team down there, a bunch of authors, and he talked about, you know, how ClickFunnels has impacted his life as well. So again, how can I deny that stuff? Right? When I have all these people telling me this is the way as opposed to going to Amazon, slipping my name on there, right? Begging people to give me five star reviews that were my dog's relatives and my cousin to my aunts, my uncles, right? Like, okay, that's great. But to Russell's point, I don't own that customer. And I never not want to own that customer. God bless Amazon. But that's where I saw the light bulb went off with me. I went from the 25, 25 watt to the 100 watt. Like, okay, I got it. Now I own the customer. Now I can do other things inside of ClickFunnels. Now I can do a free plus shipping. Now I can do an opt-in. Now I can do my consulting. Now I can do my one on one consulting. Now I can do this webinar. I'm like, Oh my gosh, I can't do any of that on Amazon. Yeah, while I continue down that road, right? So such a good point. I hope that answers your point. Yeah, that's an excellent answer. In fact, I know that you mentioned having a couple books under your belt already. So a little bit about like what you've seen success with in terms of funnel building, like, do you find you get the most engagement and the most customers from your free plus shipping book funnels? Yeah. And I know my funnel is going to be live on the 30th. So I had to, you know, I think I mentioned it, my launch is going out. I've had some issues on, unfortunately with the domain side of the house and sub domain. So I'm hopefully going to get somebody to help me out with that from ClickFunnels. But that's the only thing that's holding me back. And then I finally just had a, I did this video sales on it. So when it gets done, I'm going to send you my free, I'm going to send it to you. I can't wait to see it. And it's an awesome one. It's awesome because Russell gave me everything to do. He, I'm like a mini Russell, like on my free plus ship. You'll see my video. It's like, yeah. Awesome. Good for you. I think I'm like, okay, I can either take Russell's awesome stuff with everybody else and replicate that or be stupid and do it on my own and keep on struggling. Well, you know, I'm not the brightest guy in the world, but my wife tells me at the 35 years, I finally get what I know and what I don't know. So, and why there's no reason to reinvent the wheel when you can model after seeing success, they give you education and they hand it over to you so that you do it yourself. They want everyone to be successful. So that's right. That's exactly what you need to be doing. And that's a perfect lead into NLP. I mean, that's what we learned from Tony Robbins. You know, Render and Bannler NLP with neuro-neglicic programming, just the modeling side of the house, right? Yeah. So key to what Russell's doing. Not so much the NLP side of the house, just how he just is, he's so brilliant in the things he does that I'm always a guy who goes like, wow, that's just brilliant because I got people, I got parents that tell me, Mark, that drill you did there? That's brilliant. I'm like, okay, I don't think so. But Russell probably doesn't think he's brilliant because he's very humble. And I think I've always loved that because I believe I'm very humble in what I do, helping people. I just, you know, I see guys playing on Saturdays and seeing guys playing on Sundays. I'm not really a big boastful guy about how I help them get there. It just, it's just not me doing it. I don't think that's what God wants me to do. So yeah. And I think it's the most successful people that are willing to offer so much value without things in return. It's just, yeah, okay, wanting people to succeed, giving them everything that you know, because you actually just do want the best for them. And I'm sure that's probably the same way for a lot of coaches as well. And it is, I think, and that's why we generally get into coaching, you know, because we see a need, we saw this, we see a want to help reach out for the kids. Sometimes we want to help kids out who come from a broken home, or they need some mentorship, or they have, you know, what I used to call water cooler parents, you know, they're way over the top. Yeah. So I try to, I try to help those kids understand that. And believe me, there's kids that will tell me stories on the football field when we're training, that I'll walk over to the parents like to want to break and say, do you know that John just said, no, I didn't know that that how, how, how can you tell you that? And like, I don't know how he told me that. He just feels more comfortable telling me than he tells you. Yeah. Which is pretty cool. You know, some people take offense to it, which is weird, but I think it's cool that, you know, a 16, 17 year old kid would rather tell me something that's personal in their life, that I can maybe translate to help the parent go, you know, you might want to dial that back a little bit, you know, that backseat discussion you're having. That's a little too tough for. Yeah, that's a big indicator of trust. It is, it really is. It really is. So what's next for you? I know you mentioned you're launching your book funnel soon. So I'm seeing that I'm sure we can all check it out once you're ready to launch that. But what are your goals? What's next? Boy, I tell you, my goal is to, you know, my goal, honestly, Laura is my wife's retiring next year. Love my life. So I told her I'm going to buy her her lake house. She wants a lake house. And it's funny. She works for a pretty large company. And she's been here 35 years. Lovely lady that grew up in the Philippines came here. She was adopted when she was 12 years old by her aunt and just an amazing lady, just amazing lady. And she started going, start looking on these, you know, in her office, start looking at these pictures of lakesides and lake houses. And one day I saw her looking at this lake houses and I'm like, you know what, this is why I'm going to do this click. This is why I'm going to do this click files. This is why I'm going to spend the money to go down to funnel hocking live. This is why I'm going to find out how to do this stuff or find somebody to help me do it because of her. Because I want my wife to have that because her goal, honestly, Laura is to wake up every morning. She told me and get her coffee, go down to the lake and go fishing for the day. I love that. I can make that happen through click funnels. That is my goal. That's my, that's what I am focusing on. And I literally, in my letter, in my letter at funnel hocking live event that we wrote, I put that in there. I put that in there and we started an accountability group of 11 of us. Start with three of us at funnel hocking all newbies and we in great at eight more people to us. And now we have our own group once a week. We get on, get on what's up and what's up app and we type in what we're doing. Here's my milestones. Here's what I'm doing. Here's what I'm doing because we all said when we sat there, funnel hocking live last year and watch all those people get those awards. We sat there and said, we're going to, we're going to be there next year. Yes, we're going to be there, but it's not even for me to be there. It's for my wife to get that leg house that she wants. I love that. I love that that there's so much purpose behind what you're doing. And it's a selfless reason that you want to see successes because you want to give somebody else the life they deserve. You guys will have the marriage that you deserve, the lifestyle you deserve. It's always so fun to hear about why people are doing this more than just, because they want to reach a certain award or they want to reach a certain income level or get the money that they've been wanting because they were born and raised a certain way. But to hear about just really wanting to have the lifestyle that you want so that you can be happy and your heart will be full and you can feel like you've reached a certain level of success. That's really what we're all trying to do here. And it's so great to see stuff like that in the community as well. So I'm really glad that you're part of this. One more thing. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Can I have one more thing? The reason why I wanted to do the webinar is because I've been doing high school presentations. So I go to high schools and I do high school presentations for free. And I just hawk a couple books like, Hey, you're not blocking us. So I sell my books at these events. I don't even charge them. And the next thing you know, I'm like, wow, why would I not do a webinar around this? Why would I not? Instead of driving over Timbuktu and having my wife sit there with her Stripe account on and, you know, sell 20, 30, 40 books at an event on a nighttime, I can now do this webinar. I'm like, wow, that was another light bulb going off. I remember Russell saying that he was so tired of traveling all over the place, right? His family and stuff like that. And I kiddingly say, you know, I support Havis Southeast Asia because, you know, you're married to an Asian, you pretty much take everybody in your house. So it was, it was that moment like, okay, I can spend more time with my family. I can be home more. I don't have to schlep books back and forth from auditoriums. So the webinar was really wanting to go. And that was so awesome to me to understand the dynamics of click funnels. You can go through so many opportunities, but you got to pick one. As Russell says, you guys start there, but I'm more excited about the other possibilities that I'm working on now. That can help my audience become much more in tune and much more educated on this process. Yeah. And that's working smarter, not harder. Oh, a lot, a lot smarter. Believe me. I got tablets full. I must have like nine tablets full of stuff I came on right down. And I would stop it. Okay, Russell said this. Stop. You mean that back, you know? So I was doing that and like, okay, that's great. I can do that. But let me be smarter by hiring someone as an operator who can fill that out for me. Yeah. So I think that's, that's the, that's the smarter piece for those entrepreneurs out there that want to do it themselves. God bless you. That's awesome. But you know what? As they say, there's a value of time and it's a value of money. And I would rather hire a consultant to help me out with these kinds of things than if me do it myself. I'm just not smart enough to do that. And God, and God has those people in my corner that he's leading me to to do that. Totally. That's what drives me. I love that. That's great. Well, you've had all sorts of great advice and things to talk about, but I would love to know like if you could give a fellow entrepreneur or somebody who's interested in starting this online business in this space, what's a piece of advice that you would give them? Well, you know, that's a great question. So when I train the guys I train, some of them are pretty anal. They're pretty analytical. You know, they're always thinking about things too much. Right. And I keep on telling them, you know, here's what I would tell you to do. The Nike commercial says, just do it. It doesn't say, just think about it for like an hour and a half or three or five years. Right. And I think too many entrepreneurs look at it, they walk away from it. And we got, I mean, there's click files, people I met down the phone, I can live that started a year ago and then let it go by the side, let it go, didn't do this, we look at a video, then stop looking at the video and do something else. So if I can give that one of the bit of advice, I would say, just stop thinking about it and just do it. Invest, invest. If you really, and again, as a guy that believes in a lot, what God tells me to do, why would I go against what he's asking me to do? So the money has not even been an issue for me. It really wasn't. It was, I just have to do this because A, it's going to help increase my awareness for the people I serve. And that tribe I serve is about 82 million people throughout the United States. So that's why I want to try to serve. I want to try to serve those 8 million moms and dads times two is 16 plus the grandmom and grandpops and aunts and uncles. Right. All those people that think when their son or daughter or grandchild is born, you know, the first thing you hear from them is, Hey, look at their size and their feet on him. Oh my God, he's gone. I'm like, dude, he's two months old. I mean, two minutes old. Let him enjoy himself being a baby first. So that's what we had to do. I think you have to have baby steps and you have to have faith in what Russell is doing. No matter how many times Russell can get on there and the 40, 50, 60, 80, 100 people that daily say great things about ClickFunnel, you just got to have faith in that. I mean, that's that's what I would tell you to do. Wake up in the morning, get after it and know that if you by the time you get done at night time, if you can't get it done, go find somebody else to get it done for you. That's great advice because I think a lot of people do get held up on the just taking action part or they get held up on I can take action, but I don't know if I'm the best person to do this. And as you mentioned, sometimes it's who it's not how people to do it. But as long as you're taking action, you're moving forward, you're doing something, you'll get there. Whereas, you know, just thinking about the things that you want to do is it's not going to get you where you want to be. Yes. And you know, Laura, I just got my first I just got my first affiliate person I sold. Oh, cool. I sold and this guy's a perfect candidate. Okay. He's a great pharmacist, brilliant guy. But he's always teaching. He's teaching about compound marketing and teaching this and teaching this. His name is Julius. He's a wonderful guy. I said, dude, Julius, you're, you're, you're too got too many things going on. You need to stop being just the pharmacist and understand that you're online business and we were sitting here and said, you know, those cars going by your building every day. That's not your customer. You have no online presence. Would you rather have five of those people coming in every day or 500 people or 5,000 people coming off site? And he's now he's in a mode of like, Oh my gosh, Mark, it's like drinking from the fire hose. And like, dude, let's just pick one small thing that we can do for you, whether it's a membership, whether it's a MIFKI, whether it's this, and that's where he is right now. So I see myself and others of what they're doing with click funnels where they're going, Oh my gosh, this is so confusing. Like, no, you're making confusing because you're, you're thinking what we're doing online is what you do in retail and brick and mortar and it's not even close to sync. Yeah. Yeah. That's great advice. That's so true. Well, it's been awesome learning more about you and it seems like there's so much that you're doing that it's so much you've got going on with your books, with your webinars, where can people go to learn more about you and what you're doing? Thank you. So my podcast series is called Donut Kicker Coverage and it's basically for all sports, not has nothing to do with just football, but it's all sports and sometimes the podcast are half driven by guest appearances I have on there. I have the Notre Dame football punter from four years ago. That's going to be my podcast next week. Great guy. I've learned since I knew since high school, one of my son's best friends. And then my company is called the kickerzone.com and that's really focused on, you know, all the things we do from a kicker zone standpoint, training kickers and punters and helping them understand the framework series around that. And I'm actually going to be doing another book funnel around that stuff just for a framework I built out for kickers and punters only. So it's a very niche, very niche funnel I'm going to be doing for them next. Awesome. And we'll make sure we include those in the description so that people can check them out. Is there anything else you wanted to share? No, I just, I want to thank you so much for allowing me to use to have this small little opportunity to talk about what Russell and the team have done for me and wish everybody a happy Thanksgiving and a blessed holiday season. And that's about it. All right. Thanks so much, Mark. It was great to have you on here. Thanks for sharing more about your story and what you're doing. Hopefully everybody can go check out your business, learn more about your book and all the things that you're doing online. And we wish you all of the success and we can't wait to see you and your wife in that lake house soon. Thank you again for being a guest today and we'll talk soon. Thank you, Laura. God bless. Thank you. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye.
