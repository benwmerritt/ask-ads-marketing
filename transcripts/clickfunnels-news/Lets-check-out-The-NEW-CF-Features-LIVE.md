Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are so excited to have you guys. Now, about a week ago, Russell and Todd dropped some crazy news into the community. If you missed it, we're gonna go really deep into it and share with you all the cool stuff, because there are so many new features that are available for some of you. We're gonna go into a lot of details and we're gonna go into it. So this might be a longer episode. Stick with us. We'll see you guys on the other side. Let's roll that intro and get started. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. ["Funnel Hacker"] Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. I'm Susan Lennardsen and this is... Ben Moot. And this is an episode I'm really, really excited for, because we get to finally talk about these things and not just like hoard them to ourselves. So we're gonna get way into the features that were announced at Funnel Hacking Live. Before we do that though, we wanna talk over, there's some other things happening. There's actually some cool things that have happened, just you may have missed since Funnel Hacking Live and then also like Russell, what is Russell working on right now and what's going on with that? So we're gonna talk about that. I think maybe where we start now, Ben? Oh, where we start?

Like Funnel Hacking Live is over but there's still so much happening, like even through the rest of the year, it's insane. I can't believe you're breaking. You messaged me a couple, the day or two ago, like when we got back and he's like, Russell's got me doing this now. I'm like, why won't Russell take a break? No, it's been running and rushing and ever so crazy. So guys, love that you're here. Make sure that you are involved in text messages. Let's start with the water cooler, shall we? Really quick, before we jump into everything that's happening in 2.0, there's some cool things that are happening that you should be attuned to. So first off, Russell, just announced, is gonna bring up my screen, Christian, our Russell's podcast. So if you guys have not listened in and you guys missed Funnel Hacking Live, this is an episode from Funnel Hacking Live last year. Okay, so every year he does one that's public right away so you can watch this episode or listen to this episode and that'll do that. This is almost part two of that. This is what he was live with this year. And so if you guys wanna follow along, the next podcast is coming out tomorrow and it's going to hint a little bit more about how do you prepare for these presentations, what's coming up next in the next couple of weeks. There's some really cool stuff so definitely go over to the podcast. These are worth listening. I'm excited to listen again. If you guys got the replays, we're working on replays. Replays are not out yet. We're trying to get those out in the next 30 days and get it all organized. Russell is actually like, I have a strategy around this. You have a what? So there's just fun stuff going on. So we'll be seeing how it goes. Also, if you guys did not know, Stu McLaren took his check home for $117,000 through the airport and through customs. And so this is him getting it through and trying to get it through the airport and all that stuff. So just some fun stuff, everybody guys. If you are not involved in everything that's going on, check out social, make sure you're following all that good stuff. Also, have you guys heard of the stuff about Secrets of Success? I don't know. I'm just gonna tease it right now. If you guys have been listening, no matter where you're getting your news from, listen into what's going on with Secrets of Success. I don't know if I'm allowed to drop a link. So I'm just gonna tell you, if you've heard it from somebody, go listen to said person and go check out what they're saying because there are some cool stuff happening and you wanna be in on this. This is gonna be the coolest launch ever, Russell. At Funnel Hiking Live, if you've shared that presentation. Yeah, you did. And it was like, this is how I'm gonna grow Secrets of Success from zero to 200 million a year. And it all starts in the next couple of weeks. So wherever you're hearing about Secrets of Success, go listen a little harder because you wanna be in on this. You wanna be on the ground level. It's gonna be really cool. That's perfectly said. We can't drop the link, but you wanna go be being a dungeon. Yeah. Amazing. Okay. All right. Are we ready? I think we're ready. I think it's time to go to 2.0. Okay, so let's start with this video really quick. So Russell and Todd made a little video montage, the fun thing of everything that they released. If you guys missed it, let's go ahead and run this little video really quick. It's the one named Ben Moot. Ha ha ha. This guy stays showing phase number two, click on it's 2.0, which was amazing. We released some huge features. I'm passed over to Todd. A little more about what's happened during the live announcement of all the features that base to click on was 2.0. Awesome. Thanks Russell. So we announced so many things. I'm gonna have trouble even keeping up with them all. We had developer API updates. We have web hooks and Zapier rolling out for any of you guys that are looking for more flexibility. We have all kinds of new workflow updates. We have community rolled out, including a new thing we're calling learning hubs, which you're gonna be so pumped to see. Message hubs, which include SMS and text and chat and all the possible things that you wanna do to message and communicate with your customers. The scheduling and appointment side of the app is insane. You're able to integrate everything with your workflows, with all the other funnels you're building, all the opt-in processes, all the order processes, everything that you could want. And we also rolled out updates for courses, including courses version two. So you have to go check it out today. There's more things than I can even think of right now. We just went over by about three times what we were supposed to in the presentation. So go check it out. This is so true. That thing went on forever. It did. In a good way. It was great. Like there were explosions in the audience for certain of these. So we figured what we do is we just kind of go over this and share with you guys like in our accounts because we've been building and like creating some of this stuff, figure, show you what it is and how it works. And so first of all, if you guys have questions, let us know in the comments. So if you guys have questions about a specific feature, let us know in the comments. Should I start Susan? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so one of the first things that I noticed actually before even FHL, cause I was starting to see some stuff pop up into my account, I logged in one day and I was like, whoa, what happened? This looks a little bit different. And so Ben can show, there's like a new dashboard when you log in to your account. So talk us through the changes and why, I mean, not why, but what are they? I don't know a little bit of why that's fine. Okay, so yeah. So when you guys log in and click Funnels now, this is available for everybody. So you don't have to have gone to Funnel Hiking Live. You should see this. If you want to see how you're to use all the new features we're going to be talking about today and for the next several months, I'm sure, you need to watch the trainings here. So you'll notice that we have a whole much different trainings around how do you collect leads? How do you sell products? How do you start a challenge? Including how do you do, how do you build out your Funnel Hub? Like how do you build out pages? How do you build out a customer center? What about courses? What about workflows? We built these trainings. So Russell records the training. He recorded a training for you on every single funnel type, which you can see right here. I'm gonna click right here. You're gonna be able to see every single funnel type that's available. And so if you just want to refresh your on, let's say webinar funnels, go ahead and click on webinar funnels and you'll get a video with Russell. And Russell's going to train on webinar funnels for a while. He has a workflow of kind of what it looks like. And then we have all of these brand new templates that we literally built for this launch. So you have access to now, I think it's like five funnels per, five new templates per system. It's sometimes at six, and there's a lot of different funnels here. So Russell's gonna walk through the strategy, show you how it all works, gonna give you the ideas. And then a video from yours truly, we'll walk you through a lot of funnels here. And then we'll walk you through how to actually install it step by step. Like this is noteworthy. Everyone's like, I don't know how to use this. Like what do I do step by step? How does this work? This is the step by step. It is built for you. And so we show you exactly what it's gonna look like, how you're gonna use it. How do you actually build out your funnel? Everything is step by step. So you can learn it by funnel. You can go up here to the funnel hub. If you're like, I'm not trying to do that. We're gonna be talking a lot about courses today. And so if you wanna understand how to build out the course, what it actually looks like, we've got the full training over here as well. As Siri Elvick over here. And listen to the full training from Russell. Russell talks about how it's built, why it's built this way. And then you get a walkthrough of this is the process. This is how you build it step by step. So that way you can see how you build your course with the new system, as well as customizing it with the old. So that way you get it looking the way you want. If you're like, why can't it just work the way I want? It's all here. We're giving you all the training. It's all right here in your dashboard. And you guys like this is available for everybody right now. This is not a small update. This took a lot of work and it's available. And it's, I think it was like 18 videos. This took several days to record to get it just right for you guys and to organize it all. So you'll see all of your stats up here as normal. You'll see all the different recent funnel activity. This is a new account that I did just to record these videos actually. And so you're gonna be able to see all these different things here. Highly recommend come in, jump in, go through these trainings, get a refresher on these from what Russell has taught recently brand new. Cause it's good. It's really, really good. And if you're trying to figure out one of the new things like what about all the email, like an automation, follow up funnels and workflows? How does that work? Full on training for you right here. How about that new customer center? What about pages? Where are they stored? How do I build one? How do I connect it to a funnel? All of it is in here. So all of the click funnels is too complicated. I can do too much has now been simplified and answered for you. Okay. So now you have a walkthrough step by step of what you should be doing. Is that cool? Is that all right? If we give that to you guys? Cause that does a really big deal. That was a lot of fun too. Yeah. And these are all like all the videos that Ben made that are all like the step by step walkthroughs. They're literally brand new. Like you haven't seen them yet. No, never seen it. Yeah. No. This took, yeah. There were some lots of love that went into those videos and into all of this. Cause like we want you to succeed. We want you to grow. And so this is the step by step. Congratulations. Go into click funnels and play with it. Just see how it works. Coming here, I'd highly recommend learning about courses. We're going to talk about it a little bit today with the new stuff. But as that new stuff is rolled out, this is how you use it. And this is the platform you should be using now in the organization. And you'll be seeing this happen throughout your account as these features keep dripping out. So if that's cool with you guys, let us know in the comments. I see you guys watching. I'm not hearing from you. So if you want us to end the stream now, we can end the stream. We don't have to show anything else. But we'd love to hear from you. If you have any questions, love to hear those too. Awesome. All right. So speaking of customer center. Yeah. Let's talk about customer center here for just a hot second. So here we go. I'm doing a whole bunch of research on the other side. So apologize for all the videos, windows popping up. The customer center is a place where your customers are going to be able to see all the products that you offer and all of them that you don't. We have just created something I think that's available for everybody right now. So if you come over to your sites over here on the left, I'm going to zoom in. There we go. Let's go over to sites here on the right hand, left hand side. And when you get here, you'll be able to see your customer center just right here. So let's click on the customer center. And you can see right now I'm using the default. You see what that looks like? And so let's actually click on preview. This is the default that is now available for you. This is like a done for you dashboard. This is the dashboard simplified. You're able to see the courses that you're enrolled into. You can see the communities you're enrolled into. Wait, communities? Yeah. We have full on community features, posting, commenting, all that stuff, access, private, all that jazz, along with the learning hubs. We're able to have all of your different courses in here as well. And all the courses are organized here. So how do I actually turn this on in order to make this visible? It's very easy. When you come to your customer center, just click on the gear icon here. You guys can see this right now. And all you have to do is flip this onto from customs. This is the custom one you built with the 2.0 editor. Just turn it on to default. And it's going to make life so stupid. You can change your color schemes. You can add your logo, all that stuff. Make it customized to your brand and just click Update so that way it's good to go. But that was a really cool update. I believe that's available for you guys. So go check it out. Let me know if it's there, James. I see the love. Appreciate it. Thank you. Super cool. Yes, sweet, amazing new features. Love that dashboard. Cool. Good, good, good. All right. What else is there? Oh, okay. One other thing. Okay, so you have your Customer Center, which is a great way to organize your courses. What if we want to create a course? Well, now we can just click Create Course. But here in the future, they'll be different process. So check this out. I click on this. I get a step-by-step wizard. Okay, so I can choose which types. This is like a level. I explain all this in the dashboard videos. So like go through the dashboard videos. But let's go ahead and build a basic course next. And you're going to see it's a step-by-step. It's piece by piece. We're going to write. So the name of new course. I can add a description. I can change what the path is going to be for the URL builder. We can come in here. I can choose what theme I want this to be built on. So that way you have a theme specific to your course. I can do that. What thumbnail are they going to see inside of my Customer Center? I can change that here. Just upload it from my account. And you know what? We're going to do this super peaceful image. Going to click on Next. And then it literally creates the course. It starts to build everything. And then if I want to sell my course, I can click on Sell and I can connect it to products. So I'm going to be like, oh yeah, this course is definitely going to be connected to my VIP access. And we're going to give them access just to module 1 and 2. We're going to save module 3 for another purchase. Cool. And it's done. We'll go to the course. So there's a whole simplified course creation. This is the backbone of your courses. It's simplified. You can click on here and edit it. Pops up a little pop-up widget. Everything has been made easier and simplified massively. And if you want to see what this looks like, let's see, headline. I want a video. No, I actually want the actual video. Not the video pop-up. If you want to see what this looks like in the course, I can just come over here and say full context. And it shows me what it looks like inside of my course, which is cool. I like that. But let's just go over here. We'll go ahead and see. I can go ahead and edit the things. I can toss in my video here. Or if you guys are using the course, you can upload your own course videos. You know that, right? ClickFunnels 2.0 will manage your videos and make sure that they are not visible privately to anyone ever. And it unlocks appropriately. All you have to do is go over to courses and upload your course video right here. So say, let's see, where are you? Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. It's over here. I know it's here. Course modular, course lessons. There we go. Here's our video. And then when you do the course video, all you have to do is come over to the media and add in the video. If you want to upload a video, you can. You upload the video to ClickFunnels. And we will secure that video. Make sure that no one can see it unless they're inside the course. It's a total game changer, guys. Really cool. You guys can do that right now with the course videos. But you can just upload videos on the way should you choose. So there's some really cool, fun stuff and it has been made simpler for you and it's, it's cold. It's good stuff. Questions on that? Cool. So cool. Yeah, Jeff's asking about community feature. So maybe we go to that one next. Yeah, maybe we should just jump to it. Let's just do exactly what you guys want. Let's do it. So I'm gonna read me. Yeah, well, I was gonna say, why don't you show this? I can talk through it a little bit. You have a lot more in this account because you've recorded content. And I was, I had a train on it. So yeah, I did. I have a little bit built out and I can share what I've got going on my side too at some point. So, okay, yeah. So the community is in that same site menu and it's so cool. Okay, so what I figured out, cause I'm like Ben's like dove into this stuff so much cause he had to record videos. So I'm new to it. I dove into it yesterday. So what I've discovered is, so your community is like the entire thing. Like think of it as your platform. Like you don't use Facebook, you have a community and you have the ability to have groups. And I don't know if I'm using the right term. So if I, yeah, we have groups on the button. So we have groups. The way that I'm thinking about groups is like rooms in your community or maybe even like one level bigger than that. So like what I'm thinking of is, if I have two, like I have a course that I'm selling and then maybe I have a continuity program that I'm selling and I kind of want those two customers to be in my community but I want that they're gonna be asking me different types of questions and it's possible to be in my course and not in my continuity. So I'm gonna create like a course group and then I can create like a continuity group and have them be in separate but in the same community. Does that make sense? So they're not, you know, when people create like a buyers group for all of their products or at least for a few of their products and you're like, oh, it's hard to keep them kind of separate but give them a place where they can still ask questions. This is like solving that. So I don't know exactly how you have this set up for your spending. Yeah, so you can have like the free one. So I like, I like credit a free getting started group like a free discussion like over silly topics. And I'd said like Star Wars and Marvel and DC and just cause I'm a nerd. And then I did one for like, if you're doing a VIP and you want to have people like you want to give people to a special community just for VIP, we can do that. If you have a course, you want to give it just for that course you can do it and each of those have their own what are we calling them? They have their own topics. So each group you have multiple topics. So this first one I just said start here. Sorry, my cat's really loud if you're here. And then so underneath the free discussion I've got my general, I've got some new ideas, key beliefs you can add these new topics and these are the rooms. So this is, so your group is like a group of rooms and then your topics are individual rooms where you can see what's been happening most recently inside of there. Very cool. All right, let's, I'm going to actually switch over to mine and I'll show you a little bit of like the actual backend of creating that. Let me find the right tab. Awesome. Okay. So Ben was kind of showing you here's kind of what it looks like, you know, this is my version. Here's kind of what that looks like when you're in there I've got some stuff, but to actually like this happen it's super easy. You can create a new group. And then when you're, here's a bunch of groups like these are kind of all of our levels of all of our continuity is how we're doing it. And then we're doing like it, we're going to test out like an internal team one where we can just communicate to each other. And then this is like our general. So I'm going to click into the general one because I started adding some topics in here. So I figured, you know, no matter what level they are no matter where they are in my value ladder and they're in our community we got to be able to communicate to them somewhere. So we put like an announcements topic. So within the announcements topic we'll be able to write posts in here. And then it'll be within the announcements topic. So everyone will kind of be subscribed to that topic. And you can like, so you can pin those to the top so that way they never get lost. And you can also like make it so that topic is a you get to post there only. Like you can choose whether or not you want your people to post there. So there's some really cool stuff there. Yeah. So here's the settings of the topic. Great point. So this is how you know, choose an emoji. That's why I have these cool emojis on the navigation over there. You can do that. Open private and secret. From what I can tell the difference between the private and the secret is, is it going to show as it's locked or is it just not even going to show if it is locked? Yeah. Allow members to create posts, talk quick toggle and then hide posts from main feed, quick toggle. So a lot of good settings in here. And super easy to add your topics. We could add another one in here. And whoop, let's spell that word, right? And really easy to like rearrange the order of things if you need to. So, so far like it's really, really awesome. Now I wanted to show also, I'm going to jump over to a workflow. And you're going to see a couple of things in here. But we're going to focus in on this grant community access. So the workflow has this step. So if you click on the plus and it opens up our menu, there's grant community access and there's also revoke community access. So when someone buys into your program and that's what's giving them access, you're going to put them into that workflow and you're just going to make sure that you have the step that gives them the access. And it's actually so easy because in the settings you can choose, oh my gosh, which one of these are they giving, getting access to? I'm going to give them access to my general and I'm going to give them access to like the thing that they just bought. And then you can even have control over, well, do I want them to have, like to automatically join all of the topics in there or just at least join a couple of them. And then later they can choose to join the others on their own. That's an option. So that's how that happens. And then when they like canceled, super easy to just have the revoke community access in there. And now they have been removed from your community, all automatic, which is amazing because we don't like having to do things manually. No. And like it's got moderation in there and everything guys, like it's a really cool setting. So really quick, Susan on the second to the right tab. Yes. There you go. So there is, if you go back one step, you will see like there's that shield icon and you will see every single thing you can go ahead and moderate all the different pieces there. So you can see all the things that are moderated. You can organize it or you can choose on, choose what you want to moderate. So that's all there. Thank you. Before we run through this, we're getting some questions from Jerry and from Jeff, but they're not seeing these features. Why are they not seeing these features? Why are you not seeing these features? So these features have been, so people who attended a funnel hacking live, they were given the opportunity to get early access to these features. And then you want to share with what they can expect. I see this question a lot this week of like, well, when can we expect it? Yeah, if you guys got the replays for everything, make sure you watch the replays. I believe that gives a lot of details about everything. What we're doing right now is we're making sure that everybody who has access, forgive the cat that's on my lap. There we go. So what we're doing right now is we're making sure that everyone who has access is using it and we're finding any potential bugs there. At this point, everyone's just been loving it. Everyone's just been excited and trying to discover everything. Like it's not bug finding. It's like, how in the world do we use this? Like the world just opened up and this is just two features. Like we have a lot more that we can talk through. So that's all going to be coming out piece by piece. We're creating advanced trainings on each of those different things that way when the feature unlocks, all the training unlocks, all the different pieces. But we wanted to make sure that we gave something specific to our funnel hacker team or funnel hacking live community who came out and just told them, thank you. And when they did, they got a really cool hat as well. And so if you guys jumped in, that's great. You guys have access. If not, we're rolling this out as we get this perfected inside of our world. So we're making sure that everything is good to go before it's out to the broad community. It also helps make sure that when it comes time to support that thing, we have all of our team understanding all the different systems because we've built all the communication around it. So this, if you guys don't have access to all this, speak to someone who went to funnel hacking live. They have it more than likely in their account, go and talk to them because they're going to be able to share more and kind of give you guys ideas and be able to help go reach out to them. Like who is a funnel hacking live? I have questions about community. Who is a funnel hacking live? I have a question about message hub. I have a question about learning hubs. I have a question about the new countdown systems. Like everything let us know because that's let them know. And then we'll be releasing that out here soon. So no timelines yet that we're allowed to let out, but everything's coming. So I hope that answers your guys' questions. Is that good? I love how they're always making it easier and more intuitive for us non-techies. Amen, Tammy. We're here for you. Yeah, it's awesome. All right, should you share my screen back? Because I will go to the next one that's on our list. Yeah. That you guys got to kind of see in here anyway. So this is that same workflow. There is now what are called pipelines and opportunities. Can you zoom in just a little bit? Oh, I can. Maybe, come on. My controls, my controls zoom wasn't working. There we go. There we go. Okay, so we have create opportunity. Now, let the world as an opportunity and how does that fit in anything that we do? So there is pipelines. So in the sales area, when you have access to this feature, you will have opportunities and pipelines showing up here in sales. And I'm actually gonna zoom out a bit now that we're on this screen so we can get a bigger view. So pipelines, this is not how it's going to look, the default, it will give you four, these are called stages and it will give you four already built in in the default one. So it gives you a place to start. I've already come in here and I've edited it. I'm like, okay, we want this, this, this, this is how we're building our pipelines. I've got these pipelines built in and we're ready to roll. So the cool thing about pipelines is that it's gonna help you keep track of where people are in your like business, in your ecosystem, of your business, right? It's like, when you have a lead, you wanna make sure that they don't drop through the cracks, right? And you want to move them down, it's like a funnel, right? You wanna move them through this pipeline so that they have ultimately get to the end. And I'm gonna, because I'm zoomed in so much, I gotta scroll down here to scroll over a little bit. Holy. And so, when you get a lead, the idea is obviously to get them to, if you're working through proposals, like we do in our agency, the end goal for this pipeline is get them to accept the proposal, right? So it's all of the steps. I wonder if I can, oh, there we go. I'm gonna hit shift and then I can zoom back and forth. So moving them through like call, but call completed, ready for proposal, proposal set, proposal accepted. Oh, it's stalled. Oh, they're not a good fit, right? It's gonna help us keep track of all of these different stages that a person could be in when they're coming into our world. But that's not the only way you can use pipelines. It's just drag and drop, right? So like I can drag and drop that opportunity. Yeah, so I have, you can click here. I'll click on this. I'm not gonna add one because if I click on this, it's gonna show stuff I shouldn't show from our clients, but you can just, you name it. So you can see my name back here. I'll go back to it in a second. You're gonna name it. It's like creating a little card. So if you're familiar with Trello and they have like the cards and then you move them through your lists, it's like that. And then you choose which pipeline stage am I adding them to? What's the value of this contact, of this opportunity at the moment? If I can get them all the way to that proposal accepted stage, what's that value to me? Like monetarily. And then what that looks like over here is this. So I named it my name. I was able to select the contact to attach to this. So when I click on here, it pulls up their profile. You can have all of your information about that person over there. You can make notes over there. And then you can drag and drop them through the stages of the pipeline. So awesome. But not only that, there's more, but wait, there's more. This is like the coolest feature. I've been loving pipelines the most out of all of them so far. There's these awesome blue bubbles that have these lightning bolts on them. And you can set up automations. So for lead, you can have an automation. The choices are for the triggers, either when the contact is entering the stage or leaving the stage. What do you wanna have happen? Oh my gosh, there's so many options to choose from. I want the, I wanna send a message for message hub. I wanna trigger a workflow. Like if you can't do it from this list, you're gonna be able to do it from the workflow. So you can pretty much do everything that you wanna do from this. And then you can set up all these automations and turn them on. And then things are happening without you and having to touch it. So I'm gonna jump back over here to the workflow because there was the create opportunity step. So when I have, yeah. So when someone purchases this product that puts them into this workflow for us, I wanna keep track of that. So I have a different pipeline that is literally our value ladder of our continuity programs. There we go. So it's like, you could be a free member. You could be our level one. And we think continuity, linchpin, we got level one, level two. We don't have a level three yet, but we have level one and level two. So are they a level one trial? Are they level one paying? Are they level two trial? Are they level two paying? And then we've got like paused and canceled down over here. So when somebody comes into this workflow, it's automatically putting them into this stage of this pipeline. And then when they, let me scroll down a little bit, we have like a 30 day trial. So I have some stuff in here that lets us know if they haven't canceled yet, we're actually gonna move them to this stage that they're now paying, like they converted. We got them to successfully go from trial till they've paid us money now. And then if they have canceled, it moves them down to this one. So that's another way you could be using pipelines. And then the other way, I'll just quickly show and then we can move on. We actually are gonna use pipelines. This will be more of a manual process at the moment, but like within our level one program, here's all of like the milestones in our program. And we're gonna have them, we're gonna, they have to come in post when they've accomplished a task. That's how we know that they've completed it and they're ready to move on. So we're gonna have like a VA come in here and manually move them through as we say that they posted about it. That means like, yeah. You can have a course that literally unlocks beef by piece when they do something. Mm, that's true. So like you can actually have that dynamically work now. Yeah. So cool. What? That's just like scratching the surface of like the plans that we have for this thing. But it's so powerful you guys. And because we can make it a lot of it, most of it just automated for us, it's gonna be so easy to keep track of where is everybody at in our world, in our value ladder, in our program, in our like lead to conversion process. Really, really awesome. Like I think I wanted to spend a lot of time on this one because I don't think when people come in here, they're going to overlook it. And I think that that would be a mistake. Don't overlook pipelines. Don't overlook it. And it's the automations. I didn't know that that was how that was set up. I was like, ooh, blue light, anyone. Holy cow. And I love the use case. Like right now we're discovering all the different ways that the funnel hacking live community is going to be using this. Like all the use cases are things that we are compiling. So that way we can teach to these. Like these are the best practices. This is the way that is so cool. Okay. So just, and just as a note, this is available for everyone who went to funnel hacking live and upgraded and said, yes, I want. So this small group right now, if you guys don't have access to it, go reach out to them. See what, you know, see how they've built it out. If you know someone who's in funnel billers certification, who's gotten certified, was that funnel hacking live, go talk to them especially because they'll be able to help like, it's their job to like go crazy on this with us. So, okay. I'm going to jump. There's still so much more. There's so much more. I wonder, okay. I was going to say, should we keep going or do we need a part two? What do you guys think in the comments? Should we keep going? Should we keep going? Yeah, let us know. Should we keep going or are we good? We got it queued up and ready. What is the AI feature that was only available to purchase a funnel like in live, going to be made available to the rest of us? What all these other things are? So I believe like it's the same part of that rollout. Do not quote me on that. That is 100% something that the team is organizing. So there's been no official statement on that feature. So good question. Andy says we have to keep going. Yep, I see a lot of keep going. So here we go. Tammy, Jerry, okay. These are, by the way, these were all made available. It's not like, oh, we just made sales pipelines available. Oh, we just made stores and physical products available. It's all available. On that note, I'm going to jump over to stores and physical products really quick because that will blow everybody's brain. And then I want to go back over. I want to talk about like what you can do, like, because you're doing something else really quick that's kind of close to pipelines, which will let you all kill several different products that you don't need anymore. All right, so let's go over here and let's go over to, have you guys ever created a product in 2.0? And you're like, oh, let's create a product and physical wasn't showing here. And you're like, I can't create a physical product. 2.0 doesn't work. Anybody ever been in that world? Like, you do know that we sell physical products under the digital product banner, right? We sell eBooks, we sell software, we sell, we ship out a whole bunch of products doing this. We just zapped it over with a webhook. We just used the webhooks that are available for everybody and did that and moved it on over. Well, now physical products are available. And what does that mean? That means if you want us to be tracking your inventory, if you want us to be tracking fulfillment, like you wanna print off your printing labels from inside of ClickFunnels. If you want to be able to see your estimated shipping rates and have the customer see it automatically based on its weight, its location and where the customer is buying from, if you want all of that to show all by itself, be able to manage that inside of ClickFunnels, that is a physical product and that's now available. So let's just make this super awesome. And you know what, I'm gonna call this Superman. I don't know if I'm allowed to say that, Superman action figure, okay? We're gonna do Superman action figure. I'm gonna create this product. All right, this is a one time product. So we're gonna say that this is gonna be a really fancy product here. It's gonna be $249 because this is gonna be a real high quality Superman toy. Now, I haven't set up payments yet. All right, so it's good. This is the test account. I can make, I can say, you know what? I want this visible in my online store. I want it available in the customer center. We just talked about that. I can add the images of the product right here. Well, you know what? Check this out. Oh, Todd showed me this. I just got died. Marketing AI, I'm gonna say Superman action figure. And the AI will literally go and create the image for me. Right there. Oh my gosh, there it is. That is what I'm gonna sell. Make sure that what you're selling is actually gonna be what your images have. Yeah, yes. Don't just do that. Like, and let me like, yeah, I'll make this at some point, but oh my gosh. Okay, coming down here, I can set up my SKU so that we like, this is Superman one, two, three. Fulfillment required, yes. We want to track the quantity. Where is the, let's see. Default location right now I have, let's say 50 of these on hand. Okay, so I have 50 of those on hand right now. Is this the physical product? Yes, it's probably gonna weigh about five pounds. That's probably way too much. Country of manufacturing, I'm gonna say it's a United States based product, which means it's expensive, but it's high quality. We'll come down here. I can choose whether or not when they purchase this action figure, if they get digital courses, physical, community, if they get access to a community, which is like we are all Superman lovers, like I just want you to know that we love you. If there are variants on this Superman, like you want the man of steel version versus you want the cart tent version, if you want the, I can create all those variations. And then it will update all of this dynamically. So you can create physical products now that track all of that jazz, like this is done, so this is amazing. But now inside of my site, check this out, I have a store. I have a store. And so I can come in here, I can create my store's name, get it all created and organize it. And if I want to actually like build out the store really quick, guess where I go? Same place I go to do the rest of my funnel hub. I go into the full onsite and you'll see the storefront right here. And inside the storefront, I can change what my storefront is gonna look like. It's the 2.0 website builder, which means build this any way you want, make it look any way you want to. You can show collections of your products. Like I want all of my DC stuff here. I want all of my Marvel stuff here, appropriately licensed by the way, I'm not stealing from anybody. All right, so I can put all of my nerd stuff right there. I can come in here and say, when they go to actually purchase, what does my product page look like? And have every time that someone goes to purchase, have that product page update so it looks exactly the same way, but it pulls in all these details from the product's description. And you see this, it's a new two step order form. It's a new two step order form. It's been doing one step, two step, three step, not four step. And there's some really cool stuff that it will let you do on top of all of this. It's so good. So let's do a two step. All right, there is so much inside of stores and collections and confirmations. We don't have a checkout element, they check out page yet. Right now these are buy now funnels. Like you go to buy the product and it takes you over to this page, they come in, they buy the product, they can add a bump in here if you choose to add a bump. And then it goes to a funnel. So which means I can state when they buy from my store, what upsell should they go to? And in my store settings, I wonder if there's a way to delete the store. Let's go create a store, store of awesomeness. Zoom in a second. Let's go create the store of awesomeness. And I can see a preview of my store. So here's the store, just like we talked about. Oh, there's my Superman action figure. And there's these things called store funnels right here. If I click on the store funnels, I can say, you know what? When somebody purchased their rules. So I want to make sure that they go through upsell path one, which means that they should go to this funnel when they meet the following parameters. And I can state, you know what? They need to do this if they have never purchased this product. If they have been, you know, a follower for me for this long, whatever I want to do, I can make all those rules to make sure they see the right upsell sequence after they purchased. Like it is jaw dropping the awesome, what you can do with stores right now inside of ClickFunnels 2.0, and it's changing the game. And for those of you who have access, you get to play with it and have some fun. All right, so let's see really quick. How many products can be added to the store? You can choose. You can add as many as you want. As many as you want. It's all your choice. Those FHL got early access to this, but it will be coming out soon to everyone. Agreed, Nathan, yes. So it's coming out soon to everybody. No timelines yet. Everyone at FHL is playing with it right now. We're creating a whole bunch of documentation and creating the support systems for you guys because we love you. So there's some really, really, really, really cool, really cool stuff coming on, including my dog. My dog, an update, but she will be here on Funnel Hacker TV. All right, a couple of other things are really quick. I wanted to talk about this. I mentioned Zapier. It's not called Zapier. It's called Zapier. Who here wants access to Zapier? Would that be cool? Call out to Greg. Greg, you are spectacular. If any of you want to be using Zapier, there's a way to use it now. If you want to use it with your ClickTools account, I'm going to show you how to do it. Okay, you guys want to see how to use Zapier right now? It is available for everybody. So come over here, click on your team and click on the team settings. You see how that worked? I click on my workspace. I click down here into the team settings and I click on that. Now, what this is going to do is this is going to pull up a whole bunch of menu items. Let me zoom in. So I see a whole bunch of menu items of things that I can control, adding people to teams, all the stuff that you normally see. But down here on the left hand side is a developer portal, which means if you guys are trying to do API stuff, that is available now. You can start to add your new application and get that working. Or you can use the Zapier integration to what is that? I clicked on that, it opens up and you can be invited to use ClickFunnels on Zapier. This is ClickFunnels 2.0. This has not been available publicly. It is now, this is how you get it, okay? So once again, workspace, team settings. Then when the team settings open, go to your developer portal and click on Zapier integration. That is how you do it. For those of you who are the crazy nerds like me who want to make ClickFunnels like suddenly be the monster of everything. Like you want to be able to have automations where like if somebody does something, they're in a Facebook, like custom audience and all that jazz, you want to do that with Zapier. You want to push them into Google Sheets, all that jazz. You want to push back from Google Sheets or other applications into ClickFunnels and update. You can do it now. This is how you do it. Go over here and unlock the Zapier integration because it's glorious. No date, Eric. No date, my friend at this point. So we just wanted to give you guys an update. If you guys were at Funnel Hiking Live, you guys know. If you were not there, speak to someone who's at Funnel Hiking Live or is a member of the Funnel Village program in order to get more details on that because there's stuff coming out and it's being released piece by piece. All right, I want to make sure I didn't miss any questions really quick. Zapier, yes. Sweet, sweet. Nathan, absolutely. Okay, we're going to keep going. Susan stepped out for a second. So I want to talk about this really quick. You create your courses right now. When you create your courses, you can do a simplified course builder. Did you guys know this? So if you watch the dashboard video, like go to the dashboard, watch all the videos because they is important and they will clarify all of this. This video right here on courses will teach you exactly how to build out the wireframe that we've talked about. It'll show you how to build the simple courses and the complicated courses. The simple ones live inside of your learning hub. You can build out your full courses here and your courses will have like all the different things. I built out one of these. Which one did I build out? I thought I built it here. I thought it was cool like that. Maybe I didn't build it here. Nope, didn't build it here. But you'll have all your lesson content. You can have people can like the content. They can leave comments throughout and they can mark it as complete. And when they do, boom, progress bar updates. Like there's some really cool stuff that's happening inside of learning hubs. Literally inside of your courses, when you guys get access, it's literally the season. So let's go over to sites, let's go over to courses. Inside of whatever course you're building, all you have to do is click on the gear icon for the settings and choose down here how you want it to show. So in the learning hub, do you want it to be visible there? Do you want it to redirect to the course that you built? Or do you want it to be the one that lives inside of learning hubs? Just turn that off. The learning hub one will be what shows. Click update course and wonder of wonder, miracle of miracles, it's that easy. It's just simple course creation done so. Amazing, that's such a great ad. I love it. So good. Can you walk through the other feature that you were gonna walk through that's really cool? Yeah, are we talking? Yeah. Are we talking? There's two more that I was gonna go through. Okay. Let's talk through the whichever one comes to your mind first. I have literally, if we share my screen, I'm literally pulling up the new checkout one. So smart checkout, it's awesome. Okay, so I just opened up a blank page and I'm just throwing stuff in here, but I wanted to add the element so that you can see that when you go to your, let's go order there, you may have ones that say legacy now, don't use those ones. Use the new checkout. If you don't have ones that say legacy in your account, does this roll that to everybody yet? No, I don't think so. No, okay. If you don't have one that say legacy, it means you don't have it yet, but it's gonna be a new checkout. So if you're seeing two checkouts, then you know you have it. If you don't see two checkouts with legacy, then you don't have it yet. Go check your account. Okay, so this one is like the coolest. If you had problems with the checkout before, this is going to be so much better. I highly recommend go, as soon as you get access to this feature, go switch all of your checkouts of all of your order pages over to this one. It's everything is happens on this one. So if you're like, I want two steps. I want two steps, like it used to be in classic, loved it, then you're good, cause it does two steps. You want three steps. You're like, I want them to be able to choose which product they want first before I ask them for any information. Awesome, that's what three step does. And then if you're like, I don't want any, I just want everything showing all in place. I don't need them to go through steps. Awesome, there's one step. So everything is handled in the settings of this one element for that. Not only that, but you have so much customization that you can do in this element. So much. And I think, hang on, let me quickly look. Yeah, so I was like, I think there's actually now templates. So if you're like, I just need to get up and started. And this one kind of matches my brand. So you can start there and then you can come over and you can still customize everything. There's all kinds of colors. There's, if you need to view your step two while you're editing it, you just switch off your preview over to step two and edit that stuff, everything. I think we could spend a lot of time on this. But there's other reasons why this is called smart checkout. And if I miss something, Ben, please tell me. Because this is like, I just heard about this last week. So not only does it handle all the different variations of how you would want your form to show, but it also is your, so if someone's in your funnel and they're ordering something for the first time, this is the element that you use. If you're putting them, if you're taking them to an upsell page and you're like, well, I've already collected their information. I just need to upsell them this next thing, like a one-click upsell, right? Same element because it's smart. It knows if it's already collected their information or if it hasn't collected their information. And it's going to look a little bit different. And I think we're able to preview. Yeah, the previewing right there. So you can see what it's going to look like when it'll just say what the product is. So like, let's pretend this is your OTO upsell page. It's going to have the product listed and then they've already collected the information in the first step. So it is a one-click upsell. If you're like, I don't like the design here. This is 100% design up. Like you choose what you want. The team worked like crazy over time to make sure that this looked the way that you wanted. And it has all the customizations, all the promises that you've ever wanted. Like this is the best element ever. We don't like the border. We can turn that, we can take that border away. Get more seamless under there, right? There's so much you can do. Yeah. There's other ways that it's smart too though. Let's say, oh, this is the upgrade downgrade. So here's the OTO. Because they have the ability to still, have you ever been in this situation? Maybe I definitely have. Where you're getting into someone's funnel and you're buying their first product. And so you pull out your card, you're like, okay, I'm gonna buy it with this card. And then you get to their upsell. And you're like, oh my gosh, I have that upsell. But I kinda need to like put that one on credit card, not use the first card that I used for the first product. Well, it gives the people ability to switch that if they need to. So means higher conversions for you. So that's kind of the benefit of having it this way of like, yeah, you can have one button on your page, but what if they need to switch some contacts, some billing information, you'd rather them be able to do that than lose the sale. I've done that so many times. Okay. Well, like the upgrade downgrade, is that where you're going? Yeah, upgrade downgrade. Do you wanna talk about this one? Yeah, okay. So Russell's been talking about a Mithki funnel. So let's say somebody bought, let's use ClickFunnels as an example. How many times have you purchased ClickFunnels more than once? Like you have multiple accounts and it's almost on accident. This is an issue and we're like, let's fix this. And so we made this know whether or not you already have an account. And if you do, it just says you have an account already. Did you just wanna upgrade? Imagine what that would do to your business, okay? So let's say you're spending all this time trying to get somebody to buy XYZ product. And you're like, you know what? They get to it and they're like, okay, fine, I'll buy it. Not remembering that they bought it in the past. You're like, awesome, you have this. Did you wanna upgrade? Here's the next piece. You're like, really? You just stop, okay, what is this? And it's a very simple yes, organizes all the information and you make all those rules now inside of the product. Can I share my screen to show that real quick? All right, so if we go over here, so let's go to the product details. Oh, I'm in my products. Let's see. No, I wasn't. Superman action figure, we're gonna leave that be for now. Let's go over to, yeah, okay, we'll do the Superman action figure. That image is so cool. Thank you, marketing.ai, you are amazing. So let's create a couple of variants here. Because you're gonna be able to upgrade and downgrade within variants. And so we'll just add a couple of variants here. And so I want people to be able to upgrade, I don't know the material. Let's say first it's plastic. And then the next one is acrylic. And the last one is steel. Man of steel, yes. Okay, I can't help myself sometimes. All right, so we go ahead and create those. And then inside of your variations, let's click on plastic. I come into my variation settings. Let's go ahead and make this a little bit bigger. There we go. There is my plastic dude. I can come down here and I can choose what my upgrade, downgrade will be. So I can organize all of that right here. And it makes life just crazy easy. So I can do all my inventory tracking here. Kind of should I continue selling when I run out of stock? Is that okay? Oh my gosh, it's so cool. There's so many things you guys can do here. That it just, it changes the game. All right, so you upgrade and downgrade inside of there. All the settings are there and it's just really, really, really, really, really easy. So awesome. You switch back over to my screen real quick. I fixed. So first of all, I switched the page that I was on and then I actually added a product so that we're not getting all those like render yellow boxes. We can see what it actually looks like. That gives you when you haven't actually added a product yet. So this is what it looks like if someone's already put their information in and it just pulls up a product. It gives you the option of like, are you running to upgrade? If they're gonna upgrade or downgrade, I'm assuming that's where it's gonna give them the option. And then if we've got the, here's upgrade, downgrade, it's a smaller box, one click, and then the OTO here. It's just kind of swapping. And it knows if your customer's returning. So if they're, like if they're repeating purchaser, maybe they don't wanna put in all their details again. It just asks them to log in. It's just, we sent you an email, coach, just verify that. They verify it and bada bing, bada boom, like it's automatically updated. All their billing stuff is installed. They can change it if they want, but no, it's only. This is a smart order form and it is smart for a reason because your customer's about to be taken care of and massively over delivered on because the system you're using over delivers. So cool. So cool. So much. All right. Can we talk about? What is your cover? Oh, it's gone, go ahead. Okay, gosh, I covered so much. There's a product stores, Zapier. I covered, let's see, the membership wizard. Let's talk about appointments. Shall we? Does anybody wish that they can get rid of their calendar system? Because once you get access to these feature sets, now you can. Amazing, okay. So this is gonna be showing up in your account in the sales area, same place where we were talking about pipelines, but now we have appointments. Awesome. Okay, so I actually jumped in here. I started making stuff. I've already got my calendar connected. It's so easy. I'm gonna open up calendar connection so you can get a shot at, hang on, hang on, hang on. There's the ones that you can connect to right now. And let me jump back out of here. And okay, so I've set up one for discovery calls because that's like the immediate need we needed. And it gives you, if you're familiar with like, the other ones, you already know how to use this. So if you're like making a switch over to this, you already know how to use it. Honestly, I think it's simpler to use than other ones that I've used. So I'm really excited about that. But you can create a scheduled event, an event type, but then you also have the ability to come in here and like manually schedule stuff into your calendar, which is actually pretty awesome. So if I click on this plus, I can come in here and schedule meetings, right? Like I don't have to like jump through hoops or like go through other things like the Zoom or whatever to like go schedule stuff and then get it sent to people like, I can just come in here and schedule things. And let's see what else there is there. This one's like so basic and simple, exactly what an appointment schedule should be. The power comes in the types of appointments you can create. So you can do one-on-one, you can do collective, meaning like you've got, let's say you've got two people on your team and anyone who books with you needs to be able to meet with both of those people. So it's got to like coordinate two different schedules together and find the availability between the two calendars. That's collective. So it finds the space for multiple people to join in on that. And then round robin is one of my favorites. It is like, let's say again, you have two people that people can schedule with, but they don't have to both be on the team. They can schedule with one or the other and you can either let them choose who they're scheduling with or you can switch the settings so that it's just the system's choosing for them. They're just gonna book in to whoever's schedule, but it's all through one link. So you don't have to send out like, well, if you wanna book with this person, use this link. If you wanna book with this person, use this link. It's all one link. And then it will integrate right now. I don't know, can you talk more, Ben, about because most of the time when in today's world, when we are scheduling stuff with people, it's to get on like a virtual meeting with them. Do you have more information about that side of things? Like, I don't understand. I'm putting you on the spot. So right now what I've noticed is that you can, it's like connecting so that people can schedule a Google Meet appointment. So I'm assuming that we are going to get more availability. Like, most people. So I'm just gonna go off first, like that you can meet with and meet under. More things to integrate into it. Yeah, I know that that should be a thing. Yeah, that should be a thing I'd imagine. Yeah, of course. I would expect so, but just kind of know that at the moment. Yeah, that should be a thing for sure. And I think I kind of overlooked event types because I think, am I wrong in that you can use this to schedule like full on, maybe it's the scheduled events. I'm saying them backwards. Yeah, you're good. I just had a developer reach out to me and tell me that Zoom and other conference options are coming soon. Yes, awesome. They don't have to be like the first thing people are gonna go look at when they jump into this. Which means it's in development, which means coming soon. Yes. And then this screen here is gonna show anybody who's booked in. I'm assuming, because I haven't actually had anybody booked yet. I haven't sent my link out to anybody yet. So I'm assuming that's the future there. Yeah, you'll see all the events over there. You know, I'm just gonna say it. See the things that are actually scheduled. Okay, that's it. This is really basic. It's like simple enough to use it, but also enough like feature rich to give us exactly what we need it to do. So I'm really excited about appointments. And then also I'm gonna come back to, I think there's some automation type stuff. So I'm sure appointments connects into pipelines. When somebody schedules an appointment, you're gonna be able to move them through those stages in your pipeline. So all of that is like seamlessly integrated together too. Yeah, there's gonna be some really good stuff coming there. Really quick, one last thing that we're not gonna have time to cover guys. So really quick, let's summarize everything that we've talked about. Number one, the dashboard's changed. We have new trainings. We have a massive amount of templates that dropped. Go and see Alt and zoom out really quick so that you guys can see it. This is how you'll see it in your account. You can watch trainings on Alt.ly. These are brand new from Russell. So go and check out the trainings from Russell. They are spectacular. Number two, that's available for everybody. Number two, if you guys want to use Zapier, come over to here, click here and go to team settings. And then come down to developer portal and click on the Zapier integration and that will let you be invited to use Zapier at this point. So it's invitation only. That's how you get the invitation. Congratulations. So those two are available for you right now. Other things that are happening. We have the default customer center is available for you guys but we have membership wizards that's coming, pipelines, appointments, physical products, stores and upsell rules, web hooks, API, smart checkout. The community system that lets you have like full on community discussions and courses simplified all in one place. Like this, this becomes so much fun. And it becomes clean and simple and powerful. And it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really cool. But the one last thing that we are absolutely not gonna have time to talk through because there's so much is this thing called message hub. Okay. I want you to imagine. This thing is a little hard. Let's make sure this works. Oh, I have to go and make sure I have a domain setup. Have you have this setup already? I can get in there so we can look at it if you'd like. Yeah, just to look at it. Yep, let me, I have, we've messed with it. We haven't been able, we haven't had the time to dive into all the features yet. So we, yeah, here we go. It's loading up right now. So we've been putting stuff in here and playing with it. And yeah, let's go ahead talk. So yeah, so if you can zoom in just a little bit so everybody can kind of see. Okay, so message hubs is a place where it'll get yours. So you can, people can email you and you get it here. People can send you a text message and you get it here. People can send you a message on social, on Facebook, to your page, to your, well, different, you know, on messenger, in WhatsApp, in Twitter, in all your social profiles, and it all comes into one spot and is organized simply. You can create page widgets now that have like the chat option in the bottom right hand corner. We're not gonna have time to go over this because this almost needs to be its own dedicated Holy cow moment. That I think we're probably gonna do once it's live for everybody because it changes the rules on everything. Like a lot of us have been waiting for, well, why am I still using so much chat, you know, for Facebook or, you know, why am I doing this in these different systems? Why didn't, why isn't ClickFunnels able to do that? This is the answer. And it's the answer far above and beyond. Like this makes ClickFunnels a full based CRM. It is the bee's knees. And when somebody starts to have a conversation with you, they drop in their email, they drop in their phone number. We recognize that, we connect that to their profile. So you know, you're talking to an existing customer and you can see their profile really quick with a couple of clicks. It's, you can start actually in the workflows, you can click on start a message with somebody. Oh, you know what? I wanna message somebody in Facebook. I wanna message somebody with a text message this time. You know what? Let's talk to them via email. You can have all those conversations in here. You can start those. It's gonna be amazing for high ticket. This is gonna be killer for low ticket. Like any way you wanna paint it, message hubs is like, let's blow your socks off moment. And we're still trying to figure out all of the use cases that are possible, still blowing our socks off. So. I'm gonna bring it back to, I was gonna bring it back to workflows really quick just so you guys can understand the power that we are being handed in workflows. When you get that, I believe it's in here. But the top send message hub message is in here. So if they get to a certain spot in your workflow, you can have a message automatically get sent out and then tying that back into the pipeline and stages. We saw over there, I don't know if I still have that tab open anymore. I don't think so. We saw over there that we have those triggers. So when someone gets to a specific stage, you can have a message get sent out. So you can have the messages getting sent out based on when people are doing certain tasks and actions. Like some of this stuff is stuff that we've been asked, like when I say we, I mean like our team, like our small geek out team, we've been asking for and building custom, like thousands of hours spent on code doing this custom for people. It's being handed to us in 2.0 is so cool. And yeah, the use cases are just, we don't even know all of them yet. So good. There's so much coming your way guys. So at this point, here's the deal. If you guys don't have access, number one, we love you. That's why these things were developed and that's why it continues to grow. If you don't have access, reach out to somebody who went to Funnel Hacking Live. Even better yet, go to the Funnel Builder marketplace at funnelbuilder.com. Go find somebody who's a funnel builder and who has access to these. So that you have somebody who's able to just implement this the minute it becomes available for your account and start running on it because this is going to be game changing. If you guys want to sneak preview, reach out to your friends who are at Funnel Hacking Live. Like there's a reason we talk about Funnel Hacking Live and it's not just because it's hypey. We blow the socks off, we blow the doors off, we blow your mind and all of that happened this year. And so last episode, we talked about everything from Funnel Hacking Live that just killed it for us. We almost want, we were just talking like, we should just do our own private, like take a week off and just take massive notes on it now. I'm like, okay, this is how we're going to change this. And you know what? For Russell's newest launch that's happening that you guys should be paying attention to, we need to pay attention to what Dan Fleischman talked about here. And we should be implementing marketing hubs or message hubs like this, the way they talk about it. And like, this was amazing. This event was spectacular. Next week we're going to go through and do our regular like highlights, call out you guys, so continue to share, continue to grow, just know in the background, we're playing with these. Russell is like, all right, this is how I want the community set up. All right, this is how I want this. There are things that are being built out because of what's been announced. We wanted to make sure you were in the know as much as possible. That's what we do here at Funnel Hacker TV. So if you want to continue to be in the know, text FHTV to 208-231-3797, you'll be like, I just got a text message reminder. They're going live. Pop in with us, we would love to have you guys hang out. We want to keep you in the know so that you're not left alone. We are a community and we learned that far more at Funnel Hacker Live. Thank you guys to those who be who watch and said hello and thank you. We appreciated that a lot. Yeah, I mean, we know there's a lot of you that watch that don't engage in the videos and it was really awesome to hear that you guys are watching and we would say, hey, give us a quick thumbs up for our heart or something. So we know that you're here and that others can also take advantage of these Funnel Hacker TV episodes as well. Yeah, so we're going to go back to our normal format, which is slow, concise, gives you the one, two punch of what you need to know that day and what's coming up next week. But we just wanted to geek out for a little bit. Nope, I said that wrong. I apologize, that's your space. We wanted to, when we funnel hacking nerds and just kind of go into this with you guys on Funnel Hacker TV. So thank you all so much for being with us today. We will see you guys next time. It's going to be Tuesday, same time, same place. Mark your calendars. We'll see you again. My name is Russell Brugman and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started and we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible because it's happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call Funnel Hacking. It's not only something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way. I use the Funnel Hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories.
