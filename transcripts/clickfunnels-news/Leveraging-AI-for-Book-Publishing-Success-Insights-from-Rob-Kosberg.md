## Transcript
I wrote this in in two days and I wrote it with AI. Now it was two full days. It was me working because they're my stories and my examples, right? There is not a better way to gain someone's trust than to have a book, a best-selling book that has your methodology, your process, the way you think about things, your examples. Rob, you're living inside my head for a period of time. I've allowed you inside my head, not just audibly, but literally, I'm visually reading it and I'm, you are reading inside my head. Right people are reading the book thinking, is this person the right person for me? And if they are, then you're in. You have a customer. Welcome to ClickFunnels Radio, the podcast that brings you the latest strategies, insights and success stories from online marketers just like you who utilize funnels to grow their business. Our mission is simple, to help you unleash the true potential of your online business by harnessing the power of funnels. Join us every week as we bring you exclusive interviews and thought-provoking discussions that will revolutionize the way you approach online marketing. Here are your hosts, Chris Cameron and Ben Harris. Welcome everybody back to another episode of ClickFunnels Radio. We've got somebody here that has done incredible work in our industry in the past and is even paving the way forward with some of the tech advancements that we now have in our space to just absolutely project into the next millennium really, but the next wave of productivity and obviously sales too. But without teasing too much, Chris, you can't give it away, but you excited about this? What are you feeling? Yeah, this is so interesting. I've known our guest for a long time and this guy's been so instrumental in helping people get their name out with credibility, with authority. So anyways, let's introduce him. This is going to be fun. Heck yeah. Let's welcome Rob Cosberg to the show if I don't stumble with my own words. Rob, thank you for coming on and how are you today? Thanks, Ben. Chris, good to see you guys. Great man. Happy to be here and love talking to you guys. Obviously, big ClickFunnels fan been a beta user of ClickFunnels since forever. So yeah, man. You're like one of the OGs. Tell us how that happened. How did you and Russell initially connect and how did you start using ClickFunnels for books? Because we know you help authors and you do a lot of publishing stuff. But what's that backstory if you give us the cliff notes? You know, it's actually an interesting story, although I think my video is blowing us out. Let me turn it off and turn it back on if that's okay. There we go. It's an interesting story, at least to me. So I was originally, now I've been buying Russell's stuff since probably microcontinuity and maybe before microcontinuity, though I never really had much of an interest in learning how to use a potato gun. But all the marketing stuff, I certainly loved. And of course, I joined his inner circle in the first time in 2014. So that's 10 years ago that I've been in inner circle except for the period of time that he had shut it down. But when lead pages came out, obviously, pre-ClickFunnels, I saw the ability for us to start creating some landing pages and some funnels. Because we were running BookFunnels for a long, long time, obviously, a significantly less technical version of it than we run right now or than you see like on Facebook and Instagram, etc. But I was using lead pages and was using lead pages in conjunction with a lot of, you know, kind of like everyone was doing, built outside. Yeah, it was totally Frankenstein together. And I joined, as soon as Russell launched ClickFunnels, I became a user of it, but I never used it, right? So for like the first four months from day one, I was a, you know, beta user of ClickFunnels, but you know, it was 97 bucks a month, I never used it. And because I had all these other Frankenstein things together. And my tech guy who has been with me for more than 12 years had like an emergency surgery issue with his tooth. And so he was out. And the day that he was out, I was running a webinar to a high ticket offer, a $12,000 offer. And I went in like an hour, no exaggeration, an hour before my webinar on GoToWebinar, just to check all the pages, I always do that. I'm kind of, you know, anal retentive on that kind of stuff. And doggone it, nothing worked. And nothing worked. We learned later, nothing worked because we migrated from, you know, one server to another. You know, I don't know all the technical stuff that I know nothing about. So I was freaking out because we had like a thousand people register for this. We spent a lot of money on it. So I went, I went to ClickFunnels and in 45 minutes, 30 minutes, I created a little webinar funnel, honestly goodness, and attached our Stripe account to it and attached the auto respond to it. And I am so non-technical. And that day, we did $24,000 on that webinar. And then following over the rest of the week, we did like another $36,000 or so. It was a 12k and a 6k offer. And I told Russell about that. Was this offer then to help people publish books? Oh yeah, it was all book stuff. I mean, that's all we've done for a long time. But yes, it was all book stuff. But I told Russell that and he actually featured that. I don't know. I mean, it's like, I mean, it was like in the first six months of ClickFunnels starting. And I am like the least technical guy. I mean, I can get around, right? But I don't know how to build stuff out. And I was so grateful. We never looked back after that. So we've been, you know, all in on ClickFunnels ever since that day. And, you know, I don't know. We have like 500 funnels built out over the, how many years has it been? Eight, nine, 10 years? A long time. Yeah, 10 years now. It's crazy. And you've got the two comic club X over your shoulder there. What was, what funnel was that? So that's our high ticket funnel. So it's our webinar to call funnel. You know, all of our stuff is high ticket, except for the more recent stuff, which is our software, which there's a whole story about that. But yeah, all of it is high ticket. And so honestly, we're over, there's two of them now. I just haven't, I haven't put in for my second one. So yeah, it's all, it's all been through ClickFunnels in the last 10 years. And listen, this may be, this may be for you really, really basic, but I think for people who are listening and tuning in and trying to understand, you know, we use these key phrases in the jargon, high ticket funnel, you know, webinar book to call, like it makes perfect sense to all of us. Right. Will you just give us like a 30,000 foot overview of like what that process is? Somebody comes to a landing page, the call to action on the webinar and kind of how you close them down. What does that flow look like? Yeah, we have, we have three main funnels that we use. The webinar funnel is actually running one on Thursday. So we run them all the time, but basically it's traffic and warm, coldish, warm traffic that is run to a two hour live event. And we actually pitch high ticket on it. So I let people know that the price points are 8,000 and 15,000. And, and then we tell them the only way to purchase is to book a call, but we will not book a call unless they give us a $1,000 deposit. So it's an unusual funnel. Not many people run a funnel like this, but so we, we book a call to that $1,000 deposit. You tell them that $1,000 is refundable or? It's 100% refundable. Yep. But by that time, they've, they've been with me for hours. They know the price point. They, they know exactly what they're getting. And so usually that $1,000 is just, okay, let's work out a payment plan or, or let me get a few personal questions answered, that kind of thing. And so, you know, about 90% of those people that book a call will close. Some we end up refunding because they don't really have the money, but they're like hoping they give us a thousand bucks and they're hoping that we can pull a rabbit out of the hat, but we can't. What a, what a cool way to pre-qualify though too. You're saving your high ticket sales guys a lot of time of like, okay, tell me and compliance and everything else. Like, you know, tell me what your goals are. Remember, on it got hit on that one and it's just, it's wild. So yeah, $1,000 down, get on the call, and then you're getting 90% close. You just qualify to make sure that they have the money and what they're doing. If someone's given us a deposit, they, they have every intention of, of following through and sometimes that doesn't work out, but most of the time it does because they know everything. They know the price point. They know the full offer. And, you know, obviously it's got to be a great webinar, you know, not, not, not many people run a high ticket offer like that, but I like to do it that way. I don't want to waste our sales team's time. Now, we do also, the second funnel is a book a call funnel, which is, you know, some type of case study or some type of, of a short, you know, video sales letter to book a call and see if we can help you. And that's our least qualified. Those are least qualified calls to be quite honest. But obviously, we've done very well with that. We've been running that forever. And I'm talking 20,000, 30,000 applications over, over the, oh yes. Oh, I mean, easily, easily over that period of time. And then the, you know, the book funnel is probably besides the $1,000 application, you know, anybody that gives us $7.95 or buys one or two of the upsells, those are always the most qualified people we talk to. And so you're doing, are you doing physical books as you send these out or these digital 795 book? We run both funnels. So we run, we run a digital funnel, and we run the actual free plus shipping funnel as well. Perfect. I really like free plus shipping. Yeah, I want to hit on that because you just mentioned whether they are paying their deposit, which I presume would qualify as a credit towards your overall purchase price. Or, you know, the book funnel, both highly qualified buyers, even though one is eight and one's a thousand dollar deposit, right? Would you still say that a $8 book buyer is a qualified buyer? Because I've always believed this too, but I'd love to hear your take on it. There's a couple of reasons. Obviously, somebody that knows the offer and gives us a thousand bucks, it's hard to be more qualified than that, right? Sure. Okay, okay. So that, you know, let's take that off the table for a moment. But as you guys know, because you talk to people every single week and you've been around forever doing this, it's hard to sell anything on the internet. It's hard to sell something for seven bucks. Somebody's got to pull out their credit card and put the digits in and that's the biggest hurdle, right? Is doing that? That's why upsells, order bumps, all this works. Oh, yeah. Like get the credit card out of their wallet. It is so hard. And so when somebody is serious enough to take that commitment, that that's somebody that is, you know, at least you know, at that point, this is not just a freebie seeker, which is a very, very different person. So it's not, that's not a buyer. A buyer is a buyer is a buyer, as Dan Kennedy used to say or still says. Still does. Right. Still says. And so, you know, whether they're buying something for $7.95 or, you know, $17,000, they're still a buyer. Now, the other reason the book funnel is great besides the fact that we're getting a buyer to raise their hand is when someone consumes your book, they've decided, if they're going to get in touch with you, they've decided if they like you or not. And if they're going to get in touch with you, most of the time, they are three quarters of the way to purchasing. They just need to get some details. They need to get some investment, you know, ranges, etc. And they're ready to go. I mean, they're, you know, they've already decided. They know you, they like you, they trust you, they believe your case studies, etc. And they're ready to move forward. So how do you get them to take them to the next step? Okay, so they get free plus shipping. And then is this like an email confirmation that comes up that invites them to do the next part? Like, what's the next part? Is it going to that webinar? Yeah. So there's, there's obviously multiple different things. But what we really want them to do is we want them to consume content. So, you know, just like you said, we have the book, purchase price, then there's a number of upsells, the audio version of the book, there's courses, etc. And then, you know, we do the unadvertised bonus, which is basically a 45 minute training of like our entire process of enhanced ghostwriting and what that looks like. And then there's a book of call link right under that training. If they don't book a call at that point, then the auto responder sends them back, watch the training, watch the training, read the book, read the book. And then, you know, if you're interested in talking with us, then, you know, here's the link, here's the place to book the call, etc. So if they consume, then, then they reach out to us, you know, I mean, they're, you know, they're a long way down the path of buying. Now, this sounds pretty simple, right? But people have to understand the simplicity is generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue, right? Yeah. And you know, what's weird is, I think some people, they, everybody loves the idea of having a book. But they also have this roadblock because it is, I know that it's super hard, right? I've never personally done, but I've watched Russell go through many times. You've gone through it a bunch of times. And you help people do this. And so that's, that's one of the items. But you've got a new book out that really dives more into this whole AI thing. And that's the buzz everywhere. Everybody's talking about AI. But for me, right, you know, if I have a voice, Rob has a voice, Ben has a voice, all of our listeners do, it's might be hard for them to say, to trust AI in their own voice. So give us kind of the synopsis of this book, like, how are you using AI to do this? This is fascinating to me. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. That's a great question. Most of what you see about AI when it comes to software for writing books is wrong. And they and dangerous. Because the ads, the ads, it's not that they overpromise, it's that they overpromise the wrong thing. So the ads will be like, write your book in seconds, literally, those are the ads. Or write your, write your perfect book in 15 minutes. And of course, yes, AI, you can put several prompts in and AI will spit something out for you. But number one, it's not going to be your book because your book has your story, your case studies, your examples. And there's no way for AI to have any of that information without you inputting that information. Right. Yeah, garbage in garbage out though with AI, like 100%. And the second thing is, Amazon hates that. Amazon came out about five or six months ago and they have very strict policies now because what has happened? Well, the market has been flooded with AI-generated content. And so people are trying to earn a quick buck off of Kindle and Amazon with AI-generated content. So Amazon has come out and said that we're classifying AI content in two ways. One is AI-generated, which is just what I described, write your book in seconds, right? Just a few prompts and the book will be spit out, regurgitated garbage. Or AI-assisted content. AI-assisted content is what real authors will use AI for. And that is to get help with the telling of your story, your case studies, your examples, or getting AI to help you with rewrites, to help you where you're stuck, to help you really dial in the demographic of your avatar, et cetera. And so that's- Like a firm-bidged flow sequence. Is that kind of what it's doing? All of that. So the way, so I wrote right with AI, which I don't think even think you guys knew about it before we jumped on the call. I wrote this in two days. And I wrote it with AI. Now, it was two full days. It was me working because they're my stories and my examples, right? But I wrote this because over the past couple of years, we've been developing a software with AI to help writers that can't afford to pay us $50,000 for a big ghostwriting and launch, you know, process. And so we wanted to create something in the marketplace that will really generate books for people that are their books, right, that Amazon loves. And so I was actually in Boise. I was at an inner circle meeting with Russell. I think it was October of last year. So just a few months ago. And I asked Russell, I said, look, you blew up ClickFunnels, you know, using your books. And, you know, I said, I have this software. I really think this is an answer to, you know, a lot of people's problems when it comes to writing. I said, how would you, what would you do if you were in my shoes? And he basically called me out and he said, you know, look, if I were you and the software is so good, then I would write a book in like a month or write a book in like three weeks and show everybody that you've written a book this fast and it's this good with AI. And I was like, oh, man, I mean, I was in front of the whole group, of course, you know, is that it was during the decade and the day thing. And I'm like, man, what am I going to do now? Of course, he's right. But I didn't really want to do that. But I did. And I wrote it. Why didn't you owe your pain points around that? Why didn't you want to do that? Because it sounds like a great idea. It's a lot of work, man. Yeah, for sure. It's a lot of work. And I wasn't going to use them. I wasn't going to be relying on my team, right? It wouldn't be fair to rely on my team if I'm telling people, I so I this is this is totally me. This is this is me and AI. This is not my team. It's not my ghost writers. It's not my editors. It's not my proofreaders. And so I knew I knew I can get it done fast with my team. But but it was it was about putting my money where my mouth was, right? And so so I had some trepidation around you become your own case study like, yeah, okay, well, hey, watch me do it. And then I'll show you how to do it. Exactly. Exactly. Well, I really want to dive into your software. But I have a basic question that I know our audience would would enjoy if we just brush over briefly is, you know, and I've at nauseam begs some of my buddies to do this that are in the insurance field and and just the financial services field. So Nick and David, if you're listening, I'm calling you out. A lot of people when you say you should write a book, they're like, you know, New York Times bestseller, they think of JK Rowling or something like that, where a lot of times writing a book can be such a driver of business for a multitude of reasons, right? Whether it's lead generation, even just, you know, a self liquidating offer you can sell on the internet or being a business card on steroids, right? That's almost the same cost as print, you know, depending on how many you want to print, etc. Can you drive that home for people that are maybe on the fence so they don't understand the power of maybe being a published author? Yeah, there's a lot of power in it. And we didn't talk about this at all. I have to because you've teed this up so beautifully. I mean, I just I just put a podcast out like three days ago with a client, a financial advisor, we do a lot of financial advice books, because it's so easy for them to make money with their book. So easy because their average client is worth so much money for them to use a book to attract clients is like such a no brainer. So I did a book probably two years ago for a client. He was actually selling his financial advisory firm. He was older, early 60s, and, you know, wanted to take some time off and we did this book on tax saving strategies and financial advice. And I was like, Why are you doing this? Like you're you're selling your firm? He goes, Well, he goes, I really want to get this information out there. I really, I really feel like this has been a big, there's been a big gap in the marketplace. And I said, Look, this is a million dollar a year business very easily. And he heard what I said, he took me up on a built a book funnel, and he will do between five and seven million this year from his book funnel. Wow. Good for him. And yeah, and it's all from his book funnel. And I'm talking about simple Facebook and Instagram traffic. His book funnel is not special. In fact, I went through it and just picked it apart. And I was like, Craig, you got to change this, you got to change this. I mean, come on, Craig, but he's making so much money. I mean, it's almost stupid to change anything. People are voting with their wallets. They're pulling their credit card out. Exactly. You know, and I was like, well, I'm sorry that I undershot your performance so much. I told you it'd be about a million dollar a year business, and it's between five and seven. His biggest problem now is he can't bring on advisors fast enough. He's basically his business is bigger now since he retired than it's ever been before. Obviously, he's kind of, you know, re reintegrated. But so there, so that's not a direct answer to your question. That's more indirect. So I'd say there's probably three main direct ways. Number one is especially for like somebody in the trust business and all of us that are selling something that's expensive is we're in the trust business. So if you're in the trust business, meaning you're selling something expensive, then there is not a better way to gain someone's trust than to have a book, a bestselling book that has your methodology, your, your process, the way you think about things, your examples, so that somebody can, you know, thumb through it, find a chapter or two, read about themselves in their, in your case study and then see, okay, this dude really knows what he or she is talking about. So if you're in the trust business, there's nothing better than a book. That's number one. Number two is, is media like free, a free resource to get your name and information out into the world. Media needs content. So they need content creators. And their biggest barrier to having content creators on TV, radio, even big media is can they trust you? Or are you like a sham? Or are you like, you know, a bad guy, I'm going to find out about one day. Well, if you've written a book, you again have checked that, that box for like a program manager of a TV station or radio station or podcast, etc. That this girl, this guy knows what he or she is talking about. And then the last is direct. It's what I started with. It's, it's using the book in conjunction with a funnel, which is just a no brainer. So long winded answer there. Sorry. No, that's exactly, that's exactly what we needed. Yeah. And I don't know after hearing that if anyone has any reservations against it, I'm sure, you know, your minds have changed. And maybe a lot of people would say, they haven't read it because it's hard or they don't know what to write about, right? Even maybe I'd be in that camp. I've always thought about, yeah, like, I'll for sure write it when I know. And I've never, you know, what would you say to, maybe I just asked this question selfishly, but I think other people would have it as well. Some of you who don't know what to write about it, where would they start? Yeah. Well, the number one place that we always start is tell me about your best customer that you want more of. Tell me about who they are, their demographics, their psychographics, tell me about how you serve them, tell me about their pain points. It's in some ways, it's marketing 201, 301, right? Now, if someone tells me, well, I hate that business, and I don't want to be in that business, then of course, we have to take a step back and say, okay, what business do you really want to be in, right? Like, what do you really want to be doing? Because I've done a number of books for people that are very, very successful and wealthy, but they want to pivot. So, you know, it starts with what do you really want? What are you really trying to attract? Who are you really trying to attract? And then we have to, you know, help you to pull out the secret sauce that is already within you. Like, if you've been doing your thing for any length of time, you probably have like a real unconscious intelligence and excellence around your specialty. And so, it's pulling that information out, which we have a process we call enhanced ghost writing that does that. Usually, the people that aren't sure what they're going to write about, their biggest problem is they, by the time they get done, they have too much. And we have to really whittle it down and be more narrow. I love that last piece there. That was crazy. Go ahead, Chris. I was gonna say, you know, this might be one that you like to ask too, Ben. I want to know if there's like something, what is the craziest, like outlandish, weird, like topic or, you know, subject that you've helped somebody write about? You know, sometimes we don't always publish it under bestseller publishing. We don't do anything from a moral standpoint that, you know, because we have our own convictions about what's right and wrong. And so, there's nothing that's pornographic or, and we do very, very little fiction, but we've done a lot of stuff that is story based and crazy, crazy stories, oftentimes in politics with lawsuits and, you know, things, you know, you know, I mean, there's just bizarre stories that happen in people's lives where they get mixed up with something that, you know, and I know this isn't even a good, because I can't tell you what the examples are, but it's just, I mean, think, you know, think Charles Manson, not that we're writing Charles Manson story, but think, you know, a bystander of Charles Manson and lawsuits and Supreme Court and all that kind of stuff. So, there's certainly crazy stuff like that. Now, that, unfortunately, a lot of times that, believe it or not, isn't as economically viable as, you know, the simple financial advisor, you know, estate planning attorney, doctor, dentist, coach, consultant, like those are, I always tell people like those kind of stories where we got to sell a million books. That's like either a home run or, or just, just write the story because you love it, right? Because you want it, you know, you've always wanted to tell it. The people that are, you know, coaches, consultants in the expert space, consultants, whatever. I mean, they're, they're like, you're always hitting singles, doubles and triples. They're, they're like easy, right? It's like that that's, it's easy to make money with a book in, in those fields, harder in the, like outlandish story field. That's, which makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's either a home run, like we've had a couple of clients who've had their books made into movies, but just because it's made into a movie doesn't mean it's going to make any money. You know, I mean, that, that's not, even that is not like a guarantee of, of success. So you never know. And that's even back to your original point as well of just checking that authority box, right? Like for me being Ben Harris, if I'm now Ben Harris author, you are completely positioned in a different way as an expert, right? That maybe could allow you to get your foot in the door, whether it's certain podcasts, speaking engagements, different types of clients, meetings now, that's just, again, position is everything, especially when you're in the trust based business. Yeah. Well, even more, if, if, if you're Ben Harris author of super, super funnel marketing, you know, the definitive guide to using a funnel to make all the money in the world, right? Like, then you're like, you know, then you're trusted by the people that want to buy your super funnel. You know, I mean, right? Like it's one thing to be trusted in a general sense. Oh, great. You know, if I ever think of somebody that I want to have a conversation with, it might be cool. But if you're trusted in a very narrow space, then, you know, you know, now you have something that's really economically viable. I'm, yeah, I'm curious on this whole writing a book topic and like the psychology of learning from reading a book, right? I mean, listen, people, a lot of people who love video, they watch YouTube, people who love podcasts, you know, they listen to podcasts, read newspaper, people love books. Like I'll give you an example. I walked into Barnes and Noble, Rob, the, the, the Saturday before Mother's Day, I was getting this little book that I couldn't find. And it was packed. It was a new Barnes and Noble, but I've been there for like two months and I asked the lady, I said, is this, you know, something that is just because you guys are just open or because it's the weekend or because it's Mother's Day, she goes, it is like this every single Saturday. So my, my point here is, is there something different about a book? Because if you've written a book and I'm reading it, Rob, you're living inside my head for a period of time. I've allowed you inside my head, not just audibly, but literally I'm visually reading it and I'm, you are reading inside my head versus any other medium. Is there something more powerful with that than say podcast or video? Yeah, that's a really good question. The statistics, the numbers would say yes, like considerably more. What's the psychology behind that? I don't know the answer to, but I will say this. People always ask us questions like, you know, how much of my secret sauce do I reveal or how much of my magic and, and, and, you know, there's been lots of discussion about the idea of moving the free line, right? Giving your best stuff away, et cetera. And we always recommend that they do that for a couple reasons. And, and this is, this is what I've seen and, and I don't know that I have any psychological data to back this up, but I've certainly seen this over, you know, thousands of customers. And that is when, when someone is reading a really specific book and I have done this a number of times, and I bet you guys have as well, when someone's reading a really specific book on a specific topic, pick that topic, financial advice, you know, a book on authorship, whatever, they're doing it with something in mind. They're doing it with a goal in mind because ergo the specificity. It's not, they're not reading it for pleasure, pure pleasure, right? They have a, they have a goal in mind. So what really happens when you give someone your best stuff and, and the case studies to back that up, et cetera, is you're right, your correct customer, your right customer doesn't automatically think, well, I'm just going to go do that. I don't need anybody else. What they think is this guy is brilliant. This girl completely gets it. And if they're the right customer, the ones that understand that money is less valuable than time, time is worth more than money, then they're going to reach out to you and they're going to say, what do I have to pay to speed this process up and ensure that it's going to be done the right way, right? Now I have done both things. I have purchased books that I had a very specific mindset. I knew I wasn't reading this book to learn the methodology. One in particular was on YouTube using YouTube advertising and YouTube marketing. And I picked up a book on it. I read the book was absolute garbage. It was a glorified transcript. And because of that, I chose not to work with that individual. So it drove me away because I thought it was shoddy. Not, not because I didn't think they were good. I didn't know if they were good at YouTube or not. I assumed that they were, but because it was shoddy, I thought shoddy work means, you know, probably shoddy work for me as a client. So I, I chose against it. So people, you know, the right people are reading the book thinking, is this person the right person for me? And if they are, then you're, you're, you're in, you have a customer. Yeah. I mean, uninterrupted, right? And inside somebody's head is some real estate that is really powerful. But, but you know what's the money you said, like, where's this line for free? And, and, you know, I'm always a student studying Russell and, you know, some of the prime mover stuff that we're doing. You know, what he does for webinars specifically is he's teaching you the what. If you want the how, that's when you got to pay for it. And I think that's such an easy line right there is that people have to pay for the how, but you, there's a lot of what that can be put into a book. And then in the hiring coaching, like, okay, we'll show you exactly how to do X, Y and Z. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally true. And honestly, what you can only put so much in a book anyway, you only want your book to be 150 to 200 pages. And so, you know, you're telling stories, you're trying to drive engagement. People are interested in stories more than they're interested in, you know, they're not buying a textbook here or manual. They're they want to be engaged. Very true. That's, I mean, that's a point that I overlooked forever until now, like that's a complete even, you know, teaching through parables and telling stories. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. Chris, do you have any questions to Ty, Bill on that? Or can we jump back into software? Because I want to hear all about back in the software. Well, I wanted to know on the AI to like, you felt that it was going to be painful. And then you wrote a book, did you find that it was a lot easier than you initially had like, yeah, yeah, like a lot of things, right, that you procrastinate on oftentimes, they're easier than you think they are. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I was actually more in love with my software after I wrote a book in two and a half days than than I was before. I think before it was, you know, a product of two years of creating it and you kind of fall in love with this process of let's do it the right way. But then when I actually used it to write my book, and my book's done exceptionally well, I mean, my book funnel is crushing it. And it's been number one, we didn't even do an official launch of it. We just published it because I was running a book funnel at the same time. And it has been number one perpetually for the last three months on using AI to write, which is really cool. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I can walk you through like what it what it means to us to write with AI, as opposed to what I think is wrong. Yeah, I'd love to. Yeah. Basically, I already shared what I think is wrong. And Amazon is highlighting that, right? They don't want AI generated content. They don't want you to put three super prompts in and have 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 words written. They don't want that. They want content that is original. And so, the way we look at it is, you know, we have this whole and what we call enhanced ghost writing process, which is our trademark writing process. And so what we did is we kind of took that process and we built software and specifically AI software around that process. So it all starts with, you know, Ben, what we were talking about a few minutes ago, and that is, okay, who is your ideal client? You know, tell me a little bit about the kind of person you serve, answer some questions about their demographics, their age, their sex. And then you can ask the software basically to, okay, tell me what are the big problems that this individual has? What are the big solutions that they're looking for? What should this book really hit on? And so we build out what we call a reader avatar and a mission statement before a single word is generated in the book itself. All of that is done really following the exact process that we follow when we're one-on-one with a $50,000 client, right? That's the stuff we want as a foundation before we ever move into getting a writer involved, et cetera. So we do the exact same thing, except it doesn't take a month, one-on-one. It takes, you know, seven minutes or eight minutes, and you can literally get, you know, some amazing info. Then Manny, Manuscriptor is the, is a software. We affectionately termed it Manny. And so Manny will then create a great hook, title, and subtitle. It'll give you examples. How about this for a title? How about this for a subtitle? Because we want a working title and subtitle before we ever go into chapters or any of that, because it's the hook, right? It's, it's hook story offer, hook story offer, right? I mean, it's the same thing. We want a great hook before we move on. And so there's rules around how to create a great title, and we've built all of that into Manny as well. From there, okay, tell me what the chapters should be, how they should be organized. So Manny will help you to lay out your chapters, give you ideas. At any point, by the way, none of this is AI generated, because you haven't written anything yet. You're, you're, it's, it's assisting you with your path, right? Your, your map to write. And so we've done all of that. And then we give, you know, Manny will do all kinds of things. It will give them content. It will give them stories and anecdotes if they don't have it. The thing that I loved about it the most is it has a great speech to text feature, which is not new. But what it does is the spoken word is really different than the written word, right? Like you asked me one question, I haven't stopped talking. It's like one sentence. It's one, you know, 30 page sentence. Exactly. So we don't read that way. We, we read in short, punchy sentences and bullet points and introduction and conclusions and all of that. And so what I did when I wrote my book is I literally pulled up my PowerPoints and I spoke it. I hit the, the speech to text. I spoke it and then Manny rewrote it all in my voice. Oh, it's great. With, with correct grammar, correct spelling, correct punctuation, a full edit like a writer would do just from my spoken word. And it was awesome. I mean, I changed almost nothing and had my editors look through it and it was like 99.9%. I was so encouraged, so proud of it. So, so that, that's the, I mean, we want your stories, your case studies, your client examples. That's what Amazon wants. And that's what your customers want, by the way. That, that's not what they don't want. Some kind of regurgitated information about, you know, stocks versus, you know, the, you know, whatever the index 500, et cetera. They want like real information that's going to keep them interested and, and is compelling. Wow. So you're doing that right now through a free plus shipping that leads with, right with AI, that leads into the software. Yep. It's what we do. We do a free plus shipping or a digital. We have, we have two bumps, you know, that are writing related. And then we have our, it's a, it's a poor version of a MIFKI, but, but it's doing well. So, you know, basically we give them a seven day free trial and, and some bells and whistles to give us the free trial. And then the free trial leads into a $97 a month. But what we really want is we want to sell them the $1,000 package, which comes with group coaching calls and all this other content. And so then we upsell from there. Yeah. So that's like a kind of a, you know, not doing it solo. It's a little bit done with you, maybe over the shoulder. It's still solo for a thousand bucks. It's still solo, but they get, they still get people in a group setting they can interact with. So, so even when they go through everything, you know how it is like there's trepidation, you're writing something. And so you want to ask, does this sound good? What do you think? Yeah. And so we, we give them that and we give them that for a year for, for a thousand bucks, which I think that's unbelievable. It's stupid. Right. I can tell you what people want. Yeah. People are going to want to know where to find this. So yeah, what I want to know more or how to do this, where's the best place for them to go find you. And then maybe a couple of social handles where they can follow you. Yeah. The book is on Amazon, but you can find it. You can get it for free, of course, right with AI.com, right with AI.com. And that's probably the best place to go. That's, you know, that's what leads people to, you know, the best offers. I love it. This has been fascinating for me and it was fun that we took it a couple of directions, but I love what you're doing with this software and everything else. Wish you the best, man. You've been an incredible guest and obviously a friend for a long time and we'll see you around with all the cool stuff. Thanks, buddy. Appreciate it. Great spending time with both you guys and, you know, thanks for the great questions. Awesome. Thanks, Rob.
