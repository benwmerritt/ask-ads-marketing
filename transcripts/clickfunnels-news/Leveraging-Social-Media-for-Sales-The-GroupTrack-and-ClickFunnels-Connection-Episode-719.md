## Transcript
So, you know, what's your journey from, you know, how did you come into this entrepreneurial space and come up kind of with SaaS like group track and social media? How did we get here? Yeah, it was an accident, truly. Right. So he told me the whole story and I'm like, oh my gosh, you don't understand. We're obsessed with click funnels. Like that is our main tech stack. Click funnels plus group track. This is like where the magic happens. And so he was like, uh, you need to come talk to our people. I think this is a true testament that like click funnels can truly be used for anything. It's not one of those things where it's like, well, hold on, I do this, you know, where I dig ditches or like we talked about in the last one, click funnels isn't for me. Like this is for everybody. Conversations is what's going to bring everything together. And it's just proof that like one little thing can start a huge trickle of amazing results. You obviously know a lot about community building and running groups. And with a pretty sizable climb base at this point, what's the top mistake you see people make when they are running a Facebook group?

Here are your hosts, Chris Cameron and Ben Harris. Welcome back to click funnels radio. I believe Ben, this is episode number 719. Is that right? Almost over 720 of these bad boys. We've recorded an interview to amazing people. We are cranking these out. This is so much fun because you never know who you're going to meet when, when, uh, you know, you jump on click funnels radio. I'm saying like as a listener, like this is fascinating. You get people from all walks of life that really can dive in. And I think this is a true testament that like click funnels can truly be used for anything. It's not one of those things where it's like, well, hold on, I do this, you know, where I dig ditches or like we talked about the last one, click funnels isn't for me. Like this is for everybody. So I'm super excited to introduce our next guest. This is Jenna Larson and Jenna is the co-founder and coach at group track CRM. This is a tracking and converting system for leads from social media, which I think is really new and fresh. So Jenna, good to have you on the, on the pod today. Thank you. I'm a huge fan. So I'm really excited to be here. Now, Hey, I asked if it's okay if I can say that you're from SoCal, but you said that's not cool. Absolutely not Southern California. Okay. We'll leave the, the, the, the like the shortening cool names to the NorCal people are like, I like to call them Southern Oregon, you know, whatever. Oh, I love that. Well, this is kind of an interesting story. Like I honestly didn't, didn't know you hadn't followed you much. And this always means a lot. Vince, who is head coach on our team, um, he was like, Hey, Chris, you've got to check out Jenna. Like she'd be a great podcast host, but from what I understand, you're not currently right now in any of our coaching. So tell me kind of how that happened. And I think this is maybe why what you're doing works. So tell us a little bit about that and then maybe we can get some backstory. I always love it. It's like the proof of action, right? So really cool. I guess, um, he was at an event, um, with inner circle folks and talking about what's working and a bunch of them were like, well, we use this tool called group track. And so he's like, well, what's that? Right? So on his own, he kind of found our Facebook community. Well, one of the things that we believe wholeheartedly is that you should be a good human and have connections and build relationships. So part of the strategy that we run in our Facebook group and that we teach our clients is to DM the people who join your group and say, Hey, what's up? What are you doing? You know what brought you into my online retail store? Just like if you walked into someone's brick and mortar, someone would greet you and be like, welcome. We do that. Yeah. We do the exact same experience in our Facebook community. Right. And so I reached out. It was like, Hey, thank you so much for coming in. I'm the CEO. You know, love to kind of, you know, understand what brought you here. And he was like, Oh, so he told me the whole story and I'm like, Oh my gosh, you don't understand. We're obsessed with click funnels. Like that is our main tech stack. Click funnels plus group track. This is like where the magic happens. And so he was like, you need to come talk to our people. So yeah. And I mean, I think it's the beautiful thing, right? Conversations is what's going to bring everything together. And it's just proof that like one little thing can start a huge trickle of amazing results. I love that. I mean, what I want to do, I'm going to dive into like this kind of integration with click funnels and group track and how this works with social media and all that. Because I think that's what people are going to love to hear about. But before it's always fun on click funnels radio to hear just a brief version of your story, like your origin story, not like, and Russ always jokes like, not like, Hey, you know, the year was 1980. I was born in Long Beach. Exactly. Yeah. So, you know, what's your journey from, you know, how did you come into this entrepreneurial space and come up kind of with SAS, like group track and social media? How did we get here? Yeah, it was an accident, truly. Right. So I had a different company, which was called Drive Performance Coaching, where I was coaching online business owners how to really retain their clients. Like my zone of genius is fulfillment, onboarding, service and results. Right. So I am a coach, like I used to coach former Olympians and rowing, like this is my jam. Right. No way. And so I had a really awesome company where I was teaching all of these strategies on like really how to work someone through a customer journey and keep them buying. Because we know the truth, right? Acquisition is way more expensive than retention. And so that's where I would really support my clients. Well, what was really awesome is that what we were teaching was working so well, so that they were having so many conversations and so many leads and so many clients, but then it actually created a problem, which was, I cannot possibly keep up with all of these things. Right. So it's like you're driving on the highway and then all of a sudden you're like, I didn't follow up with Tommy, you know what I mean? And then you look bad and they don't get served and you're not making money. And it's a whole thing. Right. And so we started to have this big problem, which was, okay, we need to have a system that actually lives where the people are, which is on social media. Right. Because DM messenger, your Facebook group, your personal profile, it's a hot mess. Right. And so it was overwhelming people. And I'm like, okay, this is a really good problem to have. And so I was driving to a holiday party almost four years ago, not quite four years ago. And I was like, ah, this is it. I just need to be building a CRM that lives on social media. And so I called my client at the time as Nathan, Nathan Jass. I was coaching him on a different SaaS that he was running. And I was just teaching him how to sell and do the things that I did in my company. And I was like, Nathan, you must build this for me. And he was like, no, it's impossible. I cannot do it. No one can do it. It won't work. And so I was like, well, that's rude, you know, and so I'm like, okay, fine. And so continued, you know, life two weeks later, he DMs me and he's like, oh my God, I did it. I'm like, you did what? Right. Thinking he's talking about his own company. And he's like, no, I built it. And I was like, built what? You hadn't talked to him in two weeks. This was like the takeaway sale. It's like, hey, you're dating somebody. You're like, I love you. And they're like, I'm not that into you. And then two weeks ago, like I changed my mind. Yeah. That's what happened to me, by the way. You can ask me later. Yeah. So it was crazy. So yeah. About almost four years ago, we launched the first version of it, which at the time was only how to manage your Facebook group. So like clicking on your members and knowing where they are in your sales pipeline and people like lost their mind over it. Right. So like it blew up. And what's really awesome is we get all these crazy entrepreneurs, right? Like we get the click funnels clients. We get all the like hardcore people that are actually really making money and running a business. Right. And so it was so cool as they're now in our group going, Hey, but can you build it this way? Can you make it do this and this and this and this? And so what we would do is we would go to Nate, who then became my partner. Right. On what they want and what they absolutely. Yeah. So what we would do is we would then go to Nate, who's now my business partner, right? No longer does he have that other sass because this one went crazy. Right. So I, you know, it's the joke now at group track. We're like, Hey, Nathan, can you build this? He says no. And then he's like, just kidding. I think there's days where like I'm on a call with him and I'm like, I really need it to do this. Always answer is no. And then sometimes he's like, refresh, and then it's done. I mean, it's crazy, but the beautiful part is we have this unreal community of people that are so part of the journey. And so that loyalty and that excitement and just like all the things, because they feel like they built it with us, which they truly did. Right. So yeah, we're coming up on our four year anniversary and we're about to relaunch the entire tool. We just invested more money than I want to admit. That's all it is. Completely rebuild it. So it's going to be wild. It's so cool. Congratulations on that. By the way, that's so exciting. Yeah, it's been crazy. We're like, who are we? What happened? I don't know. It's like an accident, right? But I think what makes group track really magical is that we have, you know, Nathan, who is a genius developer. And then you have me, which is the coach that's the practitioner. I'm doing the things that we would teach our clients every single day. So we're knowing what works, what doesn't. You know what I mean? So it feeds the tool that also then we coach on, you know, what are those strategies for getting clients from social media? So kind of have a unique partnership here. That's genius. Yeah. And I can see group track, you know, obviously being a social media CRM, kind of being the trailblazer and car carving out the easy way, right? Before you do it the hard way. Now this is the easy way. What type of, I guess you say, with your current client base in group track, who is using it? We are the coaches, consultants, you know, walk us through who your Yeah. typical customers. Yeah. All of the above really. The ideal customer for us is someone who is using social media as a means to get more clients, right? So, you know, we have a lot of coaches. That's kind of like our main thing. But we have chiropractors and, you know, business owners like that that are having brick and mortar, but really utilize social media. The other like really big differentiator with us and some of the other tools is they more focus on the business page. Our tool works using your personal page. So personal DMs, personal, you know, profile, your group and such. So it's a little bit different. Some, you know, some people have intentionally. Yeah. Versus. Absolutely. It's because why then people like are more, more willing to respond via DM or what? Absolutely. That and just like people want to talk to the actual human, you know what I mean? They want community. They want all these things. Business page just isn't built to support that. And so everybody was doing it anyways, right? Whether, you know, Facebook or Instagram wants you to or not, that's what people are using. We're in the DMs. We're having conversations. And so why not just support a tool that's going to help you do it faster and better, right? Because this is the thing, like you have to do these things every day to get clients from social media. Like it's a non-negotiable. And so we're like, well, let's just help you do it faster. That's really what it is and organized so you don't lose your mind. And then, you know, Tommy's mad because you didn't sell him something. Which would be something that would happen to Chris and I for not keeping track because that's why we would need group track. Right. Yeah. We had a client who, so we have this really cool thing. It's a feature in the DMs. And you can click our little button. It looks like a martini class because it's obviously a good time. You click it and it will show you all your missed messages. So like, so we have a guy, he did it. He ran, you know, our little thing. And he found that he had 27 people who had said yes to his offer. Right. He had DM them and said, do you want to buy this thing? 27 people said yes. He never saw the messages because they got lost in the disaster of it. And I said, oh my God, David, if you had closed those, what would you have made off of it? And it was $57,000. Holy cow. It's stupid. We have people and it's the story all the time. We have another client. She ran it. She saw that someone had said, yes, I want your thing in January. She saw the message in April and was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed this 10k sale that day because just crazy. It's the value of service, support, connection, relationships and follow-up. One question to kind of unpack that a little bit because that's huge, by the way. So if you're not using group track, look it up. And I think you would be pleasantly surprised. You obviously know a lot about community building and running groups. And with a pretty sizable climb base at this point, what's the top three may tip we'd be here for 10 hours? What's the top mistake you see people make when they are running a Facebook group? Man, you're just asking me my favorite question because I want to like lovingly shake people and tell them the truth. So can I give you two? I'll be very fast. So number one, I think people just open a group and think, oh, well, you're in my store and then they make an assumption that because you're in my store, you are going to buy. But just like if you walked in Nordstrom, you're like, oh, I'm perusing. I might check out the bedding. I might check out this. But so what happens is people then who are running these groups approach you like a crazy person like, oh, by my thing, here's my thing, by my thing. And they're like, whoa, dude, like chill, right? And so the strategy that we teach is the white glove group strategy, which let's take the exact experience we would have in a really good, high touch, you know, store and deliver it virtually. Because when you serve and support and you're depositing so much goodwill and value and training in your community, the day you go to say, oh, hey, by the way, do you want some help doing that thing I just taught you? Or do you want to do it on your own? They're like, yes, here's my money, right? And you're like, cool, let me walk you over to the checkout. So the problem- I see people like going to the Apple store where you walk in- It's exactly- you know, for like some air podging, leave with a MacBook Pro or something. Exactly, right. I mean, you literally are like, let me walk you to the dressing room, AKA let me put you in front of the content relevant to your actual problem. But that requires me asking you your problem, right? And so again, the problem is we assume we know what they want, so we just make them offers and we bombard them with the thing instead of like, hey, what'd you come in here for? Oh, cool. That, let me walk you over to the section of my store where that's where we solve that, you know, in front of this piece of content. And we put them in the dressing room and then we set a task in group track to be like, let me go follow up and see how that felt. Do they need to try something else on? Do they need to look at another solution? And then we just say, cool, is this something you'd like to do on your own? Or would you like to learn about how we can support you with that, aka make an offer? Now, is this also for e-com products and for coaching, etc? I mean, we talk about store, how much of that is literal versus, you know, maybe, you know, kind of like an expert track? Yeah, no, I would say it's not literal, right? It's the experience that we're replicating. We do have a lot of e-commerce clients, but they just are really bringing, you know, the value of the community is bringing in the right people that are talking, sharing their wins, going through it with you, right? You look at something like Peloton, right? And you're like, what the heck did those people do? They took a torture device and all of a sudden now we're so excited to like spend millions of dollars and go work out. Like what did they do, right? They created a community. That's exactly how it went viral. They're like, let's bring all the people together. Let's, you know, do the challenges, get the leaderboards, get them excited, and now look, right? And so that's the value, is having that community that's connected. Yeah. And a lot of times people think that that has to be a physical connection to. You're doing this all virtually. I love that Peloton example. I mean, that's one of the reasons too that ClickFunnels is so massively successful is this community, right? And hey, we're 10 years into this. Yeah, there's competitors, but no one, no one out there matches the community that Russell has created, right? You know, just this huge community of go-givers. So you also talk, one of the main things that you do too is like this onboarding sequence, which has changed your lifetime value you talked about. I mean, that is a huge thing. People need to understand LTV and lifetime value. Like you spend all this money, the CPA, cost to acquire a customer. And then the end goal really is not just this cart value, but it's lifetime value. You want to walk us through that whole process like this onboarding and this LTV? Yeah, absolutely. It's one of my favorite things about using ClickFunnels, right? So we do all this work, right? We have this unbelievable community, we serve, we support. And just to give context, right? Because I know a lot of people think like, oh, you have to have a big group or you have to have a high ticket to make money. Our group only has 4,000 people. So like relatively small, we have a low ticket offer. So our tool is $57.97 or $157. So we're a low ticket. Is this one time or is this recurring? Recurring. Monthly. Yep, monthly. And so small group, small, you know, tier of price. There's only two of us working this actual strategy, right? $0 and ads ever, ever spent in the history of Grotrack. We collect over a million from our group yearly, right? And so I say that to be like, guys, ClickFunnels plus Grotrack, which by the way, we haven't even done the breaking news, which we can do in a minute. Like just the way we're doing it now, that is our tech stack that is getting us over a million annually, zero ad spend. Crazy, right? So what we do now, right? So because we're a SaaS, right? One of the things we have to do is we have to onboard people to using our tool. And it's technical, as you guys know, right? Like you don't just sign up and all of a sudden make millions of dollars. You have to learn, you have to get skills and all the things, right? So what we were doing is we were having my team member, Lindsay, host these onboarding calls, right? Where our new clients could come in and learn. It was a disaster, right? Sally wants to talk about this. John wants to go off on this rabbit hole. And we were just like, oh, group Q&A things. It's just like, boom, where'd you go on vacation? Oh, Lord, it was all over. Like, yeah, different use cases. But what about this? And we're like, can we just get through the training place? Like, we will get there, you know? And it was just not serving the client because they really didn't feel served. They didn't feel like they were getting their questions answered. Lindsay is spending, I don't know, probably 10 to 15 hours a week onboarding it. And it just wasn't getting the results we wanted, right? So I know that you guys know Andrea Peer. She is like hardcore click funnel. She's on our team as well. Yeah, she's a savage. Oh, yeah, we love her. And she was like, look, let me help you with doing it through click funnels. And I'm like, okay, I have this idea. So most times when you onboard someone or you're, you know, trying to get them results in your coaching program or your offer, whatever it may be, right? We typically put them in a course. But with a course, right, it feels daunting. It feels like we have to go. It's just like a mess, right? So we were like, well, what if we take the idea of a funnel and use that for onboarding? And I'll explain what I mean, because it is a little bit nuanced, right? So instead of putting them in a course, we do it like a funnel. So we have one page that's like, congratulations, you just signed up for a trial of group track, right? And then we set the tone. We're like, okay, we're going to take you through this journey together. It is going to be self guided and like a choose your own adventure. And so we kind of, you know, lay the groundwork of, you know, what it is that we're going to do with them. And so then what we do is every single page that you go on is like a baby little mini step, right? So we're actually having them use the tool as they're going through it. And then at the bottom of each page, there's a button that says, I did the thing or I am stuck, right? And so as they're going, oh, go ahead. This is good. Yeah. So as they're going, right, we know where they're getting stuck so that where we can like, you know, inform ourselves and edit and all the things, right? But because it's like a whole different page, it's like a funnel. So it's probably like the longest funnel of all time, right? But what's so cool is we know exactly where they're getting stuck, where they're going. So if they get stuck, it just submits a ticket where we then step in. And it's self guided. So it's cool, right? So we could say like, you know, so our tool works on either Facebook or Instagram or both, right? So one of the little pages is like, do you want us to walk you through the Facebook onboarding? Or do you want us to walk you through the Instagram? So they get to choose their own adventure. So remember how I was saying, like in the group onboarding, it was like, well, Jenna wants to do this and John wants to do this. Well, now they don't have to worry about listening to things that are not relevant to them, right? And that's the value. It's got to be personalized, but we have to scale it. And I can't scale. How do you handle that spider web on the back end? Like, I know now there's all these infinite paths. If then, if then, if then, and now you're building out different landing pages and different links for each. That's one question. How do you handle the spider web? And then are you like gamifying this to to encourage them to get through? Or what's the plan? Yeah, absolutely. And with ClickFunnels 2.0, it's going to be a whole different level. We upgraded. So like, so number one answer your question, I don't deal with the spider web. That's where Andrea is like our genius, right? She is like, you know, amazing with all that. So she does the technical. I'm just like, I need it to be this, this, this, so we build out a brain to start. And then I tell her exactly where I need them to go. And then she just builds the tech for me. And I think one of the most exciting things about ClickFunnels 2.0 is that we're going to be able to see more detail about where they are in the journey. And that is going to be a game changer, because then what we're going to be able to do is like shoot off emails like, Hey, Chris, I see you're stuck on this piece. Are you just taking a break? Or do you need me to step in and support you? Right? So like, that is going to be a total game changer. But what is so cool, right? We have little like, you know, buttons that will be like, click here, and share your win. And so here's what happens. They click that button. It's the permalink to a post in our Facebook group. So now we have all these people being like, Oh my God, this is life changing, right? So I'm getting social proof while capturing those for testimonials to yes. But they're that the testimonial goes right into my Facebook group. So it's boosting you organically too. Yeah, 100%. So now people are like, seeing all these people like, what the heck, right? And that's what's beautiful about our Facebook group. It's a prospecting and client retention group. So we don't actually even really sell in the group. We do so much supporting of our current clients that everybody else is like, What the heck, they're all freaking out. So I want that too, right? So that's kind of how we gamified a little bit. And I know in 2.0, Andrea is like, Oh my God, just wait, just wait, just wait. So that's going to be even better. At the end of it, what we did is we embedded a survey that's like, what was your biggest aha? What was the biggest thing that you were like, Oh my God, I can't wait to go do this, you know, blah, blah, blah. And so then what we do is we take that information, and we make a little image with their face and we're like, Oh my gosh, Ben just completed the onboarding. Here's his biggest takeaways. Right. So again, it's like all that social proof, we don't have to do any work for it, right? Because it's now we can actually scale and we get better results. So when we implemented this, we had an immediate 28% lift and conversion during the trial. Like when we talk about money, I don't do math, but that feels like a lot, right? So not only is our conversion going up a ton, but these clients are so much better, well suited to use the tool because we did the work during the onboarding that they get it. They see the value, they see the vision, they're actually using it during the onboarding. And so they're sold, it's done, right? And so our retention and our lifetime value is now huge, right? So conversion lift, LTV. And by the way, I was paying Lindsay, however much I pay her to do 15 hours of work a week, that's gone. So that's like 100%. So that's an immediate like 2,500 a month that I get to reallocate. So like the savings, the time, the everything, it's just like, thank you, ClickFunnels. Like, thank you. Yeah. And even alone, that spider web, just having something where you can go and iterate quickly and build these pages, clone these pages, style guides, everything, then make you able to just create and create and create and create. Yeah. And it's so cool too, because we get emails all the time, where people will submit like a tick and be like, that was the best onboarding experience I've ever had. And we're like, thank you. We did it with ClickFunnels. So it's like really fun, right? Because they're like, I've just never had an experience like this. So we really did take the funnel. I think that's like the big difference. It is a funnel, like just a very long one. It's not a course. And I think that's what makes it feel different, right? Because it's immediate. Shane, let's plug your two. Are you using this as an affiliate play? Like, I hope you're getting commissions from us. Like, you need to make a 30% on every single one of these that you're referring over to ClickFunnels. Ben's gonna help you do that, but do not miss on that. I do not affiliate, although I should, but guess what? We probably should like break the news. I don't know. Should we like, is this a good time? Well, do you have one more question before that, Ben? Yeah. Yeah. You had one like on deck, I could tell. Me? Okay. Yes. Yeah. Oh, no, actually, I've got a hack for you, Jenna. So adding one more piece to what you're doing. So I know you mentioned you have done no ad spend yet. And right now, you can run ads directly to a group for pennies on the dollar. So with you kind of targeting your just a customer base, even targeting a ClickFunnels audience, you know, you know exactly how to find where your customers are on the onboarding process. I haven't, we're going to do this. We haven't yet. I've read about it through a friend who did it. That same permalink actually linked that back to the ad. So you're going to be getting a bunch of testimonials and organic input into the ad spend you're putting behind it. And I've seen those testimonials to drop out. Yeah. So we'll put it back instead of them going into my group to the ad. I love it. That is genius to join the group. Sold done. Ben knows some things. Ben's been around. He knows, well, this is awesome for anybody who's doing anything. But there is some kind of exciting news. I know that's like my breaking everything else to kind of like do some fun things with ClickFunnels and group track. Why don't you tell us what's going on? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we're, we're pretty diehard here over, you know, with ClickFunnels, right? I said, just with ClickFunnels and group track or collecting over a million, we had literally an hour where we sold 130k using ClickFunnels. Like it's crazy, right? Yeah. We are. Yeah. I gotta give you one of these. I haven't used these, but I'm going to give it to you. You ready? I'm going to tell you some effects that we need to start using more. We're cool. We're cool. I mean, to say mildly, right? We're like, thank you, Russell and all of your friends, because they've really just given us the platform that we need, right? And so one of the really cool things about group track, right? So one of the main use cases for having group track is that, you know, a lot of our clients are having these big communities full of people that are prospects and clients that they could sell to, right? But when you're using Facebook or Instagram or whatever, right, what happens is you don't know who the person is, right? And so with group track, a couple of things that we do is when you come into our pipeline. So it's like a CRM, which the fact that like you guys just released the CRM, I'm like, praise the Lord, because can't even. But what happens is, right, I now know where every single person in my Facebook group is in my client journey. Am I in conversation? Did I make an offer? Did they say yes? All of these things, right? So a lot of the people who come into a Facebook group, right, we want to collect their information. So this is the breaking news, you guys. I'm so excited. So we are as of today, like this morning, I got like the official, we are officially integrating group track plus click funnels, like, which is wild. So that means we are the only social CRM that does this. And so we're so stinking excited. So here's what that means, right? So you know, when someone comes into your Facebook group, right, and they request to join, they, you know, answer the questions to whatever, you know, membership questions you have and so forth, right? When you click approve, all of that information is gone. It goes away forever, right? You lose it. If you approve them into the group using group track, a couple of things are going to happen. Number one, they're going to be approved into your Facebook group. Number two, they're going to go into the group track CRM. So now they're created as a contact in our CRM. Number three, how they answered your questions are going to be captured. So we get those actual questions. And now we're going to store them forever, right? Also in group track, based on how they answer those questions, we're going to add a tag. So imagine now, as I'm bringing you into my community, I know exactly why you came in, what you're looking for. So I can actually direct you to the section of my store that is relevant to you, right? Because remember, the main problem is we just assume and we drop links and people are like, what the heck are you doing, right? So that's what happens on the group track side. But as of today, holy moly, you guys, now it will mean that it's integrated with group tracks. So what that means is the second you push approve to add that person to your group, all of those things are going to happen. But it also is going to be created as a contact in ClickFunnels 2.0. So cool. Right? Not building your list through the social media, immediate connection. Immediate. So now we're going to build your funnel, fill your funnel with your leads from your Facebook group, right? So what that means is imagine, right? And this is kind of what we've been doing like in a way with a workaround. But now so the second you push approve and now they're in ClickFunnels, you can build an automation that is going to automatically put them into your welcome email series. And so that I mean, like you do nothing, right? So now all of a sudden, they're getting dripped your emails and I'll give you like a ninja trick that a lot of people don't do. But this is one of the things we teach, right? So you've got your Facebook group, you're doing all this awesome content, but it feels kind of yucky because you put all this time and energy into this amazing training, but it goes into the black hole, right? It's like relevant for a minute, and then it's gone. Okay, well, here's what we do, right? In that welcome sequence, we're taking the permalink to the con, the content in the group, that's your best, and we're linking that in email. So we're like, Hey, welcome to the group, here's all the things, by the way, over the next few emails, we're going to send you to our best trainings to get you up and running immediately. So be looking for those, right? So we're building value in those emails, they're just going to click the link, boom, now it takes you back into your Facebook group, right? And so it's making the algorithm be like, oh, shizzle, this is like a really good post, right? So people are commenting, commenting, commenting, even more, right? So then with group track, we have a tool that auto captures those people, auto tags them, auto replies, auto comments, auto DMs to anybody who comments. So I mean, I have a post that I did in 2020, that was a really good training, my email drives them to it, we get comments on it every single week. So then I now know who are my hot leads in my community that I'm going to add to my pipeline and start talking to and, you know, converting basically. Is that crazy? And this works for so many different types of businesses, online, offline, high ticket, low kid, low ticket, it doesn't matter, which brings me to my question. What's the weirdest business you've seen attract leads with the Facebook group, the strangest offer at a left field, big foot tours, chicken coop construction. I want something crazy. I don't even know if I can give you anything good. Oh my goodness, I've never been asked that. I don't even know how boring. How about your favorite? What's one that comes to mind? Because I know there's been a couple. Group track is my favorite. No. I mean, I think the truth is right. I think the most exciting thing is that all these people that are, you know, making offers on social media, they truly have something that's going to impact the world. And the problem is, right, they get so excited, they build these programs, they do all this work, and then they feel very defeated because they can't make sales so they don't get to impact anybody, right? And so our mission is to help you, number one, be a good human because that's a whole other thing. But number two, like, be able to impact the world through actually serving with your product or services. And if you can't make the sales, you can't do that. And so that's what we want to help you do with the tool. So not the most fun answer, but it's the truth. I love it. I mean, I think so many people go after that income, right? And then when really, and sometimes they get that impact and then, I'm sorry, the income, right? But really what they're craving long term is that impact. And I'm just super excited that, you know, this happens, you know, Ben and I have worked partnerships for so many years. And Mike, you're like, oh, shoot, I need to follow up with this person. But then it goes maybe into one CRM, but then it might not be connected to your funnel and there you have to do a bunch of zaps. So this integration that you're talking about right now is going to be massive. Well, tell us how people go learn more and actually use it. How do they get started? Yeah, absolutely. And I will tell you just one little nugget before I do that, just to paint the picture of where it's going to go. So if you guys have been following like the 2.0, the CRM piece, right? I know for a lot of people who've been using clip funnels, like a CRM might be very new, right? I watched Russell's thing and people were like, what's CRM? What does that mean? And then there were the people that were like, praise the Lord, this is so exciting. But the customer relationship management is the game changer in helping you have those relationships. And so right now what's going to happen is with the integration between group, track and click funnels, right? When someone joins your group, they're going to go in here. Tags also go back and forth. So imagine if someone buys something in your funnel, tag is applied, you now see that in group, track and vice versa. Like that is ridiculous, right? The next step is going to be you guys are going to get those pipelines, right? The deals in click funnels 2.0 with the CRM, right? Imagine you have a pipeline in group, track and they're synced. So if you move them in one stage in one tool, they move in the other, right? So like, you're going to know it's going to be stupid. So, so good. But anyways, so like that's today, you can get the integration soon. I'm sure Nate will be like, I can't do that, but then it will be done. I already know it's already being worked on and he's probably like 90%. But like, this is a really, really big deal because we have so many click funnel users that are like, would you please? And we're like, you know, it's been no for a long time. Anyways, so to get group, track, right? You can go to www.grouptrackCRM.com. You're welcome to join our Facebook group as well. It is called something. I just changed the name the other day. I think it's like social organic strategies or whatever because the truth, Howard by group track, because the truth is, right, you don't have to, you know, use ads to get this result, right? You can actually build out your organic strategy using group track plus click funnels. And then once you've, you know, validated the offer and your sales skills and your group, then we scale with ads. Like again, like, we collect over a million and we haven't even scaled with ads yet. That's next step, right? Like now that we have the integration with click funnels, we're going to rock and roll. Love it. I love that. Yeah, that's so cool. And even us on our side, shameless plug, we'll be using group track and all of our affiliate Facebook groups, you know, and our main one as well. Obviously the ClickFunnels official group, but there's been it's we're like 60 days into it now. I'm sure guys like Chris are tired of me yapping about it, but we've been undergoing a huge construction effort with almost kind of deconstructing our Facebook group and down to the stilts. And we're starting with all of our members, a lot of admin assist stuff starting from zero. There's no posts in this Facebook group. It's still paused soon to be unpaused with a video from a guy who had this idea a long time ago, but his name is Russell. So we'll be coming in kind of talking about what we're doing with it. So it's very exciting. It's so cool. And that's the coolest thing, right? Like, you know, I get a lot of messages like, Oh, my group's dead. And like, well, let's revive it. Like just implement a strategy, follow up, serve people. You'll be shocked at the number of people that want to hear from you and want to buy from you. Like, I think that's the biggest thing that people are like, what the heck? It's like, no, actually, people want to start as long as you're not being a salesy weirdo and like doing cold pitches, we're good, you know? There's like, there's a way to do Facebook groups right and wrong, right? And if you do it right, it can be amazing if you do it. It's almost like an email list, right? You have to maintain the hygiene and the integrity of the right word. You know, you need to be booting people who, you know, trimming the fat. Yeah. Yeah. And that's why I said to like our core value at group track, 100% is be a good human. And that is like at the core of everything. We're like anti-cold DM, anti-cold pitch, anti like stupid stuff that doesn't work and makes everybody feel gross about it, right? If you create your community in a way that is serving and supporting and nurturing when they are problem aware, that's, I mean, then that's what we're making them in the group, right? The moment they're solution aware, they're going to choose you. I had a client one time that called me and she's like, hey, I'm about to pay 10K to this guy for this coaching thing. But I thought if I was going to give someone 10K, I'd rather give it to you. Do you teach on this? And I was like, damn it. No, I don't. But it's the power of, when you serve, people want to work with you over everyone else. And that's what a community can do for you. Love that. Love it. Yeah. Well, hey, we could talk forever, but we're going to stop here. I think people got to go check it out. What's the simplest URL for them to go to one last time? www.grouptrack with a T group track CRM.com. Well, thank you so much. Go check it out. We're using it. This is an amazing integration for us.
