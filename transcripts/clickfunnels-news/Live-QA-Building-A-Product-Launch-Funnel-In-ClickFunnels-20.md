## Transcript
Hey, we are live and direct inside of ClickFunnels. My name is Danny Walsh and this is Sunday service where hopefully we are going to have some fun, answer some questions and get into some stuff inside of ClickFunnels 2.0 and hopefully help you to build a product launch funnel which is something that somebody has been asking about in the group and I am hoping that we can do that. So if you are watching live or on the replay let me know a hashtag live or a hashtag replay. If you have any questions drop them in the comments. We are going to get inside of ClickFunnels itself and we are going to get that lined up to bring up on the screen. I am just going to make sure that we are in the right group. I have done a bunch of lives this evening and we have had a big bunch of fun and it is great going live. We are also live again next week starting from tomorrow even though it is Labor Day and hopefully everybody is relaxing and celebrating and having a big bunch of fun. But we are also going to be live tomorrow as well around 10am mountain time again on Wednesday and on Friday with my good buddy Andy Ortega. Let me know in the comments where you have been from as a big bunch of folks and Danny are everywhere. That is what this is all about right. I am just going to make sure this is working in the Greek Big Shots of Loris and Talia. You guys are awesome and if you did join us on the other live that was not in this group I appreciate you 100%. So I am going to show my account. We are going to do some AI stuff. We are going to build a funnel. We are going to get into this and have some fun. Let me know if you can hear me. If this is coming through loud and clear let me know in the comments. If you do have any ClickFunnels, two point or questions and do not forget that Funnel Hacking Live is coming up very soon.

If you have any questions or questions, feel free to ask them in the comments section. I can see that Laurie is here and Maura is here, Talia is here, Lisa is here as well from Ohio. You guys are awesome. Thanks for joining us. I will get into my ClickFunnels account and I want to go out and build a funnel. I was not going to build just any funnel. I want to build a product launch funnel. We have had some questions up in the group which have been trying my best to answer and trying to keep the group moving over the holiday weekend for folks. If we open up my account, we are on a new funnel tab. Let's get this like this. We will turn off the funnel hacking live thing at the bottom. What we want to do is build out a funnel for a product launch. This is a specific formula. I will try and do this live. The whole point of this is you are going to give your customers a series of videos before you make an offer. You may have been on one of Russell Brunson's product launch websites, for example, or you may have been on somebody else's. This has been made famous by a guy called Jeff Walker. If you do not know about the product launch formula and you do not know about Jeff and you do not know about Adi's things work, I am just going to give you a little tiny inkling of how you can put one of these pages together inside a ClipFunnels 2.0. You can go out there and launch your products by giving people a series of training videos. This is the point. What I want to do is create a new funnel. I have called it new funnel product launch style. We are going to make a page. We are just going to make a new page. We are going to put PLF00. You can call this whatever you want. I am going to create a page and just get up into the editor. This is a specific way of presenting videos to your customers. They watch one video on day one, another video on day two, another video on day three, another video on day four, and then you sell them some stuff. Now, challenge funnels and webinar funnels, product launch funnels, these have been around for a long time. They are very, very successful. I want to open the editor. The way that these pages are defined is by having a series of videos along the top. They promote curiosity because on day one, you can see day two, three, four, five, if you are having five days. You can see these videos exist, but they are not immediately clickable. What we do is use email to either broadcast or use a workflow to tell people that the next video is unlocked. Over a period of days, the videos will unlock. The question that is asked up in the group was, is there a specific thing inside of clickfunnels that you just basically press that allows people to load this funnel? Well, I do not know where that is. I know there was one in clickfunnels classic. If you know how to build these things, then you are at an advantage. This is what we are going to do. The first thing I want to do is add a section. I am just going to add a wide section at the top. Then, what I am going to do is I am going to add four columns. We are going to have four days in our product launch sequence. Does that make sense? Each of these little squares at the top is going to have a video. The first one is going to be visible. The next three are going to be unlocked. As the funnel proceeds, as the week proceeds, you will unlock another video. You need to record your training videos. If you follow the formula that is set out and you funnel hack what is going on, you can build one of these pages real quick and then implement this strategy in your business. The point is you are going to sell something on there for. Does that make sense? You could use the perfect webinar and break this up into four days. It is like what you see in challenges. This way of doing this is dead simple. You do not need any custom code. You can do this pretty much out of the box. Anyone can do this. The whole point I am trying to show you is that you can pretty much model anything inside of ClickFunnels. Does that make sense? We are going to have our videos at the top. What we are going to do is we are going to have another section down here. Inside of this section, we are actually going to have a video. We are going to have the video. To be fair, that is pretty much the main structure of the page. I think, Dan, this is crazy. Of course, people need some context. What we will do is we will have a headline. We will put a headline up at the top. In here, we can put, for example, there one. Then we can call this introduction to product launch funnels. You are going to shoot a video that talks about introducing people to product launch funnels. In the perfect webinar context, this would be the vehicle for change. The product launch funnel is the vehicle for change. You are going to do a session, probably about 30-40 minutes in a video that then ends on a cliffhanger that tells people, do not forget to check your email for video to be unlocked. Does that make sense? Do you follow along with what I am doing? Let me know in the comments. Is it possible to have a different fabric on in your funnels, not just on workspace-wide? I will do my best to answer that one and come back to you at the moment. I think you are setting it in one place. If you need to make a feature request, you can go to help.myclickfunnels.com or click funnels.com forward slash pulse. On there, you can have a feature request. You can make that request and check it out and see if that is available. I will get your answer and I will come back to you. Whoever has answered that question, I appreciate it. If you go to clickfunnels.com forward slash pulse, you can check out feature requests and see where that is up to. If it is a thing, I will find out for you. I will come back to you. I do want to get into this. I do want to get to the end of this. We are 15 minutes in already. You should be able to do that. You should be able to do that. I will find out. This day one is going to be my introduction video. You will shoot a video 30-40 minutes long. You can put other little notes on there. For example, I am going to change up this font. We are in one of my other accounts. I am going to override this and I am going to have a smaller font. It can change the colours and all the rest of it. Video two will unlock tomorrow. Check your email for info. The idea behind this is you would get people to opt in somewhere in a fun week. You can put an opt in page before this as well. It says, hey, sign up to my five day training. The idea is that you advance people in email. You send them an email and say, hey, the next video is unlocked. Click a link. We go to video two. What we are going to do at the top is give people the impression that the future videos are locked. Does that make sense? You are going to clone this page. I will show you how this works in a second. What you are going to need is some graphics at the top of the page. If you put the image player folder and you clone this, you are able to quickly get the rest of the page in place. You might be thinking, I have been to one of these pages in the past. I have been to one of these things where video one and the day after is video two. You get the email. The next video is unlocked. Make sure you get there now before I take it down and use the scarcity. You can see where this is going. What I want to do is show you real quick how you can use AI to create your cool images from the top. The first thing I want to do here is go into the section and get rid of the padding. I want to make sure all of this stuff stays above the fold. I might think, well, these videos are probably perfect. I don't want this big gap. What I want to do is go into this section and take off this padding. When people are on the page, pretty much see all of the video. It is obvious they want to press play and watch the video. The email is going to lead this. If you wanted to, you could also add a countdown at the bottom. You could say, however long before the next video is unlocked. You could actually automate this as well. You could say the next video is unlocked there or evergreen. It is going to be on page load. It is going to set some of the hours. There are lots of different things you can do with a countdown. For the purposes of this, I am going to leave that off. We are just going to build this simple page. Then we use the email to advance people with the links. That kind of makes sense. Winters in there as well. Let me check the comments. Make sure I keep my eye on the comments. Big shout to Winter Johns. I appreciate you, buddy. Pretty sure. Only options in the Workspace. Triple check. Winter is going to figure that out for you. Winter is one of our most amazing people in Clickfuls. And one of our ambassadors. Winter Cart help you. And I can't help you. And the support team can't help you. It is a feature request. Big shout to Talia. Who asked that question. I couldn't see you in StreamYard. I am going to leave that up to you. This is where we are at. Day one is going to be introduction to product launch funnels. Whatever it is going to be. You tell people that video two is going to unlock tomorrow. Check your email for info. And then what you are going to do is you need some images to put in your thing at the top. What I want to do is use mid journey. I love mid journey. Mid journey is an AI image generator. I am going to go over to mid journey right now. I create all sorts of crazy stuff in there. I have some monsters working the printing press right now. We will use that in a presentation. In this thing it is dead simple. Imagine whatever. Imagine a video player. Screen with a red play button. And then what you can do is you can ask it to give you an aspect ratio. And the size of the screen. If you want to do that. You can do that. And then you can do that. And then you can do that. And then you can do that. What you need to do is make sure you have an aspect ratio. And the size of the screen is usually 16 by 9. If you don't know how to use mid journey. There is a bunch of tutorials and stuff online for that. You can go and check this out. What I have done is basically asked mid journey to give me this thing. Or you can go and get it from a stock image site. Or something like that. Graphics are important. We love the AI. This thing is thinking. And in a second we will get this cool thing. these options, right? So we've got some images that have just appeared at the bottom. And if we bring this up into full size on the screen, you see now that we've got these awesome graphics that we can use at the top of our funnel, right? So I just want to modify these a little bit, right? I just want to use a little bit of like help for this. So I'm going to look at like which one's the best one, right? So I'm going to rerun these anywhere because I'm not sure about the player button and see if it gives me another variant. You can just press rerun anytime you want. But the point is you're going to have one that's in full color and then you're going to have one that looks like it's grayed out. In fact, what I'm going to do is I'm going to imagine a gray padlock on a white background and then with the same aspect ratio, right? That makes sense. So I can have one that's live and then I can have one that's like a padlock and I'm just going to take these over to Photoshop in a second. You can use Canva or whatever to manipulate these. Some of these are pretty cool, right? I love this one. So this number two. So if we upscale number two by pressing that, I'm going to have that one as my live video and then I'm going to see what my padlock comes back as because we've got some like cool stuff going on in 30 seconds, right? And if you're not using AI to help you in your funnels and help you in your business, you're crazy. So what I'm actually going to do is grab a couple of these images, right? So I'll upscale a few of these. So I'll upscale number four as well. So this one is going to be our live video and then I've got a padlock and then I've got this one, right? So you see where I'm going to use your imagination a little bit around this, but I'm going to go and grab number one as well. So now I've got some stuff to work with inside of Photoshop. So the first one, I'm going to grab this one and I'm going to up size it. You see what I'm doing with this, right? So I'm going to save this image and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and drop that into ClickFunnels, right? So if we share where we're funnel, what I'll do is I'll save this image so I can use it. And what we'll do before we drop that into ClickFunnels is we're just going to take that over to Photoshop. Now actually, I can stop this screen and present my Photoshop screens. Everybody following this, right? Because we're just having a little bit of fun Sunday. Everything's cool. Building funnels in the lab. So I bring up Photoshop, right? So I'm inside of Photoshop. And what I've got is I've got my image that I'm going to use. Now I can add some text to this inside of Photoshop. So I come up in here and I can be like, right, this is one. Right. And what was my title from ClickFunnels? And look, this is very, very basic. I'd spend more time on it. You can get a designer to do it or whatever you want to do. But the point is, right, you're able to very quickly use AI to help you build out your amazing graphics and different things for inside of your funnels. And then you can drop these into ClickFunnels. And you can make a really cool look inside. So introduction to product launch funnels is day one. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to add some outer glow to this thing. And I'll put this in white and you see where I'm going, right? With this. So what I'm going to do, move this down. And then, you know, we've got a little bit of an effect going on here, right? So I'll commit this a little bit bigger, this outer glow. So it's easy to see. And that is like enough, right? So you could go as far as to help people understand this is now playing, right? Because this is going to be your day one, right? So I'm going to do a now playing variant, right? So if you go back over to our funnel page in a second, if I save this now, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So I'm going to export this. I'll export it as a JPEG image. And the reason I use false shopping is it allows me to save it at a small file size. So you see what I'm doing with this? And I made this like 80K, right? So it's like real small. So I'm going to export this to my computer and put this in downloads. And so I'll make this as now playing. And I'll save that and put there one. So we've got that one. And now what I want to do is go and grab one of my other images from mid journey, right? So if I go back over to mid journey, this time, I'm going to grab that padlock, right? So I'm going to go grab the padlock and come back into Photoshop. And you see what I'm going to do now, right? So add to stream. I'm going to use this same image as a template for the rest of my videos, for the rest of my mock-ups at the top. So what I'll do is I'll paste my image inside of here and dead simple, what you can do now in Photoshop and just press remove background. It's like, that's the easiest thing ever, right? No masking or cutting or messing or nothing, right? Does that make sense? Does that like the coolest thing ever, right? So what I can do then is just add some blending out to glow around the edge of this. And what I'm going to do is I'm then going to reduce the opacity of the image in the background, right? So it looks grayed out. You see where I'm going with this? You understand this, right? So what we're doing is now creating a locked image for day two, three and four, right? This is like the simplest thing ever. It's just images. But if you do this, right, people can say, oh, therefore is locked, right? Day two is locked. So let's do them, right? So we're going to say day two like this. So if I come back to the clip funnel screen, so we're going to do day two. And then what we're going to do is add these to clip funnels, right? Makes sense. So when people look at the page, they see one's playing and then two, three and four are locked out, right? And then that gives them the impression that they've got to join tomorrow and the next few days to watch those videos. And this is cool because people love curiosity killed the cat, right? People love to know, oh, there's something else coming and keep them going, keep them coming down the line. What is it that's coming next? I need to come back tomorrow. If you just said, oh, there's a video coming tomorrow, they go, yeah, cool. And then they forget about it. If you follow the email, right? And you tell people, hey, you know, we've got this thing coming tomorrow. And then the email goes out and then they see this thing's unlocked. It's like, whoa, this is amazing, right? So what I'm going to do is save this image. So we can have on the coming soon or whatever it is. And you can put whatever text on, you can put your little padlocks on and you'll see where I'm going with this, right? So let me export this one as well. We'll just call this the lock image. And inside of ClickFunnels now, we can add our images, right? So if I upload these images to ClickFunnels from my downloads, I can upload them. I don't want to show you the other images that are in the account, but I'm just going to add these and then kind of like get you back onto there, right? So you see where I'm going with this in a second images are uploading from Photoshop. So we used AI and we use Photoshop and we built something in ClickFunnels and we're 27 minutes in. Anybody sat there saying they can't launch a business inside of ClickFunnels, right? You're probably kidding yourself and it's that barrier that's potentially stopping you from going out there making a bunch of money online, right? So this is what I'm going to do. I'm now going to bring you back in so you can see what's going on, right? So bring you back in. You see what I'm doing with this? So what I'll do here is just clone these a couple of times and then I'll just get rid of these ones, right? So you can kind of see the principle, you can see the context, then we'll take some questions and stuff. So imagine you land on this page, right? And you could have text underneath if you wanted to, right? And just like get rid of this crazy font that we've been using for something else. We'll make this darker and we'll override this and we'll, you could set up your style guide, right? So this is now playing and then if we copy this over like this, a lot of the stuff that we do in marketing is just copying and pasting. In fact, I'm silly there, right? I'm wasting time. So what I need to do is come in next and then locked. Right? See the effect, right? That you've got. So one, when you land on the page, you're just going to have a video and you put your Vimeo or your VOOM-ly or your YouTube URL or whatever it is, right? Tell us what you can use. You drop that in there. You set it to auto play. So when people land on the page, this video starts playing and the topic says now playing, there one, Introduction to Product Launch Funnels, right? Then you send people an email on day two or when the timer expires, you redirect them to the next page in the funnel, right? That's then got two videos unlocked and you move the words up a little bit so you've got them there too. You could even link back to day one by making that image clickable. Does that kind of make sense? So when people land on this page, that video is playing, but they know that these videos are still to come and that promotes that curiosity and makes people want to come back because you can dress these up however you want. But all we've done is a grayed out image with a padlock on it that gives that impression. These are not videos, but you can make them clickable. And when they click, this will then take you to the next page in the sequence. So what I can do, if I go back here inside of ClickFunnels, I'm going to come down here and I can actually clone the page, right? And give myself the pages that I need. And ClickFunnels is just going to add copy, copy, copy and copy, copy, copy. So the end, you can go in there and adjust these URLs, but now we've got however many pages we need, right? I think I've got one too many in there to be fair, right? So we can get rid of one at the end. Delete that one. So we've got one, two, three, four. Have we got four? Zoom out so I can see what I'm doing. But we've got three. So we need to clone one, right? It was like a trick of the, it was a trick of the scroll. So we're cloning it out, right? So we've got four pages on here, and then we edit the second one, right? Each of these got a unique link. So what we can do is we can make a new image in Photoshop for day two, right? Now that we've got that one, you can go on there, right? We'll get another image from our friend over at Mid Journey. So this time we're going to take this one. You see how like this kind of makes sense now. So I'll copy that. I'll take that into Photoshop. I'll put the now plain text on that. And then we can go and add this one up into the second page, right? So let's take this one. I'll just save it real quick. So I'll save it to give you the idea because we don't want to run out of time, but I want to give you guys the flavor so you understand how you can give an impression of something, right? Without having to do anything complicated. So if I bring in, this is, don't forget, this is day two, right? So you could put on there too, you could go back. And then what you could do is link back to the previous URL. This one is now plain. And this image is going to change to the new one, right? That's what it makes sense. So let me show this tab. See what I'm doing over here. So you can say, hey, now go back to day one. And this new image you're going to have now plain, right? So what we'll do is we'll upload the new image to this one and folks are then going to say, well, I've missed day one, I can go back, but now I can see that there are two's playing and there's still two to come. Does that make any sense? Does it make any sense, right? So let me know in the chat if it's making sense. So what I'll do is I'll real quick, I'll upload this image and then you can actually go out there and do this three or four day launch sequence and just back this up in an email. So what we do now is we put an image in that's not grayed out. So people see that it's working and you just connect the dots with those links. So when you send an email out, you're like, hey, day two is ready. You send them to the link for their two page or show you where to get the link in a second. You set up an auto responder. So when people opt in to your main funnel, you put them opt in, thank you page. And then an email goes out, day one is now ready, send them to day one page. This one's playing three still to come. Once that ends, 24 hours later, they get another email that sends them to the day two page and they can see one and two unlocked. Right, I'll show you this in a second. There's what upload the picture, get my image uploaded like this. So boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, let's bring this back to the stream. You see like how cool that is. So now people can see that one they've watched. So you could change the text on there. Right, so you can put watched. Right, now this one's playing, you're moving people along. Right, so then you put coming next and then locked. So people have got the impression on the page two that they've watched that one with the remember this one's now playing and then this one will be there too. So in the perfect webinar context, this is now about breaking their internal belief. Right, so that's the introduction to product launch for those. This is unlike any other funnel you have seen. Right, so we're going to tackle the internal beliefs in there too. Right, see how powerful this is. And then we move forward. So now we're going to go back into our list of pages. Just load this up. Sometimes it takes a second when we're streaming as well. So let's bring that off until it sorts itself out. Sometimes the stream just overrides everything with all the process of power that we're using. Let's bring this back on. So you can see now we've got there one and what we can do is we can edit these URLs. Right, but at the moment we've got a URL for number one and then we've got a URL for number two. You can kind of see in the thumbnails how this is emerging. So now what do you think we're doing? We're going to set up there three, right? And each of these got different videos. You're going to send them out in the emails to those direct links. But when they arrive on the page, you think, oh man, well you've got to do all that work again. Right, let's be sensible about this. Right, so we'll go back and then we'll clone as we go. Right, so we're not duplicating a big bunch of work. Does that make sense? Let's go do that. Right, so what we're going to do is go back to the page where you've got all the bits, back here. So you don't want to duplicate the work that you've just done. Right, so all I'm going to do is delete this one and then delete this one like this. So the best way to do this is clone as you go. So now what we're going to do is clone this one. So now we're going to edit third there. This is going to be a clone of there two. We go into here and what do you think we're going to do? We're going to change this to there three. And this time we're going to tackle the external belief. Right, no one will tell you how good this one is or whatever you're going to put. Right, and again, now what we could do is we could say, right, we're going to clone this image like that. We'll put that there so we get rid of the padlock. So you can change this to watched. Like that. We'll change this to what you think you're going to do now, playing. Right, so that's been watched. That one's been watched. And maybe you do the now planes involved, right? So people can see with their one better. So this one's now playing. And of course, you could have a different image and you know that this one is coming next. So by just by creating those images, you're moving people through that process. And by the time they've watched the vehicle for change, the internal belief, the external belief, you're now in a position to make an offer. Now on this page, what you could do. So again, you can already do these texts, right? So video for tomorrow. So this is number three. Save that. We want to do the same on the previous one just for consistency. So let's go back to this thing. Bring it off the screen. It catches up. Apologies. It's like it works super fast when it's just doing its thing. It's just that we've tested it a million times on stream. So number two, we want to make sure that this one says video three will unlock. Like that. Tomorrow. So every day, you're going to send them an email and move them along to the next link in the sequence. Right? So this is day two. So once they understand the vehicle for change, tackle the internal belief, then tackle the external belief on day three, you're then ready to make an offer on therefore, right? And what you could do on the day three is actually have a timer that expires and it just moves them straight into the office. So they don't have to wait until the next day. But all we're doing here is using AI images to give an illusion that these pages exist and that they're locked, but they're actually sending them to a different link. And that link is just doing an email. It's like, Hey, day four is now unlocked. They click the link in the email, they go to the day four page. And on the day four page, they've got all of the previous videos available. If they want to click them, you can make them clickable. But all you're doing is sending people to the links that ClickFunnels gives you for each page. So now what do you think we're going to do? Go down here and clone the last this page. So now you've got your fourth page, you're just working smart, right? That makes sense. So open this one. And now again, you can move this over like that and get rid of that one. Cloning is just like the coolest thing to do, right? So clone this one. So this one's not going to have any locked images anymore. And you make a different image for each day, like we did there, but I'm not going to do that. But they now know on day four, right, you call the missing piece, right? This is the offer. So you do a recap. And then you you do the offer. And then underneath here, you can have a countdown that expires and an order form that appears, right? So click below to sign up. And if they've watched for three, four days, right under here, maybe we have a button, they watch for three days, right? The chances are they're at the end, then they're going to sign up to your offer. So you can then have a button that appears, you can actually make this appear when a timer hits zero as well as sure to have to do it on other videos. But can you see how easy it is, you know, with 40 minutes into doing this, all you would do just to make that a little bit nicer is perhaps add a background to this bar at the top. So you can think about a background and maybe you're going to use one of the gradients so it looks kind of cool. Maybe you do it like this way. And you could even do a gradient. So the line moves as the videos move. So that would be number four. You know, thinking about how you can style this in different ways. You could be a raw vein, click-fools is all sorts of different things that you can use to make this look awesome. So you could have a bar that moves, it kind of catches up with the videos. It's kind of cool. You've got to check that out on mobile, right? So you're running to work on mobile, or you can make, you know, different effects with this gradient. So maybe that's white, it's green, and then you have another white one at the end like this. So you can kind of create a cool fade effect across the top just to give that bar stand out or you could have an image. And again, you can go back to mid-journey, you could be like, hey, give me an image for the top, right? So if you went over into your mid-journey page, you could be like, slightly different. Imagine, you could like computer, code, and then you could do the aspect ratio, 16.3, right? Does it make sense? So now you're going to get some longer images that you can go and put behind those videos at the top, make it look awesome. And then all you need to do is record your videos, connect them together in a workflow with some emails, and there one is unlocked, the other's unlocked. There two, first two are unlocked, the other's unlocked, there three unlocked, and then the fourth one's locked, and then it gives them the fourth one. They're all unlocked, you've got the full series, and on therefore you make the offer. Does it make sense? There's like the how to build a launch sequence funnel, just with a few images that you've got from AI in less than an hour, using click funnels. And of course, you need to go in there and you need to tidy it up a little bit and make it look cool. But if you're using AI, look at these things, right? So I'm going to go and get, like, I don't know, I'm going to get number two from this, and then I can upscale this, and then I can use this in Photoshop, and then I've got this awesome background that I can put behind my videos at the top. And of course, if you're not happy, you rerun it, you can add effects, you can add filters and different things. But very quickly, you're rocking out, like, the coolest funnel. Even that, just with the gradient in the background, knowing that each day has got a new video unlocking. And there's just four different links, you built out in click funnels, right? It's like such a great funnel to learn, someone's saying. Tell you something that thing Laura's saying, great. Just last night searching for this exact option. Great to do the page setting where the SCR is settled. Winters, sorting out some problems as well. And look, you can dress this up however you want. If you want to have, you know, buttons underneath that kind of go forward and back, you know, proceed to previous and last section or whatever it is, you go down here and you could make a button and clone that out. So you could on this one, you could be like previous video, right? Back to day. So this will go back to day three. And then this one will be signed up to the offer, right? Whatever it is. And then look, you can save these sections as well. Right? So this is video buttons, whatever you want to call it. You can save this row. And then you can go back and add that to your other pages. So each of the videos, you can send people back or forward depending on where they are and what they're they are. And that's a cool little effect that you can have to add to like a fifth page. So on, you know, like day five, you send the thing out. Did you see the offer? If not, there's all the videos unlocked and people can navigate backwards and forwards. At some point, they'll watch them all, some point, they'll buy your offer. But whatever you want to do, it's all possible inside of ClickFunnels. And you've got the gradients, you've got the control, you've got the mobile view. On mobile, it's not as effective as what it might be on desktop. And you might want to think about that a little bit. But you have still got the ability to create menus and different things to, when it does go on to a mobile view, that you can give a menu item that takes them back to day one, day two, can have things to lock things or unlock. But on a desktop, that was fantastic. And just using the AI gives you that standalone, unique look that nobody else is going to get, right? Because nobody else is going to use your prompt. So if you're doing some AI prompting, you're coming up with some cool stuff, you're adding it to your funnels, you're just thinking a little bit outside of the box where you're like, well, look, how could I make it look like these videos are locked? Well, of course, you could just have that padlock effect that you can create inside of, you know, mid journey, and then you could overlay those in Photoshop or Canva, you could even have instead of the triangle or whatever, you could have your video still, like a screenshot from your video, and then just put the padlock over so it kind of shows maybe you on the whiteboard or whatever. But this, just let me take this off because it loads as soon as I turn it off. And it'll load. And I can bring it back on then, right? So bring it back. It's the streaming that's causing the problem. You can see the images if I sort of zoom in a little bit now, back to 100% on here, you can see the first one's got the first one and then three locked. Then we've got two and two locked, then we've got three and one locked, and then we've got all four videos, right? That one's got the buttons at the bottom, the videos won't show in the preview until you add a video. But you've created this illusion that every day a new video is unlocking, and you've done that in less than an hour inside a clip from a 2.0. And with the power of AI making those cool little graphics with the padlocks on, it doesn't have to be the red thing in the background like this. It could be you, it could be your picture. And all you've done is overlay a padlock over whatever picture it is, and then just fade that background out a little bit. So it just looks grayed out, looks locked, and that provokes curiosity. People need to know what's going to happen in that video, but it's up to you to make the previous video good, right? So imagine who's going to do, or build a business series where they're like, hey, day one, introduction to whatever business, right? Day two coming next, chances are you're going to come back and watch day two if day one's good. And then you say, oh, this is amazing. You break the beliefs like the perfect webinar. And by the time you get to day four, when everything is unlocked, you're then in a position to make your offer. And you can use a timer to make that button appear underneath at the point where you make your offer, you do the stack, you deliver the goods, and people are going to be like, well, I've been here for four days, this is amazing. Now I need the next step. It's kind of like came after the webinar and before the challenge, but this thing is still good for real good conversions because it builds trust and you're giving those results in advance, right? And there's no excuse to say you need a template, you can't do it. All you need is like some images, you can get them from the stock site, make sure that they're all the same size, and get yourself a little padlock. You can use some app on your phone to create these, right? You can use Photoshop, you can use Canva, whatever it takes to get yourself that effect. As people move through the days, they gradually see these things are unlocking. That is a cool funnel. I mean, I think it always looks when you've got like four locked below. If you wanted to sell a look, I want, you know, six days, I don't know what it looked like with six days, but you can sort of like edit it to do that, right? So you just need to clone a few more of your padlocks. And I'm sure you know, if you just put the words like, no, now playing, you can just make that smaller, right? That was kind of cool, right? So come now playing and then coming soon. It's possible to stylist however you want to do it. But the point is if people think that there's something else to come, they will come back. If you think it's just the end of the video, you've not had the chance to make the offer. And if you try and rush it all into a one hour webinar, they might not build enough trust with you this way of separating it out. And all you need to do, you don't even need to automate this thing. You just turn up next day, send a broadcast, video two is ready, send a broadcast the day after video three is ready and just send them to the relevant link for each of those pages. You pop up the video auto, auto players. You can even do it in a way where after so many seconds that this like bar disappears and with a bit of custom calling or you can get out from somebody in the marketplace or whatever it is, you could probably figure out a way to collapse this like a little accordion. So it collapses. You have a little toggle on there, show videos, you can do some neat animations and stuff like that as you're more advanced. But for all intents and purposes, the crux of this is you can very, very easily create that effect that there are locked videos to come. And you can do all of that without any programming knowledge, just work with four days. You just need an image with a lock on it for those three, then two, then one, then you make the offer. Thanks for coming. It's a cool way to get yourself moving, build trust, deliver the webinar over a period of time and make your offer with people understanding that something else is coming. If they don't know something else is coming, like the log off and they finish and they don't come back. So whatever you're doing in anything in your marketing, always tell people that something's coming next. So for example, tomorrow, 10am mountain time, we will be back doing Q&A with myself and the Ortega, even though it's Labor Day, we are going to put the work in, we are going to come back, have some fun. And you never know, we might actually be giving away some ClickFunnels swag. So if you want some ClickFunnels swag, come watch the show. And of course, don't forget, Funlacking Live is coming very, very soon. And I have Mara signed up for mid-journey yesterday. You can have so much fun with that thing, combine those images with ClickFunnels. You can pretty much do anything, right? And there's so many cool things coming with ClickFunnels, Funlacking Live, you're going to blow your mind if you're there, if you're not there, you need to check it out, get your tickets. There's so much going on inside of ClickFunnels right now, these Q&As, these live teachings, these events, the software, it's like, you get yourself the two Common Club Award, it's not easy. And a lot of blood, sweat and tears went into that one in particular, but it is possible. And once you understand that building things is normally the easiest part, you know, put some stuff on a page, it's like the delivery and asking for the sale that you need to get good at. And there's always, in my mind, three things, right? Your technology has to work and ClickFunnels does that. I've used this thing for years and I'm fortunate enough to work for these guys and work with them and the teams and the people just want to see you succeed, right? Technology must work. Next thing, you need to put the right offering from to the right people. You need to go out there and put this in front of your audience. You can do that, then you're winning, right? Because stuff works and it's in front of the right people. The most important bit is to build and maintain relationships with people. If you do that effectively, for example, through the funnel that we've just shown you, by building trust over a period of time, giving them quality, giving them value, they'll buy, but most importantly, they'll come back and buy again. Has that helped? Has that made sense? That's like something you can go and do. It's 50 minutes and we've just covered a big bunch of stuff. Morris says, thank you so good. A pleasure as always. A great funnel to learn. Any other comments that I might have missed, check this out in the live. There's likes and hearts and blonde minds and all the rest of it. Big shout out to Talia to Winter. Winter's going to figure it out and we need to do a feature request if it's something that you can't find and the developers are amazing. Winter's amazing. We'll figure this out. We'll make it happen one way or another. It might not be tonight or tomorrow, but as long as there's enough people wanting something, then of course that can happen. But don't get caught up on a little icon. Think about the content. Think about those relationships. Think about getting out there, putting the offer into people. Think about those conversations. But for now, we'll be back tomorrow with Q&A. If there's any other questions, you can let me know and I'll pick those up tomorrow. Go and build yourself a challenge funnel or build yourself a product launch funnel or a webinar funnel or an opt-in funnel. Just build funnels. That's what it's here for. That's what it does the best. Very, very soon, you're going to see a big bunch of other things going on inside of Click for One. It's just going to be the most amazing thing ever if it's not already. I'm biased. I use this stuff every single day, but I use it in real businesses. It's not some made-up stuff. We actually use this in real things and with real people and I know that it works. You can have ultimate confidence in it. If you do get stuck or you need help, if you can't find myself or you can't find an ambassador or you can't find somebody to help you in the group or the marketplace or whatever, you can also go to help.myclickformals.com and there's a big database of training and learning and videos. If you're still stuck, after trying in the group and checking out the help docs and finding an ambassador and asking an RQ&A or speaking to Andy or Carl or Tim or any of our community's team, then you can open a support ticket and you can chat to our amazing support guys and they will get into the technical stuff with you. Everything is available on the thing. You see at the bottom of the screen, help.myclickformals.com. We're here to help. That's what it's all about and a lot of people giving a lot of time to see you succeed in business. I want you to succeed in business. Everybody wants you to succeed in business. Go out there, use Clickformals, go out there and crush it and we'll be back tomorrow. If you've got any questions, you can ask those in the stream. You can ask those live and we'll do our best to answer them, but we have answers some right now on this thing. Keep on rocking, winter, joys, cut, let's see you Fun Like In Live, buddy. Everybody's amazing. We appreciate each and every one of you. We're out of here. We're back tomorrow, early, mountain time with Andy or Tiger and maybe a few other guests as well. And then we're back Wednesday with the ambassadors and then we're back on Friday with ambassadors as well, I think. And then it's one week close to Fun Like In Live. Get your tickets, funlikeinlive.com. It's Danny Walsh from Preston in the UK. I will see you on the next video, everybody. Bye-bye.
