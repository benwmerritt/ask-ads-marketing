Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels, and today I'm joined by Yett Lenvike. Yett is a visionary entrepreneur and the founder of Laptop Lifestyle Master, with her expertise in online business and digital marketing. She empowers individuals to achieve freedom and success through online ventures. So happy to have you here with me, Yett. Thanks for joining me today. Yeah, thank you so much for the invite. Super stoked to be here. I'm really interested in learning more about your story. Can you tell us how you got started in this business? Yes, totally. So I'm actually from the Netherlands, from a very small town. So when I grew up, my biggest dream was actually to become something completely different. I wanted to become police officer. Then it kind of wasn't possible for me to apply because of a lot of rules. So then I looked at my dad, who's been a very big inspiration all my life, with a business owner. And I was like, okay, I think that's my calling. I think I want to start a business and I want to learn about how to start a business. So then I decided to study actually, yeah, a business bachelor. And from there, I was allowed in my church here to live abroad. So we moved to Bali and Bangkok for six months. And that's where I met for the first time, entrepreneurs who were traveling and living in, you know, paradise, working from the beach. And I was like, wait a second, I think there's something else. I don't think I have to study the traditional business. Like, you know, my dad, as example, has more physical businesses in the Netherlands. And that's when I was like, okay, that's what I want to do. You know, I want to have something where I can travel the world for free, right? Like all of these entrepreneurs are doing. And when I then looked into what some of them were doing, I fell into the influencer world. So I actually started to post content from my travels, started taking a lot of attraction online. And that's when I then decided, okay, I want to be a travel blogger. I want to get full-itel deals and brand deals. So I did that for a while, and I was able to live abroad. And therefore kind of escaped my fate from the corporate job that I had for a year in London. I worked there as a recruiter in a basement for Hilton in London. And I also realized that this is not what I wanted at all. So I escaped that by becoming influencer. And while it was going great in the world of influencing everything depends on moral likes than money, you know. Currency is actually a thing. So while I was into that world and I was pretty good at it, I was making good money. I realized how much effect it had on my mental health and about, you know, how I saw life. And I decided then that I wanted to find a business model that didn't depend just on likes and didn't depend on attention or necessarily on, you know, how many bikini pictures I post and, you know, what things influencers, of course, we do to get likes and attention. Right. And that's when I actually came across click funnels. That's when I started researching, you know, what are the things I can do online without actually needing to be an influencer without needing to chase that Instagram famous. Yeah, this is. And yeah, this one I started this small course actually about all the skills that I learned while I was marketing myself as influencer, because of course I learned management. I learned how to build my own website and all of these things that I was doing for myself as an influencer. So yeah, from that moment I made a switch and I stopped influencing completely. And I started the digital marketing agency with the skills that I learned. And then also, yes, I started a course with with click funnels where I was teaching others how they could also become free launchers and leverage their skills instead of likes to also travel the world because I think in the end of the day, when I was chasing that, that freedom life, right, that is actually the reason I became influencer was not because of the likes or the attention. It was just because I wanted to escape the corporate job and I wanted to be able to travel and live location independent. So I think that's that's also, you know, a big part of the mission today is just that I think there's so many ways that you can achieve that freedom without needing to, you know, sacrifice your soul and Yeah, you know, damage your mental health. So yeah, that's how I got to click funnels in the end, which has definitely been a big turning point in that story from how I started. Very fascinating. And I love that ultimately you just chose to do what you loved you followed what your heart was telling you what your mental health was telling you and you pursued a business that wasn't, you know, people talk about social media and how it's all vanity metrics and you turned your business into actual conversions and profitability. So what was your first like leaving the like influencer world behind but still taking that experience and that knowledge with you. What was like, when did you start making your first dollar in online business was it through your course. So, before I started my course I freelance, I would say for one year, I freelance for one year, kind of while I was still coming out of the influencer industry because I combined it. So I had some packages where I was also making content but also helping them with their socials or building even I was doing augmented reality development. So, there was a position there for a year where I was freelancing and also offering content creation, but not anymore so much the brand partnerships of like sharing the content. It was more for them to use them. So that was, that was where I started making money there as a freelancer. And then from there I skilled my agency first to six figures. And then from that point I felt like okay, you know now I do have some experience under my belt from obviously being a freelancer than having an agency and that's when I was like okay now I get a lot of requests from people to help them. And that's initially actually when I started with ClickFunnels, the first year I actually did it for free for people from third world countries. So, you use ClickFunnels to build a membership area and to build the funnels and the pages to get people into my community. And I was doing that yeah as a free community for people in third world countries to help them as well take control of their lives and change their story and at some point someone told me yet why are you doing this for free. Yeah, you know, finding a way as well to monetize it. But what a beautiful organic way to start your business and have testimonials from people who admire what you're doing and are getting so much value from you to really grow and scale your business with that foundation. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was really great and I think also the difference you see that it makes to their lives is just very, yeah it's very fulfilling. So it was really a purpose mission that I started kind of this army of you know guys like we're going to do it together we're going to help you guys change your situation and in that time actually I had a lot of people from Nigeria as well in my community and they were very, very strict and strange political things going on in nice. Yeah, around. If you have a laptop, you know, then they were going to arrest you or you know like very, very strict to kind of hunt down people that want to work online. Right. It was a it was a tough time. I think that's five years ago when when all of that happened there. But it was powerful to see that they could say you know what I can work from home now I don't have to go on streets anymore I don't have to, you know be endangered anymore I can work from home and support my family, and especially the women that you know they're a lot to get jobs and you know to be safe outside of the house. Now they had to wait money and contribute while actually. Yeah, they were safe inside their homes. So, I think that was, yeah just a very, very wonderful time and I really enjoyed that community that we build up them and a lot of them are so part of our community today. That's wonderful. What a beautiful business model. So, speaking of that and kind of how you've grown and transformed your business through throughout the years. What is like your main business model now are you using a very specific type of funnel that's the most effective for you. Yeah, so right now we focus on really coaching program. So we have a business coaching program. And under that we have some lower ticket courses as well and also free community. So we definitely have a value leather there in in what we offer. So, for me, the left of lives on master program is really the thing I decided to focus on. Yeah, agency two years ago, I actually close it down, because I decided that I wanted to go full into coaching, I want to go full into this business and one thing that I did learn is, you know, focuses on everything. So I don't want to, you know, I did, I did to get both of them for a while, but then at some point I just decided, you know what, I get most energy from coaching and from really building this community that I actually gave away a lot of my clients to my students and help them, you know, take over the clients. Wow. So, yeah, now, now really what we focus on is the is the educational part, the programs and the courses. So, yeah, it's, it's just super exciting for me to teach and to develop new strategies and really help people to, yeah, achieve their goals. That's what makes me, yeah. Yeah, awesome. Very cool. And I can't go without mentioning the fact that I see that two comma club award hanging on that shelf behind you. Tell me a little bit about what that journey was like for you and receiving that award. Yeah, I think it was, it was very unreal to unpack it. I was like, Oh, it's, it's so strange feeling to have this now because definitely when I started with click funnels, I remember of course seeing the videos about it. I have to say when I started with click funnels, I didn't really know first how to market my course properly. It was a low, it went from a free course, right, to a low ticket course at that time. So I struggled to be with that, but I always had this vision in mind of, you know, at some point it will click as and it is possible to get to the point of making one million with with, you know, this program and in general with my business. So I always held on to that moment and I think it's been on my vision board and my notebooks, you know, for the past, I will see for the past five years. So then to eventually obviously achieve that call it. Yeah, it was very unreal and I have a lot of credit shoes for, for of course, discovering the ways of working online and the whole journey that it brought me to. I did also mention that, and I think more people have this when you achieve a goal that when you don't have it. It's a really big drive to get to that point. You know, you hype yourself up very emotionally and mentally that this is the goal you want to get. And then when we get there, sometimes it feels a bit empty because it's like you achieved it now. Now what? So now kind of that full, the whole hype of getting there. I kind of cautious then that when you have it. Yeah. And I see a lot of bulls, right? This is goals like getting an award or getting to one million dollars. I remember first it looked hard to get to one K per month, then 10 K, then 100 K, you know, now we are now at 200 K per month. Wow. I think before I started, as I said, even one K was like, wow, that's, you know, that is very impossible. And I think once you get to a point, you realize that actually it's not about the money. It is not about the awards, but it is about the person you have to become to achieve those things. What's the real payoff, you know, so great perspective. Getting this, that it's solved any of my problems, or, you know, having a million dollars that it's solved any of my problems or that it somehow changed me or made me feel different. And I think sometimes that's what we expect when we set those big goals, you know, and then you're getting there like, oh, but I feel the same. I think it's more about appreciating the journey. And really the person you had to become with your characteristics and your personal development, that that is the real payoff of, you know, getting an award like this. Yeah. Yeah. And I think especially with your journey, having such an interesting background and it probably feels like you just kept morphing, kept growing, kept pivoting, like, you know, you started as an influencer and then you turned to online business and then you started with a free and then low ticket course and you continued to grow and develop and become the next version of yourself. So on that same note, like, what do you envision for the future, the next 10, 20 years in your business? Yeah, so I think one of my biggest goals is really to become the number one program for people who want to freelance online and want to have a way to work online while not necessarily needing to pay, you know, or the likes are affecting their rental health. I want to just 100% work online based on skills, you know, and one of the number one program that helps people achieve this, that helps people escape their other AAs, you know, the matrix and nine to five. That's definitely something that I want to keep striving for just to make our program better and better and better week by week. We improved so many things and that's just very important for me to just make sure we're, you know, the best in what we do. We have all the latest updates and yeah, we really help people achieve those goals. So I see that still going on for the next years to come because I feel like this is going to be the future of education, online courses, mentorships, coaching programs. I really see that get a future of education. And then for me personally, it has always been a big dream to get into public speaking. So at this stage now where I have my team running most things, right, I can really step back and say, okay, you know, now I'm going to focus on content. So I want to really get into YouTube and podcasts and do more public speaking, because that's for me really where what my dream would look like is to get into public speaking. What my dream would look like is just being able to share value with people and inspire people day to day. So for me, I think that chapter of sharing more with the world, that's really what's yet coming out for the next years. It's really beautiful and I can definitely envision that for you because you are so eloquent in the way that you speak and you offer so much value. And I love that. You know, we talk a lot internally at ClickFunnels and on the podcast as well about how it really boils down to impact over profit. And you're living out those values in your business too. And I think that that's such a big key character trait about the people who are in our community and the people who actually go on to be very successful are the ones that, you know, it starts as I want to grow my business. And then it turns into really, I just want to help people and you're growing so quickly. And what you're doing is scaling because you're putting the people first. Yeah, 100%. Definitely. I always say that, you know, it's, it's, I think your revenue reflects the impact you're making, you know, yeah, it's cool to make that much money and blah, blah, blah, right. But yeah, what's what really makes me jump up and down the rule every day is still when I see just that my students are actually achieving their goals and, you know, having a complete life transformation. And that is always going to be the main reason that I that I do this. Yeah, that's great. What is your biggest impactful piece of advice for fellow entrepreneurs or maybe somebody who wants to start working remotely and live out the way that they want to live? Yeah, I would say it's, it's maybe a bit of a cliche, but make sure that you all heartedly love what you do every single day. Because if you want to get good in business and you want to get to a level of, you know, seven, eight figure entrepreneur, I think that means you need to become part of the top 10% of your field. Yeah, you need to become really good at what you do and really specialize in it. And you're only going to want to work that hard to get to the top 10% if you love what you do. Very true. You will love what you do. You will not be able to pull those late nights and, you know, have to discipline to just keep going even when you fall down. But if you honestly can say that you love what you do every single day, then getting to the top 10% is going to be something that you aspire and that's going to motivate you. Yeah. Love that. That's great perspective. Thank you for that. Okay, one last question. I always like to ask this, where can people go to learn more about you and your business and what you're doing to help other entrepreneurs live that laptop lifestyle? Yes, definitely. So we are very active on Instagram. So my Instagram is jets phone bike with an X behind it. That's where we post a lot of reels, a lot of really cool value content. And then of course we also have our website, which is www.jetsphonebike.com. And as I said, I'm going to start my YouTube. So yeah, if you really want to see more long form content from me, value about personal development, entrepreneurship, then I also encourage you to check out my YouTube and my podcast as well. Perfect. We'll include that in the description as well. It was a pleasure getting to know you a little bit more as yet and I'm really excited that you're coming to Funnel Hacking Live. So we'll have to connect there. Thank you again and we look forward to hearing more from you. Sam, thank you so much.
