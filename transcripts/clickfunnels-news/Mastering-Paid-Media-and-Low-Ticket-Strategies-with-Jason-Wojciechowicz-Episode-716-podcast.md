What's up, Chris? What up, Ben Harris? So this individual today is one of the best, if not the best lower take, I say low ticket experts in the entire world. He can dive into what that means, because I'm sure he's in way better of a definition than, than I can come up with. But someone that's spent hens of millions of dollars in paid ads, clients from many different niches all over the world, Facebook, all kinds of paid media. But I'm super pumped to welcome Jason Wojo to the program today. Jason, what's up, man? Good, bro. Thanks for having me. Yeah, we're super excited to dive in. This is awesome. I also see over your left shoulder there, right in the hardware, man. Two, I've got another one too. I got two of them. Oh, sweet. Tell us, tell us about those. Was that a specific offer? So one of them was from my client, Dylan Kivo. He gave me one as a present for my birthday. And then this one was mine, but I just got my, my 10 million three weeks ago. So it's in the mail right now, I guess. So yeah. Yeah. So I'm really pumped about that. I'm like, I, the only thing with the wall is like, I don't know where I'm going to put it because I think it's too big for like this thing right here. I'm pretty sure it's huge. So I don't know. I mean, it is bigger than those others, right? 10 million is bigger than one million. No, yeah. We have to make, you know, the size appropriate. Which may be a bigger office. But he's got to build you something huge, right? Even for your C award, when you get it, we're going to have a need, a lot of room for that one. Yeah, that's dude. That's one that I've seen like has like the ring lights and I'm like, that's right. You got that. That looks so sick. So as we, you know, we dive into your area of expertise, we love hearing back stories and really your path towards not only the Click Falls community, but just the internet in general. So if you don't mind diving into man, like what, what day you started in the internet, what was your introduction into this world? Yeah. So when I was in culinary school back in college, um, I wanted to be a chef. Dude, I don't know how to cook a damn thing right now. But yes, I did at some point because I was working at a restaurant when I was in high school and I had no self awareness and I don't want to do my life. And my boss was just like, Hey, you should go to culinary schools. You know how to cook already breakfast food, which by the way is very easy stuff to cook. Like it's not hard. Like you want to waffle french toast? Like that's what I was doing. I was doing like bagels with cream cheese and like stupid stuff. Like anybody could do like it was just, yeah. He was like, you might as well do that. I was like, oh, yeah. So I wound up going and I realized that it wasn't for me. I was in these six hour labs. I was like, dude, I don't want to cook this stuff. Like I was making chicken breast from scratch. All these things. I'm like, this is so hard. Like I don't want to do this anymore. So the chicken, what does that mean? Chicken breast from scratch. Like, yeah, we start with an egg. Yeah. Like, like it was just so tough for me to grasp the things. And I wound up, you know, getting into Pokemon card flipping. That was one of my things. Like I was on the internet one day and I was just like on YouTube, looking at all these people making money on the internet. I came across Tai Lopez's ad, the here's, you know, car in my garage, that, that whole, you know, angle. And then on top of that, I was looking at like people, you know, flipping Pokemon cards and like I found a YouTube video. I started learning it. And I had a whole shoebox in my car at the time while I was in school. And I took it out, went upstairs, started flipping these cards. Like seven bucks, three bucks, like small money, but to a college kid, like making 200 bucks a week. That's a lot of money. So yeah, I was doing that. And you know, I was skipping school and stuff. So I wasn't really like passing. So I wound up dropping out. I took the Pokemon cards home, kept flipping them. Um, and then I bought Tai Lopez's course eventually for the 997 for the SMA course back then it was 997. Now it's like way cheaper. Um, so I did that. And then I got into like local business marketing. So doing like SEO, Google, my business citations, like, um, Google ads, native Facebook, I started doing like small budgets though, like 20 bucks a day, 30 bucks a day, nothing insane, but I was helping local businesses to get more traffic. Um, and then from there, I was very rebellious against school. So I started making videos on the internet about like, Hey, like, if you're in college, like drop out now. I was so passionate about those ideas. Like, dude, drop out, flip some Pokemon cards. Makes a lot of sense. I was doing it and this brand reached out to me and they had these shirts where it said like hustle, patience, gratitude. And, um, they reached out and they wanted me to make videos with their merch. And they sent it to me for free. It was like hoodies and shirts. I made the videos. I sent it back to Greg, who was the owner at the time and he's like, dude, these outperformed all of our other ads. And I was like, what the hell is an ad? First of all, like, I was used to clicking boost posts for local businesses. I never did like back end ads manager. So that's what I thought an ad was was boost posts. I'm like, oh, like, cool. That's, that's sick, but I didn't realize how much money he was spending a day. And I met him for lunch in Connecticut. He's a lived in New York at the time. Met him for lunch and he was showing me how they were spending $2,000 a day on Facebook. And at the time, dude, I was broke college. I thought that was insane. You know, like spending two grand a day on Facebook. I was like, bro, this guy must be so rich, rich, rich. And like now working with tons of business owners, I realized how small $2,000 a day is now it's like so freaking weird. Uh, but like it's, it's just interesting. And then I really just spiral from there. Um, he started paying me like four grand a month to make these videos. And that was the most money I've ever seen in my entire life. I stacked money for about three years and then I moved out, moved to Orlando. And then I just, just built the agency from there on out. And that was really it. Like I learned so much working with Greg through emails and like we were using click funnels, like down sells, up sells, like the active campaign integrations, all this stuff that we were doing. Um, we were doing free plus shipping offers back then, which today like are not always the most effective because of increased ad cost, but they can still be very, very profitable. Um, just depends on how good you are direct response. But like back then it was way easier to get costs for purchases below like 10 bucks for a free plus shipping offer. Now it's like 20 ish, 30 ish. Um, so like I learned a lot through that and like, you know, offer stacking, Facebook pixel tracking, like there was no high roast back then. So I was doing all that. And, um, like, dude, I learned so much and we took it to like 23,000 paying customers in 11 months. We did it over like 1.2 million. And then he might have selling it. And then I had to go out on my own. And then that's when I had to move to Orlando. Cause I had no other money because he was my only client at the time. So I was like, all right, I have a little bit of money saved. Now they're going to get my own clients. And that's why I started doing like cold outreach, yell local businesses. And then I started building my thing from the ground up. And then that was it. Are you still doing Pokemon cards? Um, you know, it's crazy. Yes. And the crazy thing that I'm about to claim on this, which is the truth is dude, I flip Pokemon cards and I still make like 20, 30 grand a month. Just all flipping Pokemon cards. Hold up. What's, what's the highest value card you've ever had in your possession? I have a Charizard, uh, PSA nine and a Charizard PSA 10, which if anybody knows Pokemon cards, like one of those cards is worth about 150,000. And then the other ones like 20,000. So like, yeah. I mean, I asked the question like, I know what I'm talking about, but dude, I have, I don't have any idea. Yeah. And like funny. Cause what? So I also do like sports memorabilia. So like this Kobe thing, that's the tickets from the last game him scoring 62. And it's signed in an envelope by him. And like that's pretty valuable. And then I have a piece of the Chicago bowls of the court from when they won the championship. It's like, I know you can't see it, but yeah, it was a little piece with a replica ring and like, I just, I just collect these things. And there's a replica Kobe ring from a chip. It's crazy, but I haven't, I have other stuff over here. Um, but I do collect like, I have the only Kobe Bryant one of one card in the entire world. It's like $80,000. And it's a signed card by him with like a piece of his jersey. And, uh, dude, I just collect stuff like that because there's things that are like, it's not like buying something stupid. Like they're so valuable to where if you buy it, like you're already in the green. And, uh, yeah. I mean, dude, I'm, I'm very passionate about like trading cards and still do it. And it's really fun. And like, dude, you know, it's crazy. Is that a lot of people like they're, they're building a business and scaling and scaling, but like there's so many things on the side that you can do that will supplement like your actual like active income, like dude, an easy 20, 30 grand a month from cards going up in value or taking something from eBay for 20 grand and selling it for 24, like you just made four grand in 30 minutes. Like it's, it's something where if you understand market arbitrage, it's actually pretty easy to get into. That's awesome. It's funny what two episodes ago, Ben, we were talking to Pat Flynn and he's doing like a whole event around Pokemon cards. Like what was his channel called? Um, it's escaping me off the top of my head. I don't remember either, but Jason, do you know of Pat Flynn? Just the online marketer. Um, I don't know who that is, but you just got passive income. So yeah, if you Google, go listen to his episode, man. It was awesome. It's, uh, it's really good. It's called card.party. Okay. That's the thing he has come. He's got tons of, yeah. He's a huge, it's a bunch of people, a bunch of people going in and trading these things, but I always, just the reason I bring this up, bring it back to marketing. It's so interesting to hear what people, people are passionate about. And marketers find a way to make their passion into profits. Right. It's really interesting. Like they're like, okay, well, I love the sportsman ability, but then they find an arbitrage situation. Like you said, buying one place for one price and selling at another place, you know, for a higher price. I mean, is that something that, uh, you still do outside of the sportsman ability stuff? Is there other passions that you have like that you're profiting from? Not profiting from, but like another passion is like basketball for me. Dude, I, I was very good in high school and then I had a growth deficiency issue. So like that was one of my, like whenever I have my events, I always tell the story, but like I was probably one of like top 10 prospects in New York to play basketball when I was in JV, like nine, 10 grade and everybody else was growing and hitting puberty. I never hit puberty. Obviously now, yeah, but I was just saying you got a mustache guy. Yeah. So, yeah, but it was never like this. So like when I was a senior in high school, I was four 11 and 70 pounds. Um, I was almost like anorexic basically. And dude, I, when I was going to culinary school, I also looked so underdeveloped that like teachers legit didn't think that I was a student. So like I was there fresh from year when I was going from freshman to sophomore year, I went back home. Like I had to go get HGH because I was so underdeveloped and I never hit puberty like everybody else. And that's what caused my basketball career just basically declined. So now I'm six one because I basically bought my way to six one. And, uh, yeah, dude, it was just a crazy journey. Like, and I always loved basketball. Something that I always like ran to for like, you know, the relieve anxiety and stress and like it was my own creativity world. Like the court was just this thing that I would look at or just, you know, passion and like, dude, it was awesome. And it didn't work out the way that I wanted to. So like the biggest reason why I became an entrepreneur was because when I was playing basketball, people listened to me because I had a skill. And then over time, like when the thing kind of faded out and I wasn't able to compete, like, dude, when you're five, one ish and you start to take HGH and you're 85 pounds and you start driving down the lane and there's someone who's five, 10, who's 150 and you just get bumped on the shoulder. Like, dude, you can't pass them. Like you just can't. Like, I don't care if anybody says like, you cannot drive in the lane and take contact. It's just, it's so hard. So it was tough. So now I was stuck in this business where I was like, all right, like, how do I find my identity and something else? And dude, when I, when I was in high school and college, I realized that the only like kids that people listen to were the kids with like rich parents and that house that would have all the basement parties and like, you had to have money to be listened to. And I was like, all right, well now I can't play basketball. So now I have to make money for people to pay attention to what I have to say. And that's something that I like, I believed in, which was weird because like there's conflicting opinions about that, but I feel like the world will only listen to you when you have a massive amount of authority, which comes from wealth and like prosperity. And like, that was just something that I looked at a lot. Like just being. How do you get that as an entrepreneur? Like if you, if you don't have an audience and some people fake it till they make it, like I see all sorts of entrepreneurs all over the place who try to get this clout and a lot of times it's their own Instagram. And you know, we've seen it, right? They're renting the Ferrari and they're just like, if you want to be like me, I go pick up my mail in a Ferrari that I rented, you know, they don't tell you that part. How do you gain this authority? You know, if you're just starting out. I think the biggest thing that I just started doing for the last six months that I never did in the beginning was like trying to get into bigger circles and trying to provide more value to like just people without asking for anything in return. I was just like, hey, like, you know, I can do X, Y and Z. I can help you guys out with this. We could do X collab, whatever. Like I never like push people's buttons for money. And it was something that in the beginning I was so scarce, like urgent to make money. I was like, oh, like I have to make money. I have to pay bills. I have to get out of this race. And like now that I have money, now I'm just like, okay, like let's get into bigger circles. I want to communicate. I want to network with people that are bigger than me. I want to be able to be in better rooms. Like I want to be the stupidest person in the room. And that's always been the goal. Like I never want to be the smartest person because then it's boring because everybody's just asking you all the questions and I'm just, it's exhausting. So instead I want to be the person who's sitting there soaking and absorbing up all the stuff from people who are like way ahead of me. And like that's been my only play for the last six months. And you know what's crazy is that without asking for any monetary stuff, I've grown way more of the best. Like our business grew by 30%. And like, dude, it's just nuts. Like not asking for anything and just providing value to people. Like just getting on calls with people that are like, like yesterday I was on a call with Grant Cardone's, uh, president and we were just talking. And he was like, yeah, like, dude, by the way, dude, like I've been following you. Like I want to send you clients from ours. I'm like, what the hell is going on? I didn't even ask. So it's this thing where I was just so focused on making money. I wasn't really focused on relationships. And I realized how important it is. And a lot of entrepreneurs in the beginning, like, yeah, you don't need to have like, like, dude, click, follow those awards are awesome. But if you can't do that or you don't have that, you have to be reputable enough or at least referred to by people who consider you a good human. Like if you're just always out there trying to get stuff from people, people are going to know and they're going to talk about you. Like, Hey, like, don't talk to that guy. He's just trying to sell you something. Like, dude, I've seen that happen all the time with either people that I've known or people at events that I've seen or like, you know, these people in the space that are like really sleazy, like they get called that. And it's just something where it's not always about sales. It's not always about revenue. Like I'd rather be in a room with 50 people who vouch for me than like 50 people who I had a hard sell. No question. Yeah. Um, how would you suggest? Let's say, you know, we have a vast, uh, base of listeners, right? From people that are at your level from people that are just starting. Let's say they are just starting. How would you suggest they get into rooms they don't necessarily have a connection with or brand new to the space? What are some steps that you would advise for them to take now that you've done it? I mean, first thing I would do is like find free events in your area, meetups, like entrepreneur events. And then from there, you know, you can either invest in yourself because always when you have an event, someone's there, obviously to sell something, which is fine if it's valuable, but like, you know, you find a mentor, you find a coach or like you go to click funnels events, you go to 10x growth con, you go to other events that are not the craziest, expensive events like 4.97, 9.97. Two free events. We were talking about that. That you do some things. Yeah. So like I host them because I remember what it felt like for me when I was first starting out. Like, oh, no, I mean, I get why bigger businesses charge for events. I just, you know, I just don't have the sales team and the fulfillment to have a 3000 person event. I just don't because if I had 3000 people in a room, 300 people, 400 people would buy something and I just don't have the fulfillment and I'm, and I'm okay with admitting that. I just haven't gotten to that point because that's where you start. Like for you to have a 3000 person event, you have to charge because you're like, like the room rental is 200 grand a day. The food is a hundred and fifty, two hundred thousand dollars a day. Like it starts to get pretty hefty, probably more if I'm probably underestimating it and it's like when you're doing events like that, you have to charge because you're not just going to only make money off sales. But even when you get 3000 people in a room who buy a ticket, like dude, being able to sell them something. Yeah. If you're software, it's scalable because there's really no people involved. Yes, there's support and whatnot. But like if you're doing a done for you service like I do with ads and management, dude, I can't take three inner clients on and one day onboarding on Monday. That'd be a fricking crap shoot. So it's just something where I don't have 250 team members and I'm not doing a hundred million a year. So it's just this, you know, practicality stage where I'm at, where I'm just doing it to collect out and get more reach. Like when I run the ads locally, we'll spend 200, 300 bucks a day per city. So I'm running 22 cities at once. And it's like, dude, these ads get so much impressions and reach. Like, and as we kept running these, like I was going out and about in the cities. And there were people who noticed me at random restaurants who weren't even coming to the event. Like I would just be sitting there like, oh, I've seen your ad. I'm like, oh, sick. And I didn't notice so many times. And I was like, damn, this is crazy. And it's all about that like internal local reach. And that was something that I always thought was more impactful than just trying to create a dollar. I don't know. It's just, I think it's all about like having more brand equity. Like if people start recognizing it means you're doing something correct, but it's not always intrinsically correlated to an ROI. It's correlated to just you having a name for something or doing something or trying to be something. Like it's just, it's more impactful to be that. Yeah. I'd love to dive into that event a little bit more. You say you got one coming up in Dallas. Okay. And tell us, like, I don't know. I mean, if you don't mind, let's open up kind of the playbook here a little bit and dive into even some numbers. You're spending money on ads. Okay. You're getting the event space. You are, you know, maybe food and Bev minimum, depending on, you know, wherever you're at, um, how are you making that profitable? I know you have some high ticket stuff, but you also mentioned you're not charging for these. So if you would maybe give us some averages, but you're doing, how many of these are you doing like a month? First off, we do, we do four events a month. It's one a week. So it's Tuesday right now. Uh, we had Jacksonville two days ago and then this week we have Atlanta and then we have Austin, Dallas, New York city. And then we start back again from Tampa, Miami for Lauderdale. We just go in Orlando. We gotta be taking a ton of your bandwidth, man. Like, is this like the main source? Like it's not the main source. Like even like right now, like I definitely have like a slight cold because I think my body's like taking this toll because we're like 12 events in and I'm feeling it. So, um, yeah, dude, it's honestly really tough. Like I didn't think it was that hard. Now I see artists who are doing tours every two, three days and I was like, oh, that must be fun and I'm doing it every once a week and I'm still tired. I'm like, damn, dude, like Taylor Swift had a tour doing one event every three days or two days. Like dude, I came and imagine. This is kind of huge team, right? I mean, that's, that's one thing about scaling these teams, you know, that makes it a little bit easier and you even talked about fulfillment. So when you go to these, first off, how many people are on your team? We have a team of 52. Okay. All right. So you've got, but not at the events. Our team at the events is maybe eight people the most. Okay. Cool. So what do you do? Are you getting them into do like they get the tickets free? You're running local advertising. What does that look like? Are you selling them immediately into something high ticket? How does that work? So we get them in there for free. We don't pitch until the end of day one, um, because I go through like. Well, how many days is these events? It's, it's a two day. Okay. Yeah. So I do a two day, uh, because day one, dude, it's a free event. So like just for sales wise, it's hard for me to sell people on a free event in just one day. If it was a paid event, yeah, dude, you'd pay 997. You come for one day I could sell you, but free. There's people who like legit don't want to buy on day one. They want to wait till day two and they want to just like think about it. I guess, uh, and they just, you know, interesting. Uh, so like they either want to bring their wives, they do this. People who have come day one and they're like, I'm gonna wife tomorrow and then we'll buy. I'm like, what the hell? But it will, whatever, you know. Um, the, the, the biggest thing was providing all the stacked value in day one. Like I'm not going to lie, man. Like there's a lot of sale stuff involved in this. Like, yeah, it's free, but like we give them a ton of value where they could implement it. They want to, but they're too overwhelmed to do it themselves. Like everything that I give them, like, dude, they don't have to buy from us. They don't have to, but the overwhelming this makes them go, all right, like, I'm on as well, just pay them. So it's not the word to do in the free event, just to sell people. Like I go over offers. I have a whole offer worksheet. I help them build their offer. I do the landing page. I do all of these things. Your ad video script. I do your KPI worksheet. Like what's the most you're like done with you inside the event? Like they're working on it. Yeah, they're working on it. And then from there, yeah, they're just like, dude, this is too much. And day one, we, it's a 12 K and a 17,000. You can go do all this on your own or we can help you. And they're like, Oh, please help me. Is that kind of what you're saying? Yeah. And then like at the, at the, at the end of day one, what we do is, is we say, Hey, like we have a 12 K and a 17,000, 220. And if you buy right now, you get to come to the Airbnb. We rent this big mansion and we live in it though, but like we rent it and then we have a cocktail hour at it. So if you buy, you get to come to cocktail hour. Just like just an FYI, that actually crushes. It works very well. So like they come to cocktail hour and if they spent 12 grand, my sales guys are trying to send them to spend the 17. So like the cocktail hours, they'll like get the more excited and we send them then day two, we scoop up more buyers day two, they get to come to lunch with us. That's the other place. So like it's like cocktail hour plus lunch. Um, and then after day two, we have a really cool thing where like, if they get the 17 Monday, so it's a two day event, but Monday, I have a videographer that I fly around. He's full time for us and he will go to the Airbnb Monday and all the people who bought, he'll film their ads in person. Day three at the mansion. That's big value. Yeah. So like, you know, we'll get about eight to 11 people per event who buy about eight to 11 ish some events we had, we had 15 Miami always crushes. For some reason Miami will just sell 20 people. It's freaking crazy. Um, yeah. So you close percentage on a $12,000 to $17,000 is what you told me you're getting a hundred to 140 people. You're, yeah, we'll get a, I mean, it's a very close. It's a, yeah. I mean, the, if it was a paid event though, I'd have a 25 ish easily probably if I'd take a, you know, a intricate guess. Um, but like it's not bad for a free event because I'll spend all in, we travel between 20 and 25 grand. So I make a five row as, and then I go home or I go to the next event or I'm flying to do a podcast or whatever it is. Like I'll just go get the content. That's the thing too that people don't realize is there's actually the back end piece of it. The biggest thing that I, the back end piece. Yeah. The huge back end piece was literally not having to record content and being forced to like you're speaking for two days. I have 16 hours of video. I never have to sit in front of a camera again and be like, okay, scripts for the week, like no shot. It's done for me while I'm speaking and selling. So I don't have to ever like get a list of topics for YouTube and be like, all right, cool. This week's topics. It's all done for me when I'm speaking. So that was a cool part too. Also between the breaks, we have people who come to the front of the room. They want to take a picture or whatever. Or they just want to ask me questions. I mic up and I just answer questions and those are short form reels. So like it's literally killing so many birds at once. And yeah, I mean, that's, that's really all it is. And like the offer is good. Like it's such a good offer. And, and that's the whole point. Like I talked about offer so much and then I give them a good offer. Like that's the whole like congruency angle. Like the slide then pops up. It's like, all right, do you want to hear the power of a good offer? Stand up if, and I get them to do the whole like sales thing, go back to the room. But it's good. Yeah. Um, what, what led you into doing events? Yeah. So I was at a grand chrono event. Uh, we were at the business boot camp and we, there were about 700 people in the room. And he had 107 sales reps. And I was like, bro, this is off the wall. So dude, when you walk in, like you would all do respect. I wind up spending 400 grand at the event. I'll talk about that in a second. But basically like you go in there and you can't walk anywhere without anything. Like you, you literally get sworn. Like you walk in, you get your lanyard. Bro, there's two people just like, fuck it. That's it. There is on you and they're selling you. And, um, there was like 10 people per sales rep. So like, no, seven people. Sorry. So like, you know, they're texting you the week before they're sending you selfies and the videos on the I message, all that fun jazz. And then, um, you know, basically you go there and they had this thing up on the screen, dude, it was like, you know, those big red counters you see in studios where it says like, like a timer, but it's in red. It's digital. Bro, they had a counter up in the room showing you how much money they were making. I was like, what the hell? That's so weird. That's an invasion of privacy low key, but it was so freaking impressive. Dude, they did 15 million in three days. I was like, yo, I looked at Casey. I was like, we're poor. We have to run events. And dude, he was like, oh, like, we can't just do that. We have to have a team ready. I'm like, nah, dude, I'm just going to set up the landing page when I get back and we're just going to run events. And that's what we started doing. And he was like forced to hire people. It was so funny. Um, and I do what I saw that I was like, bro, like they're just playing on a different game and I was like, this is crazy insane. Like, obviously I can't get seven people to ruin right now, but I want to be able to do that. Like it was so impressive, man. Like just the setup and the organization and the systems and the processes and how the whole event ran. Um, I wound up buying into elite 125, which is like a private mastermind group. Uh, it's a lifetime. So it's like you get part of random Dawson, you get a six month done for you than a 15 month done for you. It's this whole Schfield's called elite 125. And it's like, it's pretty sick. Like the networks in there is nuts. Like the CFO of Microsoft's in it. It's crazy. So like the, the network and stuff is just insane. Um, and you get to meet cool people too. And, um, I don't know. It was just, it was something where like when I saw all those things moving in person, I was like, bro, imagine spending, like they were talking about it on stage. Are they spent three million to run the event and they made 15. And I was like, like, that's an insane row as, and the thing about that people don't realize about in person, like you could sell stuff online. That's awesome. And you could scale to nine figures. Like if you're, if you do it well, like you guys do, but events, bro, you have the highest lifetime value from a buyer hands down the highest lifetime value. So like you get people in a room in person, you can shake their hand and actually touch them. They won't leave as customers. It's very hard to get buyers remorse or refunds and charge backs from people in person. So like, let's talk about fulfillment on that though. Okay. Cause I think it's easy and we paint this picture. Like, dude, I know events to go in and get everybody excited to do a landing page and get people there. One, one, actually filling an event is extremely difficult to do, you know this, but fulfillment, it's not like you can say, sweet man, we just sold 60, 70, 80 grand and now you can go do the podcast. You go into the next event. There has to be a whole fulfillment on the backend. Whether they've shaken, whether they shook your hand, they've looked you in the eyes, they know that you're legit. If you don't perform on that fulfillment, people will fall out like crazy and your reputation can get slaughtered. So talk to me about, you got 50 people. So if they come and they buy on a Friday, what are you doing these Friday, Saturday, what are you doing? So they're Saturday, Sunday, and then they do. So then Monday, Monday is like an onboarding. Like what is that process? Like you go through this and then what? So Monday they filmed their ads and then Monday they filled their onboarding form and they're usually picking an onboarding slap between Tuesday and Thursday. So they're onboarding the actions pretty quick. But the thing that I realized is like with running an agency, they just want a quick win. Like if you get them a quick win in the first 24 hours, they're not leaving. Hence why we do day three. We filmed their ads in person. That's the fastest quick win. No agency can do that, by the way. No agency out there is filming someone's ads within 24 hours and then buying. Like that's just ridiculous. So when I saw that as an opportunity, I was like, all right, we have to do this. Then we can scoop up people. You know, we do, there's people. Oh my God. Here's the other thing. We have people come to the house day three. Dude, there's people who they had friends of that didn't get to make it to the event and they bring them to the house and they buy the shit. So like there's like this referral loop because they're all there in the city. So like they'll bring their friend and be like, Hey, here's my friend. I told him the price. He's ready to buy. I'm like, Oh, sick, dude, take his card. Like that's literally what it is. And I'm like, all right, well, we got to film like you got to sit down with this person, write your script and you'll be next in line. You're in the queue, whatever. And then they're doing their script and then they're recording within an hour. So it's like, that's happened many, many times. We had a girl at the Miami event. She had three sons who were realtors. She brought all three of them over and we're like, yep, they're ready. I'm like, all three Jesus. So then we like signed up all three and then like they went to do their scripts and like, dude is crazy. So it's good referral because they already refer people because they met us in person. That's the thing that like people who are listening to this need to understand is that the sale cycle is shorter. Like, okay, you know, online. Yes. Very scalable. I get it. I've been in the space for years. But if you want to sell like a very high ticket thing, like you're selling a 30, 50, you know, $100,000 thing in person, it's a lot easier. You guess I'm going to raise their hand for a mastermind for $50,000. It's a lot easier. Yes, you can sell through the phone, but you're obviously a common to a certain niche, you're calling people who have a $10 million comic club award. You're calling people who have even a, you know, just a million. Like it just, just depends. So it's something where it's a lot easier to convert. So like the other thing is, is that there's no objections. They can't hide. So you're on a sales call and you're like, yeah, like, you know, how does this sound? Do you see yourself being successful with this? Yeah, great. Okay, cool. Let's go through the contract. Yeah. So my turtles outside, I got to talk to him first, then my wife, then all this random crap comes up and it's like in person, dude, they can't run. And they see you in person. So the close rates higher objections are less, buyers or horses less. Like there's, dude, we've never had buyers or more. We've sold, geez, 160 people from the events and we've never had anybody fall out. So like it's crazy. Zero, zero have fallen out. Zero, zero. Nobody does that. That's wild. 100. Well, it's 158. Two people have paused payments because they had a medical thing going on. So that was understandable. But two people have paused payments. Dude, it's nuts because after the 12 K or the 17, they go back on the monthly subscription. So like also they're better business owners. We get to talk to them in person. Like we get to actually communicate with them on like, Hey, like, what are you doing? Like open your CRM, open your laptop, show me. Cause here's the thing, man, running an agency online, people will lie about their numbers on the phone just to buy from us. I see this shit all the time and it's so aggravating. Like they're like, yeah, we're making 20 K month. You go in their Shopify. It's like six. I'm like, dude, you lied. Like 20 K. Oh, yeah, that was for the last three months. I mean, that's not what we asked you. Like it's just, it's just something we're like, they're lying and it causes fulfillment issues because people just want to feel good. They want to be a part of a group. And in person, dude, we can literally sit there with them, be like, Hey, like, do you actually have the money to invest? Like, do you mind showing your bank account? Like we asked them that. I don't mind asking people that because I'm like, you, we can't work with you. If you're a service business owner and you don't have a sales team and you don't have at least 10, 20, 30 K liquid to run ads. Like I'm not going to run this thing for X amount of months and then you drop out. I need to know if you have money or not. Like I just don't people lying to me or I'm like, Hey, at least show me a credit line or whatever you have. Like I need something to be able to validate that you can even join. Because the last thing I want is someone paying and then a month and a half in, they're like, yeah, so I don't have the money. I'm like, what the hell happened to the money? And they're like, Oh, well, this thing I'm like, so. And then they start talking about refunds and then it's like this, dude, it's just like it causes headaches too, because the fulfillment that people don't realize is that when you start with a client and you have a project and all of a sudden we tell this pod or my team, like, yeah, we can't work on more. Dude, they have to rear their focus now. And the focus was on that. And it's like you're diverging so many emotions across the board to where now the team feels like it's their fault when it's not their fault. Like it's just terrible. So that's the only thing about being in the ad space that's a little like haywire. Is that people lie a lot about how much they make, which sucks. It's fascinating. It's cool to want to appreciate you kind of pulling the curtain back, right? The entire model of, of, you know, what, what you're doing really taking up a ton of time and you're, you know, you need to have your own Jason Wojo, you know, tour shirts of all the cities you've been to and stuff like Taylor Swift, you know, selling merch in the back. For one thing I wanted to touch on, and I know we have taken up a ton of our time, but I know you have so much knowledge to give in this space is in the low ticket area. Right. That's a huge, huge, uh, I guess niche of yours that you're conquering right now. Can you elaborate on that at all? Or, you know, what you're teaching walk us through that. Yeah. So right now I'm working with a lot of the biggest people in the space on just low ticket will be also called self liquidating funnels. So, you know, it could be a five day challenge for 27 bucks. It could be a PDF for $7. It could be a starter kit for 17 bucks, 27. It could be a course for $47 and many, like a mini kid or whatever, a launch kit, toolkit, whatever. The low ticket product space has been pushed down the road for the last couple of years, okay, because of heightened ad costs. Okay. Yes, bigger people in the space run it, but all the people who were making six to seven figures, they doubted low ticket for a while. Not every six to seven figure entrepreneur runs low ticket. It's a very small amount of people, right. Um, and what we found was just like, why are we so worried about the rise in ad costs? Like you're blaming the rise in ad costs because your offer sucks. It's not about the ads. And I was sitting there. I was like, like why? I one day I saw an ad and it was like a five day challenge for 27 bucks. And I was like, dude, this is so congenious. Like I know, and I have other clients too who sell $27.17. And I started getting a lot of them results. And I was like, wait a second, like this is something that I should be doing because they're self liquidating their ad spend. It's free. And then we sell them high ticket. And all of a sudden dude, I was like, boom. So then I, you know, I would case he was my CEO. I just went on the drawing board. I was like, dude, I'm changing like my private offer because I only do low ticket offers with, with, with, with private clients. Um, so like those are like for bigger person or brands and whatnot, or do consulting. So like when I go into someone's business, I'm like, Hey, you're running exit. Like there's like, let's say for example, right? Uh, one of my clients, Ryan, he spent eight grand a day. And I'm like, you're spending eight grand a day and you make no money on the front end. He's like, yeah. And I'm like, we're going to change that. So we built a whole low ticket offer. He replenish his six grand now and he's got two grand left and he's getting the same amount of leads and he's getting buyers on his email list. And like, doesn't matter if you lose two grand, you get the same amount of leads you're going to get anyway. So it's like, it's a self liquidation and buyers second money is the easiest. So that's what I started to realize. Like, okay, why don't I just go into people's businesses and form low ticket offers. And that's what I started doing. And it's just crushed and like now I'm like this ticket guy. So like all of you will put me in group chats and they're like, oh, here's what joys my low ticket guy. Like if you don't, if you don't work with him, you're, you're like afraid to make money. It's the funniest shit. Like these messages I get in group chats are so funny. Um, but like, dude, that's, that's thing that took me to another level. Like brand wise, I was always the ad person. You know, hey, run ads. Like to be honest, man, everybody in their mom can run an ad. So that's why I wasn't really at the full expansion I knew I could be at. Then I became the low ticket guy. And that's when things really got like a lot more lucrative for me. Um, and it was exciting because I got to work with bigger brands who could afford to spend more money on ads. Like they were okay spending two through grand a day. I'm like, oh, sick dude. Like, okay. And then some people spend 10, 20. I'm like, oh, this is great. So that's when I was funneling all the ads into these low ticket offers. And then also their sales team loves it because the leads are better. So, you know, leads are, you know, let's say you're doing a free lead man. Like, dude, you're the only thing I wouldn't recommend you doing free for is either a live workshop, like once a week, or you're doing like a live event. Okay. Those are the only two free things. If you're doing a free lead man, like you might as well take the money and just burn it on fire. This is really no point. Like I get building email lists is important, but front load and reduce the sale cycle and just get the buyer. Like it just doesn't, it just doesn't add up in my head. I'd rather spend 50 bucks to make 27. And then to spend three bucks for a free PDF to go to someone's email. I just don't see that as valuable. If you have a ton of extra money and you want to put it into a retargeting campaign, be my guest, spend a hundred bucks a day and get 30 emails a day. Whatever if you think, if you think that's valuable, I mean, it just depends on the offer, it depends on your back end. If your back ends at 30 K product, then yeah, dude, have a blast. Like, but if your back ends 1997, yeah, probably not a good idea to spend a hundred bucks a day on a free lead man. So it's something we're using the validate that by like the KPIs and the business and like what they're selling. So do like the whole low ticket space was something where it's easy when you get the results, by the way, like way easier. And they don't leave because I always have to touch their ups and downs and optimize what's going on and like the sales team has got to be trained and all these fun things. And like I've been getting asked to speak on really cool stages because of the low ticket stuff. Um, so it's just been really cool. Like people come to me more for low ticket than they come to me for the freaking ads. So it was just this thing where I was like, all right, I guess I'm just going to be the low ticket guy. That's interesting that you do such a range, right? That you can be an expert at low ticket, but then it's still jump into sell something that's 17 K. Um, also, man, we could talk to you forever. I think you've given us really, really cool nuggets. Um, if somebody wanted to learn more about you, what's the best way for them to find you? Yeah. So if they go on Instagram, they can go to at the Jason Wojo. Um, and if they're a business owner that has at least 10 grand a month and ad spend, they can click the first link in my bio and they can book a free demo call. That's awesome. And we'll appreciate you. Any, any final words then? No, I mean, that was amazing. Jason, appreciate all the insight. And, uh, yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, man. I appreciate you guys. Thanks man. Appreciate you.
