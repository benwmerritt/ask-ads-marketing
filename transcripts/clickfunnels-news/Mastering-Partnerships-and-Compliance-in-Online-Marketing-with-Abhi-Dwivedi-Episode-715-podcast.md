Um, so I'm based out of Dubai in united arab samurit and uh, yeah being here Ever since covid started I used to shuffle between to buy and Bangkok before that for about like five years And uh, yeah, I just made this a full-time outmaster In between of covid actually really, you know, I've actually I've heard a lot of people moving there I'd love to hear kind of the journey how you ended up there pre covid Like if you always been doing partnerships like where did your online entrepreneurial journey start was a partnerships through? How did that get going? Oh, yeah, that's uh, this really on short so um I'm really old in the industry. It started when I was like 15 years old and 33 right now 32 right 32 I started when I was 15 Um back in the day, I don't know if you guys remember there was a there used to be this prominent internet Markers forum called digital point Um, we're talking 2001 2002. Wow. Wow Um, so I was 15 what I used to do I used to do create wordpress themes And that we would sell do follow Links at the footer of those themes for 20 bucks a pop and we'll have like three links in the footer And we would then publish those WordPress themes and a lot of wordpress directory. So people who would buy Uh, do follow links would start getting SEO juice from all those wordpress sites where our themes would be installed That's how I what started back run at 15 years old Then I did a lot of cpa Up until my 20s We were one of the first few people So I used to live in india back in india and we were the first few people Uh to start using content lock cpa offers if if you guys remember um, then and then I got started into creating a selling wordpress plugins and Yeah, since then we've been creating different sans products and uh, just 20 2017 2007 2008 I've just been creating software products and launching them. So it's been a mix of uh, some solar products solar uh, avengers and a bunch of partnerships as well We're we're partnered with people who have Software products that help them market and sell got them to the market And then we've also partnered with people where we had products and they had their marketing or better Audience that we wanted to reach out to and it's been a mix of everything Since then so this 2007 eight with just being uh drilling down uh, very happy focused on uh on software and then I think 2013 14 was the time uh when I was Shuffling like I moved out and was living in Bangkok back then and then Since 18 I've been shuffling between Bangkok and Dubai 2020 happened and uh by Trump's incident That's awesome. And so you've done a tunnel to sass Is that kind of yeah, this whole partnership journey started and I'm curious When you structure these partnership deals, I always love this because you know when you do big, uh, you know corporate America or whatever And there's these mergers and acquisitions It's so interesting like and ben does this all the time. I used to do this like When you're in the entrepreneur world a lot of times it's like, hey, I like you you like me You do cool stuff. I do cool stuff. Let's partner and it's literally like a handshake that sometimes turns into millions and millions of dollars Is that kind of what happens? How do you structure these deals? Literally, it's literally the same process to be honest. Um, a lot goes into your gut feeling when you meet somebody Yeah, yeah um, you have to pick a partner based on your intuition your instincts your gut feeling and uh, I mean when you go to events you travel You meet a lot of people a lot of people have brilliant ideas like Products a lot of people have brilliant teams and marketing and audience It's just that you need to connect with somebody you actually think like listen. I can't work with you. You know, I can Uh, be who I am and deliver what I can and you know when shit's gonna go south We know we can handle that so I think that's the number one he when it comes to doing partnerships and then um It also depends a lot on what we both want out of the deal and I'm very, uh I don't know if I would say stubborn but very Lazy focus on the fact that when we partner and we bring in the product I'm always like we own the IP of the product because This has to go in our balance sheet at the end of the year because when we exit From this company or whatever that we try to sell it has to be, uh, you know in a single entity instead of there You know, I'm just sharing all the revenue with you and then you're paying me out in back Because we want to make sure our EBITDA looks strong our P&L looks positive and it looks something when we're an investor or buyer Looks at if they understand what's going on. So that's one of the key things that I'm very, uh, you know Very lazy focus on when we do the partnership But then at the end of the day for me Partnerships is all about me trying to make my partner as much money as I can Um, there have been deals where I have lost money just to make sure, uh, the partner walks away with a cash positive because You know, you can you you'll you'll have a different product You'll have a different partnership. You'll make the money back. But once the relationship bridges burn For whatever reason, um, it's very hard to get back Uh to that thing so Like give her a test like okay, we'll start with something that's totally transactional We're gonna go do a joint venture webinar or we're going to I'm gonna promote your book or something And then if that works well, then you jump into maybe a more long-term partnership So, uh, there's a cool story about it. Um, this is like something I'm very like I said stubborn about like, um When I do a partnership I want to make sure my partner Makes money it's a win-win, but if it's going south they at least walk out of cash positive But there was this one time I did a very transactional partnership and it was a brilliant product with this developer from uh, you know, Eastern Europe, but don't exactly remember the country Latvia, I think but it was a brilliant product back in 2015 and We did a very transactional partnership, but it went south in a way. Um, It's a very long story, but I got blocked by facebook. I got a cnd season disease letter from facebook lawyers um, and the guy just uh took away with everything I was like, yeah, that that's just uh The first and last time I'm ever gonna be doing a partnership very, you know, it's a very transactional I'm just pushing away all my gut feeling and intuition just going after the money because Yeah, it just doesn't work out so well in the long term That's it. That's crazy and abby I would love to hear a story Around you know, kind of piggybacking off that a little bit, but you've mentioned You always want your partners to walk away cash positive even if you lose money and obviously, you know at facebook That's a whole different deal, but can you tell us a time where that's happened you and paid off in the long run? I mean that happens quite often. I would say so I'll give you a little example when we do product launch, especially on jb2 Um, so product launch model works In a way we go live on a specific day and then we have a lot of affiliates promoting us and we're doing we're doing like an opening Contest when we open the car for the first 24 hours for 40 48 hours We do a contest anybody who sends the most sales as a lead board top one top two top three so Um, often what happens like we sometimes we allow people to team up right so the two people can team up so they can Combine their gross sales and be higher on the later board Uh, there was this one time and and the rule about team up is like we need to be told about the team as vendors from the affiliate before That's fair once the car. Yeah, once the car contest starts. We don't allow that Um, so there was this one time Everything was fine. The contest was live. I had teamed everybody but I forgot the team two people so they were showing up Individuals in the contest, but they had told me early on that they wanted the team. It was my mistake Uh, where I messed up so I teamed them up a little bit later the moment I teamed them up They showed to number one and the guy was number one. He got his dog He was like listen, dude, this is not how it's gonna work because they he was like i'm winning $5,000 Down suddenly dropped to three thousand right and losing two thousand dollars just on the price money So I was like listen, it's my bad. It doesn't matter um It as long as you are on number two We'll pay you the same price as the price for the number one because it was not your fault. You saw it so what happens like that person and uh, that guy was he was Promoting us for the very first time. He was uh, he was a youtuber with uh reviewing the product and posting on it He had massive audience and then he went on to promote uh, at least three four other products of ours and the next 24 months bad We did about 150 180k revenue with him We gave him a lot of extra commissions and everything so yeah that that little two thousand extra that we spend help build a better relationship And kind of put us in a way where he thought that you know, we're more I think other more uh, Happy to pay out our partner as long as you know, it's a good business deal You know, this is a small world even though it's it's not right, but especially you get into these partnerships And people know who are the people like oh, you know, you got burned by them too Like the little things like that, especially, you know as an affiliate manager or anything else Screwy things happen that you didn't think of before I love to like team ups have to notify before like we've had this Ben like where we've had people be like, oh, yeah, no, we're working together like dude. No, you're not like you didn't tell us or whatever and uh But that's genius like you have to seriously take your partners And treat them like your customers Because it has to be like Pedro Adeo who's in our world like he's the challenge guy We were at a mastermind in mexico and he gave a whole presentation on these Partnerships and one of the things and I know other people have said this too, but this is really what it's stuck at Stuck it stood out to me is he says the formula for successful partnerships three things It's win win win, right? It's got to be a win for your partner It's got to be a win for you But ultimately how you know that it's a win and this is not monetary or anything else Is that it is a win for those customers, right? What are you bringing to the table? What are they bringing to the table? Everything else. Um, so is it different though? Like once you do like transactional or you do a launch Is that different than this long-term partnership with like a sass? Company like what are the differences and nuances that you have to pay attention to and how do you structure that? Right, so we we talk about a short-term partnership. I'll give you an example It's like a product launch drive you bring on a jv manager on board to partner up at the jv manager You split whatever you want to do. We usually do 40 60 depending on How much traffic or how many philias the jv manager could bring in? Or if I'm partnering in a way, I'm doing the marketing and somebody else is bringing on the product then We still do 60 40 I take 60 they take 40 Depending on how much sale I can bring in to the short-term launch but for the short-term we always do 60 40 for the first 60 days Is that because of refunds? No, so again for refunds. I'm very transparent and very open. I'm like, you know as long as there are refunds I will cover it It doesn't bother me But just just for the marketing just for the sale of the ad cost and everything We stop running campaign after 60 days unless it's like a really really profitable Sometimes products do really well sometimes don't do too well. So we keep a package of 60 days and that's about it But for long-term partnership, it's uh, it's right or right sort of a situation like, you know, if you partner up on a product and You are with the partner till we exit the product So, you know, everything's 50 50. We always do a 50 50 Partnership all expensive are shared together all of work is shared together We try and map out what each other's Responsibilities are which is very very critical because we don't want to be in a situation You know a year down the line where we're like, you know, you're not working, you know And I'm putting in more weightage and all that stuff we try and iron that out and we put that in agreements and Yeah, we we try and stick to that and again these kind of deal these kind of partnerships only work when you are actually Partnering with somebody you actually like somebody who likes your back somebody who understands how you move how you think what you what you're trying to catch or think Yeah, that's wild and even yeah from the listeners that we have and viewers who are brand new to affiliate marketing Would you and this is I'm about to take like two steps back. So I apologize in advance But even though over what it's like to be an affiliate versus a vendor and both so Affiliate essentially somebody who has an audience right and they're trying to monetize their audience right and you promote a specific product To your audience now the tricky part of the affiliate you have to always be honest and true to your audience You can't be promoting to random jump to your audience because you you could do it a couple of times You'll make money 100% but then you will lose them trust Yeah, and uh keeping your trust with the audience and making sure they like you they support your back That's the most critical thing when it comes to affiliate. I think biggest the uh Saying the biggest takeaway would be to do your research And only promote products where you know the the vendor the seller the product the area actually going to be Supporting the product for a long period of time They are actually delivering on the promises on the sales page on the funnel And the product actually works right and it's a good convert product like don't sell weight loss pills people were looking to you know Learn baseball Right your audience very close, but you know, you don't want to do that to be be very very niche focus It's very very important even in internet marketing niche if you're an mml or a bizop sort of niche Um, you'd think you know, I could I can just promote any sort of bizop offer or I can promote any sort of internet marketing Funnel builder sort of uh product you have to find what you are Talking about with your audience because that's why they are following you there They might be following 10 different people, but they're probably just following you because you talk about Funding building right and that's why they listen to you So the product that you recommend have to do something But would you teach them or will you talk to them about usually on parvally? um, and uh at the end of the day, I think it all goes down to Promoting products that actually benefit your Audience if you find a product that benefits the audience And is a good deal Keep promoting that as long as you can the audience are going to love the product They're going to love you back for promoting and recommending that and you'll make money That's simple that and Bob when we talk about winners That that's a completely different ball game because now You're you're building products, right? You're creating a software product or you're building you're creating a course Then you have to Take a wider view and you have to see Uh, what's the problem out there and how can I solve that problem? biggest problem biggest issue that I see with a lot of software creators, especially even course creators In our market right now I don't know I talk to a lot of people in the affiliate world something that happens in Dubai every year a lot of events happen in Dubai a lot of muscle mass people are trying to come up with solutions to problems that don't exist Right you're trying to solve a problem By creating problem It doesn't really exist But you're trying to solve it and then you are like struggling with coming up with the sales So the funnel the marketing the the ad copy the ad credit because the problem doesn't exist Right you're trying to solve something that people are not looking for a solution so sometimes you have to look for Uh problems that exist and find a unique Way of solving those problems Right if you if you can if you can't do that if you can't find a problem and you can actually find a good solution to it Um, you're golden the marketing is going to be super easy The sales company is going to be easy your BSL is going to be easy the funnel is going to be easy Everything's going to be easy because the problem exists people are actually asking For a solution and when you build that solution you've already done 50 percent of the work It's it's similar to what Henry Ford once said, you know Um, and I'm going to talk about this a little bit as well. Uh, when you ask people What do you want? They would say I want to foster hordes Because sometimes they don't know what they want, but the problem exists. They need something fast Right so a lot of people tell like, you know, you should survey your audience Sometimes the audience doesn't know what they want But if you can figure out the problem that they're going through you can come up with creative solutions And it could be like multiple solutions to the same problem, right? So it's not just like, you know Oh, my competitor already came out with a solution now you can come out with something better something different And yeah, if you do that you're all that You are also and jv zoo you're like Top three affiliate and then top vendor for like four or five years now Do you have any tips on things that maybe you're doing differently than other people that keep you like on that leaderboard? What differentiates you Yeah, so I think when it comes to when they're are creating product We we literally do what I just told you we look for problems And we try to come up with creative solution and then we also try to present the solution in the um in our marketing in the most Sensible that I'll give you a very very simple example of something we did in 2020. Um, we created the product where You could take these conversations like we have this podcast, right? You could upload this video software will extract the audio chop down the audio and Create the transcribe it create chapters and convert those chapters into sort of educational videos So we were like, okay, you know, you can repurpose your podcast or repurpose your youtube video And that sort of sounds good in a technical way But when you're trying to sell sell to a bizop or internet marketing audience that wasn't a very appealing idea So we were like, okay, we have the product and this is what the product literally does But let's repackage it in a way that makes sense to the audience So you're like, you know what? There's a product that lets you turn your knowledge Into a course that you can sell right? So if you have youtube videos or if you are just walking in the garden and recording recording audio on your phone You're gonna upload that and the software will convert that into video chapters that you can then Buy and create a video course and that clicked with the audience that we went out to do about like 1.2 1.3 million in about 18 months with that product So I think I think coming up with great solution Is is very very important. But then also Making sure your audience understands the use cases behind behind the solution, right? There's problem, but then they also need to understand what other use cases they can come up with And I think that's what we really focus on trying to come up with Use cases around the products that we create around the courses that we create that helps our resonate with the audience Based on what they're looking for that has helped us be uh Seller on the platform and again at the end of the day the goal is never to be the number one seller or number two seller Anything as long as we are building solutions that uh make money to our partners and our bringing results to our customers Those are the two things that we mostly fake with focus on and as long as those are balanced out sales coming Yeah, that's key. That's awesome Yeah, so what would you say about the awards that are over your shoulder there? I'd love to kind of hear about them and even you've mentioned some affiliate networks that you're involved with Could you take us through, you know, why you've chosen those affiliate networks and then uh, what type of recognition you've had with them? Yeah, so we right now exclusively work with jvzoo or to primarily reason number one Uh, laura is amazing. Uh, the CEO of jvzoo. Um, she was here. We did an event in january We invited a lot of vendors and affiliates into five. We had the massive event. She was the kino speaker. I love where she's amazing um and second biggest reason is jvzoo is the most compliant network when it comes to fcc compliance. I mean you're doing anything um in the internet market like When you're selling anything on that literally anything you have to be fcc compliant. Like there's no other way around it And uh, there are other networks that don't want to name them But they they're usually a little bit more casual about Uh, the products that are approved on them um jvzoo usually Goes through the copy the funnel. They try and make sure That the product and the marketing is compliant with fcc and that helps in two big reason number one It's it's a big thing For us because they are looking into the compliance for us and trying to point out the errors that we might have in our marketing That could get us in hot waters with fcc. So that saves us extra work. That's massive extra laura. That's huge. That's huge And yeah, um, especially now it's pure Those people just go like wing it right and then they figure out if they get slapped We had actually a few episodes back We had onyx singall on here and he told us his whole story And it's fascinating how he's pivoted to really lean into this. I think more and more marketers, especially Affiliates like you think you just throw it out there, but understand too if they're promoting your product That can kind of put you in on it. So that's that's a key point I want listeners to hear as well as like make sure you understand that the things that you were saying Even if you don't have somebody backing you up like I'll be saying what jvzoo, right? Make sure that you have the who can keep you compliant instead of making outlandish claims just so you can make a quick buck And because they will let you down and they will find you I think they're doing it. They're they really really at it. And that's why that's what I think I think shipped it as an entire Focus from all the other things and courses he was sending to just fcc and being teaching people about fcc compliant and uh huge niche Yeah, and I think that's what jvzoo is really um really good at and being standing out and they they they're very strict about it and that kind of he Can sometimes feel a little bit of a pain to deal with because like, you know, uh Like I just got the whole she explained funnel and video shot now. You're telling me, you know those I can't say that Bad. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah It's such a pain like sometimes like I remember uh, we were really short on one of the launches the vsl was ready and then they were like Yeah, you know, you can't say that We have to go back and reshoot it But but it helped in a long run. You know, even even see what we're not at a us base. We're we're based in jubilee We're based in ua e sir In certain ways fcc doesn't really apply to us but when you look at the long-term picture if we exit when we exit and We sell to a buyer that is a us based company They would get into trouble. So we want to be make be sure that you know, we're going to be compliant To fcc we're compliant to gdpr. We're compliant to all these different You know legal entities And it's it's it's it's it's just better marketing, you know, it's cleaner marketing and uh, a lot of people are like, you know We you get to fcc compliance The the whole direct response the whole marketing goes away. It's just not gonna sell off Do it it's out It does you just do it a different way, right people and the consumer sophisticated too like a lot of times They're tired of hearing like the cheat easy wins and it makes them skeptical and so when you become compliant Like it's it's almost like growing up in business. You're more mature and people can see through that and and and you're more established for sure No customers are a lot smarter than they were, you know, a decade ago uh, sure and they definitely see through The kind of language in the tone and the copy and it can be a turnip actually so We've been compliant and we've never seen a drop in conversion Be it warm traffic through affiliates or cold traffic with ads. So uh, yeah, jbz is rather those networks that really looks after those sort of things And that saves us a lot of money. We we don't have to have a lawyer looking at things all all the time And uh, yeah, there's the voice that we have at the back. I just uh, would be top in the in the platform our revenue-wise Congratulations to them. That's awesome. Yeah, that's very admirable especially for such a big platform like jbzoo um, you know in A question for our audience because we have a lot of people who listeners and watchers click follows users who are looking to Get their you know first couple of Sales online right get started and if you guys can hear that music behind me, sorry russel brunson's going on stage right now I don't know if that's coming through my audio or not, but um For someone who's just getting started. Would you recommend them taking the path of being an affiliate or a vendor and why? Okay, so again, it entirely depends on what they want to do If you have an audience The best thing to do is do you start as an affiliate start promoting products that resonate better with your audience because what that will do That will give you instant Uh, you know recognition with other affiliates and other vendors you would be known in the market You won't be some new be walking in it but If you want to if you have a product and you want to launch that product first and you don't have an audience the The best thing would be to find a partner somebody who has done good launches has a good track record And can get affiliates on board. So you bring in the product they do the marketing you guys go 50 50 each way What that will do that will establish you in the market You will be known when somebody When to fully spread your launch and it does well, they will know you say you're prepping yourself up to do solo launches without partners in the future Um, but you make sales if you build an email list then you can go ahead and stop promoting other products That are more congruent to you as an affiliate as well Hmm, very cool and even for you tell us about You know, what's next for you? Do you have any product launches down the line? Are you looking to promote things? What's uh, what's your up in the morning? What gets you what gets you excited? What are you working on now? Um, we'll get you up in the morning. I'm poor. I need money and greedy Typical It's a funny conversation Last month I was invited to attend an event in New Delhi, India by a friend of mine, Clark the Grimani who um I run this massive massive events. They were like 2,500 people there And and I got there and one of these guys walks up to me It's like I follow you on instagram tell me what would you know, we'll get you excited What's the key to success? I was like, see that fucking don't know. I'm just greedy. I need a lot of money. I have extensive taste Yeah, I have expensive taste that that's this thing, you know that there's there's really no guru mantra You gotta feed the habit. I eat the taste. Yeah. Yeah, but I guess I guess At one point it struggled with being motivated when I say motivated, you know, you you get up in the morning And you're not excited to be on the desk. You're not excited to do what you usually do because things get monotonous and I try a lot of things. I I guess things that usually help me the best is Uh time blocking my day where I try to do things that are more fun More exciting for me in the first couple of hours when I'm in the office all the by all boring things. I try and do Uh brainstorming or building product ideas or doing calls to the team because that's what I like to do but if you try and time block uh Because once you start your day with things that you like your body will do that all my thing the Whatever that happy hormone is called dopamine Dopamine and you you get in that the focus right and once you're in the focus you can get through the boring part That's a great. So if you if you time block if you time block start with a good thing get dopamine running and then you uh, you know go through the boring thing and then um, there's this one uh thing that somebody told me When I was really really young was never be afraid to work Um, and that's something I think by it like it doesn't matter What happened you get up you show up at all day every day all the time I remember when we were doing the event in Dubai in January um Just just a day before the event something happened I got a bug in my eye and I couldn't open it. I'm like fuck. I got an event Uh tomorrow and Laura was speaking on the stage that day and uh, I was like, okay, doesn't matter I'll show up. I'll be there and Laura was on the stage David was doing the my I was sitting in the back with an IV of my nerve sitting like this I was like, yeah, I have to show up and then in the evening we had we had a cocktail party Everybody went for drinks and then right after the cocktail had the doctors come up give me another dish You just to make sure we channelize things are still there like Sometimes you have you have to be stubborn with yourself and you have to you know, you have to show up and Be there get things done no matter how It's not for boring and monotonous things to get That's the pathway to whatever you're trying to achieve Right, it's it's not sure it's not simple You have to keep at it as long as you're stubborn about it. You'll get what you want I think that's a great mic drop too is I think Perseverance and hard work You don't know where that goes sometimes, but if you show up for yourself and your audience like every single day Your goals happen But it is sometimes monotonous. Sometimes it's difficult. Sometimes it's hard to keep going And so I think that's a great a great way to end this too.
