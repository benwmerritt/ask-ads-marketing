Hi, this is Alrick from Ad Outreach and I wanted to record my video for ClickFunnels and the 2, Club X Award which I am so excited to receive. It has been an absolutely incredible journey that I've had with ClickFunnels and what I wanted to do is just tell a little bit about that story. Today what I do with Ad Outreach is I help businesses, especially online businesses, coaches, consultants, course creators use YouTube video ads to get consistent leads and sales. We have a program that works hands-on to help them learn how to use YouTube ads and then we also have a team of trainers that will train their team or them on how to use those YouTube ads to scale up long-term. We also do omnipresent retargeting as well. So we've really built this incredible business and what I want to say is how transformational and pivotal ClickFunnels has been in that process. So I remember about 12 years ago I started my first business, my YouTube channel AppFind. I was reviewing mobile apps, technology tutorials and it really started to take off. Lots of people started watching it. It started getting millions and millions of views, hundreds of thousands of subscribers. So I started running YouTube ads. This was back in the early days before really not that many people were running YouTube ads back then which is kind of funny. And so I started working with several different apps as agencies but I remember the time that things changed and really started to grow and that pivotal moment was back in 2016. I went to HubSpot Inbound and I saw ClickFunnels, the ClickFunnels booth there at the conference. I remember talking whether it was with Dave or whoever it was at the booth and just saying you know I had this business, here's what I've grown, it's online business, you know I'd heard a little bit about ClickFunnels but I wasn't in it yet. Can I build a funnel for this business? And they said absolutely. I signed up, created my ClickFunnels account and I created a funnel and at the time I was helping app developers use YouTube ads to get mobile app downloads and so I started to build a funnel for that. I used the perfect webinar, went through that whole process and we started to get clients you know from YouTube ad to webinar to then these app developer clients I was running YouTube ads for. But I knew I wanted to go even further right and that was working really well, it was fantastic to have the funnel but then by being part of the ClickFunnels community people started to say hey how are you doing that? How are you using YouTube ads to get leads and sales from your funnel to get high ticket sales through your funnel? And so what I realized is it wasn't how I helped apps that was my secret sauce, it was the YouTube ads themselves. And so then I built an entire program around YouTube ads and many ClickFunnels members, many 2, 2, Club X members use YouTube ads to get consistent leads and sales for their businesses. It has just been a fantastic journey. It was just a little over a year ago that I earned my 2, Club Award and now I'm getting the 2, Club X Award and so I really appreciate obviously Russell, the entire ClickFunnels team. It has been absolutely fantastic to be able to go in there and build a business with the software. I am so excited for where I'm going to go in the future, where ClickFunnels is going to go in the future, just want to say thank you so much and I'm excited for this award but this is just a milestone on the journey of where we're going from here. There's big things so very excited. Thank you so much.
