## Transcript
Hey there, Alex Sonski here, and this is my two comic club story. I'm the owner and founder of Prospecting on Demand, an online mentorship program for agency owners, coaches, and consultants to scale from a six to seven-figure business that's an asset, not a pin in the ass, using the seven key systems for scaling. That's what we're all about. Now, before ClickFunnels, most of my sales were in a one model, either through B&I or an online Facebook group's similar to ClickFunnels. And then ultimately, we started to realize we didn't have the right structure, not only for the program, but also for pre-qualification, for our testimonials to kind of prove what we do. So what we wanted to do was change from a model that was kind of haphazard, random systems and processes, especially when we're coaching that, and start to create a more cohesive model. We created a really successful marketing agency, and trying to coach for that marketing agency, we realized we didn't have some necessary components that, frankly, ClickFunnels provided, which we are super, super grateful for. It actually allowed us to grow the business in a much more efficient way. I'm an impactor and entrepreneur, and I felt that the ClickFunnels community was exactly the same, and it really, really helped. Ultimately, I was allowed myself and my wife, who I work with as my business partner, Sharers Linsky, to grow this business to a place where we want to, without feeling the pressure of always needing that next sale or next opportunity, because we know ClickFunnels team has our back and we've got a model in place, and everybody needs to make sales to grow, and that's pretty absolutely fantastic, and something I'm super grateful for. In terms of whether or not you should join ClickFunnels, or considering joining their coaching programs, I'd strongly advise it. It's an incredible tool that really allows you to synthesize everything in your business, funnel it down into a simple spot. You see the plan, the plan words I did there, and ultimately have a singular process for everything to be actually focused in one area instead of 400 different tools. I cannot recommend ClickFunnels enough. I'm eternally grateful to the team and so excited to be a part of the two-comic club. If you're thinking about it, get after it, and I'll see you on the next one.
