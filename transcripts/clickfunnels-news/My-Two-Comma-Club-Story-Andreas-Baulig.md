## Transcript
Hi, I'm Andres Bollig, I'm the founder of Bollig Consulting. I'm currently the employer of 40 consultants and coaches that help people to get more leads, increase their revenue in the German speaking market. And we discovered ClickFunnels a while ago, several years ago, and we've been using it ever since. As you can see, we've been using ClickFunnels for a while now. We already got several 2,5 awards for various projects. And in this instance, we created a referral system that enabled us to get our current customer base on a specific funnel page and give us referrals for our programs and our consulting services. Setting up the referral system with ClickFunnels was super easy for us and we are recommending ClickFunnels also to all of our clients. So basically, we alone are managing at least 50 other projects that are also using ClickFunnels. So I can absolutely recommend that you guys get ClickFunnels. It's amazing.
