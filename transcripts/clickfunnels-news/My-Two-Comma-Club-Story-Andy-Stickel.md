My name is Andy Stickle and this is my two comma club story. So I own a marketing agency where I help lawyers grow their law firms and we work with all types of attorneys, everything from personal injury to criminal offense to family law to bankruptcy. Before ClickFunnels, we really just didn't have a centralized hub to really run our marketing from. We didn't do any lead magnus. We didn't do any cheat sheets. We didn't do any of that type of stuff. And really our marketing was mostly cold calling, which really anyone who's done cold calling knows it absolutely is a terrible job. I really started kind of embracing the lead magnet structure and a lot of the different funnel types that Russell talks about in dot com secrets and then also in expert secrets. And once I started implementing those funnels and those types of strategies, my business just absolutely took off like a rocket. Ultimately, the reason that I jumped in and tried ClickFunnels was because it was recommended to me. I had tried lead pages before I tried to unbounce and I really didn't have great results with them. I talked to somebody else who was like, well, you got to try ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is so much better because it's not just a landing page creator. There's a community behind it. There's lots and lots and lots of training that goes along with it. And honestly, the training and the community is what really makes ClickFunnels just absolutely amazing. Why I'll never go anywhere else. It's because of all the support that is given to you with ClickFunnels. It's what ClickFunnels allows you to do and what Russell's coaching and marketing allows you to do is it actually makes it that people actually want to hire you. There's so much goodwill built up as a result of using ClickFunnels to get them and provide value first, rather than just pick up the phone and cold call, that it's so easy to get people to hire us. I really wanted to have a stable, predictable flow of leads so that I could take care of my employees, that I could predictably hire employees so that I, you know, my family could move into a bigger house that actually, you know, fit us all. So after using ClickFunnels, as a result, we now have a marketing system in place that allows us to buy ads, do partnerships with people and everything. We can send all of our traffic to our funnels and then the funnels go to work. They get the email addresses and they do all that type of stuff. And we just have a constant flow of leads coming in. We never have to worry about gathering their email addresses or anything like that. Cause all that gets done automatically through the funnel. That allows my business to grow exponentially. And that has not only changed my life, it's changed my family's life and it's changed my employees life too. Cause I can also pay them more money. I can hire more people. The cool thing is, is that I've got so much business and I'm able to hire people that I only work four days a week. I would not be where I am without ClickFunnels. If you're on the fence and you're trying to figure out, should I sign up for ClickFunnels? Should I do this one funnel away challenge? Yes, absolutely. 100% do it. You have to do it. It will change your life. It's changed my life.
