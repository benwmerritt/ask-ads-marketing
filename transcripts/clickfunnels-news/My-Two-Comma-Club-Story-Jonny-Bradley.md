Hi, my name is Johnny Bradley and this is my 2, Club Story. I run a education business and it's really focused on e-commerce. I teach people how to start their own e-commerce brand and how to launch it on Amazon and to be hopefully very successful doing it. I've been doing this for a few years now, but before ClickFunnels, I worked at Apple for a very substantial amount of time and that's why I learned a lot of the skills that I have then brought over into educating people into e-commerce and creating products that hopefully can change people's lives. The thing that actually pushed me over the edge to becoming a proper entrepreneur, a self-employed entrepreneur, is that I was working a job that I actually really did not like. I was commuting three hours a day, being treated like a number and it was slowly just grinding me down to the point where I really could not continue to do that anymore. That's when I went on a holiday and I read a few books, one of them being Expert Secrets and I decided at that point that I was going to change my life. Before I started using ClickFunnels, I was using two things. I was using Wix, so I was just using a normal website builder and I was using Teachable, which is where I host my training. The problem is that both Wix and Teachable, they're not made to convert. One of the big issues I found with Teachable is that you couldn't put a purchase pixel on the thank you page, which is obviously terrible if you're running ads, which I was. So I was trying to figure out another solution for this and the solution was ClickFunnels. By doing that and using integrations like Zapier, I was able to take my existing business, which was using Wix, using Teachable and integrating with ClickFunnels very, very easily. In fact, it was a lot easier than I thought it would be and to be honest, I wish I'd done it sooner because I thought it was going to be harder than it was. That allowed me to properly monitor my sales process, to properly monitor my advertising spend and the return investment I was getting, which if anyone runs ads, we'll know that's incredibly important. For me, I just wanted an easy way to run my business. I wanted a website that could work. It could do exactly what I needed it to do. It just allowed me to have a better overview of my business and be able to focus on actually what matters is creating really good content, is delivering and fulfilling what I've promised people, what I promised my customers and not have to worry so much about the individual bits in my website that may potentially go wrong or maybe aligned correctly on the wrong mobile or desktop version. It allowed me to simplify and focus on what I do best. For me, ClickFunnels has not just been about the tool that we use. It's more about the community. It's about the ethos. It's about the books, about the education and it's not just a website builder. It has allowed me to do incredible things. I'm sitting here talking to you from my office, in my house. I work from home. I'm able to do really, really lovely things. Just last year, I took my dad on his 70th birthday and I took us all to Italy and had a really fantastic time. All expenses paid. I would never have been able to do that. At all, unless I had gone down this path and gone down this journey. It's not just the ClickFunnels tool that was able to allow me to do that. It was the whole thing. It was being part of the community. It was being part of the Facebook group. Reading the books, consuming them, underlining them and really getting into this space. My life has changed dramatically in the last three years and I certainly wouldn't have been able to predict where I'd be right now. If I look forward to the next two or three years, I have no idea where I'm going to be in the next two or three years, hopefully in an even better position than I am today. What would I say to someone who's thinking about joining the 2.0 Club X coaching program or signing up for ClickFunnels? I would say that the first thing you need to do is really focus on the customer. I think many people make mistakes in business and they fail to see things from the customer's perspective. I think empathy is something that you really need as a business owner, having true empathy for your customers. I think that's the first thing. Once you understand your customers, you can really deliver the complete solution to them and using ClickFunnels and using coaching is going to be a great way to springboard that success. Use the knowledge within the community. Use the tools that you have available to you because they work. A lot can change very fast as soon as you start giving attention to it. If it's you and you're sitting on the edge, just do it. Go all in. Jump in with both feet and make it work. Entrepreneurship is hard. Lonely can be stressful. The rewards really outweigh the risks. Become part of the community. Use the tools and services that work for so many others and just take action and get it done. Finally, I'd just like to say thank you to ClickFunnels to the entire team for all the people in the support for everyone that is there creating the content, creating the training. It's been influential in my success. Thank you very much.
