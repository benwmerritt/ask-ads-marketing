Hi, my name is Jordan Edwards and this is my two comic-up story. I help businesses build out the technology around their marketing systems, essentially help them scale through dashboards and all the different things that they need to continue to see the big picture as they're scaling up. So before ClickFunnels, I was in university studying business management and one of the things I noticed was that I didn't really feel like I was ahead of technology at that time, like where we were at in the world. I felt like I was learning about things from the 90s in 2013. On top of that, I didn't feel like I was surrounded by the right people and it was funny this one time I was sitting in my dorm kitchen and I was with, you know, a bunch of other business students and I remember sitting there trying to figure out a business plan for a business that I was trying to start up, this a waste removal business, right? And I was going through it, sat there on the laptop for like two hours and I remember two of my buddies from my classes came in and they had beers in their hands. They were like, hey, what are you up to? I was like, oh, I'm just trying to start a business, figuring out a business plan. They both looked at each other and they started laughing and they were like, what are you doing that for? And instantly, boom, I realized, you know, I weren't in the right place. And at the time, early 2014, I was just leaving uni. I already realized I wanted to leave and I was trying to figure out like how people make money online. I was kind of like learning about affiliate marketing at that time, understanding the basics of like MLMs and online advertising. And by the end of that year, when ClickFunnels was actually launching, it was like this perfect synergy of like, I stumbled upon Russell right as I was learning this stuff and he just accelerated things and boom, my knowledge just went through the roof. My understanding of how everything worked. And then he launched ClickFunnels. One of the things I learned early on was that, you know, you don't watch what people say they do, you watch what people actually do. And one of the things I was looking for when I found Russell, and when I joined ClickFunnels was I was looking for someone who was doing the things they were teaching. And that was super clear to me. Like I was going through Russell's content and everything that was being said was actually being done. It was literally like Russell was showing you how the bread was made. It was like he was making the bread and showing you how he was doing it at the same time. And what that meant to me was I was following someone who was laying out the tracks behind them and I was able to follow and I could see exactly what we were doing a couple tracks up ahead. I was just following along. The main problem before I joined ClickFunnels was that, you know, I didn't really know how to program. I didn't know how to code. I couldn't build these systems out on my own. I had to have, you know, help. I was new and I realized that if I wanted to get results really quickly, I needed a tool and ClickFunnels came along with perfect time. Like I needed something that was going to help me skip the learning curve. And it wouldn't have happened if I didn't stay patient and get through a bunch of different stumbling blocks that for a long time stopped me from achieving my goals. One of them was that I didn't really have a product that I was really passionate about. I was launching these things like half-heartedly. It was like as soon as things got tough, I'd be like, you know what, let's just move on to the next thing. Then I started like teaching marketing to other people and trying to give the knowledge I had learned over the years to other people. And what I found throughout that process was that maybe I don't have a product right now, but maybe someone else does and I can actually help them grow their business. Like I can take the passion that they have for their business and help them grow through that passion, kind of get like that second hand love for the business that I didn't have for a business of my own. And all of that led up to working with Honey Badger Boost and the team over at 9 University. Over the last two years, we built out this crazy monster of a company, you know, and a lot of that was down to being able to quickly build things out in ClickFunnels. You know, if you want email setup, boom, it's already in there. You can just plug a couple of things in. It's done. You have an idea yesterday. It's built today. It's launched tomorrow. Like you can literally get your ideas out like that. And one of the best parts about all of this is that when it like pops, everything feels buttery smooth. It's like, yeah, it's crazy. Well, that's done for my family is that it's allowed us to realize that we can really build out whatever life we want. We can do things the way we decide if we're willing to be patient enough, we're willing to put in hard work, you know, anything is possible. My girlfriend, even she started up her own Etsy stores, all these marketing tips that are pouring out of the ClickFunnels community, they apply everywhere in all walks of life, especially in business. It's mind blown. Anyone who is thinking about joining ClickFunnels or anything to do with Russell and his team, you need to do it like right now. You need to go, you need to make that decision right now. You need to go through the training. You need to go through anything. Do anything these guys tell you, because I promise you they have your best intention in the heart. They're genuinely coming from a place of trying to give back to the world. Now that's honestly what I feel when I'm inside the ClickFunnels community.
