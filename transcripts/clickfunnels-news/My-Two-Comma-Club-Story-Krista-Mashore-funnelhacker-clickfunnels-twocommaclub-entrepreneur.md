## Transcript
Hi, I'm Kristen Meyser, CEO of Kristen Meyser Coaching, and this is my two Plumble Club X story. I'm a coaching company and I actually teach real estate agents for across the country how to utilize video and social media to be what I call community market meters. I used to be a teacher at top third grade for six years. I love, love, love teaching people and it was so great teaching young kids, but you know, there's a lot, a lot of money in it, right? So my daughter got really sick and so I decided to leave, be a teacher and go into real estate. And so for 17 years, I grinded like crazy as a real estate agent. No time, phone rings constantly, working 70 hour weeks, zero freedom whatsoever. Yes, I had the money, but I didn't have a life. That was my life pretty much before ClickFunnels. Now I'm making 12 times more than I was making as a real estate agent, but I have my life back. I have freedom, I have workshop with my family. ClickFunnels has helped me be able to do that, but not only that, I'm able to serve houses of people and get my message out there. I'm able to positively affect other people's lives, make a difference in their lives. We've helped people become millionaires now and none of that could have ever been done except ClickFunnels, but most importantly, like ClickFunnels gave me my life back. I don't have to work like I did before.
