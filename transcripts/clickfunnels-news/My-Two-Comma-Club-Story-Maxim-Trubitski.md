## Transcript
Hi, my name is Maxim Trivitsky and this is my two comma club store. So I'm 18 years old. I started e-commerce Shopify when I was 15 years old. And since then I've built many successful e-commerce Shopify brands. And then I've also within the last year and a half started developing a coaching consulting business where I also help aspiring entrepreneurs get started selling physical products on Shopify. And before ClickFunnels I can basically say I had no consulting business. I had some free time. A lot of my Shopify stores were automated. So I started offering my mentorship, my consulting. I started building a course to allow other people who were in the same position as me get started selling physical products online and build Shopify brands and just scale them, work with influencers because that's a lot of fun. And I started trying to sell my coaching by running advertisements somehow through Shopify. But then when my friends told me about ClickFunnels it was a complete game changer because there's no other software like ClickFunnels that allows you to basically generate leads, store them, use the integrations to follow up with them, to set up applications the right way, take them on different paths, show them different upsells, show them different downsells. There's just no other software like ClickFunnels that allows you to set that up and just get clients online. You know, I was just starting out in coaching. I had no clue what type of business models, what type of system I should create and ClickFunnels that make it super clear for you even when I started coaching. It's about 16, 17 years old. I was able to just figure it out, put the pages together, start offering my services. ClickFunnels makes it so easy for you. And this result basically changed my entire life. And I was able to travel the world at 18 years old. Anyone who is thinking about joining the two comma club ex coaching or signing up for ClickFunnels in general, I will tell them there is literally nothing to lose and everything to gain. You can build a business, you can gain cash flow, you can maximize your profits on anything you're selling. It's the best software you can possibly use. Thank you again.
