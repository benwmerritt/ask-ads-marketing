Hey, what's going on guys? Robert E. Blanchard here and this is my two comma club story. So prior to having an online business and running a commission hero, which is a course that helps a lot of people learn how to do affiliate marketing, make money online, just four short years ago, I was a struggling gym owner and I didn't have an online business at all. I had zero experience when it came to running an online business. I just personal trained clients and that's what I did to make a living. And so four years ago, I was at a point in my life where I decided, do I want to pay for groceries or I do I want to pay the bills? And that was a tough point in my life. And so what happened was I learned to finally go online. So I was able to run Facebook ads for my gym, which really changed my gym and made it from a, you know, kind of just a non successful gym to a really successful gym, just through Facebook marketing. And then what happened there was I started to go online in my business because I knew that if I wanted to grow my business, if I want to take things to the next level, then I had to go online. ClickFunnels has been a big part of that journey and even more so this year because I just launched my commission hero course and we have over a thousand members in the course and one of the best things about it, one of the most rewarding things about it is being able to help people who have no experience at whatsoever online to help them have success, have their first sale online, their first hundred all day, even their first thousand dollar day using what I teach them in the course. And so ClickFunnels has been a huge, huge part of this success, you know, of commission hero and everything I've been able to do, mainly because it's such an easy platform to use. So the thing that I love about ClickFunnels personally is being able to use the platform to create pages, you know, within a couple hours, being able to split test stuff, having the membership site, having the back end systems in place as well. I mean, pretty much our whole business runs on ClickFunnels, which is a huge, huge benefit. I've been a ClickFunnels member for three, four years now. And just to see the platform grow, it's super fast now, it's easy to use, the support is great. So that's one of the biggest things that I love about ClickFunnels. So with all the success I've had as an affiliate, it's obviously changed my life quite a bit because, you know, like I said, four short years ago, I was just a struggling gym owner. I did not have an online business whatsoever. And now I'm able to, you know, obviously travel the world, I'm able to do things that I love to do. I'm able to spend more time with friends and family, I'm able to golf more because golf is one of my favorite things in the world to do. So I'm able to do that. I think the biggest thing for me is being able to help other people out, but otherwise would not be able to help out. So the reason why I became a gym owner was because obviously I wanted to help people lose weight and get in shape. And now with Commission Hero, I'm helping out people, you know, make more money online, which is obviously going to impact their lives. If you were to ask me, what would I say to somebody that's thinking about joining ClickFunnels or the two comma club or whatever, or how do I get to the two comma club, just jump and join ClickFunnels. I mean, one of the things that I tell everybody in my course is that they need to use ClickFunnels because it's the easiest platform to use. It's the most user friendly thing. It's, and it just works, right? You can split test things faster. It's just a really, really great platform to use. You're going to get there guys. I mean, literally, if I can do it, just being, you know, struggling gym owner with literally no marketing experience, then you can definitely do it too. You have to be consistent. You have to work hard and you have to really have a product or service that's going to make an impact in other people's lives because I'm a big believer that in order to get what you want, you have to help other people get what they want. And so that would be my biggest advice when it comes to getting to that two comma club level.
