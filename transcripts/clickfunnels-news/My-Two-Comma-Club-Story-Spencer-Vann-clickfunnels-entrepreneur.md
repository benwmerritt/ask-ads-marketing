Hey, this is Spencer Van and this is my 2, comma, club story. So it all started out when I was just 15 years old. At the time, my life was basketball. I literally would wake up every morning, play basketball, go to school, have basketball practice, lift, and then play more basketball. That was it. And maybe do homework if my mom was lucky that day. What happened when I was 15 is I shattered my ankle. I broke it in six places. If you're squeamish, don't look, but here's a quick picture of what it looked like. It was very, very, very brutal. And so obviously looking down and seeing my ankle in two different zip codes at the same time did not build my confidence of me being able to play college basketball and being in the NBA. And so I realized at that moment I needed to figure out something else to do. And so I started getting involved in real estate. In fact, here's me at a local real estate meetup. And one of those real estate clubs I joined was run by a real estate investor by the name of David Church. I first stumbled across these guys when I was about 17. I sent them an email asking if it was okay if I came to join their real estate group, even though I didn't really know anything about real estate at the time and I was just learning. And David replied literally within five minutes and said, yes, we'd love to have you, your story is inspiring that you're in high school and da-da-da. Everybody was just freaking out that there was some 17 year old high school kid. Like what is this kid doing here? It was awesome because David as the leader of the group really welcomed me to the group and gave me a lot of opportunities. Later that year I actually worked for him doing construction. And then later on after that we started doing real estate deals together as I got older. We did wholesale deals together, surplus fund deals. And we really started building that working relationship. So fast forward to October of 2017. I realized that like my dream has always been to own and operate a massive company that really makes a big difference in the world. And so because of that and because of the expert secrets book I had read because of a couple of people that really inspired me that I had met that had really successful online businesses, I decided I want to do that too. I went ahead and I called David and we sat down and I pitched him this idea. I said, look, what if we created a business where we taught people how to do surplus fund? First he was like, I don't know. No one's really doing that. Maybe we should just do wholesale because that's what everyone was doing. I said, trust me, man, that's going to be a huge blow ocean. No one else is doing it. No one even knows that stuff exists. Like we will be the only people on the planet that teach this. And so after a little convincing, he joined and we became 50-50 business partners and started a company called surplus list. We built out our first training teaching people how to do surplus funds only in California back in the day. Then we built a little hour and a half webinar presentation because we wanted people to join our movement. And so we spent about maybe $500 on marketing in November of 2017 and we did our first live webinar. I remember hearing Russell talk about, yeah, you can go on there. You know, you're going to close 30%. You're going to make $25,000 and it's going to be crazy. And I was so excited about that. I knew it wasn't going to make $25,000 my first one, but I was looking at the numbers and I'm like, dude, we could make $5,000, $10,000 on this first webinar. It'd be amazing. When we go on there, we had 100 people on live and we got zero sales. And then I said, well, you know, it's our first one. Let's tweak some things. And so we tweaked some things. We took, you know, December off or Christmas to really fix things, update the course a little bit and all that. And then first week of January, 2018, we launched it again. We did another live webinar, spent another 500 bucks and zero sales again. Man, I just spent 100 hours per webinar building this thing, studying webinar, studying it over and practicing over and over and over and over and over again. And I've just wasted like a month and a half of my life. What the heck? And we did this every single week, week after week after week, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours spent working on our webinar, working on our product, working on our marketing, networking and working with other people, trying to build out the best possible culture and products and everything that we can build to get people inspired to want to do cerebral stunts. It's a thing we care about so much. We did this for 17 weeks in a row without making any money, $0. In fact, we actually lost on average about $300 to $400 a week for 17 weeks. And I remember laying in bed after that 17th webinar and just really being upset and sad and wondering what I've been doing wrong and not understanding what all these other people that are finding success with this, what they're doing differently. And I kept thinking in my head that same phrase over and over again, you're one funnel away, you're one funnel away, you're one funnel away. And all of a sudden, like a light switch just flicked on in my brain. I said, I'm not one funnel away, I'm one action away. I'm one action away from getting our first sales, from getting our first student, from having our first success story. And sure enough, we ended up doing that 18th webinar. We literally stopped the marketing because we were literally going to end the business. We're like, it's not working. Last minute, we decided to do it anyways. We had three people on live and we made a couple of tweaks to the webinar and we closed two of those three people on live. We're 17 webinars with zero sales and obviously we've won our first two comma club award. But much more importantly than that is the massive impact that we've been able to have on the world and on society. Over 15 million people have seen our YouTube ads and even more amazing than that is through all of our students and the deals that they've closed helping recover money for people. We estimate we've recovered over $25 million for families all across the United States, which is absolutely amazing. I'm going to take a second to thank all of you guys out there who've helped make this possible because as I told you guys, my big dream is to go out there and build a company that really makes a difference and without you guys, it would not be possible. So I want to take a quick second here. I want to say thank you to Russell Brunson, Todd and everybody over at ClickFunnels and understand that if you have the opportunity to work with Russell Brunson and work with his team of coaches and amazing markers that have over there at ClickFunnels, you would be absolutely ridiculous not to take that opportunity. But I am saying that for someone, if you're interested, if you are like, I want to be an entrepreneur, this is what I want to do to not take up Russell on a 2, Club X coaching offer, to not take them up on ClickFunnels, to not take them up on all these things, you are shooting yourself in the foot. It's time to step up.
