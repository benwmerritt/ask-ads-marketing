What is your look for? Let's roll the intro against our heads. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Music Welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are here in the ballroom at Funnel Hacking Live. And literally, you see how many people are out there at the event. They're putting stuff up on the chairs. They're getting all prepped and ready for the next session. And the fun part is there's so much exciting news in the comments. I'm gonna snap to it. We've been waiting forever to talk about this. But before we take the ball, say, first thing you have to happen is, so what we can tell you about right now is the beginning of this. Before we get into that, make sure that you guys are subscribed to the text messages, 208-231-3797, text FHTV, and we will send a text when we go by if you don't have anything. There's some major news that was dropped today. So we want to make sure you guys know everything. Make sure you subscribe to the content. Okay, so I'm gonna do a quick recap of, like, most of the stuff. Before we do the recap, should we show the video that they recap this morning? Should we show the recap video? Let's show the video. Yeah, let's show the video. Cool. Who are the most excited, the most passionate, the ones who were willing to leave everything to come here and be part of this, because you have a dream. We'll be here one day. We'll be here one day. Thank you, thank you. My goal is to help you give you the tools and the assets that you need to make those dreams become a reality. That's what we do here at Funnel Hacking Live. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! This is a rock concert for entrepreneurs. Are you guys all right with that? Yeah! I say take ownership. Take ownership of your mission. Take ownership of your job. Take ownership of your finances. Take ownership of your future. Take ownership of your life. Yeah! What's that? Okay, so when everybody came in this morning, that is the video they got to see recapping all the previous day. Like, that was just a half day. And everyone was already like, oh my gosh, that was like drinking from a water hose. We guys watched last night. We talked to different people who were part of this from a little bit of a trickle-cation. And they were talking about how crazy it was. They missed it. Go check it out on the footmills page. There was so much happening. And you can see the background. Everything's changing. They're doing tests right now because today is award ceremony day. And the sun is so cool. We awesome. Okay, all right, so I'm gonna tell you about what happened. Sit back and you'll see the morning's pattern. And then maybe every single speaker is hitting the mark. It just delivers the cream. So we're continuing down the Lynchman path. The teaching like parts of Lynchman. A speaker will come out and dive into like how are they actually doing for the business. So we're gonna talk about continuity. Continuity. And so naturally we have student clarion come out. He dropped the bomb on how to go and say like, didn't see what we're missing. And it should be like. Have three of us. I'm gonna go back to the back. This is like three years. This is where he stayed in the partnership. He gave everybody that secret. And then we had the first half. And then the next people was Garrett J. White. Like he wasn't doing anything. You want to talk about it? Oh yes, I watched this. Okay, so Garrett came out. It's interesting to see like, I'm not doing my normal just like we're teaching you business stuff. So when we had to talk about how he's able to take a first time machine interview stuff coming to the field of work. I mean, that helps guys. And so he's like gave out some really cool stuff. This is what Russell was freaking out about. This is how we run your program as a facilitated program. It helps people take action better than watching the force. Better than hiring a whole bunch of coaches and trying to train as many youths. Facilitated is what works. Like I'm five or six thousand people on a two day training. Like this is how I do it. And I'm here. It's happening. So this is the process that he taught us all how to do business. Because everyone only has like 20 minutes and they're jam-hacking like the fairly best of the best. Like this is choose your route. Here's everything you need for it. But the next piece it is. It's super beautiful. And we got more Russell. We're right. We all named him. He's gonna talk a lot. We got more Russell. And then the next non-Russell speaker was Dan Pleisch. Yes. Dan is all about like his people. Really deep runs of agency that helps people go and do this. Next people to the big influencers. He came out on stage and just like he came out to actually hire an agency to go and do it. How to start doing it on time. What's the rules for that? Yeah. You can do it. And then he was after that. He actually took a joke. He took a joke. He went out. She went for the second. Third time being a presenter at Michelle. The second time on the main stage. And she killed it. Killed it. She shared her framework for how to book TVs. Which Al's being like, she said, smoothie, I love that word. And without like having to send gifts then like work your way up that relationship. But she has a science config, not scientific proven, statistically proven way. And she just like, we have to do the whole thing. She's like, don't take pictures. I'm going to tell you when you take pictures at the end. Like I got them back. She just delivered everything we needed. You know. And then Kathy. Yeah, I'll talk about Kathy Yoder. Because first off, Katherine Jones is amazing. I'm sorry on the phone, I'm like, oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. She's like, she busted it was absolutely amazing. Kathy Yoder came on. And Kathy Yoder keeps so much like so much more than the background. To be able to. But then she came in and she talked about like, this is how I'm doing my YouTube channel. And these are all the things you should do and shouldn't do that. And she dropped like, here's 72 different attempts. Because I just don't have time. So here's 72 tips. And the playbook from start to growth and as you grow, so you should be doing next. You put this in really connect like home and creating a profile for what you want in your YouTube channel to be like, will be your avatar. Will be a dummy and somebody else's store. See how it works that way you come back and fight all sorts of chances. So men. Russell and Todd came on. And Russell and Todd came on. You've been looking forward to this, I know. Oh, for a long time. Yeah, I've been helping. Todd had me up in the room. We were like working on all the stuff. And it's trying to get to the presentation. It's right. And they've been changing since I touched the glass. It's a little shut up. We don't have a base. And as they did it piece by piece, it was so cool. The audience is really interesting. The audience is like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. If you missed it, it's all on Facebook. It's here. Put that through. So make sure that you guys are watching that. We send out a text message to everybody. If you missed it, text FHTV to Tuesday, 08-511-3797. It's called that. I'm going to find out the stuff. Go ahead and do that. And that will give you all of the details so that we can go back to the next slide. Because when they dropped stuff, they dropped stuff. And it was so much. And then you have to have an answer about how they're getting all of these people out to see you guys, but everyone in the room has it. And if you want to see what's going on, you need to have the ambassador. You need to have the ambassador to check out content on how they're using everything. So look out for that. There's so many people. You've got chat. You've got, which one were you excited about? Oh. OK, so first of all, they just kept showing. Yes. And they kept going. And they're like, oh, we got more. We're like, we're going halfway through. Just don't stop all of it. OK, so yeah, everybody went. And that's for the message call. Also message call. And so they rolled out a lot of exciting quotes. One, another one, eight messages that were sent. Three, just in a way to get your first up and six within hours. Yeah. We know that. I think everyone knows that. I have 15 questions coming up. I've selected, yeah, I need to do a couple of customized versions of the Navy tunes. And now there's like, I don't care about that. I just need to start soft. The best part of her stuff, I'll smash into the Simplified platform. It does everything. And one of the things that I loved about, they brought on another person this time. And he came on. And he's one of the main devs. Like, we work with him all the time. He came in, and he talked about how like, what they're doing is they're trying to build this in a platform that has everything you need. But when you get to a specialized, exact, tune in, it's not the platform you ever need to leave. It's a platform you can integrate into. So we talked about SAP, we talked about integration, we talked about API. And now all of this, all of it, we earned so much gold. It's so, so good. There's so much there. Is there any other you need to watch it? Like, it's not special. You use the tunnels and the other ones. What's going on? You see the other projects. So it's so good. Yeah, it's a good time. Thanks, guys. You've been like, I'm happy to be here. Oh, yeah. Thank you for being here. I'm sweet for this thing. Now, go watch the video. This is Antler. And Justin, I'm so happy to be coming to you. So I'm so happy to be here. There was so much you were interested in. We had some time to talk about the flow for even though you're not in the community. I'm happy to have you on there. But there's so much you need to talk about. Yeah, there were eight brand new ones. And then with the new stuff that we were like preparing to impact on, there was a lot. There was a lot of times. True. So go make sure you watch that right after we're done here. Go watch that video. We have more coming. So this is just the beginning. Can you guys keep letting us know what it is that you want to see? So every time we go by, it's a little bit more for me. So I'm sure we'll put up on there. Tonight, we're going to go by with these. Yeah. So we're going to just hope that they didn't move over here. OK, all the things that happened was for safety. The bigger plan is to make half what happened today. Maybe get the book for the piece. You know, the other thing. Maybe coming on handbook or the film back there. And then maybe we can get their big announcement. Yes. Yes. They have their assignment. And we'll talk more about the 2.0 stuff. We missed Richard Pennington. Richard came on with Pennington. Brains, they came on. They delivered massively. Everybody loved it. Like, there's so many things that we've missed. If you guys want to learn how to cover this, this is just supposed to be the snippet. If you want to be there for the conversation that we have, you definitely want to check out a little bit later. If you miss it, it'll be pretty quick in the morning. We'll be here again tomorrow to give you another update. Let us know what you guys want to see. And we're just excited to be here. And it's an absolute blast. So leave in the comments. Let us know what you want to see. So excited. Go watch that video that Todd and Russell just did. Have a great time. We'll see you tomorrow. We'll be back. Bye. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences. But all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life. And I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. Hear the call. Do you feel it? It's beating, it's pulsing. I made for something more. We get scared. And then fear hits us. There's a little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven are you guys here today. More people are finding their breaking points and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. It felt like I had gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that's made me all of my money. My best selling framework. Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust in Blue Hunter. Blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning again. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this wondrous life? Happy life. You wouldn't be able to tell, but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People build a sense of belonging here. It feels like home. It's so encouraging. Because if they can do it, so can I. It's all it's worth saying, hey, next year we're going to get better. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer ever. We find exactly what your business is missing. You're going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right, or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day they're telling people how they met you. I can live change my entire life. Because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be blessed. Your legacy's going to be blessed. Movements are about to be burned. My story hopefully gave women's permission. You don't believe it? Stand your ground. You do not have to be great to get started. But you have got to start if you ever want to be great.
