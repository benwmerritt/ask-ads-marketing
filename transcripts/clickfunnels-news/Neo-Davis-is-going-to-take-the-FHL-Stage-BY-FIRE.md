The person who we're speaking today, I was at a category King meeting. This is, so Russell has certain tiers inside of the inner circle. And category Kings is the tier where he gets to sit in. He listens to everybody. He shares. He gets to talk to everybody as they're sharing. And it's a multi-day event. And I was sitting there and listening. Everyone's on stage, going on stage. And this person took the stage. And I've never met this person before, but this person has a YouTube channel. They have a podcast. They have a foundation. They are giving. They're constantly growing. And the ideas that came off stage, I have not heard before in our world. And it just shook kind of the foundations of what's possible. And these simple ideas are like taking, I want to take, I want to share, I can't. There's so many cool and amazing ideas that he shared that literally blew everyone's room socks off so much. So that Russell was like, Hey, we have the inner circle meeting in the next couple of days. You're sticking around, right? And he stuck around, came on stage to the inner circle. And he was able to share there. And everyone was just said, keep talking, keep talking. We don't care about the time limit. This is an amazing, amazing opportunity. We are so excited to be able to welcome Neo Davis. Thank you so much for being here, brother. Hey, thank you. Hey, listen, that intro, what a fun up. I need to clip that up and just that be my intro for now on anytime I speak. So it is just an honor to be here with you too. Thank you all for just giving me the opportunity to share my story. And I absolutely cannot wait to be at Funnel Hackers Live. So if y'all looking at this and did not get y'all tickets yet, funnelhackerslive.com y'all, I'm speaking not once. I'm speaking twice and I promise to y'all, we are going to bring the heat every single time. So thank y'all for having me here y'all. No, and it's crazy thing is to like, you're going to hear him the first day, like on the day that he comes on the first time you're going to hear me like, oh my gosh, when we announce that he's coming back on stage, you will erupt and freak out because the amount of just, oh, the fire that's brought in the layers of it. So first off, how did you like enter the ClickFunnels world? Like your business has been growing for a while. So tell us about your business a little bit and then tell us about how you entered the ClickFunnels world. So that way we all know like you're a funnel hacker, like the rest of us, even though you're doing crazy madness. Like I can't help but I'm going to be talking about it. So, so it's funny, you really asked, right? It's actually funny because I'm sitting here and this probably will be my first time even sharing how I entered the world because I got to go back so far for me to even digest it. But I started this kind of newity program. I had this event where I had this event and I had a gentleman come by this event and he was like, I had a gentleman use my event space. He came here and he did this amazing presentation. And at the end, it was all around community building. He said, hey, you could join us for $50 a month but free for 30 days. I'm like, that sounds like a good idea. Like I've been doing all of the things that you just did in this presentation for free for the last couple of years. I'm making this connection with this person, this connection, this connection, but I'm not making any money off of the connections. Can you show me how to do it? So he basically said, man, all you need is a flyer. All you need is a ClickFunnels or a way to do a landing page and a way to collect continuity. Like he simplified them. I'm like, well, I'm about to do that. So I learned about this ClickFunnels thing and it's so fun to y'all. Years, it took me years to understand the concept of what a funnel really was. So I was just using ClickFunnels as a regular website, not understanding order bumps, upsells, downsells. I had no clue about any of those things, but I did just start with ClickFunnels because my guy, Matthew Farini, he was like, hey bro, we got to go ahead and use ClickFunnels. So fast forward, we went to go use ClickFunnels. I went to his office, he showed me, and then I decided to go to the conference with my buddy Josh. Went to the conference and it was like, I don't know how many years ago this was, at least five years ago, I wanna say, right? So I went to the conference and I'm like, yo, what a dope experience. I didn't really know anything about none of it. Like I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't understand it. I even think I signed up for the coaching program at the time and I don't even think I continued on. Like it was like, I never even knew what a coaching program was. I wanna say about, yeah, five, six years ago, I'm like coaching program, but I did. And fast forward, I just started to dive into funnels. I made it my business to learn everything I could about upsells, downsells, order bumps, digital products. And then I took about two years learning in the very next year, I was able to go get one of these awards. And now I'm probably about 10 awards later. I got awards laying on the floor. I just got awards that gotta get hung up. And that's just for me really diving in. So one, everything that Russell says works. One of the biggest game changers that contribute to me making my first million dollars in digital marketing was Russell said, Russell said, do a webinar every week. And I did exactly what he said I did it every week. That allowed me to become a better speaker. It allowed me to communicate better. It allowed me to serve my audience to the highest level. And just from that one result of him telling me to do that today, the specific webinar that I did was teaching people how to open up event spaces. Today, I've helped about 500 people around the world open up event spaces. So for me, him telling me to do that, the impact that has made on the lives and the families of everybody who took my training is absolutely amazing. So I'm forever grateful for Russell. I'm forever grateful for the ClickFunnel community. So now just to think that I'm speaking there, not once but twice is just absolutely incredible. So I'm excited about it. That's incredible. Okay, so you already told us a bit about you, about five years ago, your first FHL experience. It may be longer. I don't remember, like I'm not good with days. Someone said, hey, you've been doing this digital stuff for like seven, eight years. And I'm like, the time is so fast that I don't even know. Okay, so were you in Orlando? Were you in Texas? Do you remember? So for example, it's say I got this award in 2019. So if I got this award in 2019, it's 2023. So that's four years ago. That means it took at least, I want to say a year past. Well, I don't know if this, when did y'all take a break? It was a time that y'all didn't do funnel hackers. What year was it? It was a weird, like it was over 12 months before we got it, but it was still like the same. It was kind of weird. It was like night. This is COVID, right? Yeah, it was weird. So we did COVID a little bit later. So we did the two comic cup live event that kind of like kicked up in between. So maybe I discovered ClickFunnels in 2017 at that year. And then I went and grind and went and learned and got my award in 2019 maybe. I'm not sure, but that maybe. The 27th team would be Dallas. Yeah. It wasn't Dallas then. Must have been Orlando. It was very good for Orlando. What year was Orlando? Orlando was 2018. Okay, so it was definitely, I want to say Orlando. And then maybe I did, I spent a year and got that award in 2019 then. Okay. That's even more impressive. I'm glad we figured out that date. And it's so funny because I didn't really understand, like I'm going to share this with people because some people may don't know because I didn't know. It was like, I believe that you had to make a million dollars in a year on that funnel. So I'm grinding. I'm working so hard to do it in a year, not understanding it's the lifetime of the funnel. So that may take you six months. It may take you six years. It may take you two years, but I was like, I'm like, I got to do it in a year. So that's why I pretty much pushed myself to do that in that year. That's crazy. Yeah. Okay. So funnel hacking live, you go, it changes your life obviously, because then the next year you go and you get your award. What would you tell people who have never been to funnel hacking live? What would you tell them about it and like why they have to be there? Well, the first thing I'm going to tell them is commit first, figure out the rescue. Oh no. No, no. You lost, Neo. You figured it out. So just since you guys know, Neo has been having like some technical difficulties the entire time trying to get it. So we're back. We're good. Oh, no audio. No sound. Oh, be good. Figure that out just a minute. I'm going to go ahead and unmute you just that way we can. Ah, all right. So someone says the mic is connected. We're good to go. All right. So we know he's speaking, oh, let's see, got audio? Just checking. I don't think we have audio yet. No, it says the mic is not connected. All right, so we're going to restart. So we know he's speaking two times on stage this year. One of them has to do with this new framework that Russell's going to be announcing, releasing for the first time outside of inner circle members. I don't even know if I don't, am I allowed to even say the name of it? I'm just kind of on the website. No, no, no, the other piece of it. Oh, the other piece. Do it. So the title on one of NEO's, if you go to the Funnel Hacking Live website and you look at the title, it says unique flywheel traffic strategies. I will say that much. Not weird. And it's, I don't know how much I can say. So we're welcome to be announcing this framework. Yes, there's different, inside the Lynch pin model, there's different ways for you to be able to get traffic. And we call those the Lynch pin, or we call that the flywheel. And you're going to learn different strategies inside of there that work extremely, extremely well. And the way that NEO does his is very different. And it's super ridiculously powerful. And so if we can get it back on them, we'll keep going. But here's the deal. Like if you guys don't have your tickets to Funnel Hacking Live, you should get it. Funnel Hacking Live is one of the best premier experiences. You guys see NEO right there? And as you scroll down, you'll see like, if you want to learn more about NEO, you can find them here. The thing is Russell is making sure that he gets the very best of all worlds here, presenting all the different things that I saw NEO twice, presenting here at Funnel Hacking Live. This is the best of everything he's been able to collect over the last year. And it's all present inside of Funnel Hacking Live. And there's no other place you can find this. And so he's trying to make this as irresistible for you as possible. So your job is to go and get a ticket to Funnel Hacking Live. If you guys are like, oh, kind of on the fence about it, here's a couple of things. Number one, you can win the ticket by going to clickfunnels.com slash giveaway. And, but that ends at the end of the week. Okay. And then at the end of the week, then we're going to have a special with Russell and we're going to start talking about what happens next because all these bonuses that we've been collecting, they're not sticking around for forever. And we want to make sure that you guys get access to them. So if you are even thinking about it and you look at the bonus stack, and you're like, my gosh, this is super valuable, you need to go and get it because the stack is glorious in and of itself. Not only do you get the recordings from all the Funnel Hacking Lives, you get integrations, you get crazy bonuses from the inner circle that they just threw in there because they appreciate Russell. Okay. You also get bonuses from every single speaker. If you guys have been seeing emails that go out, there is a ginormous stack. It is ridiculous. And we just need to almost sit down and be able to like review all the bonuses better there. Can you guys hear me? Yes. Glorious. Thank you. Hey guys, I am so sorry. So I don't have my tech team here with me. I got a whole studio here and it's like trying to run it by myself is just not the play. So you said something, you said something I want to go ahead and talk about it. The reason why you need to be at ClickFunnels simply is because you need a coach and you don't know what you do not know. So for me, I'm sitting here, I'm trying to figure out how my studio working and realize that I don't have the person here that normally works the studio. So I understood that if I understood that Funnels, if I understood that year one, I would have died even deeper or earlier on just the concept of Funnels pay whatever it costs me to learn because every year that you don't pay is costing you not to know the information. So for me, and the other biggest reason, I'm gonna be honest that I tell people to get to events like this is proximity. I only can imagine how much further I would be if I was in those environments earlier. Like imagine if I was there a year earlier, I would have got the awards a year earlier, I would have made more connections a year earlier, I would have made more impact a year earlier. So I tell people all the time is you gotta take advantage, something my mentor ET says, you gotta take advantage of the opportunity of a lifetime during the lifetime of the opportunity. Some things won't always be there. Russell may say next, this could be the last year, I doubt that will be the case, but you don't wanna miss out on that opportunity if that was the case. So just being in that room changed everything. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so when you were not with us for a minute, we started talking a bit about what you're talking about. Do you wanna tell us a bit more about that? We actually didn't get that far. So if you wanted to start from like, okay, what is Russell inviting you to speak about? So Russell saw me on stage and I gave them two things. I gave them paid challenges and then I gave them social media, right? So Russell said, hey, can you come give them everything you know about social media? So I got this book, Seven Steps to Turning an Instagram into a Cash Machine. But I said, you know what? I think I wanna talk about seven steps for just dominating social media. So we're gonna talk about how to become a category king in your niche. We're gonna talk about how to attract your ideal customers and clients. We're gonna talk about how to blow up your audience. Like I'm gonna literally show you my signature process that will make you become a legend in your industry within three to six months if you execute on it. We're gonna show you how to leverage not only your own traffic, but other people's traffic. I tell people all the time, you gotta learn how to leverage other people's audiences and other people's sages. So the form that I'm gonna show you is gonna have people begging for you to get on their platform so you can gather audience. And then we just gonna show you how to really monetize and maximize social media. There's a lot of people on social media, but they don't know how to work social media. So I have about, I think we're at about 500, 600,000 followers on Instagram, a couple of hundred thousand on TikTok, several other pages, 500,000, 700,000. Like we're gonna literally show you how to go blow up your audience. And then how to turn your audience into cash flow. Like how to create a digital product associated. So that's on the social media side. Then we're gonna go deep on all things challenges. So today we had well over 10 seven figure challenges for ourself and our partners that we work directly with. So we're literally gonna come in and literally uncover our entire framework. So we got a system like, we added so many processes and systems now to just make a challenge like go crazy. So we're gonna uncover that, pull back the curtains. We're gonna show you our ticket type system. We're gonna show you how to get the butts in the seat system. We're gonna show you how to sell to your audience at a high ticket challenge. Like we're gonna literally break everything down. Day one, what they do, the psychology behind it. What they do on day one, what they do on day two, what they do on day three, what they do on day four, what they do on day five, right? We're gonna show you how to fill up the rooms organically as well as paid, right? So we're literally gonna just uncover. Now the issue is I got about an hour total to do all of this. So I gotta, I'm letting people know like go on my YouTube, go on Google, go watch as much content on me if you wanna know my backstory because I'm not coming there to give you no origin story. It is soon as I start talking, grab your pen, grab your pad. Cause I'm just giving you all the info you need to grow, grow your brand and grow your business. And it's crazy because the way you do challenges is different. So like we've done challenges before, challenges is not new in the ClickFunnels world, but the way you do it is different. The way you set it up is different. The way that you pitch is different. The way that you organize each level of VIP is dramatically different. And in the social media idea, there's a phrase that I've caught on and I've held on to forever, which is how to create an entourage with Dream 100 espionage. I'm like, oh, I like that. I like, say that phrase again. I gotta hook up. That was yours. That's yours. Create an entourage with Dream 100 espionage. You said that at the category King and I just like, oh my gosh, write that down, save it for forever. Like it's, I am so stoked for everything. So we went through really quick guys. If you guys get, when you get your tickets, you get a whole bunch of bonuses. We've done several different just funnel hacker TVs where we've talked about all through the bonuses and we've gone through all of them. It's ridiculous how many there are. Nino's throwing in his bonuses and they are madness. And so brother, can you like explain to people what it is that you were giving them when they jumped in? So one of the things I'm like, guys, I really, I have an hour of time to spend with you, right? Honestly, you need nothing else but click funnels. Like giving funnel, you being in the room, honestly, is all you need. All the bonuses that I'm offering any other speaker off, that's just icing on the cake. Getting in the room is gonna do the trick that you need. But since y'all asked for bonuses, I'm like, what can I give them more time with me? So we're giving you eight to 10 hours of a whole conference that we sell it for $1,000, just to record it. It's y'all's for free. I'm also in October, about a month after click funnels, I'm having a full conference, virtual conference. I'm giving everybody here a $300 free fee. So those are just other things that everybody gets here for being a part of it. So I just wanted to make sure I wheat over deliver and just give you more time with myself as well as with others to just add as much value. But again, one of my biggest things I tell people all the time is information only changes situations with implementation. So don't hear the information and don't do anything with it, right? So go grab your tickets y'all, funnelhackinlive.com if you didn't have it. Get yourself in that building. We're gonna be delivering so much content. I can assure you one thing, my presentation will be worth 100K to 500K if implemented over time. Like I can, and again, I know we can't make claims but I believe if someone implements on the information, it will be worth six figures in volume to your business over time and implement it. Yeah, absolutely. It's gonna be amazing. Absolutely, great. So this is very rare that Russell has somebody speak twice at funnelhackinlive. There's only one time it's happened before and that's happening at this event when Yara J. White is speaking twice, we interviewed yesterday. So this is the only time, the only other people who've done that are Russell and Todd. And so the question is- I feel good about it. It's a lot of pressure though. You put some pressure on me now. Heck yes. Oh, it's serious pressure dude. It's gonna be so good though. Like I have no question about it. Like how you were trying to just shove as much in as possible in category Kings and Inner Circle, like there's not gonna be an issue. So really quick, if you guys don't have your tickets, go to funnelhackinlive.com. Neil, if there's one message you could give somebody who's in that place where they're like sitting on the fence and they're just, I don't know if this is for me. I don't really know if this calling is for me. Like I don't know if I can trust in myself in order to be able to make these steps. What is that message you would give to that person? Man, one of the things I would say are, what are you willing to give up in order to go up? And one of the things that you're gonna have to give up in this season in your life is fear. One of the things you're gonna have to give up in this season in your life is doubt. One of the things you're gonna have to give up in this season in your life is excuses. I've learned that if you continue to do the same thing, you're gonna continue to get different results. Like everybody looking at this, I don't care if you're making six, seven or eight figures, there's another level for you. There's another level literally waiting with your name on it, right? Waiting with my name on it, but it's time for you to unlock it. It's time for you to remove fares. And it's time for you to make a decision to go all in and give it everything that you have. Because one thing that I know to be true was that time is limited. Meaning we don't have a limited amount of it. And you don't know when that's gonna be up. So every single day you gotta literally max out and take full advantage of it. So that's what I would say. Just give it everything you got and just show up, commit first, figure out the rest later and do it scare. Some of the greatest moments and some of the greatest experiences that has happened in my life came as a result of me doing something afraid. Me doing a webinar every week was afraid. It was, it was, me doing a webinar is so crazy. I used to be one of the worst speakers ever. Like when I had to go speak, I would bring in my different friends, had them go speak. I would go speak first cause I was so horrible that they would come up and clean all the mess that I did. That was my strategy when I used to speak, right? So now I became, I'm speaking twice because Russell must see like, he can speak a little bit, but I need you all to understand that came from a result of me saying yes, to speaking engagements before I was ready. That came as a result of me saying yes, to doing a webinar when Russell tasked with the webinar that we did it for a year straight before I was ready. So I made a decision to commit before I was ready. So anybody looking at this, I'm challenging you to commit and think about your family. Think about if you don't do this for you, who are you doing it for? So always think about my mom, always think about my wife, always think about my children. If I don't give it everything that I got, they probably won't give it everything they got. So that's what I would say. Oh my gosh, I cannot wait to get all of the value from you at Funnel Hacking Live and just be there with you and everyone else guys, go get your ticket, funnelhackinglive.com. You don't wanna miss out on this. This is gonna change your business. There's no doubt about that. So anything else, Ben? No, nothing else. Neal, thank you for your time. We appreciate you so much. We cannot wait to see you in Orlando, brother. Thank you, Ben. Thank you, Queen. I appreciate you both. Can't wait to see if there's anything else that we could do for y'all to help. Please let us know. Thank you. Thank you, Mio. We'll see you all later. All right. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating, it's pulsing. I'm made for something more. You get scared. And then fear hits us. There's a little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm gonna do it. The driven, are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm gonna show you the magic trick that made me all of my money. You want to start out closing if you're gonna end up closing? 82% of customers trust in influencers. This better blow your mind and allows you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning again. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this one precious life? Life is life. Life is life. You wouldn't be able to tell but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. I feel so good about what you said that you were mine. People feel a sense of belonging here. I feel like home. I'm so encouraging. Because if they can do it, so can I. They thought, let's say, hey, next year we're going to get better. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer in Everland. You find exactly what your business is missing. You're gonna amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day, they're telling people how they met you. I can live change my entire life. Because now I know what I'm gonna do next. Your family's gotta be blessed. Your legacy's gotta be blessed. Movements are about to be burned. My story hopefully gave women permission. If you believe it, stand your feet. You do not have to be great to get started. But you have got to start if you ever want to be great. You have got to start if you ever want to be great.
