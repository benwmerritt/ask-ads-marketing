Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm joined by Carl Weischa. Carl runs an e-commerce agency called Accelerated where he focuses on conversion optimization of landing pages to boost his clients revenue. Welcome Carl, thanks so much for joining me today. Thanks for showing me Laura. Really excited to have this interview with you. Yeah, I'm excited to learn more about you and how you got started in this business. So can you give us a little bit of a background? For sure. So I've always somehow been in online marketing, right? When I was 16, I started buying and resetting limited sneakers like EasyBoost, Johns and all of that. And then I also ran an Amazon FBA store, had an online store. And that's how I found out about conversion optimization because back then in the days, I hired a freelancer to do that service for my online store. And that's how I got to know the service. And then it was super exciting for me because it was super focused on like understanding people and like how people work, how people buy and kind of apply the psychology to it, right? So I have this understanding of what works with this target audience, what are the triggers we can kind of click and how can we get them to convert. And then three years ago, I decided to move to the service business and found the agency together with him. And that's what we've been doing over the past couple of years. Really cool. So what led you to ClickFunnel specifically? So for me, in the beginning, I used to build my websites on Webflow just because it was like a nice website build out. And they looked kind of nice with like a lot of animations and stuff, but they didn't really get me any book calls, right? And then I had a friend who was running on ClickFunnels for ages, and he had like a really long sales page for his service that he was selling. And he was already in the 2, Club X Award. So he did over 10 million with that funnel. And that was super inspirational for me to kind of switch from Webflow to ClickFunnels and also mimic this like long form sales page that he had. And that was working phenomenally for me to really not only kind of spark some attention or interest, but really get them hooked in, get them to actually go through the whole website to the bottom and then book a call with me. So that led me initially to move towards ClickFunnels to have like a better funnel to attract customers. And do you think that's made a significant impact on the business? Yeah, definitely. I mean, it's super cool to have like a 3D looking website or whatever, but if your website isn't designed to convert and really get them into the funnel, then it doesn't really make sense to have a website as long as you're not like a huge corporate business that's not relying on actually making sales and making revenue. But for like me back then, it really helped change the trajectory of where my business was going because using ClickFunnels, I could book way more demos and then obviously also get way more clients than before. Yeah, it's interesting, right? When you have like more of a design background or you're very into aesthetics or branding as a business, especially in Ecom, you understand the need to have something that looks beautiful and simple and easy to understand or follow as a customer. But one of the best things that we can do outside of what looks beautiful is actually guiding that person to a sale. So I think that's one of the cool things that with ClickFunnels 2.0, we talk about like funnel hubs and creating and designing your main website. But even if you don't use ClickFunnels for your main website or your homepage, the importance of funnels still exists and having different landing pages and different funnels for your business outside of that main hub so that people are still getting the conversions that they need. So I find it really fascinating with the Ecom industry specifically because I still see the importance of having something that's beautiful and technically designed. But also there's a difference between like the aesthetic design and also designing for conversions, which is what you're doing. Yeah, definitely. We also really like to use ClickFunnels a lot for like our clients. Similar to what you said like this, there's this aesthetic looking website kind of where they can just like explore everything. But then for the ads and especially for like the direct response ads on Meta and on Google, we then focus on like pushing them in like one funnel. So they don't move around or it's not like due to lack or randomness that they buy, but it's like specifically designed to push them through like one funnel where they can go through. Yeah, so are you handling traffic and ads as well? No, we're not doing that. We have partners that we work with for that. But then for us, we always handle like building the landing page or like building the funnels and then also running the split this for that to continuously like find you near a test different front end offers, test different upsets and all of that so that we can push more conversions and also push like a higher average order value. Cool. Do you have like a favorite type of split test to understand what things are performing better? Like whether it's like headlines or buttons or copy, what do you think gives you the most insight? Interesting question for me, especially if we talking about let's say like an opt-in funnel, right? For me, the most interesting split test to run is the main value proposition like the main headline because you can see a difference in like options anywhere from like 10 to 30% depending on like the headline and the message match with the traffic that you push at that page, right? It can make like that big of a difference. Like it can convert better by like 10, 20, 30% and we run like a lot of tests on the opt-in page. And for me, that's always super fascinating because then we can get a better understanding of what's the main value proposition that really gets into opt-in, right? Like what's the one thing or what's the one proof or one case study that got them to like opt-in because then we can also give that forward to the sales team, right? So they can use it as a hook and then we can also give it to the ads and creative team so they can push more traffic to the page because it would get more people to click, right? So having like a copy split test really moves the needle not only on that page specifically, but across like different steps in the business. Oh, that's awesome that you're not just taking that and applying your conversion methods to the page itself and the funnels that you're building, but making sure that you have consistency throughout the entire process, which I think probably quite a few people forget about. Like if you have a winner in your split test, make sure you're applying those methods to your ads, to your follow-up, to everything that you're doing. I think that's really cool through that big impact. So tell me a little bit more about what you told me what brought you to click funnels and how you switched over for the fact that you need to design for optimizations. What about the community in Russell and coaching? Like what types of things have you kind of immersed yourself in? So for me, the training guides have been super helpful and what I also found was in around September, October, so pretty quickly after ClickFunnels 2.0 launched, I immediately switched my funnel and like built it in ClickFunnels 2.0 and what helped me a lot because I'm quite like technically so I can do a lot of stuff. But then sometimes when I couldn't find something or when I had like a block or something, I saw that the support was crazy good. So they would send me Lume videos, they would answer super quickly and I was like, wow, because I had to build the funnel again from scratch, try to get it live again. So that was especially helpful. And then also the connections that are made inside of the community were helpful because it's like you use ClickFunnels as the software to like build and host a funnel and like convert your prospects. But then like the people you meet inside of the community help you with the marketing, they help you with the sales. So they help you with all of the other business aspects, right? That are somehow even wider than just like the funnel building itself, right? Or like the e-mail CIM. So that was really beautiful to see kind of the connections you can make in the community and also all that can also help with the trajectory of your business because somebody else may have made some whatever, let's say I'm running an opt-in VSL funnel and then somebody that I meet in the community has run a super, super great auto webinar funnel, right? Which then gives me the idea to test that type of funnel or to to have like a different sales approach or like follow up approach in the back end. So that has been super interesting for me from like the marketing and also the operational perspective. Yeah, I love that. I think the community is one of the biggest things or like when I'm having conversations just like this, people do say the profound impacts that the community and the feedback and the advice that they get from people that are just willing to add value is remarkable and how it helps them test new things or try new things in their business. And I love that jumping in the community and seeing what people are willing to help out with or even just, hey, send me your funnel so I can take a look at it or just give the advice freely, I think is really, really cool. There's a lot of positive things happening in there. So you talked about different types of funnels. Do you have a funnel that is your favorite to build or that you think you've seen the most success with? So for me right now from the service perspective, I mean, my main goal is like to get a lead to book a demo with me. And the best funnel for me always has been the opt-in to like a VSL funnel to like a book a call, right? Like it may sound super basic, but it has been working super well for me in terms of like having the qualifier in the beginning, get them to opt-in, we can have somebody like call or the opt-ins and then we can have them like watch the VSL and then afterwards like as soon as they're like really a warm lead, they booked a call. But the one example I just gave you with the webinar funnel happened like really recently that somebody out of the community pointed that out to me to like how well it worked for him. So that's something that I'm working right now on the team together with the team to set that up and try that out. So for me, it's also a lot about kind of like testing other stuff, maybe another funnel to see if it could also work for like the stuff that I'm doing and not only like super obsessed with like the one thing that I have already. What are like what are your biggest business goals with what you're doing right now over the next five, ten years? For me, one thing that I'm working towards right now is the two comma club X award. That's like a huge milestone for me that I'm currently working towards too, which is obviously tied to like how I structure the funnels and how I'm able to like push traffic there, book the demos, convert them into clients and then also after I successfully stay with us for a long time. So that's like the one big thing that I'm working towards right now in terms of the business with like click funnels and like the business goals. And then for like the next five to ten years, I really want to focus on kind of creating an ecosystem around my service, right? Because right now it's a it's a done for you service where we come in with like a full stack team and we take over all of the efforts for them from like A to Z. And I want to kind of build an ecosystem around that. So over the past like one and a half years, we've been working on a software solution to also integrate into that so we can have the data collected in there, run split tests and everything. And we have like a lot of other projects. And basically my long term vision with the business is to have like the ecosystem around like conversion rate optimization for direct to consumer brands. Wow. Yeah, you're working all aspects. I can imagine that you're pretty busy. So are you mostly building your funnels currently in click funnels classic or in 2.0? 2.0. And are you using the A B testing features inside of 2.0? I didn't run any tests yet. Okay. Yeah. And everything seems everything is still fairly new. And there's a lot of things that are rolling out weekly, daily, monthly, like all kinds of things. But what I'm most excited about inside of 2.0 is to be able to have the ability to start testing things directly in the software, which I think will be really exciting. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. So what would you say to a fellow entrepreneur or somebody who's interested in starting a business or working with clients and potentially building funnels? What's been your biggest piece of advice or something that you can give to them as a takeaway of what you think would be very helpful for them? I think the most helpful aspect will be finding this community of like like-minded people who run a similar business, who you can connect with and exchange like thoughts, ideas and what has been working for them. That has always been the most helpful aspect of like me running my business to have other people who have already successfully done it. So just as an example, I told you about the friend of mine who has already achieved like the 2.0 Club X Award because he has been working with click funnels for like ages and he has been giving me so much valuable input for like, how I should run my funnel, how I should do the marketing, how I should do the sales. So this would be the biggest piece of advice to people that are starting out. Love that. And where can people go to find out more about you and your business? So most active on Twitter and YouTube right now. Awesome. And what's your handle there? It's just my first and my last name, so Carl Weischer. Cool. We'll make sure that we include that in the description as well. Any last words for us, Carl? Thank you so much for having me, Laura. It has been a pleasure. And then I'm really looking forward to seeing you sometime soon, maybe even at one of the next events. Yes, we'd love to have you at Funnel Hiking Live. In fact, if you're going for that 2.0 Club X Award, what we would really like to see is you walk across the stage in a good person. So you should definitely come out for that. Okay, we'll do. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks so much for being with me today, Carl. It was great to get to know you. Thank you so much for having me.
