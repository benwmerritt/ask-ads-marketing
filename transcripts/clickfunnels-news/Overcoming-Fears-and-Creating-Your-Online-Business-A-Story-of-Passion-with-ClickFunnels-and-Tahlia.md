## Transcript
Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels. And today I'm joined by Talia Ragnari. Talia, I met like a few weeks ago now at Funnel Hacking Live. And I got to hear a little bit about her story. First of all, she came all the way from Australia. Where about in Australia, Talia? Victoria. In Melbourne. So she came one of the furthest traveling attendees at Funnel Hacking Live. And I got to hear a little bit about her story. And I'm really fascinated because she's fairly new to ClickFunnels. And she overcame a lot of adversity to put the effort in that she's doing to build her business at home. And I'm really looking forward to hearing more about her. So Talia, thanks so much for being with me today. Thank you so much for having me. So to get started, can you kind of tell us a little bit about your background in business? Kind of what brought you here to ClickFunnels and all of the things that you overcame to get to this point? Yeah. So before Click, well, before this world, I used to work for the Victorian government with Corrections. And I have been working there for 10 years. And unfortunately, I got injured at work. The injury to start with was misdiagnosed. So I actually walked around with a broken foot for nearly two years. So when I finally got diagnosed correctly, I had to have surgery. And after that surgery, it didn't take too long to discover that I had really severe nerve damage. And I had that there was enough damage done that I now have a chronic pain disorder that's called complex regional pain syndrome, which it's known as the second highest pain disorder in the world. So it can be pretty intense. And so this happened. And I did everything that I could to try and be able to continue being a prison officer. But unfortunately, I couldn't go back inside. And I couldn't really stay at work, even just doing administration or things just because of my chronic pain. So unfortunately, my employment ended. And then I started at home. And I was really quite affected and depressed by it because I'd lost my identity. I felt like I had no identity anymore. And so I did what most people do, I think, when they find click funnels in Russell. I Googled about creating a business or at least being able to make money online, but be able to stay home and work. And I found Russell. And I started off with the dot com secret book. And yeah, it kind of like just spread on from that. And I've now, you know, I made the decision to fly halfway around the world with only a few days notice, which still now I think is absolutely crazy. But I did it and it was incredible. After I was diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome, I had to have a couple of spinal surgeries because the treatment that I was having wasn't working. And I had been in hospital for was like five times over about an 18 month period where I'd spend a week essentially having ketamine infusions. And just to help me be able to get out of bed, essentially, I then had four spinal surgeries, which then placed a spinal cord stimulator in my back, which is always fun when you're traveling around the world and you go through customs because it does light up the X-ray machine. So that was when I got to America. So, you know, it's been a little bit of a crazy time over the last few years. And I've been trying to make something so that I felt like I had an identity again, because I felt like I didn't. And I mean, that led me to click funnels and obviously meeting you at FHL. Yeah. So yeah, you literally went from not only being misdiagnosed, but because of that giving you results that were misdiagnosed, you were walking on a foot that was broken and essentially bringing yourself more pain because of this. And this went on for a while. And then that led to spinal surgeries, which is like probably one of the riskiest things you can go through. Yeah. And then coming to click funnels and then flying literally across the world, kind of on a whim with a few days notice to be at Funnel Hacking Live. Like, I can't think of like a crazier transition from basically being in horrific pain in the hospital for weeks at a time to being in that room with 5,000 other entrepreneurs. Like, does it kind of feel like it was all a dream in a way? 100%. I had been struggling with my limiting beliefs about just go, get on a plane, like you need to be at FHL. You need to be at Funnel Hacking Live, because the group of people that I've gotten to know and I love that I've met through Click Funnels, who one of them, Madison, who's a Click Funnels ambassador, she actually won an additional ticket through the affiliates. And she was the one who messaged me and said, if I can give you this ticket, will you get on the plane? And I'm like, my gosh, it's like the 17th or the 18th of September. So it was like, my goodness, like nine days, nine days before. I was like, OK, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. And I was away for my birthday and I literally was away for my birthday. I booked everything really quickly and I came home and I had less than 30 hours before I had to get on the plane to come to the US. So it was a little bit of a whirlwind trip, but I was also very blessed. It's amazing. And it's kind of ruined me for life now for traveling. But I was really unlucky. I got upgraded to business for my flight over to Dallas, which was incredible. Yeah. And like I said, it probably won't happen again. It was like a luck of a draw, which made my flying experience so much easier because I am that person who is up, down, up, down in the aisle, pacing around. I didn't know this before, but flights coming into America, you're not allowed to like you can obviously get up and walk, but you can't kind of like hang around in certain areas. So that's usually me. I'm usually that person at some ungodly hour in the morning doing weird stretches near the toilet. I'm so glad that I was able to have that because I would have struggled very much. So it kind of feels like all 100 percent. The stars aligned for you in order to be there for that event. There is someone looking after me for sure. Yes, for sure. I want to get into some tactical stuff because now you were looking for a solution to be home and you struggled with your identity. And I think so many people in our community, myself included, struggle with tying our own self worth and our value to our careers or our jobs. And it starts to take over. And when you don't have that anymore, I'm sure it's like it feels like a complete identity crisis. So what brought you into the entrepreneurial world and kind of where do you plan to go from here? When I first started, it was more about it's not a greedy mindset, but it was more about like, I've got to figure out, I've got to figure out how to like have something that I can do now. And like I'm sure a lot of people, because just from listening to other people's stories, I did. I fell for the shiny things. And I always had, you know, the idea that one day my goal was to be able to get something that I could retire my partner. That was my like very much my why. As well as being able to create something that a whole family could be involved with or if not create generational wealth. So that's my definis of purpose is to be able to create something for my family. It started off with, I'm like, oh, I'll just learn some like funnel building skills. And, you know, maybe I can maybe I can sell a funnel or two on Fiverr. And it didn't feel right to me because I've always been the type of person where I enjoy helping people. Like I originally went to school to be a social worker or youth worker to work with like young troubled teens. But I found just speaking with local businesses or local business owners that were family friends or people that my parents knew and, you know, talking to them, especially over COVID. Yeah. And how they were struggling. And they didn't have really a presence online. So they really were affected by COVID because here in Victoria, we were shut down like it felt like nearly two years. Like it was a very long time where so many businesses were shut down. Lots of people lost their jobs. And for a very long time, we weren't allowed to go more than five kilometers from our homes. So small businesses, they had to learn how to transition to be online because they weren't going to be able to, you know, be able to serve their customers. So my goal and my dream for my business is to have a funnel building agency where I'm able to help small businesses transition to be online, as well as grow and scale, you know, it's not just working with your like your local plumbers or things like that. That would be awesome. I love to help people who have trades because I feel that so many of them do so well just from like word of mouth, but they don't realise that they could expand and not just be, you know, a plumber and his apprentice, like he could have other people working behind him so that eventually they could kind of like step back and not have to do other dirty jobs and have other people who are working for them because they've been able to expand online. My dream is to be able to have the ability to help others come online and grow and scale. The process of having like starting an agency as well as a side business, which is kind of strange because, you know, why not start two things at once? I know very much about focusing on the one thing, but I want to help start something for my family. So my goal is to start a sensory toy subscription for kids or babies and but make it a little bit more affordable to be that. One parent household can afford to get sensory toys and sensory play into their homes because I have a little niece who is just the most adorable thing in the world. I'm very biased when it comes to it, to tell me to wear. But I was able to even like purchase a subscription, a sensory choice subscription for her. It's expensive. And, you know, my sister, like they can't afford that. They've got to focus on having their baby, all the things that they need to have inside the house. And that is, I see, is like a luxury, if you will. Right. But I don't think it should be a luxury. I think that every child should have the ability to have these type of toys and the type of play because watching her develop and even her little like mom's group, little baby friends playing with the toys, just watching them figure things out in real time. Like I cry all the time, just watching her play with like it's ridiculous. How much I cry over how she can put a ball into a container. And I totally get that. That's my side goal. Yeah. And I love that it's a passion project that also kind of goes hand in hand with the business that you are building with this agency. So you're learning the essentials of funnel building and helping customers. And then that kind of seeds into what you want to do with your this passion project of building a business that helps. That's a subscription for sensory toys because you've then learned all of those fundamentals for your own clients that you can, you know, your, this passion project could eventually take off and be a core business, which sounds delightful. I'm sure it would serve so many different people. I have young children at home. It's very cool to have people that do that. That is affordable because so many things these days are not. So really cool. And I understand the need to focus on something, but when both of those things can help each other, I think it's absolutely worth it. And, you know, it sounds like you're just another entrepreneur who has lots of different ideas who's trying to make them come to life, which is exactly why we're all here. Yes. And, you know, being at FHL, learning the linchpin and spending that time being able to like dive deep. I had ordered my linchpin book. I had my linchpin book before FHL and, you know, being able to read that. And I'm like, okay, gave me some like pretty awesome ideas and some were really out of this world. And then like actually being at FHL and learning everything over those like four days just like it blew my mind. But one of the biggest parts that just made me realise that you come on the right path with it is just talking to people. And like you said, you know, you just said about you've got children and speaking to the different people that I got to talk to. And they're like, don't stop. Like that's a great idea. Like go with it. And that in itself is like doing market research to see if it's something that, you know, maybe the market needs. So, you know, thank you to those people I spoke to at FHL because you just did a lot of work for me and not having to do market research. So I'm grateful for that as well. Yeah. And there's a lot to be said about being surrounded by other entrepreneurs and being in the same room with them because it really can be a lonely journey for so many people who are bootstrapping their businesses. So to have that opportunity to be in a room and meet them in person is it's like a bunch of lonely entrepreneurs getting together to finally be surrounded by people who think just like you do, which I think is a really good feeling. It was so beautiful. And, you know, I watched Lisa Deema the other day and she was talking. She was lucky enough to win the VIP ticket, which was incredible. And she was on Final Hacker TV and, you know, she was just talking about incredible. It was just to meet people and a network. And that it's like all the things that we learn, like out of this world crazy. I have a whole book full of notes as well as my actual workbook that we got. But it was the people that we met and the people that I met that really it made it more than worth flying and being uncomfortable and being and all of that just to meet everybody and just to see it's so real. Like you can be it's not a dream. You like people can do this if you just move past fears that you have. It's so true. So much of what we do is really just believing in ourselves. 100 percent on that note for anyone who is new or considering starting an online business or a future potential client. What kind of advice would you give them? So if you were new and you're wanting to get started online, I would definitely say one of the biggest things is is like what you said before is find your community. And for me, the ClickFunnels community is that community. I've never felt like there's been a feeling of like competition. It's always been praise and just people behind you going go for it, go for it. And the fact that you can be in a community and be talking to somebody that you may not necessarily realize that you're talking to someone who's a two comma club award winner or multi two comma club winners. And they just stand there and give you the advice that changes your life. So community is one of the biggest things. And that's something that I definitely think changed my journey. You know, before I found ClickFunnels and before I became a funnel hacker and finding my other fellow funnel hackers, it was really lonely, like he said, before it is because a lot of the time, even though, you know, our families love us and they want to encourage us, sometimes they don't understand. My family literally thought I was talking about funnels that you use in the kitchen to like drain oil. So like it's cool to talk to people that realize it's not just about kitchen funnels. So community is one, like it is number one. Definitely the next thing is about just believing in yourself and being able to find a mentor. And it may feel like I talk about Russell a lot to, you know, my outside world. And a lot of people are like, I hope so. What? Who? Because they're not in this world. Right, right. But I see Russell as a mentor and I've never met the man. And but I've learned so much and all of the other, I guess, well-known people in the funnel hacking world. So having a mentor and having someone to look up to, I think is another big thing because if you don't have that, it's like wanting to be an athlete or want to be a famous basketball player. We, you know, everybody has their player that they look up to. So to me, Russell is my Michael Jordan, if you will. Having a mentor is another thing. And I know that it does kind of connect into community, on a more like strategic side of things and the tactic side of things. I would say the doc, like the the secrets trilogy is just it's huge because it brings you into the world and it explains everything in a way. And that's why I love Russell, for that sense. Is it explains everything that a common person who has never done anything online is like, what is a funnel? Why are you talking about kitchen funnels? But then goes from that to then realizing, oh, wow, I can start a business on a passion that I have. And if that passion is, for example, me thinking, the horribility is watching my niece learn and develop. Like that has become my passion project. But it could be something as simple as your really good growing herbs in your home garden. So you can create a business helping other people learn how to grow herbs in their garden at home. And that's the most brilliant part of it. Having realized what your passions are and even having something that you've got that experience and realizing you don't need to have a PhD in something. You don't need to feel like you know everything as long as you're passionate and you know that you can help someone get from A to B. You can create an online business and you're willing to have funnels there. Yeah, 100 percent. I'm terrified of cameras and I don't go on camera. And I tell I started recording videos and talking. There were some days I forgot to do it, so tired. But it's one of my biggest fears is being on camera and stuff like that. But if I didn't get over those fears, I wouldn't have had the confidence to sit here and speak to you and be able to share my story. So like you said, the limiting beliefs, like that's definitely something that, you know, it's all inbuilt into helping you get from, OK, I want to start a side hustle or I want to be able to stay home longer with my baby. Or I believe like I've worked in the same job for 15 years. I just want to be my own boss and have more time with my family or whatever it is. If you have that little like that feeling in your heart or that little spark inside that you like want something different or want something more, you literally can create it. You just need to realise that there are real other people out there who are doing the exact same thing as what you're doing. And they will be there to help guide you and push you and also cheer you along as you're going through your journey. That's so powerful and such great advice and so much of it is mindset. And who knew that this would be a 30 minute discussion that probably helps people overcome their own limiting beliefs. But it is such a big part of what we all do. And it's the first thing you need to do before you start taking action. Because once you start taking action, like the success will come. It's just getting exactly. Yeah, yes, amazing. That's super powerful. You know, and momentum. Like, I mean, Russell talked a lot about it. And it's definitely I can honestly say that I dabbled. I wasn't as confident as I have been, you know, even in the past sort of like six to seven months, honestly, and being able to push past it. I've gone from, you know, I'm going to do something. I'm going to do something. I'm going to do something to flying 23 and a half hours across the world. Three flights in a day and also going back in time because, you know, I left, which was kind of funny. I left at four o'clock five in the afternoon on the 25th and I landed in America at four 15 on the 25th. So like really, it was only a 10 minute flight. You look at it that way. So only if only. But yeah, like taking that huge leap. And like you said, the stars all aligned for me. Like, you know, just everything and the whole time I was like, like someone is there behind me helping me like, you know, spiritually. And it's for me, it's my my grandmother. She's there just like, yeah, tapping me on the back being like, keep going, keep going, keep going. No, turn right, turn left. That's what led me to here and speaking to you. Yeah. Well, what a beautiful origin story, you know, that it started in such a big, profound way. And I'm so glad and grateful that you came on and that you were able to share that with us. And I know that people will probably love watching your journey unfold as you stay in our community and continue to build funnels and help the people that you're helping and, you know, continue on with your passion project. So I appreciate you sharing all of that. Where can people go to learn more about you and your business? So you can go to phoenixfunneldesigns.com. OK, that is my agency. And then you can follow me, I guess, on Facebook, just Talia Ranieri. Get the spelling in the description because. You know, don't don't try and make that up. But yeah, so phoenixfunneldesigns.com and yeah, just Talia Ranieri on Facebook. Awesome. And we will include all of those in the description. Thank you again, Talia, for being on the show today.
