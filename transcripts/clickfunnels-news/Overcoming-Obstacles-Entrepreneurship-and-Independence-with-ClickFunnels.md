Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels, and today I'm joined by Marcello Sartino. Marcello is a member of the ClickFunnels funnel builder certification program, and he has an extremely inspiring story to tell everybody today. Welcome, Marcello. Thanks for being my guest. Thanks for having me. So can you start off by just telling us a little bit about your background, your personal story, and what brought you here today? Yeah, yeah. So whenever I was 21 years old, my parents brought me to a dinner. I need to pay you an awesome right. I have an electrical condition called Friedrichs attacks. I was diagnosed at 14 years old and I've slowly lost the ability to walk. So I'm confined to a wheelchair now. And just as I was growing up, right, I needed to find a job. So my parents brought me to a financial aid for this building facility. And it was pretty overwhelming. I didn't want to fall to what I call nonsense verbiage in activities that don't fit for me. Right. I want to meet you. I just want to work for myself. I want to let I want to reach my goals and not have to focus and rely on aid, right? On the assistance. So after going to that meeting, I was like, I can't do this. So I started looking how to make money online, right? Through my search, I eventually came across Russell Brunson. And it just, my mind really opened up as I was learning all of the stuff and going through all the teachings. And from then, I asked my parents because they're really helping me out financially right now. I asked my parents to help me go through some of the programs and go to Bonahack and Live. The first time I went to Bonahack and Live was in 2011. It was awesome. It really opened my mind to see, OK, look, I can do this. I don't know. I have this condition. But the way I look at it is it is my unfair advantage. I'm here in my wheelchair. Just sitting on my computer most of the day. And I know I can do a lot of stuff on my computer that is going to help me out in the long run. So as I was going through everything and seeing how this actually does work, I was like, man, I can do this. Wow. And that's what I'm doing. I'm really excited just to see where it pains out now. I mean, I'm very comfortable with where I am now and what I'm learning. I think I really am in the right place. As an adult, I think probably most people in your position would probably feel like they're being stuck or they have limited advantage to having a successful career and something like this. And you decided I can run a business online. I can build funnels. Like this isn't going to hold me back. So what has it been like for you being a part of that program? It's been incredible. I mean, just I've always had overanalytical eyes. I was overthought on everything I went into doing. But building funnels and seeing their aching certifications to receive in the program. I made it to Goldmine to get them all done by FHL, Funnel Hacking Live 2023. Wow. So now I joined actually last October and so it'll be year in October and it's April now. Anyway, that's huge. I had this thought in mind. I mean, I need to learn how to build these funnels correctly. Right? I'm still relying on someone to help me do it, which I know I know he can. But like I said, I had the time here to make it happen on my own. So learning the funnels was huge. And speaking of the overanalytical stuff, meaning that there's 18 funnels, you just got to go through it. You got to get rid of that overthinking. Yeah, there's a lot. So I mean, I really have learned more than just building funnels, which is amazing. Awesome. So how many have you been certified in so far? So I received my 10th one yesterday. Wow. Congratulations. And are you already taking on clients to build funnels? See, I have not done it yet. I'm really focused on learning all of them first. I mean, I just I want to know how to build the right ones for the right clients, right? Yeah, of course. So no clients set up yet. But it will come, I know. Of course, yeah. Being certified in 10 funnels is amazing. I'm I have access to that content just from being an employee here. And it is it's crazy how much content there is to go through and what just one funnel certification requires. So it's very time consuming. But oh, my goodness, it has to be worth it to be certified in 10 different funnels already. It's great. It's great. Fantastic. So what are your your big goals when you are officially certified in all 18 funnels inside the program? I have a couple of business, you know, like businesses or brains. And then I want to start one that I really want to work on for a long time now, called Le Placimo Mindset. You know, it's kind of taking taking my story and positive thinking and making a whole business out of it. Right. The launching courses, membership sites run through all the different funnel times. And generally, these off the leads, please funnel really growing the brain into something amazing with a great message. So that that is my main focus for after my. After I finish, you know, quote unquote, finish the certification program. Awesome. I look forward to seeing you start that. That'll be amazing. So tell me a little bit more about the ClickFunnels culture in the community and what has inspired you to be a part of this program. You said you you attended Funnel Hacking Live. You've been learning from Russell Brunson for a while. What has it been like to be a part of the community here? I see. I was actually. Sorry. I kind of I kind of I start off a little little quick. All right. I actually I attended the. Two CCX coaching program last year. OK. It was awesome. And it really got me involved in the community, which. Really was a blessing, right? I didn't want to let go of that. So I mean, just now being in in the certification program community and being able to talk to everyone and and see all the all the mentors and people high up in the company, right? Working, working with everyone. Um, it's huge. And it really is a family. And I don't know how that go on. Just I'm I'm so appreciate it doing it with everyone. And it's amazing how much we learn from each other. Right. I mean, just a question you would. Well, not you would probably but a question that you might think is simple. And people don't need to hear it. You say it's a dumb question, right? It's just it's so powerful because I mean, a lot of times when I. Whenever I get into the community. A lot of times those questions are the ones that really help me out. Yeah. And it really sparks and needed inspiration. So tell me a little bit more about your personal journey and how. Um, by joining this program and learning about Russell and making the decision to really invest in yourself, because it is it is an investment to do this. Um, and your personal life was your family and everyone around you supportive of doing something like this. Sure. Yeah. They're all supporting me. It's I was really cool with my dad. It's a character. And I love how much. I love how much. Carapace used to study in funnels. Right. Yeah, an example each time. And just seeing that I. I've found my dad and I'm speaking with him. Is about ready to help him out. Um, I'm going to help him grow his practice even more. Amazing. Do you use his business from time to time to practice funnel building? Yeah. Do you ever find other ways to kind of practice your funnel building outside of just what's in the program? Well, for sure. Yeah. It's amazing because now. It's just happening now. Um, I will actually go funnel hack other other websites that I see are are doing better. And I do good or other other funnels out funnel like them. Right. So I'll pull up and do screens and, you know, I follow like in a sense copy. Copy their structure, but then just totally change everything up where it's not really the same thing, but it's the same layer. That is so powerful. I mean, yes, that's not really something I saw myself doing. Yeah, and then I really am. My mind is geared toward design. So I just I see this whole funnel program is just some amazing. It's fun and it really is. Um, another way I do I practice, you know, funnel hacking outside of outside of the program is in a different kind of example. But it's like my my my person. Right. I really enjoy. And the other Lego sets. Right. So building black sets. That is a funnel. And that's a physical a physical funnel. Right. Which I mean, it's just that concept is mind boggling. Right. That's amazing. Um, that and then. Building funnels for my I started a e-commerce store. Me commerce brain last year in the two comic club. Okay. Um, now I really get to build out my cart funnel. The correct way. Yeah. And for for the practice that they have and I'm so kind of lost that. I've seen I'll be lost in in the next two weeks. Yeah. Amazing. So do you see yourself already getting a return on your investment in the program and just being a part of the click funnels community? With that or not with that or not. Yeah. I'm very excited for that. Return. I'm not I'm not there yet. I mean, I think, you know, I'm learning to serve and not worry about financial income from it and same time I'm learning right now. And I'm learning so much. There's no doubt in mind that there's going to be a return return. I'm not even worried about that. I return and then. Tenfold on top of that. Yeah. And I mean, when you compare it to attending college or university, you're spending, you know, even more an investment to go attend school for four, sometimes five or more years to not be able to actually practice what you're studying yet. And that's, you know, four years of a bigger investment. And that doesn't even necessarily mean that you're going to be able to find a career or job opportunity in what you've been studying. So what you're doing with the funnel builder certification program is ensuring that you are getting the education to start creating funnels that you can start doing now the day you get into the program, you can start building funnels for others. You can do it without the program, but the program ensures that you are certified, you know, exactly what you're doing in 18 different types of funnels to build and that, you know, you can become your own agency when you're done with this program. So it's what I think is really cool is you are going to be as successful as the what you're willing to put into it and you can accelerate and get through the program as quickly as you would like to. And the fact that you've been in this program for six months now and you are already certified in 10 as of yesterday is really impressive. Thank you. Yeah. So I would love to know what piece of advice you'd have for somebody who's maybe in a similar situation or they're thinking about making an investment in themselves and they know they want to start an internet business and they don't really know where to go or where to start. Like, what would you tell them? You know, without without being just positive with it, because as I said before, I do have a I'm going on fair advantage. It's fun to say that because the advantages that I have a disability and kind of weird and put two or two like that. But it's unfair advantage to where I I have all the time in the world or not all the time in the world, but I have a lot more time just to sit on my computer and rock out all these funnels. Yeah, super cool. But you know, when it comes down to what I really had to learn and what I want to understand is you just need to go for it. Right. I mean, again, no over thinking. Just build the funnel. You know, let it fly. I just, you know, working on working on my own phones or my own brand like the we were talking about the e-commerce, the card funnel that I'm building. I've been trying to build that for a couple of months now. Why is it thanks to me because I'm overthinking it? All the all the all the certificates that I've gotten, they do. Really, I mean, it's a good the award at the end getting all those certifications. It's a good perk. It's fun perk. Um, you know, I was like, shoot, I'm not actually I'm going to have my whole family with me at the live this year in September. So like, right, guys, you'll see me get that award at the at the event this year. And then I clicked it was like, too. I'm gonna get them all done. Yeah. Um, I'm on my way. Why? Because I'm not over thinking now, you know, I'm just gonna do it. And, you know, I'm, I'm so excited to take that same way of thinking. Putting into my own stuff on it. As I held service and done. Just to build the bill. Yeah. The bill. I want to go. I go from there because I mean, at the same time with so much testing, and he's been done. We really just put something out there. Yeah. That's powerful. It reminds me of a quote that I read recently that was something like, um, the best way to get ahead is by starting sooner. And that reminds me a lot of what you're doing is you have all of this time that you can dedicate to learning the program and understanding being certified and building this for other people. And that is your advantage. Instead of having a disability, it's almost like you have this special ability to spend so much time studying and doing the work and understanding how to break things and put them back together. And you mentioned liking Legos and how it's the building blocks. You're putting things together that, that work. And I think that there's, there's something really powerful about that. I would say that you definitely have a special ability and being able to get ahead and spend all that time getting those certifications. And I know that it's going to pay off 10 fold for you because people are going to love to go to you knowing that you spent so much time dedicating to putting in the work. And I think that that's really, really powerful. That's, that's amazing. Thank you. Yeah. Is there anything else you'd like to share? Um, yeah. Going, just going through all this, you know, it really opens up the mind all the possibilities of other sales. You're right. Like affiliate marketing. I mean, I am, I'm so determined to climb the ladder and your equitables and, you know, get the dream car award for affiliate sales. Um, to come, award me in beyond, right? Um, it's amazing. You used to see how the process works in every single funnel. I just, I can't get over it. And I mean, I just, I am poor. I'm poor out there. It's to get in the program, not only getting it, but achieved the whole thing. Yeah. It's amazing. Well, thanks for that. And I look forward to seeing you at funnel hacking live in September and getting that award for being certified. That's incredible. Um, is there any place online people can go to learn more about you or to find you as a funnel builder? I appreciate that little plug. Um, I want to say yes. So I'm going to say this because I'm going to watch it today. Um, towards the affiliate in email thing on Instagram. I don't know the handle is going to be yet. We can include it. We'll include it in the description when you decide. We'll make sure that we have it in the video and that we also put it in the description for you. Awesome. Yeah. So I'll let you know what it is later on. Um, but I got this little brand that I'm working on for the affiliate sales for three funnels in this can be, you know, it's going to be talking about funnels and going through the whole process with, with everyone. Yeah. The brand is called funnel crackers. Funnel crackers. And then I mentioned before my, my positive motivation and manifestation brain is going to be on the placebo mindset. So I'm going to, I'm going to work on watching those and let you know. Amazing. Well, thanks for sharing that with us. Thank you so much for sharing your story and the things that you've been through and what brought you here today. I'm certainly inspired by it. And I look forward to being able to refer people to you as a funnel builder and for you to start your business once you're officially certified in all 18 funnels, Marcello. Thanks so much for being with me today. Thank you. Thank you. This was incredible. Thanks.
