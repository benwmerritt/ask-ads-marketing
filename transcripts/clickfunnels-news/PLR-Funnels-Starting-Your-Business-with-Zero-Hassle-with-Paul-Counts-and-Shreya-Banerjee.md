PLR Funnels really is, like I said, I mean, not to overhype it. It is the fastest, easiest way for somebody to get going, though, because a lot of times people, their share funnels that are out there, then those are wonderful because they give you a foundation. But what makes this even different is they get access to the products. Like they not only get access to the share, they get access to the full product, full lead magnet, the email swipes that would go into it. So the five part email sequence, the social media posts that go into it, product graphics. I mean, it's all done. It's a whole business right there. It's a whole business times 50. So I mean, that's why so many people have been so excited about PLR Funnels because it is an easy way to fast track your business. Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm joined by Paul Counts and Shreya Banerjee. Paul and Shreya are co-founders of Marketing Counts and their partners with ClickFunnels on PLR Funnels, which you might have heard of. Their methods and strategies have generated well over $100 million for their clients, customers and their businesses. They've been online entrepreneurs for a combined 30 plus years and they've taught over 100,000 customers globally. Their Marketing Counts curriculum was in over 140 high schools and they have taught marketing in numerous colleges throughout the country. So cool. Can't wait to talk about this. Thank you both for joining me today. Hey, thank you for having us. We're so excited to be here. Of course. Can you both tell me just kind of how you got started in business together and what you're doing now? Yeah, absolutely. So in 2018, we had both been doing business separately and I'll have Shreya share her story bit, but I've been doing this since 1998. So I was 13 starting out in school. So I've been doing this business for quite a while. In 2018 though, we became partners. Came partners. I was speaking at an event. Shreya was attending the event, learning marketing, affiliate marketing. And I decided like there was something I was missing in my business. And one of those key pieces was, you know, structure and somebody that's had a bit of a corporate background because she has a little different. I've always been an entrepreneur and we all know how that can be for some of us. So, so I decided to, you know, we decided to partner up and it's been amazing. She's added a lot of structure that I needed because I've always just been the fly by the seat of my pants. Solarpreneur, you know, that I think a lot of us have. And so she brought that structure and we've done amazing things since partnering up and been able to get into high schools and curriculum and expand, you know, our training courses and things like that. So I'll let Shreya share her background a bit, but. Very cool. Yeah. So I actually don't have a traditional marketing background at all. I'm a mechanical engineer by trade. And then actually went into engineering and worked in a corporate setting for over 12 years. So it's, you know, something I was good at, something I enjoyed, but the problem was once my son was born about eight years ago, and I went back to work, even though I enjoyed it, the structure of the work was too much. Like going there for seven 30 standup meetings and, you know, not being able to take time off of work because my son went to daycare and then, you know, he would get sick. So that kind of brought me back to internet marketing because I used to do this back in college a little bit. You still like, you know, made a few thousand dollars. I was happy, but then, you know, everybody said you go graduate and go get a job. And that's exactly what I did. And I'm happy. So that was a turning point in my career, almost to say, no, I need to do something else. I need to get my time back. And that's why I came back into it about seven years ago. And then five years ago, Paul and I met when it's just been a wonderful dream. You can call it or a roller coaster, but it's been one good thing after another. And we were very grateful for that. Yeah. So it sounds like you probably, even though you came from a background of like working with a place that had a lot of like structure, you at least still bring that to Paul, probably as an entrepreneur who's probably always on the go. I imagine that you're like, more of the systems person. Is that right? I am. I'm more operations. As far as structure goes, you know, we kind of have a schedule in place, but we're really in charge of our own schedules. Like if we're both night owls, we're not morning people at all. So majority of our work gets done at night when everybody is asleep, but you still know what exactly needs to get done versus, you know, that, that little structure, but you still have freedom, complete freedom over your time. Yeah. That sounds like a perfect dynamic. Okay. I want to talk a little bit about PLR funnels. And that's only because I got to see, you know, what you guys did with Russell and then I jumped into the product myself just to kind of poke around because there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of fun stuff to have there. So can you tell us like what got you started on this trajectory of like doing affiliate marketing and PLR funnels and how you ended up partnering with Russell on this? Yeah, absolutely. So since, you know, you heard my story earlier, I started in 1998 and I've been doing this a long time. So in 2006, I actually launched the first private, so privately where I'd started in 2004, somebody decided to do ebooks and basically create content that other people could license. So it's been around for a while. The concept has been. So in 2006, I was I was already selling some PLR ebooks and doing some stuff with private labor rights just to get my business off the ground because it is the fastest, easiest way for anybody to get started because you're buying a license to use somebody else's content. That's really what it is. So it's a legal way to use other people's content. And that's what makes it so powerful. So 2006, I decided to be the first person to launch a video course on PLR. So I became the very first person to launch it. You can even go back and read the threads in the old warrior form way back when, and I launched that in 2006. And Russell had actually known about PLR way back then. And so he's kind of followed that trajectory of like PLR and we had connected in the past on certain projects. And then I became a partner on a program called Nitchology. And Russell mentioned it on the webinar, but his father's course on stop snoring was actually something from a Nitchology product. So we were visiting Boise. We're hanging out with Russell and he just said, he's like, Hey, so many needs to do this. PLR funnels, you're the guys like you've been in this space for so long with PLR. You know, you're one of the experts on it. So let's make this happen. So then we brainstormed, came up with the idea of, you know, here's what we're going to put together. We're going to give people these funnels over time, create all these different products. We mapped it all out and decided to launch with it. And so a lot of it was just, you know, the partnership came about because we were intentional, we provided value in the market to begin with. I mean, that's that's a big part, right? If you're not providing value, you're not going to get to be able to partner with anybody really. So you just have to provide value in your business. And amazing things happen when you do that, even if you're not necessarily seeking it. You know, we weren't necessarily seeking this. The opportunity came towards us, but it all stemmed from years and years of efforts of putting in good, good products and good value and constantly delivering. And so, but that's how it all came about. PLR funnels really is, like I said, I mean, not to overhype it. It is the fastest, easiest way for somebody to get going, though, because a lot of times people, their share funnels that are out there, then those are wonderful because they give you a foundation. But what makes this even different is they get access to the products. Like they not only get access to the share, they get access to the full product, the full lead magnet, the email swipes that would go into it. So the five part email sequence, the social media posts that go into it, the product graphics. I mean, it's all done. It's a whole business right there. It's a whole business times 50. So I mean, that's why so many people have been so excited about PLR funnels, because it is an easy way to fast track your business. And you don't decree anything yourself. Like for all those people who are like, I'm an entrepreneur at heart. I just don't have anything to sell. Right. It's the right thing. That's it. And that's what makes it so great. I mean, we had a few people that were skeptical that joined or were thinking about joining and they're like, is this legal? Like I was like, yes, it's completely legal. Like we're giving you the rights. In fact, when they log in, they get a license to use these products. And then of course, on the webinar, you'll hear about all the other bonuses. We were able to give away the entire Nitchology library, which is amazing products. And then Russell gave away self-improvement millionaire, which was his version of PLR and all self-improvement products with private label rights that he helped write. Oh, to get that. Yeah. So they can go to plrfunnels.com, plrfunnels.com. And there's a webinar you can watch. And so you'll just want to sign up for that. There's a webinar you can watch. There's a really cool offer after you sign up where you actually can get a chance to get two free funnels. As long as you sign up with ClickFunnels, there's two free funnels waiting for you. And then you can watch the webinar and we'll show you how to get all 50 of them plus all the bonuses. So it's pretty cool. That's amazing. What a deal. And so I'm going to ask a question that you guys probably get asked all the time. But I think this will be really beneficial because we get these questions in our community when people talk about affiliate marketing. I know there's a lot more hype around it lately. And, you know, you mentioned PLRfunnels has been around since what, 2004? Yeah, yeah. Probably have no idea because I feel like it really just started blowing up fairly recently. Like I didn't know it was around in 2004. But there's also a lot of popularity and a lot of buzz around people talking about MRR, which is master resell rights. Can you tell us if there is a difference between the two and if there is what they are? Yes. So actually, I was going to bring that up because people think it's something brand new and it's been there since like the beginning of Internet. Unfortunately, things recycle. And this is another one of those things, you know, the 80s fashions coming back and the 90s fashions coming back. So PLR is coming back. And the only difference between the two of PLR is you have rights to edit the documents and then pass it on to your customers. But your customers cannot change anything on that document. So you cannot pass on the Word document or the Google document. It'll have to be a PDF version, right? Versus the MRR is its master resell rights. So you can actually sell PLR for that particular product. OK, so it's almost like you have a little bit more ownership in authority of what you want to do with PLR. Like you can make some adjustments and edits, but for the people who are buying it and they want to resell it, then it stays how it is. OK. Yes. And see, the downside of master resell rights is you can't make any edits. And so like the person that sells you the master resell rights, there's nothing wrong with them doing this. But a lot of times it'll be their links and the ebook. It'll be their links and the ebook, their affiliate links. So their incentive is to get you to buy this product that you can resell. But enclosed in that PDF because you can't, you know, edit it or anything. Enclosed in that PDF are their affiliate links, their referral links to their website. Whereas with PLR, you could take that edit it, put your own links in there if there's a recommendation for a product and you can edit it to make it your own. Because if there's maybe a chapter in one of these master resell rights ebooks that you don't agree with fully and you're like, oh, I wish I could just change this just a little bit, then you can't, you know, but with PLR, you have full reign to do that. You can make the edits, you can make that change. And so PLR really is better in that regard just because of that. Now, we do both. Like I've sold master resell rights. It's been around since early 2000s as well. So that's been a big part. It just it's it's amazing. It's like fashion, you know, it always circles back. So yeah, if you can even value in that then, especially if like you, if you get to change and add your own affiliate links in there, you know, you get to own those residuals rather than making passive income for somebody else who sold it. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And that's and that's their incentive, right? To sell it that way. There's nothing wrong with that. They're smart for doing that. But yeah, yeah. Very fascinating. So tell me how you both got involved in using click funnels for your own business. Yeah. So in I mean, I got started in, I mean, we I've been doing the funnels for so long, right? So I mean, at one point I was building my own by hand, right? Using Composer, which is a very old HTML editor. I mean, so the old wissy wig editor that I don't know what that means. Yeah. Old what you see. Yeah. You basically had to write your own code and that was very tedious and very difficult. And so when click funnels launched, it was just something that made life so much easier. And, you know, I just obviously being in the space, I got emails about it, learned about it and got an account and and it was amazing. And it made life so much easier to build landing pages, to build optin pages, fast tracked everything I was doing and, you know, just never looked back. It was it was amazing. It was a great tool to use. And, you know, was a huge, huge fan of it and absolutely love it. And it's been a big part of my business ever since. So. Very cool. And I know that I mentioned this in the intro, but you guys have your curriculum that was actually being taught in schools. Like, how did that all come to fruition? Yeah. So that was a partnership with Deca. Let Shreya kind of share that. It happened during during actually COVID time and we saw a need in the market when all the schools were were out of school. And so we just kind of saw a need and we went for it. Wow. And we've noticed that a lot of people that go in there with the wrong mindset, like I need to sell, I need to get here, I need to get there. Right. If you just lead in with I'm going to just provide value. Lots of good things happen to you, like even without you even trying. And this is one of those opportunities that came about when COVID happened, schools were down. We were seeing how can we get back, right? How can we give back because we have those expertise. Nobody else had these expertise. We've been doing this for so long. Online classes, we had courses ourselves. So we actually asked and reached out to Deca, which is. Is it entrepreneurship program in schools? It's nationwide. Yes. It's nationwide. And I was part of it in high school myself. So we reached out to them and said, Hey, do you guys need any help? And they were struggling. The marketing classes were struggling to come up with courses. So we said, Hey, we have this amazing five week program. Would you like to partner with it? So they partnered with us and then we got into these schools and teachers loved it. The kids loved it. It was a live class. They actually helped small businesses at that point that were struggling and closing doors to get them online. Yeah, we had some helping a local pizza shop. We had them help the local furniture shop. Like it was amazing to watch. Like they were literally taking what we learned. A couple of kids turned into a summer job even took what we learned. High school kids and went in and we're doing Google business and SEO for for local businesses from this training. And wow. And what an interesting time to be doing that too. Like the whole world is kind of shifting. And you guys like essentially tapped into a market that probably not many internet marketers thought to do, which is actually teaching students in school. You're right. Right. Yeah. And that was something we thought of because we can, you know, we have a very unique approach because in school, unfortunately, they teach it backwards, you know, so the reason we are big proponents of ClickFunnels is because our whole philosophy and everything we do. So we we also serve as fractional CMOs, so fractional chief marketing officers for many different brands. And we've done work for everybody from, you know, large influencers all the way to, you know, large companies that are publicly traded. And so we go in and we'll fix some of their marketing strategy. And our process is very similar. So our process actually is we go in and we say, we're going to look at the foundation, you know, fix your foundation first. And that's your landing page, making sure it converts, making sure it's dialed in. And you're going to send all your traffic to this landing page to get conversions or at least fix the current pages you have. And that's where ClickFunnels comes in, because that makes it way easy to optimize those things. And that's why, you know, we love teaching ClickFunnels because of that reason. And so we a lot of times people are taught in college, the traffic first mentality of, well, just get traffic, throw a bunch of money at it. The problem is most businesses, when they're starting out, don't have multi-million dollar budgets or billion dollar advertising budgets. And so 90% of college students leave college with an understanding of marketing that only works if they're working at a Fortune 500 company or a large company. It does not work for the average small business because they, the large companies we've learned, they don't care about conversions. They really don't. They just throw money at a wall and hope it sticks. And then they'll optimize later. Sometimes the conversions are 0.1% and they're very happy with it. And they're happy. Yeah, so just won't work for a small business. Yeah. So when we go in and get them a 10% conversion or 20% conversion, they think like, wow, you guys are like magicians. You know, when the reality is we're just taking basic marketing concepts because we are big proponents of if you don't, you don't need to spend millions of millions of dollars to make something work, right? You just have to test it, tweak it, you know, make it fit. So that was the philosophy we taught. We thought there was a gap of the market. And like Shreya said, we went in and we're always doing the long game, which can be frustrating at times, but that leads to amazing things because we are the only people that I know of in this industry that can say that we have curriculum in 140 high schools and top colleges. And so it really has added a layer of credibility for us. So even though maybe we didn't get paid directly from the schools, we gave so much value that now we can use that on our resume and it sets us apart from anybody else. And so that's what I think anybody can do as an entrepreneur is find ways to add value to separate yourself from the market. Yeah, it's incredible. And it really is unheard of when I saw that you guys had, you know, your curriculum in schools. I'm like, this is the thing that people just aren't doing. Right. Teaching these students, especially during a pandemic, did it seem like they were pretty open to adapting to shifting things to online? And also, was it kind of an adjustment of like using traditional websites that maybe they were taught to create before versus online digital marketing funnels and actually getting the conversions that they deserve? It was a little different. Yeah, for the kids, you know, especially like, and a lot of times the kids and the teachers both, you know, we had some teachers question things like, well, wouldn't I just send them to my main homepage or wouldn't I send them here? Or, you know, like stuff that everybody's taught, right? They don't actually, we realize teach like the foundation of having a website, especially at the younger kids. They we had a lot of pushback by saying, I have a huge social media following. Why do I need a funnel or a page? Right. Like that social media following can go away any minute. Yeah. Whenever the company decides to change another rhythm and you're done. And that's the concept. Exactly. You don't own the audience. But that's the concept that was very new to them. And they got frustrated over it. But I think they saw the light at the end of the tunnel. But yeah, that was that's the common mistake that everybody goes in there with. Yeah, great point. Yeah, I think the biggest thing was like the people would grasp it and think about it. And it was very unique. And we really had to teach people away from social media, like not that we're anti social. Social media is amazing and you can make a lot of money on it. But the problem is if you're just relying on your social media traffic, that yeah, go away. Yeah, yeah. It's a tool to get them to your funnel because once they get into your ClickFunnels funnel or wherever, they're you now own that data. Yeah. If they're on Instagram, you don't own that Instagram and Facebook on that, not you. And so a lot of people want to just focus there, focus there. But you're an algorithm, you know, we're in ClickFunnels, we say one funnel away. On social media, you're an algorithm change away from not having a following. So that's that's probably the biggest thing we teach people is, you know, get them from with your social platforms, use it, leverage it, get the traffic, all you want from it, run paid ads, everything you can do on those. We support that, we do it, we love it. But get them to your funnel because getting them in the whole. Yeah. And I feel like that generation is also they're so great at monetizing social media. So probably gets a little bit confusing. Well, if I can monetize my Instagram, isn't this where my business is? But what they don't realize is like they could 10 X that monetization by actually owning their audience and having a funnel and, you know, collecting leads. Oh, big, big time. I mean, are one of the things we always laugh about are some of these reality stars that all of a sudden blow up, right? So we've all seen them, they're on a reality show. All of a sudden they go from a thousand Instagram followers to 500,000 Instagram followers because they were on this big reality show, right? And you go and I'll look at their funnels or their links or whatever, either a, they don't even have a link to anything. Or if they do, it goes to the most awful page you've ever seen in your life that has nothing to do to help them. Or it's a list of here's my Amazon affiliate wishlist or Amazon links or something. Nobody's sending them to a funnel, you know, and it's just crazy. Which at that point, I imagine it's like, oh, it's going to be so easy to help you. Yes. Yes. Like it is. It makes it so much easier to see that. And they're just not taught that, you know, everybody is taught that, you know, social media is where it's at. And again, we love it. You need it, but it's not going to always be there. So yeah, you got to you got to own that data. That's the most important thing. Yeah. So I always like to ask this question to anyone who's been familiar with the ClickFunnels software. Do you both in your own business have a funnel that is your favorite or that you find the most impactful? Yeah, definitely. So I mean, for us, it's the it's the webinar funnel. So of course, I mean, if you go to PLR funnels, you'll see that like the webinar funnel is has been the most effective. And then right now we just launched some supplements as well. So not only do you have PLR funnels, but we're launching other brands. So we're selling weight loss supplements that, you know, we are working with a doctor on that he created these supplements. And we're using the generic, you know, a sales page funnel, everything, you know, lead magnet to a sales page, you know, that flows. It's not a webinar and loving it. And so we use them both. We have different use cases for what we use, but definitely the webinar funnel you can't go wrong with. And the most, you know, I think that the thing a lot of people get confused about is there's so much there, there can be so much that it could feel overwhelming. Like where do I even start? And I think the biggest thing is if you just get started, it's amazing what happens. And if you just like started the base, started with the most basic funnel possible, capture that data that we were just talking about, send them to an offer page and then let the rest sort itself out. And if you don't start somewhere, it's going to be hard to do all the other pieces that, you know, Russell teaches and that ClickFunnels teaches. But once you get that first funnel started, it's amazing what happens because now you have something to work on. And I think the biggest thing we teach is you're guaranteed one thing is if you don't have something live, you're going to get zero leads and zero sales. And I think that's the biggest takeaway. I hope somebody gets from this is that if it's not live, you're guaranteed to have nothing coming in. So just get it live and then tweak. That's why they call them funnel hackers because they're tweaking, testing, tweaking, testing. So you just dropped advice that I feel like everybody gives when I ask this next question and that is just to get started. I feel like that's like the easiest thing to share with people, but it also was those things that it seems so simple, but so many people just don't take action. It's a great piece of advice. But I want to ask you both from your own perspective, like for fellow entrepreneurs or people who maybe want to get started in affiliate marketing or just want to create an online business, what are the biggest pieces of advice that you guys would give them? I'll give you from an example of hurdles. So there are two hurdles that I see most common amongst the PLR funnel users. And actually the entire population of entrepreneurs, but like from just PLR funnel's point of view, first, everybody wants to make things super pretty. They don't feel comfortable launching something until it's super pretty. And you don't have to wait. You know, yeah, things don't need to be pretty. As a matter of fact, we have shared this in our coaching calls with the PLR funnel group that the page that converts the most for us, that the highest conversion rate is from like 1999. I make fun of it all the time. It's Paul's page is the most basic, not pretty page, but it out converts everything. And we have tested it up and down like over the years. So don't get hung up on that prettiness factor. And then we're just flashiness factor, right? And then the second hurdle everybody has is I got to automate everything. I got to make sure everything works perfectly before I let it out. And how would you know if everything works perfectly? If you don't start testing it, if you don't start driving traffic to it, right? Like just let it out there. Things are going to break. It's never going to be perfect. It's going to break. You will know what your failure points are. You will, you have to start slowly. So don't wait for that perfect thing where you're not a big company. Don't try to be a big company. You're you. Just let it out there and start driving traffic, start getting conversions and then tweak like a funnel hacker would. Great advice. And I think, you know, being authentically you is what everybody's individual superpower is. Like there's something to be said about just being yourself. And I love that you touched on the flashiness aspect because even Russell himself will say like, oh, that's too pretty or like, I don't think that's going to convert. And if you go inside of ClickFunnels 2.0, we have an email template, which is called Russell Brunson style. It's just tax. I love that one. I love that one. Yeah, that one is probably my favorite one to use because it's that it's simple, it's basic. Exactly. You know, and people over, overdo it. And I love what Shreya said about the automation. I mean, just to echo on that, I mean, it is crazy to think that if you have no leads that you need to have everything fully automated. Now ClickFunnels 2.0 gives you all that capability. So use it, leverage it down the line at the bare minimum, set it up so that it delivers your lead magnet, you know, and your workflow. And then you're good to go. A lot of times people want to automate things like, well, if somebody clicks this link, then I want them to do this. And if somebody does this, then I want them to do that. And it's like, you have no leads yet. Don't do that yet. Like, you know, get your first thousand leads at the point you'll know when it's time to automate. That's what we've learned. You'll know when it's time to automate, when it becomes a nightmare for you to have to manually do something, then you automate. But I think a lot of people, you know, we, and we have, we've, we've talked to our coaching students, we've talked to our, you know, PLR Funnels group and we get them to realize like, it's okay to start running your traffic with how it is now, like get the leads, your lead magnets there, your offers there, your sales page is there. When you would get tired of manually sending them something, then automate it. And again, I'm not saying you, if you know how to do it or want to do it, by all means do it. But if that's a point of like, I'm not going to launch until that's done, then for sure. And I'm sure so many people get lost in that of like, I'm not going to start driving traffic to this until I have everything automated. And it's like, you're missing the point. You want the leads first. And then once you have those leads, you'll know what to do with them. Exactly. Yeah, you'll know. And then when it gets painful, then you'll automate. I love that. Like build up your nightmare. It's a good problem to have. We told somebody recently, they were trying to automate all their sales and they had only made, they only made one or two sales. And we were like, okay, I said, well, instead of doing that, I said, they're still getting the lead magnet. They're like, well, yeah. I said, but I don't want them to see this email of this. And I was like, well, that's too much. I was like, get your first. We don't even do that. We don't even go that far. You know, like get your first hundred, your first thousand sales, then worry about that. And that's a good problem to have. You know, I love that. Create your own nightmare. That was a good way to put it. Yeah. And I liked you that it goes back to what you said earlier, Shreya, about like, you get to be yourself. Like, and I said, you know, that's kind of your superpower, right? And at the beginning, when you aren't overwhelmed with the amount of leads that you have, you get to insert your personality and yourself a little bit more into that. And if you're not automating everything, there's more room for you to be authentic with your audience and you get to send out broadcasts and put, like, make things timely and. Yeah. Seasonal and that people can really start to relate to you that way. And I think that that's super important as well. Yeah, that is so powerful. Cool. Well, this was awesome. I thank you guys for all of the advice and the insights. This, I could go on with this conversation all day, but where can people go to learn more about you and your business? I know that you mentioned plrfunnels.com, which hopefully people will check out and see your webinar funnel there, but where else can people find you guys? Yeah. So we have two other spots that can find us. One is if you want to see that really ugly landing page, Trey, I was talking about. I do. And it's actually built in ClickFunnels. So it's built in ClickFunnels. It's sixfigureinsider.com. So it's number six figureinsider.com. It's one of our giveaway there, but it's a really ugly page. And I custom built that in ClickFunnels. So you can at least get an idea of it. And then marketingcounts.com is another spot they can go to learn about us. Awesome. This is a great conversation. You guys, thank you so much for being with me today. We'll probably have to have you on ClickFunnels radio podcast because this conversation is fun and you guys both have a lot to offer. Thank you for sharing everything today and we'll talk to you soon. All right. Thank you so much.
