## Transcript
We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Fuddle Hackers and these are our stories. Hey everyone! How's it going? I'm awesome. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm pumped. Yes, I'm pumped. What's happening this week? Have you ever been in a club? Have you guys been paying attention to anything that's been going on this week? Because our brains are being filled up with no points. Oh my gosh. You're already seeing it now, but we have to tell them what we're doing. We've got to make sure you guys are all in the know on Funnel Hacker TV. But first of all, I'm Susan Lennardsen. I'm Ben Moot. And you guys just saw a little bit of a sneak peek of what's happening this week. I think they might be wrapping it up for the day today. But before we get into our big takeaways and what we're talking about, make sure you are subscribed to the texting. You just have to text FHTV to 208-231-3797 and you will get notified. I saw notification get sent out like 15 minutes ago saying we were going live. So they're getting sent out every time. If you guys got it, let us know. If you didn't get it, let us know. We'll figure that out. And then also you can go and watch all of the past episodes of Funnel Hacker TV at funnelhacker.tv or funnelhackertv.com, whatever way you want to go. Which also includes a bunch of stuff from Russell on that page, which is awesome. And yeah. Okay. All right. So Ben, what is happening right now? If it's not, I mean, everyone probably should know by now, but just in case you don't. Everybody should know. If you haven't noticed, there's been a lot of streaming into the ClickFunnels group lately. And it's been streaming across everywhere. I've been shocked how much they blasted this. Okay. So if you haven't noticed, there is an event going on right now. We have Pedro Adel teaching how to do challenges with Russell Brunson. And it is one of the coolest, if not the coolest event ever. There are so many different ideas that have been brought up that are new and that are different and that are kind of changing the way that I understand everything and how I see everything. And it's throwing me off. It is so, so cool. So first off, if you guys have not seen it, the challenge secrets masterclass is going on right now. It's been going on yesterday. It's been going on today. Let's go ahead and remove that for a moment. That's causing me a lot of stress. I actually had to like jump. I was on the VIP on my phone listening and I was like, shoot, it's not over yet. I got to jump on the Funnel Hacker TV. I'm missing the end. They might be wrapped up by now, but they were still going with the VIP when I jumped over to here to get ready for this live. But it's okay, Susan, because VIP is recorded. And if you are a member of VIP, you get lifetime access to it. So guys, if you've missed anything, a couple of things. Number one, go and sign up at challenge secrets masterclass.com. Okay. Number two, then what you need to do is go and become a VIP so that we have this for life and you get access to the VIP sessions going forward. Number three, take massive notes. This is all action focused. And so Susan and I have been taking notes literally. And so we're going to be talking through exactly what that is. Yes. So, all right. You want to kick us off with day one? Yeah. So, so Russell messages me like five minutes. No, it wasn't five minutes. Like a half hour before he goes live and is like, Ben, I need to know the stats for all of our challenges. Like how many options have we gotten for this stuff? If you can find it great. If not, we'll figure it out. I'm like, what? And so I'm organizing all these things and I had to go run grab stats and these are the stats that she quoted from stage. Challenges are the number one funnel that Russell is launching right now in all of his business. It's the way and this is how we do it. So if you're missing it, don't miss it. Go sign up. But it was we had 125,000 people go through the one funnel away challenge. We had 221,000 people sign up for the first funnel challenge when we launched. We've we almost have over 500,000 now. No, over 400. We have over 400,000 now. And the five day lead challenge was that which was a free challenge. We had 417,000 people register for that event. Like ever since 2000, and I think it was 19 when it was started 19 throughout today, you can still sign up for it. It is crazy how many people have gone through this event. Challenges are the bees knees. They are what works and it is so cool to see Pedro Adow who has made challenges work for with or with Tony Robbins with Dean Grasio. See with with massive big names out there in the industry that you all know. And I think to see him to be able to actually dive in and teach this at a basic level. So you understand it, but then for the others of us who are nerds and might be funnel hackers for life. It's like realizing those little things that tweak those little tweaks as little adjustments that just swing the door so much more. I think that's how Barry's talked about it today. Like that looking for that small hinge point that just opens up the door and floods you with with all the all the attention and cash that you're looking for. Yeah, I heard the stats Russell shared those stats yesterday on the day one. And it was like I blew my mind I'm like oh my gosh like we don't normally usually hear the numbers behind not not monetary numbers but like attendance numbers for events like that and I was like oh my gosh like that's insane of how well that that has worked for them and not just one challenge but the multiple challenges that they've launched over the years. No, absolutely. And so like, so Pedro goes into what his strategies are and we're not going to recap everything like if you want it you need to be there. He recap day one pretty well today if you guys just need to jump in you can Susan I know that you're out in Colorado you had stuff that you were up to yesterday so you just watch a day one this morning. In order to be able to catch up. Okay, you can too. This is really really good what stood out to you because I've got my notes but what stood out to you for data. Okay, so day one. If you're familiar at all with running any sort of event or challenge like this. Or even like any sort of program or you've taught somebody or whatever. So usually you have to start out with some mindset stuff you have to overcome their personal beliefs about like, can I do this can I not do this is this going to work for me. Some of some of those objections so day one was a lot of that type of content of like helping people to realize like this is like this is what you need to focus on if you know if you're all interested in running a challenge this is for you and here's all the reasons and it was Russia Russell sharing those stats and Pedro talking about other people that he's worked with saying like this is who I've helped like they did it and look at how successful they are, and it's really just intended right to help people understand like this is possible. Yep. Absolutely. And what about you. So for me like he talked about a couple things. So he is working on a book right now at the same time maybe that he's played with. And so he's been having a couple of doodles created and one of them. He's the one was a speed of trust and how a challenge increases the trust value but the other one was the influence keys. And it was a Peter Chial Dini, if I remember the name, and he talked about how like there's these five levers of influence that you're able to pull. Each one you become the influential character doesn't matter if you start without a list doesn't matter if you start you know without any reputation if nobody knows your face if you're not really good on camera, you leverage these five things and it just, it takes off like your, your influence is automated, you don't have to like try to work this in and so that was really, really cool. The thing that shocked me was how heavy he was on funnels versus challenge funnels, right, like the whole value ladder thing. Yeah, that was surprising to me like he was like you don't need the value ladder you need a challenge and the challenge will be your whole value ladder. Yeah, it was a challenge, but heavy, even today like talking about the different types of challenges and offers you can do that would like make the entire value ladder done in, in like, two events, one of it, two events, Max, it was really, really cool. Yeah, I was just gonna say like so that whole value ladder thing like okay if you're in the comments and you're watching this right now like tell us in the comments if you were blown away about when Pedro was, was sharing like, here's your value ladder and then like challenge written all across the top of it like here's how your challenges your entire thing now right. Like, did that blow you away like let us know in the comments for sure because I was like I drew it all out. And I was like, this is awesome like I never thought about it that way I knew it was an awesome lead gen and awesome to like get get the initial sales going but I never thought about it being able to replace almost your entire value ladder. No, well, you saying your entire value. Yeah, I mean it's doable and it's a virtual event so it's totally possible but it was it's a it's a different shift for sure. I think what was really cool what blue Pedro's mind is what Russell said how he ran his free challenge to his paid challenge. And like how he did that just blue blue Pedro's mind and Pedro was like, we need a doodle for this like we need to show this so today like that was one of the main doodles is the free challenge to a pay challenge and how you run that and how you how you set that up and so day one was awesome. The other last thing that I thought was interesting is how Pedro gives away an award if you make $1,000. Like we have a two comic club awards but he has like awards for 1000 for 10,000 for 100,000 for a million for 10 million he has awards for every single step in order to make sure that you gain that momentum and that belief because it's hard not to make $1,000 if you do a challenge and you get attention and you follow what he's teaching all four days, five days. Yeah, yeah, I mean that's so true and I, I think that's one of the programs that I've been through also did something similar, and it was highly motivating, like, oh, like, I got to have that award. A lot of people are motivated by that type of stuff some people are not, but a lot of people are. And so it is like, people like recognition for the hard work that they're putting in, even if they're not to the point of like the monetary success the financial success that they want at least are being recognized for the hard work that they are putting forth and that keeps you going. Exactly. Now here's here's the thing guys really quick. I can't remember if you guys got the text right down giveaway if we promise to giveaway let me know because I just realized that that text came out and I don't want to like hold up my phone in front of you guys you guys tell me if there was a giveaway right giveaway in the comments. If not, then we'll do it next time scouts on it. Okay, but if there was if there was a giveaway, let us know because I've got stock options and things we can do something like that. But I got the text and I see the words giveaway on it. Okay, all right then the giveaway must be required. Okay. Okay. All right then so really quick as we're going through this right down what your biggest takeaways are and at the end we're just going to scroll through and grab one of your names and give you guys a click funnels water bottle so that sound good click funnels water bottle. Is it like this one here that I love so much. I want it to be. There's there's two or three. There's so many. There's the loss. Well there's styles that I haven't seen before and I must swag a holic. So yeah, so if you guys keep commenting do that you'll be great. Yes, I promise to give away Jeff. Thank you so much. All right, cool. So day one was really cool. Yes, all of his stuff is really scrappy agreed a K. Day two has been really different. It's the number one he recapped everything at the beginning, but he talked he brought on Barry and Barry kind of blew my brain. I think she blew everybody's brains. She's in VIP they did VIP just a second ago and they talked about how to actually make your event sell or make your challenge sell an event and how different an event is from a challenge but not really. And how you can do it from your home and what you do with it. It was. I blew my brain. It's awesome. Yeah, that was one of the things that I wrote down to so I have a lot of day two notes. I love Barry. I actually was it in Mexico was she at Mastermind and Paradise. I'm like I know I've seen her speak recently and now I'm like everything's blending together and I don't know what's what. But I reason I saw her like that was my first exposure to Barry Baumgartner and then she blew me away then she blew me away again today and and one of the things that she was talking about. Yeah, like the live event so it's they laid out like here's the typical challenge funnel and what you're doing what you're selling with it like Pedro laid that out and then he laid out like here's a live event challenge and they're like almost identical. It's just you're changing what you're selling and it was like duh like of course you could use that and so what my takeaway was you know how we were just talking about how a challenge funnel can replace your value ladder. Well I think it might require and I could be wrong on this but my my aha was like oh challenge funnel for like the bottom half maybe the bottom three quarters of my value ladder depending on how I'm going about it and then another challenge funnel for like the top half of my value ladder and so you might have like two happening but that was just an idea I had that doesn't mean go and do it listen to Pedro. No it's not works like you talked about how the best lead magnet that you can possibly create is a challenge. And so it's a lead magnet that gets people in and then you can sell you have your trip wire and then you can sell of course 997 on the back end and then he's talking about how you can through an event ticket in there as well so that way it's not a big deal. It automatically puts people into the next next event slash challenge and that sells the high ticket so exactly. There was one of the things so kind of what about what I was just talking about I'm going to tell you like the next person but we can come back to very if we need to also another person that joined today was Terry. Sorry Teresa Todd and this like seriously like I'm in disbelief about what she has done with a challenge funnel because they laid out some numbers and she was doing a challenge for she does a challenge funnel and it's your typical like. You get in for a low amount I'm not going to say numbers because I don't know if I should or not but you get in for like your typical low amount challenge right and then she sells a VIP for a very affordable price and then she's selling a five high ish five figure offer at the end of it so like there that just like kind of shows like value ladder like entry point at the bottom of the value ladder and she's getting people to the top part of her value ladder like that. So fast and the fun part was how fast she did it like she said that she had two comic or seven comic club winning funnels back to back after like just events challenges after learning the framework and implementing it and like now they've grown and she started giving numbers and you can only give so many numbers that's to know where to meet compliance but it was explosive like a lot of us don't realize how small we think. Yeah, and that was really cool a lot of us are like concerned like I don't know if I'm going to make the two comic club what if you made the two comic club in a single event. Like it was crazy when we did the first funnel challenge Russell hit the two comic club in like less than 30 minutes from the offer dropping. And it was crazy and that thing that's what's possible it's not something that's totally crazy or unrealistic this is all 100% realistic and doable for you. And so it's just a lot of yourself. Yeah, I was going to say that same thing like we keep saying like it's crazy. It's so awesome. But people are doing it. People are doing it every day and it's not just them. It is like Pedro listed off like a bunch of people like these people have done it. These people have done it. There's a lot of people that are doing this every day and maybe not to that extreme level which is usually what we put into our case studies and testimonials are the extremes, but even like less than that people are doing it every day and that's still extremely life changing. Absolutely. Okay, guys, keep commenting because I'm going to choose a number between one and so many and I'm just going to count the comments and you're getting a water bottle. One of the things that shocked me too was how simple you can make the offer. We already have people commenting about how amazing it is that you know the replays can be the offer things like that. On the thing that stood out to me was value does not equal more. And I was like, oh my gosh, like my stack doesn't have to be massively like I don't have to keep adding a new product every time I launch something like it doesn't have to be massive. I don't want to keep adding more. What it needs to be in today's world is it needs to be faster. And how do I make the result faster for people is number one, and the number two is how do I increase their status instantly. If I can increase their status instantly it's a luxury by and it's an obvious thing. Okay. And it was I was like, I got to play with that. And I also one quote that I loved Barry made this quote and it like changed my entire perspective. It says, the moment people don't pay you for everything you know, they pay you for what they need to know. And I've had a hard time like when I created my own programs, I wanted to like download my brain as much as possible into everything and just give them absolutely everything on that topic. And that's not the goal. I wanted to actually give them the fastest route in order to get that result. And that was yes, faster, not more. Yeah, I mean, and at one point Pedro even said like he's like we're, I think we're all guilty of it, but he was definitely admitting himself of like, in the beginning I was giving way too much. It was overwhelming people. And he didn't use this word, but I'm going to use it. And that like he started editing it, like editing it down and slimming it down. And that's when things started taking off for him. Yeah. Yep. Okay. All right, can I can I share another takeaway? Okay. All right, so this is back to Barry. This is a good event. You guys should be registered. We're blown up. And we're just like giving her the like takeaways, but like, there's no way you can learn what we learned just from watching us like you need to go join. But one of the things that Barry did was she drew on the whiteboard, she's really really awesome. Like a digital whiteboard that they had set up. I was like, I need one of those. And she was showing at the. And then you have like, you don't need a bunch of different offers. Your, your, you've got your one primary outcome is what the major said. And there's at the beginning of your value ladder, you're teaching it in some way like you're doing just enough to get them to believe right. And then there's another level. And then there's like your high ticket level, right. And you're going to have these different levels. And it's just, you're teaching them the exact same thing. It's just how deep are you going is your value ladder. And so she gave us example of like, challenge is one of your levels. Live event could be one of like, she's the live event lady, right. So live event is one of your levels. And then like maybe some sort of retreat is your other level, right. But you're, it's the same thing. It's just you're inviting people to go deeper on that topic on that and learning how to do that thing. Deeper and deeper. And so that's how you keep ascending them because you don't need to be the master of a bunch of different things. You just need to be the master of the one thing that people come to you for. And we all know that Russell is massively prolific like dot com secrets. I just learned this at the last event he was talking at he said that dot com secrets originally had the expert secrets scripts in there. So it was originally much bigger. And he cut it out to make it simple. And if you look at it. dot com secrets at the time that he wrote it, was the high ticket program. People would come in and he would say, all right, then this is step number one, this is step number two. And he built the book because they didn't want the book. They wanted the book in action and they wanted support in doing so. So they were willing to pay. You don't need a million framework. Russell has a million because people keep wanting additional things. They want to grow beyond the two comic books, the two comic book X and two comic book C. They just want to keep going for the skies the limit. Your job is to take that one thing that you know extremely well. I thought it was beautiful how they talked about how anybody has a framework. Everyone has something. And you know, it's not. It's more what can you can give Pedro was really honest about giving and how what your offer is is your, your offering to serve. But you, your serving is also going to obviously going to come at a cost so that way you can like dedicate time to do it. And so it's allowing yourself to be out there to serve. And if you're somebody who already wants to serve, this is a perfect fit. Oh my gosh, there's so much. Okay, um, can you just say can you hold up dot com secrets again real quick. Okay, so like to make the point of what I was saying also of like, okay, you, a lot of the times we hear Russell say like, people would pay him thousands and thousands of dollars to get help with something and he he'll be like, Okay, well, and I think a lot of his example is like, Well, it's either your hook your story or your offer right which you learn in his books. And it's always those three things you can learn everything that you need to know in the books, but people pay a lot of money because they want that specific help but he's always like It's either your hook story or right. And so like the point being like the books are the same information that people pay him thousands of dollars to learn and get like, get that implementation advice for right. That's the point that Barry was making to have like, you're teaching the same thing at every level is just the level of access and the how deep you're going is what changes. Entirely. Really quick. Some of you guys are asking me number one how do you sign up for the challenge. It's challenge secrets masterclass calm VIP that apparently this is the last day they're offering it according to the comments. I didn't watch until the end so I'm not exactly sure. I imagine they may hit on it tomorrow but I cannot verify so if today's last day is the last day go. Number two people are asking how do they sign up for this like how do they get reminders for this go to funnel hacker dot TV you can watch all the replays and we also do it weekly email recap so that way if you guys miss something we let you guys know everything that happened in the video to go and watch it in order to get a little bit more. But if you want the text reminders to go out right beforehand, especially the ones where we say we're about to do a giveaway text FH TV to 2082313797 according to the right sections down here. So with that giveaway guys keep commenting I think we're at like 2526 comments now. And so it's going to be one to 26 I'm going to make we're going to figure that out. Okay, um, chances are good. Oh, chances are good. Keep commenting. And I will increase that number and you increase your chances. So, uh, yeah. Okay, go ahead. The one thing that stood out to me really quick was, there was a statement of purpose driven payday. I've, you know, I've had a hard time like with my own offers like feeling connected to the purpose in why I do it versus I'm putting something out because it's in my head and other people apparently get help with it. And so I do it and it makes money and I'm grateful. But like what is the purpose that's driving my I don't even know what that is some days and being able to like define that purpose and be able to create that so that way the payday always comes back to that and so I'm kind of like saying that rock and not just it's not just building on sand. I guess we'll say. Yeah, well, and also like when I, I think when at one point Pedro, I believe is it was talking about like, at first you're going to be learning as you're going, that actually stood out to me was like, go and do the challenge. What's the worst that could happen? It could be that you just did the challenge and you learned something from the experience of doing it, right? Even if nobody bought your thing, you're gonna learn and you're gonna get feedback from people that showed up of like, well, what could I sell them? Like, what do they need next? And like, I think if nothing else, you can learn from that experience and get more clarity about what you're doing and what is your purpose? Maybe you're not even sure what your purpose is yet, but you can go and take action and it's gonna help you learn that thing a lot faster. Like, I want you guys to understand how much value is being dripped out over these five days. Some of you know this because some of you have been around for forever and you're looking for that little hinge point that may either A, swing the success broader or B, actually gets you off your butt and have the belief to do the darn thing. But for some of you, this is something that you're just starting at and you might be starting at rock bottom and it might be hard. And I guess the only thing that I could say to somebody like that is when things were really, really hard for me, I took a walk. Like, I went outside and I just walked until I couldn't and I leaned against somebody's fence and just had a discussion about where I was and what needed to happen until I found the why and the why and those moments was I had to do something. Like, I had to be loud. I had to do this because my back was up against wall and I knew what to do. At some point you're gonna have enough to know. Knowing isn't the issue. Well, what about this? Knowing is not the issue. You can Google most things and get close enough with the information that's being dripped out here. It's dripped out not because it's a great lead magnet, not because all things, it's dripped out because of the belief in you and your ability to even run with this simple free training and to make a difference. A lot of this is happening. All this happening. The reason that Susan and I are here is because Russell believes in the community and he wants there to be cheerleaders that are constantly talking about all the funnel nerd stuff. We're here because of the belief in you. So if you're having that day where you are hitting the pavement and you are just everything seems down, take a walk, understand that we are believing in you. This is us trying to breathe air of possibility into your lungs so that way you can go forth and change the world and we can be cheering you on when you cross the two comic club award and you get that on stage next funnel hacking live. Like that's the goal. Or even just being able to get yourself out of the situation that you're in right now, you can do this. Like that's what this is all about. That's why we're funnel hackers is because we believe that you have a calling and you can do it. And so yeah, there's so much gold. And I would add on to that that the challenge, like a lot of you watching right now, you might be like, I know a lot of the stuff. Like I've been around a while, I've read all of Russell's books, I've done all the things that he's put out. I may not need to go and do this. Well, I would say go and it might be the catalyst that you need, it might spark an idea that you didn't think of before because there's like during a challenge, like one of the key things of a challenge is that you are given action assignments at the end of each day to go and do the thing. And I was looking at some of what the homework is and it's like, it's easy. Like I would say, let me switch my word. It's simple, it may not be easy to answer some of the things, but it's simple. And actually, I think a lot of the questions were kind of easy, like it's just trying to get you started, right? And so in the challenge, you have the help that you need right now to start going. One of the things I was gonna say was I was sitting in the VIP today and I couldn't believe how the extra value that was being dropped in just the VIP session because like Pedro spent an extra hour on with everybody unless he went over, because I don't know, I jumped off early, of helping people, like people are asking questions and he's giving real time answers to their questions right there. So if there's been hurdles where you haven't been able to get started because you don't feel like you're getting the support that you need or you're not sure where to start, I would say this is the perfect opportunity. Even in the VIP session, one of the first question, the the first question was for Barry. And she answered it by going back to the whiteboard and she laid out an entirely new framework, like from different from the training, right? And she gave a whole another framework in the VIP. So like, I'm gonna pause it, replay it. Go sign up for a VIP. It's free, right? Yeah, it's free. That's the, yeah, VIP, if you do not have a ClickFunnels account yet, VIP is free and it's included with a trial of ClickFunnels 2.0. And the reason for that is they're giving you a template in order to create your challenge. So that way you have something all set up. Like we've taken care of the tech for you. So that way all you have to do is, yeah, it's your funnel. It's yours. Yeah, I was in there this morning. There's a classic one and a 2.0 one. And I was like, I'm getting both of these. Look at that. Depending on your comfort level, it's all yours. You get the workbook and the workbook is glorious. Even if you're just watching live, you're able to sign up for prizes. Yesterday they gave away an iPhone and it was one of the brand new ones. It was a 14. I was like, huh, I need that one. And then they gave away an iPad today. And so, and they're continuing, I think they're giving away an iMac here soon. They're giving away a ClickFunnels account. Like they're doing, they're doing a lot. And so... Can I just touch on like how awesome the giveaway prize things are positioned of like, they're not just giving away stuff to give away stuff. Like, yes, there's an ulterior motive to get people to show up, right? Like we all know that we're all marketers. We all do these things. But the brilliance of how it was positioned of like, Pigeon saying, these are the tools, these are the only tools that you need. You could literally do a challenge from your phone. And so I'm gonna give you a phone. You could do it from a tablet. So I'm gonna give away a tablet. You're gonna need ClickFunnels for the one challenge funnel that you need. So I'm gonna give you a ClickFunnels. They're giving the tools that are needed. It's not just like, it's not things that don't, that aren't connected in and just like, oh, fun prizes. There's a purpose behind their prizes. And I think that's a huge takeaway just from an onlooker of like, go put that into your own challenge. Give people things that they need. Yeah, they're not giving away a car, something we're not gonna be able to use. This is like tools for you to be able to implement everything they're teaching.

And the value that's being dropped is pure gold. Like Pedro spoke at Funnel Hacking Live. And then he spoke again at Funnel Hacking Live. And then he spoke for the, for the Orphers Funnel Challenge as a bonus afterwards. And every time he spoke, he started to talk about this and kind of paint the vision. This is his opportunity to really paint the vision. There's a reason this man has made as much money as he has. How many lives he has changed. And the calling that he's felt has been put on him. There's a reason he has a vehicle to do it. And he's sharing with you the entire blueprint. Like, let me see really quick. Yesterday we learned, do do do do do do. Yesterday we learned, let me see what this summary like, what each day is called. Yesterday was, what is the challenge funnel? Today was the Irresistible Challenge Offer, which we've already talked about. It could be as simple as the following, right? Jeff, you know. And then tomorrow is creating the Irresistible Challenge. So how do you make your challenge like something that people salivate for and have to be in? Then we're talking about traffic and we're talking about how to sell what you serve. And so much more, guys. I can't give away all the goods. If you're in, you know. So go get in and pay attention because that's good stuff. Yes. And I don't know if you have anything else to say, Ben, but I was just going to say, we're going to be back here Thursday also to give our biggest takeaways. But we want you guys to come back with us Thursday because you're going to be participating in the rest of the week and come back and give us your takeaways too along with us. So we can all share it together. And do it. And if you guys post it in the ClickFunnels community, if you will go and like make a post about what you've learned during the challenge, no links, no spam, no nothing, just share like what we're doing. We're not here to promote ourselves. You don't know what my business is. It doesn't matter. What matters is us giving to each other. So share, put your post in, give all the details. OK. Share exactly what you're learning, why you've had your epiphanies, why you have your ahas. We're going to be highlighting a couple of those next time as well. So if you want to be highlighted on the show, that's how you do it. It's good stuff. Awesome. OK. That'll be so fun. OK. All right. So let's see. We were going to give away a ClickFunnels water bottle and I don't have an image of it because we were trying to get all the images and videos and stuff all set up for you. So what we're going to do is we're going to choose the number between, let's see, I've got, how much am I able to scroll? That's a better question. Let's choose a number between 1 and 30. No, no, no, no, no, 1 and 20. 1 and 20. You want me to choose the number? Yes. 13. 13. OK. 1, 2, 3, 4. This is the manual wave, do we giveaways? Damien Chetham. Awesome. Damien Chetham. If you would like a ClickFunnels water bottle, my friend, I'm going to love your reaction. I need you to be able to message me. Like message me. We'll be able to chat. We'll get this all taken care of. Congratulations, my friend. Congrats. Just found your comments. We'll see if we can maybe tag you or something. But yes. All right. OK. We'll be back on Thursday. Make sure that you have, you're signed up to the texts, FHTV to 208-231-3797 so that you know exactly when we're about to go live. And yeah, we'll be back Thursday for the recap of tomorrow and Thursday morning. And it's going to be so awesome. I can't wait to see the rest of the guests. It's going to be great. Keep rocking it. And let's roll the outro. All right. Bye, everybody. My name is Russell Brunson. And I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash to venture capitalists to get started. And we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get this happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not only something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you, who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers. And these are our stories.
