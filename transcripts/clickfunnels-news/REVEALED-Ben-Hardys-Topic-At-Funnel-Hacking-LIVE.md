I go up to that like Two o'clock mark, but I'm doing it and I already have questions written down pre even knowing about this So I'm really excited because I have been reading this Authors books for a while. I read He co-wrote the gap in the game. I'm currently listening to unaudible 10x is easier than 2x and I'm just like I'm taking notes in my notes app I have notes in my planner like I have so many questions about it I'm really excited So this is a really really fun and exciting opportunity for me because I'm a huge fan of His methods the people that he's worked with how he coaches people and it yeah, it's really really cool to be here So there's there's I might have given too much of a tease there But you might be if you guys know who it is dropping in the comments, you know, it's funny I was doing I've been listening to Two 10x is easier than 2x as well And I started to research and he's written a whole bunch of books other than this that just like I'm like oh my gosh My library is about to get bigger and bigger. I just have to get everybody's books. So with that said shall we bring him on the stage? Let's do it. Let's do it. Everybody. Welcome to the stage doctor Benjamin Hardy. How are you sir? Welcome? Super good. Thank you so much for letting me hang out here. Thank you for that introduction super generous Thanks for being with us today Absolutely happy to be here. Oh okay, so Russell I remember when Russell started to realize like how he he puts together funnel hacking live in pieces and he's waiting for these Right things to drop on his plate. He's like that's just right. That's just right and Mastermind in Paradise is an event that happens in Mexico It's for the for the coaching customers and for people that are in the mastermind programs And he invited you out to speak and I kind of want to know What was that story like of him just beginning to reach out that relationship building and then he'm asking you to speak? First at that event which is like the testing ground for fun like he live. I did not know it was a testing ground So so I'll give a little bit of background so back in 2015 I started blogging online my quote-unquote 10x feature self was becoming a professional author I had no website no blog and I started blogging but the next year I Did read Russell's book and it really helped me so like I've known about Russell's work for a while I read his comm secrets and It's helped me a lot It helped me to become a professional author in many ways to grow a huge audience And so I've known of Russell and then I met him in a mastermind group that I was a part of maybe like Five or five or so years ago. And so I've known him He's kind of we've kind of been in each other's ecosystems a little bit And I knew that you know, he read for example, who not how and the gap in the game like they were semi in these Orbits, but I hadn't talked to him a lot And then after I wrote this book 10x is easier than 2x This was like early this year I knew that that was my last book with Dan and honestly like I was kind of just exploring potential People that I wanted to just connect to and maybe in the future write books with who knows But I just Russell's just one of those people are like I really want to get to know Russell a little little bit more And so I literally just would like send him private messages on Facebook and just say how have you been what's been going on with you? He's like dude, I've read your books. I love you. What's going on and I told him about 10x is easier than 2x And so ultimately the conversations were just like dude You should just come out and teach it the book wasn't even out yet Like the book this was like in you know, I think that the mastermind was in March The book didn't come out until May but he's just like you should come out and teach all this stuff at mastermind and paradise We'll just talk about stuff and so that that's what it was like it was just private messages on Facebook and Ultimately he invited me to come out and hang out. I love that. I feel like so many people have similar stories, too It's like it all started with a DM Exactly And it works every time so you came out and spoke at mastermind and paradise everyone was walking away saying but that Presentation though, but that presentation though like everyone walked away with something and I remember Russell getting into the office And he's like, okay, so I've been implementing gap in the game just the entire flight over He's like it's amazing how much momentum I feel in my life Like I like just how much opportunity like is ahead versus you know things have been and so I'm not gonna steal the thunder on the process but Your presentations and I know you gave multiple while you're out there Really did really did make an impact and it's really really cool to be able to see that The world that you've been in with Dan Sullivan kind of get mixed into our world a little bit and we get to see some of that So first off, thank you for sharing. It was absolutely influential But um, what were you sharing exactly because it seems like sometimes it was gap in the game Sometimes it was 10x is easier in 2x, which is an amazing book by the way. Absolutely love it. Oh, thank you I mostly was teaching Frameworks from 10x is easier than 2x and even some of the frameworks that are not in that book that I've kind of put together That will be in other books like and so I was just teaching them a lot of like the psychology Frameworks of you know past self present self future self a lot of identity frameworks And then I taught them some of the the crazy 10x versus 2x frameworks It was a lot of fun I did there was the final session that I did where I taught some of the psychology behind the gap in the game and how to how to really What I would call is master your past most people don't have mastery over their past their past is actually a problem It's like a it's an asset. It's a liability not an asset So that that whole book the gap in the game is really about developing mastery over your past 10x is really about mastering your future and your present and so yeah, it was fun I mean, I remember after I finished and I actually love the I did I did remember talking to you and being like holy cow. This is long because it was seven days I was away from my family and I'm like one after another after I'm like, this is this is huge I know that Russell does everything massive, but like me even me teaching three times I was like, I don't know if I got anything left in the tank But I will say that the group is so amazing like such learners that I think that's that's one of the things I love about this group is it is a little bit every entrepreneurial community has like different energies And I love the energy of this group. It's like very applied like you take stuff You apply it you test it you try it like you're always and that's it's very different from what I've experienced And so I just loved how fast people like grabbed onto it and immediately started applying it And I remember the energy in the room was really intense when I was teaching like I was I've never actually taught with an easel board before That was the first time now. I love it now I like have my own but like just drawing the pictures and teaching and in the energy was really high And I remember someone afterwards just saying like I literally feel high like they were just like they're like literally I've never like that. I haven't I haven't learned stuff like this in a long time if ever and they're like I am high right now and I was just like But it was fun. It was like amazing energy such a good group and Yeah, it was a lot of fun That's awesome. We have a lot of that in our community just the energy They all kind of feed off of each other and it's funny because they're actually at an event right now at Pirates Cove He's with inner circle and it's you can Gain that sense of hit the energy that's happening there just from the content that he's sharing about it And that's what I just love about click funnels people It's like they get so excited about a new framework that they can apply to their business as soon as humanly possible It's awesome It's definitely unique and it's it's really fun So then what was it like when he Twisted and said, you know, I have this other event that we go a little bit longer a little bit harder and make everything even bigger Would you be interested in speaking at Fennel Hacking live? What was that? Oh? Yeah, I was not expecting that we just continued the conversation on our DMS You know what I mean? afterward after that week in paradise and I actually really loved it like I Would go back, you know, maybe I should just join his Atlas group or something who knows but Yeah, so we just continued the DMS and he was getting all sorts of crazy feedback on just people being blown away by the book because we actually Here's another crazy story is is that this book came out in May? But when you like as an author I can sometimes get this book like a month early Well, my assistant Chelsea had to break her back So like there these books come to know we didn't really know that these books are printed somewhere in Minnesota The printing events but we only need to know that because I really wanted if we could to get these books into Mexico Very difficult to get them across the borders and something that my assistant Chelsea did anything and everything But the literally hot off the presses the very first printing ever of this book and literally 24 hours later We had them there and so we got the no literally the very first ever printing of this book the very first 400 copies ever off the presses Immediately shipped to Mexico and we had them there and so like the copies we gave to people there were the first ever Printed copies of that book ever That's really cool And like, you know printing is usually like 20,000 copies You know, so we've gone through multiple printings now, but like those were the first printed ever But the only reason I say that is is just that Are we good? Oh, sorry. Yeah the first basically You know the presentations weren't really well they blew people's minds people got high I guess you could say and then they all read the book and I guess Russell just loved it as well And so he pretty much just PM me or DM me and just said I think it was like a month later He just said you want to teach that at Funnel Hacker Live or you want to come and teach at Funnel Hacker Live? And I'm just like dude, I live in Orlando. Let's do it Yeah, three different times in a week Well, yeah, now it's gonna be fun. I mean, I've actually been to Funnel Hacker Live and I already like know Like how crazy that is and so it was it it was actually a Really generous offer and an amazing I was very humbled and grateful and so of course I would say yes to a lot of things that Russell's involved in but That was awesome. So Came through a PM or a DM What were you gonna say sorry There's a lot of people excited to hear from you as well So it's exciting to all of the ticket holders already that they get to see and learn from you at that event Awesome, it's gonna be fun. It's such a such a cool group. So So I know you've got a present that you're gonna give everybody there I don't know if I want to tease that just yet like when you get to Funnel Hacking Live and it's Dr. Benjamin Hardy's day to stand on the stage and to have the easel out and be totally ready like There will be something for you But There's something that you can get right now. So here's the deal really quick guys If you guys go to Funnel Hacking Live calm and you grab your ticket In order to join the event what you're going to get is the full event you get to be able to enjoy all four days This is a cultivated experience. Is it a rock star party like Dr. Benjamin Hardy was talking about and it's all revolving around a specific idea Called the Lynch pin and how it works and how do you actually take authority and step into authority and be able to build and grow your business and It is going to be an event like none other if you guys do not have your tickets yet They always sell out always and so our Deepest suggestion is if this is an experience that you've been thinking about you've been wanting to learn about Russell cultivates the very best of the best for a year and brings them all onto the Funnel Hacking Live stage And that includes Dr. Benjamin Hardy and you sir I think we're giving a bonus to people when they join is that I think that's right Yeah, absolutely. Yeah So I will see you do what you want me to do. Please. Do what it is or do you want? Yes? No Okay, I'll tell you I didn't really know about this until before because I didn't think that Russell would would would give this away I'm just kidding. One thing I will say about going to those kind of events is Is there's a book I read and I'm not aiming at say the name of the book I'll say it to you if you join I'm just kidding. No, the book is called unreasonable success by Richard Kosh But it's it's a book all about people who literally change the world like we're talking like Beethoven Einstein, etc and One of the things he talked about is is that these types of people have like an absurd level of confidence and I would break Confidence into two categories like self-belief and also high expectations for what what's what's gonna happen But that confidence didn't come out of nowhere It came from the third part which is what he calls transformative Experiences that the more transformative experiences you have and that could be doing something you thought was impossible Watching yourself achieve something but it also could be being in certain environments that totally stretch your view of what you think is possible and those type of experiences Open up your mindset to going for the impossible one thing I do want to just say before I even say that the the present is that I really think even before you go to Funnel hacker live and I've been testing this and I've watched crazy things Is that everyone for the rest of this year? You should have an impossible goal like this book teaches you the science literally There's a lot of research on why impossible goals are easier, but if you and read you know check it out, but like If you're not going for an impossible goal What that means is that you're stuck in your past because you are going for something that you already think you know how to do Whereas only by making the goal impossible where you actually say I have no clue how to do that and that finally gets you out of Operating from your past and then opening yourself up to the few things that really matter and so I just invite everyone to seriously I've been applying this a lot Like to find an impossible goal something you genuinely believe to be impossible before the end of the year before the end of 2023 And then ask yourself that would be impossible in less what and then there's only a few things that would get you to an impossible goal So just go for that. We'll share more on that later But here's the thing that we're giving you is is that I guess I did three sessions when we were at the Paradise mastermind We taught 10x very deeply some of the identity frameworks and then on the Midnight mastermind. I taught some of the some of the insights from this book the gap in the game Which is just a really beautiful book about like I said mastering your past But I actually in that presentation went even Deeper beyond the book and taught some of this stuff on like some of the identity models about how you can really master your past Because a lot of people like I said their past is a problem. They don't know how to master their past They don't know how to expand their past and get more and more out of it And so you will get that full presentation. I guess is that right that they're gonna get that 50-minute presentation Oh, yeah, do it do it and the crazy thing that was powerful to me Like I went and I watched it again before we hopped on because I was like wait a minute now is this the one where and The motivation that this creates because when you're able to go into your past You said this when you go into your past and you expand that your future automatically expands as a result Yeah, one of the things yeah, well, well there I'm remembering this talk now and Some of me like I remember walking away from that talk and I actually went in the gap Because I immediately realized that there were like I learned so much when I gave that talk But one of the things so most people just to give a little bit of insight into this And I know that you said Russell was listening to it over and over and over like right before we flew out to People are very especially people who are gonna go to funnel hacker live We all are really excited about that impossible future actually But the challenge is is that we often measure ourselves against that future and and what me and Dan talked about in this book Is that? The ideals the vision that you have for your future is like a horizon in the desert It's always stretching forward no matter how many steps you take forward the horizon keeps going, but if you're always Comparing yourself against the horizon and wishing you were there Then you actually start to feel like a loser Even if you've literally gone 10x many times in the past and you're a millionaire billionaire blah blah blah Like and so this book teaches you how to look at your past in different ways because really How you view your past is is heavily gonna shape what you expect in your future And so we talk I remember taking the people in that talk through a really cool exercise Which I'm excited for you to go through that exercise, but usually people because they're not skilled in this They're not masterful about their past. They don't know how to squeeze a lot of juice out of their past I Could say like tell me the most important things that have happened between now and in the beginning of 2023 and Obviously you're a community of massive high achievers and so a lot of things have happened But even still you probably would list a few things that have happened And what I do is is I give much shorter and shorter timelines and once you get better and better at the process of squeezing gains out of your past By the way, you do that and then you'll have a much bigger future But I'll basically you'll see that you'll get really good at it such that even in a 24-hour period of time Like you can I can look back on who I was yesterday afternoon And I can see insane differences between who I am now and who I was 24 hours ago And I can see ridiculous progress and I'm getting better and better at seeing and squeezing that progress And it just makes for a huge future and so we'll show you how to do that That's so cool In fact when I when I read the gap in the game There were a few things that stuck out to me and there's a lot of things like I have these little notes here But I still think about a MB Regularly like with anything that I do whether I'm at the gym or it's in my personal life or it's as a parent or at work I'm always thinking like Always measure backwards because like regardless of how I'm feeling in the moment I'm still progressing from where I was when I first started this journey and like that's it's so powerful It sticks with me very frequently Okay, I do want to ask one question if I can narrow one down because I've been reading through 10x is easier than 2x before I let Ben go into the details of what we're gonna be doing here And you talk about a lot of things that are also really powerful about like Transactional life versus Transformational which I think is also really cool Like I actually like highlighted that in my book because I'm like go back to this. This is huge Can you give us a little bit of like the framework of how 10x actually is simpler? In Comparison to 2x when you're just talking about the basics kind of like trimming the fat and like really like focusing on something like what? What kind of things we'd be talking about and what can people expect to take away from that? Yeah, for sure Obviously we're gonna go really deep into this but If you're gonna go for 2x of anything what that mostly means is that you're doing more of what you've already done So from like a psychology standpoint what that means is that you're taking the present and you're taking the present and you're pushing it into the future And that's what most people do is most people When they're thinking about their future, they're mostly doing it from the present and so 2x is very non-transformational Just using the 80 20 principle and we have a whole model on this and stuff really simple frameworks learn that from Russell, but You know using the 80 20 model and if you've heard of the 80 20 principle You know that 80% of the things you're doing only create 20% of your results And you know that there's 20% of the things you're doing that have huge upside And if you're someone who's really learning you're always looking for those few things that have the biggest upside That's that's really what learning is all about is letting go of the Many things that aren't really doing anything for you and finding more and better things in relationships that take you big time So the main thing here in the main difference is is that 2x if you're gonna go for 2x You can actually keep the 80% because 2x is not transformational You can keep 80 80% of your life right now like if I want to double the amount of books I've sold I can mostly keep doing what I'm doing But that's not really that effective because it doesn't force me to figure out what the few things are that have the biggest upside I'm just keeping pretty much everything and so the opposite is 10x 10x is so big back to the idea It's seemingly impossible that most things won't get you there like most things won't help me sell You know 10 times more books than I've sold almost nothing will work And that's why it's really effective is because only a few things will and and those few things have the biggest upside So to go 10x you have to actually get rid of the 80% and this is this is what the whole book teaches you how to do 80% of your life is actually your past self and your present self But it's not your 10x future self and so the book really helps you narrow down and simplify Those very few things that have the big upside and then it teaches you how to let go of the things that honestly got you here But won't get you there even the great things that got you here But won't get you there and it helps you clarify the very few things and then ultimately helps you become a leader apply other really cool ideas, but it's it's a very simplifying approach bigger bigger goals Dramatically simplify everything you're doing because most things won't get you there I'm sure that resonated with so many people But like I just have to say I'm so excited for you to go in depth on this because Even like the most simple things about that book were about you know, it's you talk about not doing what you've done before It's like what you've done to get here isn't gonna get you there and it's actually about doing less like Transformational stuff is actually about doing less. It's just focusing on the right thing And I think so many people are gonna have amazing takeaways from that and I'm so excited about it. I can't wait Well, I mean if you look at Steve Jobs or even anyone they apply this I mean Elon Musk one of the things he literally talks about like I love studying how he thinks and he talks about how most people they Optimize things that should not be done. And so like the first thing you literally want to do is figure out what must be removed That's the 80% you've got to let go of most of the things that are a waste of time Find the very few things with the upside and then that's what you get really good at and You know even Steve Jobs when he went back to Apple like you know He had gone to like Pixar and stuff like that but when he came back to Apple Apple was falling Falling apart because they had like 20 different products and he's like we need to just find like the one or two that are like doing really Well, and he like literally got rid of the 80% focused on the few things that mattered and got ten times better at those And then Apple became the number one company in the world. And so like these are just fundamental principles But there's also just deep psychology in it. And so I'm just really excited to share it with you guys Well, like so I was telling Tickets right there I was telling Laura like at the beginning of the book just The analogy that you give of Leonardo da Vinci having to constantly reinvent Michelangelo see You're good. This is no no no this is David, right? Thank you No, share that intro that intro Was a bear to write But what did you what did you like about the Michael? No, it's just the fact that he had to reinvent himself every single time like it wasn't just now I'm gonna learn the anatomy like no one else has and I'm gonna be the crazy on the French person that does that and then In order to take it to the next level what he did and how he reinvented himself again He never stood on his own laurels Being able to like how you taught that Made the entire framework of the book and obvious like well Do I want to be the painter on the side of the street? Do I want to be the sculptor who's able to play with clay or do I want to be a da Vinci and it just It made the entire theory. It was beautiful. It was just it was really really cool. So thank you That is very generous. Well, I was lucky enough that Last summer we we took a six-week trip to Europe So like I had been thinking about this book for a year or two, but I like I you know I was I worked on other projects and stuff like that but like Right before I really went deep and by the way chapter 5 of this and like I'll go deeper on the talk is all about how to go Deep into flow most people they have shallow like they go into shallow flow Which is like I can focus for 90 minutes This book teaches a much deeper model of flow But I was deep in quote call it recovery flow like where I was expanding my mind and we were we were in Europe for six weeks and so we went to Rome like saw the Sistine Chapel obviously and like we're blown away by Michelangelo's work on that ceiling and Then we went up to I went up to Florence and I saw the David, you know, and I was just like I Have to learn more about this man And so I just started watching documentary after documentary after documentary and read the agony in the ecstasy And I was like this is it like I knew when I came back from that trip that I was gonna go deep into the cave And I ended up spending like five months deep in the cave writing 10x and But yeah, that is one thing I will just say to this is Is is that 10x is not for everyone like it's it is for those people who are willing to Go for the impossible again and again. I know that Russell loves the hero's journey and like the you know You got the call to adventure and then you resist the call And I would say resisting the call means you're just continually consuming yourself in the 80% of stuff that is is your past And it's just not getting you anywhere But if you do it again and again and again each time you do it you're you're a different person So like you go 10x once, you know Michelangelo he creates that beautiful huge Hercules and then his next one turns out to be like the Pieta Which is like still one of the most beautiful masterpieces of all time then the David then the Sistine Chapel then all of a sudden He's an architect right and his life is just And like I guess that's really the invitation. I'm sure that's Russell similar invitation Is this just like even if you've achieved incredible things and definitely always stand again? Like that's why we wrote this book first, but there's even a full chapter on the gap of the game in 10x You can do the impossible again and obviously you want to stay in the game the whole way But like you don't even know how good you can be like that's one thing that this whole book taught me is that the deeper you Go into the 20% you don't even realize how good you can be I would love to know what it was like for Michelangelo to Measure backwards. Oh my goodness. I mean so like you know when he well The crazy part the crazy thing about that is like he was still living in Florence working on projects and like He could go out and like look at the David You know what I mean? It was like in the center hall and like people came from all over the world It that statue literally changed the psychology of the whole city like Florence Rebuilt its courage and its confidence because of the David the David became their symbol so like you know and then then the Rome I mean then the Pope called him and was like Please come and build my tomb. Yeah, obviously that ultimately led to the Sistine Chapel But yeah him measuring backwards. He's working on the Pope's tomb and like going back and just remembering Those four years of just covered in powder like looking at everything and just exhausted of just Every little thing on that David like it's gonna be crazy Yeah, and thank you for that introduction to that book too because it does set the stage for everything else that follows and even the stuff that almost feels a little bit morbid about him learning about biology and like Going into the morgue and basically risking in my second corpses. Yes. It is so fascinating one thing I want to say about this is That often going 10x involves doing a lot of really really deep work on a project. So example Michelangelo did a lot of deep work for four years even for a year when he made his first Hercules project, but I'll give myself as an example and some more famous examples like I Did some seriously deep work to write this book like learned so many things broke myself But then the project itself can often take you 10x like just as an example Had I not written this book? I probably wouldn't be meeting with you guys like even even though my other books are great Like I wouldn't be here because the projects can take you 10x like I think about Like it just as an example like the things that this that this project opened up for me Like I'm I'm regularly now training leadership teams of companies doing over a hundred million dollars and like like they really need these frameworks to get to a billion In revenue and like I wouldn't have been able to do that two years ago But like the deep deep work and doing deep projects can often take you 10x and I really Even think about the example of like Lin-Manuel Miranda and like, you know, like his his Incredible obviously like Hamilton like he spent six years like making that Hamilton You know musical but like think about how that project has changed the world But also think about where it took his life like it literally that project became a rocket ship to him and Opened up so many different things and so if you're willing to do the deep work and get ten times better Go into the deep flow the deep waters and catch the big fish You know those projects can 10x your life and so we'll definitely teach you guys how to do that If you come we'll definitely do that Guys you funneling in life is the 1% crazy. That's what we're here for even if we get the names of famous artists wrong in the past It is beautiful to be able to be here. Thank you so much and for coming in for This year is so hinged on changing your business and adjusting it so that way it's set up to grow for the long term and What is required to do that is a reworking of yourself and taking on an extreme ownership and being willing to Leave part of you in the past and take up the call and change things so that way you can make the world a better place by changing yourself It's it's going to be an event that you do not want to miss so really quick when you do get your ticket Here's everything that you get number one.

You got it, right? No one thing I want to say is this I When I was chilling with Russell in the mastermind in Paradise I didn't know about his linchpin model and you know He was he gave me a book on it and stuff like that which I know he's now presenting out to the world but he also taught it multiple times and I It it changed how I view entrepreneurship literally it reminded me when I was in my meeting with Dan Sullivan So I was in him like a mastermind meeting with Dan Sullivan and he taught who not how for the first time and I literally Like was shaken it changed how I saw even you know And I walked up to Dan afterward and I said Dan if you ever want that into a mainstream book I will write it and that's what led me to ultimately the trilogy that we wrote I felt the exact same way when I heard Russell teach the linchpin I was like, I mean, I don't know if it's gonna happen But I was like dude Russell like that needs to be a book like I'm talking a major book like a book like this Like I'm like Russell like I it is that good like I'm like that changes the game. I would actually I'm just telling you blunt Like right here. I would write that book with Russell and we would sell a couple million copies I don't know if he's up for that, but it's that good. I'm like, I'm serious. I would I would franking I would do that. I'm just saying it out loud. Maybe maybe we'll manifest this into the universe right here I'm just kidding, but I can always keep pushing them on it I wanted to write the linchpin book with Russell because it was totally different and I could actually see that If you started with that mindset as an entrepreneur First off your business would probably be exponentially bigger than you're probably making it now, but it does change It's just a it's a a much better approach And I think most businesses are not made with that framework and so they're just never that great of businesses So we've gotten to see so many people talk about learning about linchpin and like being in the thick of it for several days and Seeing their faces and the excitement when when they know that it just clicked because there's this moment where they're like I don't know. I don't know if this will work for my business I don't know if this applies to me and then they realize it applies to everyone it applies to every business and when that clicks for them It's just like the trajectory of their business and the excitement on their faces. It just changes Yeah, it's it's definitely I'm glad Russell did the deep work He went into the deep waters to catch that fish and really understand it because I do think that that's what's gonna take click funnels 10x is like actually helping people understand that model and it's it's gonna change people's businesses like click funnels has done Insane things like I said without without some of the insight I've used click funnels since 2016 like without it certainly it's changed many people's lives and businesses, but this insight Can really it could it will it will make many billion dollar businesses because it's it's that it's that clear I remember when challenge funnels was the big deal That was the big insight that was brought to the market Four or five years ago, and it's spun up and become this thing. This is gonna be a whirlwind And it's going to it's gonna change so many lives Well, I could talk about this forever But one thing that I just want to squeeze in here as an ask before we wrap this up because I've been too excited And I have so many other things I would still love to talk about is Dr. Benjamin Hardy we have to have you on the podcast.
