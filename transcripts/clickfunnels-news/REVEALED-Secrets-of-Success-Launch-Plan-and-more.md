If you haven't, we're here to make sure you're in the know. So we're gonna bring on our guest. This person has been working really close with Russell in, you guys saw at the intro, the Atlas Research Center project. This guest has been working with Russell in helping that actually come in to being in an existence. I'm not gonna tell his story too much, but you know how Russell really, really loves to collect old books? This person helps him to do that. And then is heading up the secrets of success, new business and launch and everything that entails. There's so much exciting stuff happening around that. So I'm gonna just bring on Justin Benton is here to talk to us all about secrets of success today. What's up? I'm gonna have a joke here. What is up? PhonehackerTV, I've been down there in the comments the whole time and I'm here. Now you're on. We're so glad to have you here with us. What's up? What's up? Yeah, oh my gosh. Okay, where do we even start, Ben? Do you have? There's so much to talk about. Okay, so Russell's been taking on this secret project that very few have ever really heard about. And once we all started to get like these little ideas of what's happening, you were like suddenly the man behind and say, I remember Russell's like, do you know Justin Benton? Justin's coming to the office and he's like, like cuffing himself to this briefcase. Like there's some serious, serious stuff going down. I'm like, what in the world? So if you can like share what it is that like, what's going on with like your story behind the scenes of hanging out with Russell? Cause something's happening next week and it's all revolving around secrets of success. So tell us the story. Absolutely. So that was a really fun event, the one with the handcuffed and the briefcase. And what had happened was, I mean, I'm in Russell's inner circle, right? And he opened it back up a few years ago and it was at the biggest no-brainer to get in and sign up at FHL when I could. And it's called coming through the front door. Like a lot of people want to do business or partner with Russell and things like that. And they want to do it through the back door and they want to do like a get through the gatekeeper and like impress them with something and then it happens. Well, you know what? Us as guys in general terms, we value our relationship over time or experiences. And so sometimes if you're going to build a genuine relationship with somebody, you got to build a genuine relationship with somebody and it takes time. So I went through the front door and the inner circle. We had a Facebook group, private inner circle Facebook group and I had posted a newsletter that showed Napoleon Hill was at the back of it as an article and it talked about, you know, there's no such thing as education, only self-education. I posted it in the Facebook group for inner circle and I was like, oh my gosh, you guys are reading this? And then I happened to hear from a friend of mine, Ken Walsh that Don Green, the head of the Napoleon Hill Foundation was having a secret auction in a billionaire's house in Hollywood Hills. And it was like $500 to get in and it was very exclusive. And so I had Ken was actually a part of it. So he invited me to come down. I posted in that inner circle group, when I posted Napoleon Hill thing, I said, oh, by the way, if anybody wants to deets, I'm going to a private Napoleon Hill Foundation auction. And so literally 10 minutes later, I might have been the first time Russell ever voxed me, maybe the second it was, chirp, chirp, Russell, what's the deets? And I said, hey man, I'm going down. He goes, oh my gosh, I've been traveling everywhere. I want to be there. I just got a boat. I'm taking it out for the first time with the kids. Is there any way that you can like go down there for me and help out? I said, dude, I'm on it. I'm going. So I'm cruising down to Hollywood Hills. I meet everybody down there. I meet Don Green. I've become best friends with him. We got Willie Galtz, the auctioneer, the old Chicago Bears player. I'm best friends with him. Russell wants to buy the whole lot. I say, Russell, just hold tight. Let me see what they have. And we'll cross-reverse it with what you have. And how about we just get the things that you don't have? How's that sound? He's like, oh, that's a great idea. So we went through all the different things. They had all the magazines, the Golden Rule, Napoleon Hill magazines. They had first edition signed books with a positive mental attitude with W. Clement Stone and Napoleon Hill that started at $15,000. That was the opening bid. Signed books from Napoleon Hill. That was one was written to a film production company, Easter Egg Held There, something like that. And then they had like NFTs and other books and all this crazy stuff. And we got all of it. Everything that Russell wanted. We were actually in a bidding war with one with another person. And there was two checks. And I said, stop the auction. You and I are never gonna stop. There are two checks here. Why don't we stop here at this price? Thing was $2,500. And I said, you can have that one. And I will get that one. She's like, okay. And so anyway, there was a blast. And so here's kind of a dream 100 little sneak peek for you. So as I was grabbing all this incredible stuff and I'm taking it to my car and I'm thinking, normally what would you do? Well, you would FedEx it. Well, immediately I was thinking, why would I FedEx it number one? Could you imagine if it got lost? And number two, what an amazing opportunity to get to hang out with Russell. And so I just hit him on Vox or I said, hey man, I got all this great stuff. Do you want me to deliver to you on this Friday or next Friday? And what did Russell say? This Friday. And so I came out there and I had the handcuff to the ClickFunnels bag that my son had wanted at Unlock the Secrets. And Dan Usher was there taking pictures and all that kind of stuff. And that was the moment when Russell and I got to sit and talk, talk about his family, talk about the boat, talk about life and really connect. And so that was that opportunity of building that genuine relationship. And from that meeting, we just kept talking. And I was talking with Don Green of the Foundation. Obviously Russell was trying to form an alliance, I say, with the Foundation, but it just wasn't clicking. You know, obviously Russell's super busy and not the biggest extrovert on the planet. And so I just said, hey, let me keep doing it. Let me keep working this angle because Don loves me. He's a sweet guy. We just need to continue the dialogue. And Russell was like, okay, go ahead. And so I went hopped on a plane out to Wise Virginia in September. I understood what Don's needs were. He wanted to have a charity. He was raising $2 million for a charity that helps underprivileged children have access to these Napoleon teachings at the University of Virginia. And they will match dollar for dollar the University of Virginia up to $2 million. And so they had a gap that they wanted to reach. And that would make his day, Don Green's day, and such a wonderful, wonderful man and good friend of mine. And we all know what Russell wanted. He wanted typewriters, manuscripts, and he has some TV rights that we're working on. And so I just said, hey, this is what we want. That's what you want. What do you say? And we just shook their like that old Southern gentleman. And that was it. And that's when you saw the typewriter and the outwitting the devil manuscript at FHL a couple of years ago. Yeah, like, Funnel Hiking Live last year, Justin sneaks up to me and he goes, do you want to see something cool? And I'm like, what is that? And he shows me the manuscript. And he goes, that's like a $1 million manuscript, bro. And I'm like, oh, this is outwitting the beast. He's like, it's outwitting the beast, man. I'm freaking out. Or what was it? Outwitting the beast? Like, I think it was the devil. It was the original manuscript that was his wife's copy. She had signed it, Annie Liu. So Napoleon Hill's wife, Annie Liu had signed it. And she was the one that when Napoleon Hill passed away in 1970, she lived for another 14 years. And she still wouldn't allow it to be published. But that was the original copy signed by her. And it worth millions of dollars. Dude. All right. So this relationship has grown and grown and grown and grown. Now to the point where you and Russell are speaking on stage. Let's make sure we show that video of Russell and Justin guys. If you guys don't know, like, Russell and Justin have been connected at the hip. They are like doing some crazy stuff and making some magic happen traveling across the world in order to create this. And it's happening next week. So what is this? What in the world is this, Justin? Well, so we most of us here at Funnel Hacker TV have some call it bibliomania, some call it an obsession. Russell has gone down the rabbit hole of rabbit holes. It started with the laws of success, which was a Napoleon Hill original. That when he first printed it was basically, it was the author's copies. And so you see it right there, law of success. And it was listed for $1.5 million. And so that was his original manuscript that he sent out to like Queens of England, presidents of the United States, titans of industry like Carnegie. And it was like the original like Dream 100 he sent out to these people. Well, there was only like maybe 100 made. Russell found that copy that was signed, the original original. And it was worth $1.5 million and a half bucks. And Russell went for it. I think he said he was having a bad day. And he said that was the only thing that was going to cheer him up. So he got that book. And when he started reading it, and obviously we all know Russell's favorite book was Outwitting the Devil, which is why we got that original manuscript for him. But the book that changed his life and so many of our lives was Think and Grow Rich. And because of our relationship with the foundation in Don Green, Russell was allowed to publish his own Think and Grow Rich with a beautiful forward that you can't wait for you to read and find out just how important this book was to Russell turning his thoughts, his thoughts into things. And those things helped to not only help him become wealthy, Think and Grow Rich. But so many of his clients and so many of us that his teachings were able to help us become wealthy and become rich. And so that's part of what this is all about. We have, we all, most of us know about the Lynchpin. We all know about the Mifki. And before I get to that, but first Think and Grow Rich book by Russell will be in the Mifki. But let's talk about what Secrets of Success is. Secrets of Success is a membership site. And for those that are following along on the Lynchpin, they understand of building the membership, building the continuity. And so Russell has spent over $15 million on these books, over 15,000 books that he has read through. Russell's probably greatest asset. He sees the greatest curator of all time. How he has time to actually read all these books? Because I'm pretty sure either he's got like a time machine. I know he listens to Voxxer on Forex and he's ears coming out to be the fastest ears on the planet. But he goes through all of these incredible authors. He finds the best books, the best authors. And he's gonna deliver them in a month by month training, you know, our success path. And we're gonna go deep dive. You see Napoleon Hill there, and Orson Sweat Martin, the original, Charles Handel, which was a contemporary and before Napoleon Hill, which is incredible material. So of those 15,000 books, we have combed it down to 28 authors that we're gonna feature. And Russell is going to write the book, Secrets of Success chapter by chapter with you. But the only way you're gonna see this chapter, taught live by Russell, is to get signed up at Secrets of Success. But right now, what we're talking about, there's only one way to get access to it. And we can talk a little bit more about it right now. You've probably seen some buzz. You've probably seen some people, maybe even on this screen, that have been talking about it. And right now we're giving early access for affiliates. And the affiliate marketing, Russell, who went back and forth, trying to figure out, how can I best launch this? And, you know, just for those that know Russell, he's really tired of writing $2 million checks, probably on a credit card, MX. $2 million to Mark Zuckerberg every month. You know what I mean? And the prices, the costs are going up. When he launched ClickFunnels, he didn't spend a dollar on paid ads for 18 months. His relationships, the JVs, the affiliate marketing, is what boosted, you know, ClickFunnels to what it is. And that's the same play that we're running again. We want to give that money to you. Just you, the funnel hackers, we want to give it to people that are fired up about this, that are fired up about Russell. So we're giving you access to an affiliate link. I'll let Ben maybe talk about it. And if there's others out there that you've seen, that are promoting it to get signed up with them and all that good stuff. Oh, Ben, we lost your audio. Hold on. You're just muted. Just unmute. Yeah, we're good. So yeah, thank you, Susan. If you guys remember like back in the day, once upon a time Russell launched ClickFunnels with an amazing, amazing affiliate program. That affiliate program was one of the best structured affiliate programs and it got everybody who wanted to move to move. And it was not a one tier affiliate program. It was two tiers. And the way that it worked back in the day was it was 40% commissions for anybody that you refer. So if I give my affiliate link to anybody, I get 40% of whatever they pay into Secrets of Success or ClickFunnels at the time. Then if they referred anybody, I got a percentage off of this. And what this does is it allows you to build a team and support a team to help go change the world. And this is like saying thank you to those who have a movement and are really big into this. And absolutely love it. Want to turn this into something more than just an affiliate promotion. And they actually want to turn this into a piece of the business. And that's what ClickFunnels did spectacular at the beginning. They've taken that affiliate program, correct me if I'm wrong Justin, and just said, this is what we're doing for Secrets of Success. This is the exact same thing. You have two tier affiliate opportunity. You get commissions off of whatever you recommend, but then at the same time, if you are a team builder and that's your focus, you can do the exact same thing and support your people as they support their people and so on and so forth. And you can make waves of change and be able to get that back into your bank account. The goal here is to go and sign up. So there have been a link floating around. I don't know if you guys have seen it, but there are people who are out there promoting. It's actually a part of the JV page. If we want to share my screen really quick, like we have a Facebook group of people who are inside of the JV. And so we have a JV going on right now. We have people in the group. If I were to scroll through this really quick, you would recognize names. You would see people who've already got the MFK, who've already got a box, all this stuff. Little welcome message from Russell, where he's like, do you want to see behind the scenes? Like there is some stuff happening right now. And if you have seen the links, you need to click on those links. Watch for the people who are dropping them. Look for what's happening because this all starts next week. And this is the preparation. This is how you get into it before the wave hits. So how do you ride the wave? You see the wave coming and you start to paddle and get positioned. This is the time to get positioned and to get all of this going because we've got some really, really cool stuff happening. Susan, you've been seeing this on the backend quite a bit. Like what have you been seeing as you're doing that? Yeah, I have a few things to say. So one is, okay, this is definitely not an opportunity you want to miss, whether you're into the old books or not into the old books. Like this is something everybody needs, whether they are a business owner, a funnel builder, your neighbor, your mom. Like everybody should be learning about these authors and these thought leaders from our past. And like it's just like, there are foundational principles that our society exists around from people that Russell will be talking about. This is an important thing for you to be a part of. Second thing is what it probably just left my brain. Oh, I remember. So there, I've been talking to people about this already and if you have a business right now where you're like, this is what I do, this is what I teach, but like people come to me with like mindset issues, like they need help getting through these things. And like that's not me, that's not my expertise at all. One amazing opportunity for you to be an affiliate for secrets of success, because you can just send them there, let Russell do that part for you through these books and these manuscripts and these authors and the amazing people. So it's an amazing companion with likely what you're already doing. Anything that you're doing too. Yeah, it doesn't, like this has been a funnel space idea. Right? So if you're in the funnel world, this is great for funnel world. I was talking to a couple of people and they're like, you know, I've created networks in old affiliate, old network marketing companies and old like these. This is something that breaks the barriers and really can put you in an amazing position should you choose to go out there and promote. Justin, what is the best way, Mr. King of Dream 100ing? What is the best way for somebody to actually like number one, find the link, but number two, how do they actually take that and run with it? Like what is the way for them to be able to make the biggest splash in the promotion that's happening next week? Yeah, well, it just depends on how you're set up. Look, if this is your absolute first rodeo, when you sign up, you're gonna get an email from me to go to that Facebook group, which was Secrets of Success, VIP affiliates. You can also just apply directly to it and you likely will still get in once we match up your email addresses. And we have so many wonderful affiliates, you know, like Susan that is already in there and so many, you know, Doug and the list goes on and on. A lot of the names that we know. And what they do is that they'll make a really long, beautiful post. There's also this thing called AI, I guess you can use that helps you write stuff. Anyways, you write a really cool post that talks about this, you can use the verbiage and we have, you know, swipe files and you can use some of the verbiage on the landing page there and write a cool post. And the main thing is like, how can I support them? What bonuses can I put on? Can I add like an extra level of training? Or can I, do I have some offers that align with this? Or what does my audience love? And what's maybe a bonus like a $1,000 product that I have if you're a coach or things like that? You know your audience, you know your people, just make it irresistible. Cause that's what we did, you know, we made it irresistible for you to sign up for this when we get to talking about the MIFTI. So kind of come up, figure out what is your own MIFTI for your friends, your family, your followers, your audience, your clients, your list and get it out there because all you gotta do is get them to sign up as an affiliate for free. Then they get access to the first access to the MIFTI box. And look, you know what? Let's let the greatest marketer in the history of the planet, let him do the closing, let him do the selling, just get them to, get them to the starting line. And once they get to the starting line, let Russell do what Russell does, which is over deliver just like your hat says Ben. And that will go from there. And we have such a great supportive community that we are all lifting, we have over 2,000 people in the Facebook group, almost 10,000 affiliates total. We're going for 35,000 by launch. Launch is next Thursday. You have seven days to make it happen. And so now is the time, if this is your calling, if just like Russell was talking at FHL, if you hear the calling, act. This is the opportunity. You couldn't buy something if you tried. You only have seven days to build your affiliate army. We're gonna give you early access is the plan to the MIFI box with those three books, two of which are unpublished worth millions of dollars that Russell has spent. And there's a rumor that you might have access to a special live training directly from Outsecrets of Success that's gonna be inside the membership site. That may or may not happen. Wink, wink. We see, okay. All right. So if you're not signed up, you should be signed up right now. So that way if something happens, so go to the Facebook group, go to the links that you're seeing posted by everybody. Oh my God. Susan, I cut you off. What were you gonna say? I was gonna say, people are asking how do they join as an affiliate? I think you just gave them the answer. Yeah. Well, like you said, if you've seen a friend or someone talking about it, or you go through your feed and sign up under them, otherwise we can put the link up there as well for you to sign up. If you're just like, I just wanna sign up now, you can do that as well. But another thing that we didn't mention, those aren't one time commissions. These are lifetime residuals. So for as long as somebody is active in the membership site, which why would they ever leave when they hear all these incredible insights and access to these million dollar books? You know, Russell's all about making it sticky. That's how you get a membership site. So as long as they're active, you get those residual monthly incomes, whether it's 40% first year or 10% second tier. Because if you sign up, what I call a whale or a big network or someone who goes just crazy with this, you're gonna get those checks monthly. And a lot of people have heard the stories and being in the right place at the right time. Well, guess what? You're in the right place at the right time if you're hearing this right now. If you love Russell Brunson, if you love what he's about, if he's changed your life, if he's inspired you, this is his biggest passion project. This is his legacy play. He knows when he can bring the pulling hill back from the dead, publish unpublished manuscripts, teach the things that he was meant to teach, open the success schools around the world. He knows that he will have the vehicle in place that he can keep his teachings, live on forever in mortality, and when he's no longer here. So this is the ultimate, ultimate legacy play for Russell. He wants to see it done with Napoleon and these other great authors that are no longer physically here. So he can ensure that his teachings will live on forever when he's no longer physically here, just like he's always joked about, but he's serious. If he gets hit by a bus, keep my ads running. Legacy play, this is what Secret of Success is all about. Yeah, this is the legacy play. I remember when we first watched the vision of what Secret of Success was going to be with the Atlas Library or Museum or whatever we're calling that sucker. I think it's only gonna be deemed the name, like once it's actually built, then we'll actually put a stamp on it. But like, I remember Susan walking away and you were touched. It was like, I need to be a part of this. I want, like, if you guys want a piece of that vibe and you wanna be able to be a part of something and be able to make, I've got family members that are freaking out about this and this is not something you share with family members. This is big deal. This is life changing. This is the ability to be able to actually support somebody and to help them find success. This is not just business success. It's business success in any area of their life. This is a full on new movement and it's so cool to be able to watch Russell and just funnel hacks. See how he's doing every single little thing and to see how you're supporting and making that happen every single step of the way, Justin, is been a blast. So, aside from everybody going and looking for links, trying to find out where it is, what is a more direct path? If somebody's like, you know what, I don't want a team. I don't wanna be on a team. I'm like the crazy shark. I'm just gonna go after it. Where do they go? How does this work? Here's the thing. So how many of you wanna partner with Russell Brunson, right? Everybody wants to partner with Russell Brunson. Why wouldn't you? Well, guess what? This is your chance. You get to be a 50-50 partner, up to 50% commission for life when you head over to secretsofsuccess.com forward slash JV. If you couldn't find anywhere else to go, then go there and get signed up. But this is your opportunity to partner with Russell for life. On his big-ish passion project, 15,000 books over $15 million spent. We've got a $25 million library and 20,000 square feet to build. This is the legacy play. And a lot of the people that are in inner circle like me, when they saw the opportunity to get the seats and to be a part of the library, it was a no-brainer because it's a one-time thing and you're gonna be a part of Russell's life for the rest of his life. You're gonna have access to this library if you buy one of those seats and we'll probably do something special for the affiliates in the top 10 that maybe have some extra access to the library as well. It's just, if you're about Russell, if you're about self-improvement and if you're about making impact with income, this is maybe the greatest opportunity that there will ever be in our lifetime. You said that people were jumping to get those seats and just, I think that opportunity and then also the secrets of success opportunity, both are like, not, it's like I need to make it happen. It's not like, oh, I wish I could do that. It's like, find a way to make it happen. That's how I was when I saw the seat for being in that building someday. I was like, I'm gonna find a way to make it happen. And I did. What we're talking about now, like there is no hurdle. You just need to go to the link, sign up. There's not anything to pay. You just go do it and then you share it with other people. And then, there's gonna be offers in the future which you gotta have offers. But right now, the only ask is just go sign up. That's it, that's it. There is no, like, I gotta find a way to make this happen. Like the way is just go to the link and go sign up. It is the easiest over-deliver possible. And it's because it's a passion project. It's because it's hard as there. Like when I jumped in, the very first thing that Russell did was like, do you wanna go see the library? I'm like, yes. And so we walked over and he's like, okay, here's this room, this has Napoleon Hill stuff. Here's this room, it has, here's this. This is like where he loves to live. And it's so fun to be able to play with it. Like he loves funnels. He's never leaving funnels. And he talked about this at Funnel Hacking Live. If anyone's wondering like, is this where he's going? Like is he pitch changing? He talked about this at Funnel Hacking Live. In order to be able to grow the message of click funnels, you go to the next level up. And what is that in our world? It's self-help, it's self-development. It is motivation. It's all those different pieces of personal development. And that is what secrets of success is coming. So this is going to make our message broader and stronger. So if you're a click funnels affiliate, you might want to think about being a affiliate of secrets of success as well. Might be valuable. There's some really cool stuff happening. So is there anything that we should end this on Justin that would like make people drop their hat and go? Is there something that we need to throw at them? Like, because there's, next week is going to blow your brains. It's so good. Yeah, we're going live October 19th. So that's next Thursday. You've got one week to partner with Russell before the world finds out about it. And then when the world finds out about it, you can still partner. But right now, you can help us build this affiliate army. We're about a third of the way. We need your help. And even if you're like, I've never done an affiliate marketing thing before, even if I don't know what I'm doing, if you're passionate, nothing trumps passion. If you're passionate about this, if this speaks to you, just get signed up for an affiliate link, and we'll teach you, we'll help you, we'll guide you. You know what I mean? Because not only, like I said, is a massive impact, but can you imagine, a lot of you know my history with the raw hemp and all the things that I did for my son, and now I've helped others, paying it forward. Imagine the impact you'll have on your friends and family, right? There's people that just aren't thinking right. Or just somebody went to high school with, and they see it, and they signed up, and that you're going to be able to help change their mindset. Russell's going to teach these secrets of success to change your mindset, to get out of fear, and to get into faith. You know what I mean? And learn how to program your subconscious to look for what's right. So you can have more of what you want. And it's not rocket science. And we all know Russell's the greatest at curating. He curated 15,000 books for us. He's going to teach us the greatest nuggets in his own way that we're going to be able to apply and change our mindset and take control of our lives. And can you imagine if you did that for a friend, or a loved one, or just someone you knew down the road, and they come to you and say, signing up for secrets of success was the thing that changed my life. I now understand how I can have the life that I want to live. Or I have the financial freedom. Or I understand that I was actually living a great life I just didn't appreciate it. And because you introduced me to the secrets of success and I signed up for free and I got those amazing three books in the mail, which we haven't even talked about the Mifkey yet, it's absolutely changed my life. Just like when you read The Forward for Diggin' Grow Rich that Russell did, in the Mifkey, you'll see how that book, Thinking Grow Rich, changed his life. He was making $1,000 a day, or excuse me, $1,000 or $2,000 a month. He read the book, and it changed the way he thought he applied the principles of Thinking Grow Rich, and now he makes close to $1,000,000 a day. And it was how his thoughts turned into things, and those things changed all of our lives, and has now changed the audiences that we've been called to serve. And again, he wants to pay it forward. He's done the homework. He's read the books. He's ready to give this to you. But the only place you're going to find it is when you go get signed up. Right now, the only thing you could sign up for is an affiliate link, which is going to give you early access to the live training. It's going to give you early access to the Mifkey box, which the Mifkey box has. You're going to get a free in the mail, just pay shipping. You're going to get the Think Grow Rich book, which is right there in the middle. You're going to get access to the original Mifkey. It will place you wherever you wish to be amongst men, which is what the Mifkey that Napoleon Hill used. If you signed up for his magazine for 12 months, you got that book, which was worth $35 back then, which is $3,500 this year. So that's the original Mifkey from Napoleon Hill. And then the Secrets of Master Salesmanship is the other book you see there as well, which was an unpublished manuscript that Don Green was so cool to let us put this in the Mifkey. Literally, it was in the back of the archives at the foundation. There's four people that have read it, me, Russell, Bob, and Don. And soon, it will be millions of others that will have opportunity to glean these insights. And there's the Hand of Destiny. That book right there cost $10,000 to read it per day. Russell said, that's great. I want it. The guy said it's $10,000 per page. He ended up negotiating it down to about half of that. So Russell, if you can do math on 200 times 5,000, figure it out. That's what Russell's grabs to check out for that one. And that's going to be a part of the Mifkey as well. Folks, this is the only. We want to change the world, but you have to take action. You've got to get signed up to the affiliate link so you can have early access. And then the Mifkey's coming. And you want to talk about funnel hacking. This is going to be the greatest funnel in the history of Russell Brunson.
