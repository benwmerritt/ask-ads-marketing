And the funny thing is, is you guys told me at the beginning, like, don't feel like you have to be prim and proper when you get out. That wasn't a problem. You're going to tell a story. I don't think I've ever told the story publicly, but they asked you the question was, how did you first get on the internet? I'm going to give you the guy. That's true. OK.

But before we introduce our guest, I have to introduce Mr. Chris Cameron, who's here co-hosting today. Chris, what is up, dude? What is up, my friend? We're recording a few of these today, but I'm super excited for this one because this is a guy we go way back. He's been in the industry, knows everybody, doing some crazy cool stuff. You know, the buzzword right now is AI, right? But like, how do you actually go apply this? That's what this guy does. So let's introduce him. Welcome, Mr. Matt Leitz, to the program, Matt. What up, man? What up? What's going on, fellas? I'm doing well and we appreciate your time. I'm excited to dive into a lot of stuff and even hear about, you know, your journey as a lot of our listeners are incredibly, you know, one, they admire, they admire you and love kind of hearing your backstory, what you've learned, what it's taken for you to get to, to this point. And one thing that I'm super intrigued about with even getting to dive, you know, I've known you for a while, but even diving further into, you know, your path to success, why the internet? Like, what got you started clicking a mouse? Oh, my gosh. Do you want me to drop the real story? Yes. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, and the funny thing is, is these guys told me at the beginning, like, you don't feel like you have to be all prim and proper when you get out. That wasn't a problem. You're going to tell a story. I don't think I've ever told this story publicly, but they asked you the question was, how did you first get on the internet? I'm going to give you the guy's truth. Okay. When I was in college, I was participating in extracurricular activities. It wasn't underwear modeling, was it? All right. That was a very short story. Thanks a lot. You ruined the whole thing. Yeah, I was billboards everywhere and blew up. No, but I was smoking stuff that's not legal, but then wasn't legal. And I had this idea that hit me, right? And I don't know if anybody on here knows, because I know you have a very straight list, straight lace listing crowd here. But when you have the end of a certain kind of a cigarette, they call it a roach. And to hold this thing, they called a roach clip. And I had this brilliant idea. I was like, what if we took a toy cockroach, a little toy bug, and we put a clip on it? And it was actually a roach clip, right? So I went out and the very next day, I went to the store and I got a little cockroach, and I got a clip. And then I thought to myself, you know, this is actually a roach clip. What if I went to the US Patent and Trademark Office and try it to trademark this word? And lo and behold, I applied for a trademark and I get a phone call. Her name was like Gertrude. I remember like it was yesterday. I'm sitting there and normally the trademark office does not call you, right? Like, you know. Like, dude, you know this is illegal, right? Yeah, no, this is the way the call went, right? She's like, Matt, as an examining attorney at the US Patent and Trademark Office, usually we don't make phone calls, but I had to let you know, I've been working here for 25 years and this is the most hilarious thing I have ever seen. The entire office is talking about it. And there's literally no person here that can come up for one good reason of why we cannot give you the trademark for the word roach clip. So I trademarked the word roach clip. So now here I am, right? I'm like, you know, I got this cool little novelty product. I own the word roach clip. I'm like, what am I gonna do with this thing, right? So I go out and this is in, I don't even know, maybe it was the 2000. I mean, it was like early on, like early in the game. And I went and I acquired the domain roachclip.com for $350, right? No. And that is how I got into the internet game. Now, fast forward, I failed in that business and failed in the next one, in the next one, in the next one, in the next one. But yes, that silly little idea to put a cockroach in a clip together, roachclip.com is how I got into the internet game. So this, this is wild, Matt, because you bring up something, dude, that I think maybe something that's inherent to like successful entrepreneurs. One, they're able to like just come up with these ideas and then they don't care, meaning that they're not scared to fail or maybe they are, but they'll just get over it and then they fail again. And so they're so resilient. And so that's what makes like, if you just fail enough, that qualifies you for success. It's like the best university ever. Like, is that something that's inherently with you? Or is that something that you have to like work with all the time? Like, well, crap, that didn't work. I think I was, I was just born a natural failure, frankly. Not just me. No, I'm just messing with you. No, but truth be told, I failed in roachclip.com not once, but twice. And if you go there today, I still own the domain and there's nothing there, right? And I'm very, you know, honestly, I didn't tell that story for a long time because it was this thing that was so, you know, there's so much judgment out there. But, you know, now it's practically legal. So here it is. You heard it first right here on ClickFunnels Radio. But that was certainly not the last failure. I'll tell you another quick one. I decided years ago, and I don't know if this is a video podcast or not. Yeah, I love some video moments for sure. All right. So the, right now my stand for my laptop is my board game called Don't Be a Loser. So I invented a board game and I was so excited about it. Found this awesome. Yeah, I mean, just like found this thing that I love. And, you know, there's a lot of people that invent a lot of board games and I was struggling, you know, I just couldn't get, you know, I felt like I was going to, you know, conventions like, sir, will you play my board game? You know, I just wasn't getting anywhere. And so. You come over here, let's sit down for a minute. Yeah, yeah. So I was like, oh man, I got to make a move. And by this time I'd had a couple successes. I did, I have made a few dollars, you know, people are like, why am I the guy of all the dough? It's loose. But I, you know, I'd made a little money. And so I creatively acquired the domain boardgames.com. So I was like, who the heck could fail with boardgames.com? This guy. No way. But I, it failed. Yeah, because I just, and this was, there's a lot of lessons you got to know your numbers. There's a lot of things that I learned, but I will share this because I think this could inspire some people, you know, the cool thing about domains is they're just like anything else in the world. Like, you know, I'm in a commercial building here that we bought, you know, we bought a, you know, really cool house, anything that you can acquire, you can, you can do so creatively and on terms, right? So here I am, this guy with this board game struggling. And I go to boardgames.com and it was the worst website ever. And I saw that this guy's like trying to, I'm sorry, to this guy, I shouldn't say that. It was kind of mean. It wasn't, it was an underutilized asset. All right, we'll say that. And I just could look at it and I'm looking at his traffic and I'm looking at how he's converting. And I'm like, he's making about $450 a month or something on there. It's like not making revenue. And I just, I tracked the guy down and I'm just like, look man, here's my vision. Here's my track record. Here's what I can do. And I made a deal with him that was basically, I think it was $500 a month plus a percentage of board game sales, right? So for 500 bucks, I got into boardgames.com. And all of a sudden I went from that guy that's like holding my board game to being like showing up like, yo, what's up? Oh, you got my seat at the table. Thank you very much, right? So it was just that kind of reminder that it's like, when you think outside of the box, you see something that if you can make a creative deal that is a win-win, you can make things happen. And you can make those kind of quantum leaps because I think that, you know, the beautiful thing about click funnels and all these programs is like, it gives people this ability to finally have this consistent thing that allows for growth and this predictable thing. But I just, I can't stress enough that in business, so many times it's about these breakthroughs. It's about these things that are just like chugging along, chugging along, chugging along. Strategic partnership, bam, you know? And I just, you know, I really would kind of challenge people to think outside of the box like that, you know, and step back and go, man, I'm into this industry. I need to get, you know, I need to do this thing. What is the move that I can make, you know, that's gonna help me get there and kind of give me that jump that I'm looking for? God, I love that. Especially with, and even you could also call it being resourceful or something. You know what I mean? Thinking outside the box, flipping something on its head because even if we don't, this is not about me, we're not gonna dive into my past. But there's been so many times where you have no favors, no connections, no nothing, but you just do something off the wall that's like, that worked. Totally. You know, what's the most recent way where you've had to do something like that that's worked out in your benefit? Well, I mean, it's, I don't know, yesterday. I mean, it's always something, right? This morning? So right outside of my door, so we have this building and it's robusting at the seams because we're remodeling the second floor right now. It's right outside of my door is, you know, what I believe, you can hear me, so I'm saying this extra loud. An absolutely brilliant technology mind, right? And we're just sitting there and we're like, we're trying to build, you know, some really cool AI stuff and I'm kind of hitting my head against the wall and you know, so here's a talent in all credit to, you know, my CEO, Jeff, who's just like, sees me every day and I think I got a good brain for this stuff, but I'm also, you know, supposed to be the CEO of a company and I'm the, you know, I still do the marketing and all these kinds of things. And he just goes and literally does a LinkedIn search and within 24 hours finds this amazing candidate. You know, the reality of it is, is this guy's acumen and background, we couldn't pay him, you know, like these just, what's my salary expectation? Okay, so only about three times more than we can pay you. Cool, all right, but here's the deal, right? It's like, you see this vision or you don't see this vision, if you see this vision, there's enough upside in this thing for everybody, you know? And so I would say one of the things that I've learned to do really well is to create creative compensation packages, you know? So like in the example for him, you know, it's like there's a salary, you know, everybody's gotta eat, you know, one thing my dad would always say is you want your people hungry but you can't have them starving, right? So there's a base salary and there's also, hey, you know, what's our, what's the product that you're delivering? Well, we want monthly recurring revenue. We want, you know, this is the thing that we're trying to generate. So all right, when we hit these thresholds, this is how you can get paid more and then, oh yeah, okay, cool, if we end up selling this company someday, you know, this is how you can participate in this thing, you know, and just kind of look at it and just, you know, it's the same thing as the boardgames.com. It's just, you start to realize it's like, I think a lot of times people think that there's these rules, there ain't no rules, you just make them up, you know? And it's a good deal when it's good for me and it's good for you and it's good for the world. And as long as you can literally write it on paper, you can put it together and it's a deal, that's it. You know, I think so many people who are not entrepreneurial minded struggle with that though, Matt, like for you, you've got it. So many people will sit there and they'll wake up in the morning or they'll beat themselves up at night, going, well, that's a dumb idea. They have these genius ideas and then they'll say it's dumb. You know, people like you, people like Russell, people like a lot of entrepreneurs will say, oh, well, why not? And it's this fearlessness that happens. So one, is that true with you? And then two, what happens if a person that you are gonna hire something might be a genius mind, but they don't see it that way. They have limiting beliefs instead of, yeah, let's take this thing to the mind of the right people. I appreciate you calling me a genius, Chris, but it's probably more ignorance than genius, right? I mean, and that's not even just the God's honest truth. You know, I mean, when we started using chatbots, like, you know, we were able to land mini chat as a client using mini chat as an app, right? Like that's free, you know, like you gotta be kind of dumb. But the way that we could do that is we were using the software and ways that other people weren't because I didn't take the time to go learn how am I supposed to do this thing? I was like, you know what, it should do this. And we were using this logic and creating these experiences, you know, that were just so far outside the box. And because of that, you know, Facebook noticed, next thing you know, Facebook's flying me to Palo Alto, California to like show them how we're doing these things. So, you know, the thing is, you guys are really highlighting the good stuff here, right? But there's also a lot of challenge that comes with that, right? So, I've ran my head against the wall a hell of a lot of times. So, when you say like are some people born with it and some people aren't, you know, of course maybe like anything else, but here's the thing that I will give myself a lot of credit for. And I think back to my early days as an entrepreneur, okay? And so, here I am buildingroachclip.com. I've never talked about this before, but this is like, I can give you guys the full scope of the story. Get the real scoop here. You guys are getting it, right? And I just remember sitting down with a mentor of mine, incredible guy, he had a couple of exits, just, he gave a lot, I went to the Ohio State University and he came and spoke and he took a liking to me and I'm sitting at breakfast with him. And I was a very slow starter in business. It took me over two years to make my first dollar, like very slow. We didn't have click funnels back then, you know? It makes a difference. I mean, you know what I'm saying? Like, when you're hiring, you know, anyway, I'm making excuses for myself, but I was just having one of those like moments where I was like kind of having a bit of a pity party, right? And I'm just like, man, like, I just, you know, I'm like, honestly, I kind of choking back tears a little bit, you know, I'm just like, I just, I'm not getting, I'm not going. He just looked at me and he said, Matt, I just got to tell you, it ain't gonna get easier. And the reality of it is you're gonna do one of two things, right? You're gonna give up and quit, or you're gonna learn to look at this failure differently because it's quite possible for you to see these same challenges and have them excite you because you understand and you know that these challenges are a part of the path that's gonna get you there and you learn to truly enjoy them and put a smile on your face. And I can tell you that there's situations and stuff that happens that like, I mean, we'll be in an event and stuff just blows up, right? And I'm just like laughing and dealing with the problem while everybody else is like ripping their hair out and freaking out. And I'm like, I'm smiling and I'm like, here you go. Like this is Tuesday, man. It's not a big deal. It ain't no thing, right? So it's so much of it is kind of getting that. And I think it's the thing that doesn't get talked about a lot is the sort of the attitude. When I'm evaluating people, right? And I'm sitting down and like, is this person the right person or is this person doing a good job? I only look at three things. I look at their attitude, I look at their ability and their effort. That's it, right? Like, what's their energy? Like, how are they feeling about it? Are they coming to work with a smile, right? Their ability. And I say their ability because I'm not even talking about their skills today. I'm talking about their aptitude, their ability to learn something, right? Potential. Yeah. It's a difference between being intelligent and being smart. Right? Like I was not smart. Nobody's smart when they start a business. You're not smart. You're not, but if you're intelligent, you can figure this stuff out, right? So that means you've got the ability, right? And then finally the effort. And people talk about the effort a lot. Like it was this big hustle culture and all this kind of stuff, but they're not talking about the fact like, great, you're working your ass off and you're a miserable son of a gun and nobody wants to even be around you. Like who gives a damn? Like it doesn't matter. Like you got to understand how to cultivate that attitude because then what happens is you, like that is like one of the hardest things to teach somebody, okay? Like he taught me and it hit me just because I'm, by nature have a good attitude. And it woke me up and I always anchor back to that. Now I'm just, you know, with practice it's become really good, but it's hard to get a new person in and be like, let me teach you how to have a good attitude about this, right? So, but the thing is about a good, when you've got that sort of spirit about you and your people just see like, they see you like just like get in the face and you're like, all right guys, here we are, let's go. You know, and it just becomes this thing that like, when your back is against the wall and you got nothing and you got no money and you got no thing, that's when you can like be like, yes, like let's go. Like now I'm like, this is the thing that we're gonna look back and you can future cast. And you look and you're like, I can't wait to tell the story on stage of that time when, right? And when you do that and you're in that moment, like the whole world opens up and you have that sense of clarity that like, man, you don't know if it's gonna be this funnel or that funnel or this ads gonna work, but you just, you now realize that I'm freaking unstoppable and there's nobody that's gonna get in my way. And you know, like to me, it's like, you probably brought me on here to talk about AI. We haven't even said the word yet. But it's like, you know, I can tell you everything about AI, but you still gotta go learn the stuff and you gotta have a bad attitude about it. Don't matter, you know? So you didn't ask me that at all. That was the worst. No, but this is a, no, this is an incredible answer. Yeah. And I love pulling stories out. If I can go one layer deep, cause I also do want to get into AI cause what you're doing is freaking incredible. But you mentioning, you know, these moments sticking with you, right? And you sitting with your mentor from Ohio State think it's not working, it's not working. There's a story there. Okay. Oh, go buck guys, every wire sucks. I didn't bring it. Okay. Like what, what story, what was that moment where you're like, you know, there's the, like the story you just mentioned, like one day on stage, I'll be talking about this. I want to hear that. And I know our listeners do too. I got, I have like so many of them. I'll tell you, one of them though was, was, again, we didn't have clinic finals, right? So you had to hire developers. So I went through the, you know, hiring in so many different internet ideas. Like this is why I love AI. AI is like reminds me the early internet days, right? You got an idea, you just build it and go. Like it's freaking cool, right? But the story that really sticks out to me is I remember after hiring a local development company, a national development company, hiring a local developer, I mean, I'm just racking up all of my credit cards. I'm so deep. I went to the friends and family in fools, right? Raised money, burnt through their money. And I'm at the point where I finally, I got this little like spark. Like I found this Russian programmer for $8 an hour that was super smart. And I was like, wow, this is a guy that can do stuff. But I had no money to feed myself, let alone pay this guy. I was out of money. And I'm at this point where I have nothing left to tap into. I've maxed out every credit card. And I'm just like, what do I have? And I at the time didn't even have a car. And my little sister, the angel, let me use her old Chevy Lumina, right? This old beater rusted out. And unfortunately it broke down and I had no money to fix it, right? So it's just sitting there in front of my little shabby apartment. And I'm like, how am I gonna get money to keep this dream alive? Like I gotta go. I can't ask anybody else for money. And I remember that there was this little credit shop. It was like city, whatever, you know, where you could go walk in and get a loan. Do it for high interest rate place. Exactly, right? So it was a five minute walk down the street. So I walked my happy butt in there. And I just, I never forget this lady. She was just the most like joyous, like big, awesome, just energy. And I was like, hey, here's where I am. You know, and she's like, honey, I wanna help you so bad. She's like, the thing is, is that like, you know, you're credit horrible. She's like, I need some kind of something, right? I need some sort of asset, some sort of collateral. Like, what do you have? And I'm like, I got my little sister's rusted car that doesn't run. She said, sugar, that'll work, right? And she gave me $1,000 on a car that didn't run, okay? That wasn't even mine. Just like wanted to help me. And I took that thousand bucks. And, you know, I've made millions of dollars since then. So it, dang. Yeah. Yeah, it's so cool. It was the first thing. Yeah, man. Yeah. I thought I'd dive into that a little bit more like, because I know people are right there at this point right now listening to this math. And I think that's what's so important is like, they're sitting there in the apartment. They haven't even walked down to the loan center and they've got the rusted out thing. What would you want if you get in the deloorium and go back in time and tell, you know, little Matty lights, right? Go tell him or go tell somebody else who's in that same spot, what advice, you know, now you got a Forbes and an Inc. 5000 plaque behind you. Like, what does that math tell these people? Just, it'll be worth it, you know? And the thing is that you can't really know until you look back. You know, I didn't end that story the right way. Who gives a damn about how much money that I've made, you know? It's, the thing is, is like, everybody hits their breaking point, right? And the reality of it is most people break, right? And it's okay if you have, you know, like, you know, I've been there, everybody's been there, you know, maybe you quit, maybe you come back, you know? And the thing about it is, is like, was it the thing that I put that $1,000 into that was the thing that, you know, made me? No, it wasn't at all. It was the fact that I kept it alive. And the thing is, is that it is going to change constantly. You know, it's, I mean, it's always this, you know, this pivot, this, you know, like, how does board games turn into chatbots, right? Like, it changes constantly, but the thing is- How does Roach Club turn into board games, you know? It's step by step. It is, that's it. But all that matters is you can't be married to the idea, but you gotta be a believer that you just, as long as you don't let the dream die, you're gonna get there. And I can tell you this, I have never in my life ever met somebody that's like, you know what? I've been trying with everything I have my entire life as hard as I possibly can, and never given up and I didn't make it. I've never met somebody like that. Never. But you know what I have met is a hell of a lot of people who have stories just like that, but their own version of it, who were at that point of breaking, but cat freaking going. Yeah. Right? And then they look back and they go, you know what? That was the best moment of it all. And it was because I had developed that attitude that we talked about earlier, that I'm in that moment and I'm laughing with this. You know what I mean? Like I'm not crying about the fact that I'm like eating ramen noodles. I'm like, this is, I'm freaking Steve Jobs over here. Right? Sugar, that'll work. Right? Like, yes, that's it. That was the box. All right, sugar, let's go. Like I won't name my first girl after you, whatever it takes, like let's go. So, you know, it's just, AI is just another thing. You know, it is, is it legit? Like, dude, is nothing like it that I've ever seen, but it doesn't matter if you ain't gonna go all into it. Yeah, let's dive into that though too. I mean, you guys, you're feeling pop-filled. And start the podcast. No, this is great, man. I love every second of it. Sometimes that's the stuff that people are here to because it's a motivational thing, man. People, you know, you don't drive across the country, you know, in the dark, the headlights don't reach from LA to New York. They reach just far enough and you just keep going, man. You just keep going. I like that. I like that. That's awesome. So now you've come from Roach Clips to Board Games, to Bot Builders, right? I'm taking a lot of liberties and jumping here. Yeah, for sure. But what is it about AI and even this chat thing like this organic contact and meeting people where they are, how did you come up with that and what are you excited about right now? So when I invented chat bots, no, I'm just kidding. That was a chance. No, on all honesty, I thought I invented social media. I swear to God back in the day. And they're like, yeah, if you're going to think about Friendster and I'm like, oh, man. Like, wait, what if it could? They're like, yeah, that is it. Exactly. You put the pictures in, you know. But so I guess how we got into chat bots. I was not early on. If you guys remember, remember when mini chat was this like sensation and it was just crazy. And everybody's like, Messenger's going to kill email and a whole bunch of stupid stuff, right? This just simply isn't true. I was like, kind of like, all right, no thanks. And in fact, at the time, our marketing department would come to me and like, we need to build a bot. I was like, no, we don't because I was such a big believer. I was like, we're a customer support company. We win because we take care of people. And I always thought that bots were the opposite of that. I thought it was like, oh, let's phase people out. And really what I realized when I finally got in there, I was like, oh my God, this is like just crazy because it creates such a connection and experience. You know, like you guys are copywriters. We all live in the email game. And like to me, like a bot and not a lot of these crappy, like when people think about their like bank bot or like these are just horrible experiences. Like we create these like multi-dimensional, kind of like really like, so imagine like you're writing an email, right? It's like writing copy in two dimensions. Imagine you're writing a chat bot. It's like writing copy in three dimensions. You know, it's a whole different level of experience. And what we realized is like, you know, yeah, of course you can use chat bots to like save a lot of time on things like FAQs or whatever. But we have so many people that use them for like flipping houses and like, you know, getting coaching clients. And like better coaching their clients that they have. Like imagine this, okay? You're never gonna replace a coach with a chat bot. Like no way. But let's just say you do coaching with a client once every two weeks. There's a lot of time in between, right? So what if you could have your chat bot holding somebody accountable, helping them with problems along the way. And then if they're not checking in or if they're having bad check-ins, it pings the coach so the coach can go check on the client. So what we do is like our mission here is, we help businesses grow by using automated technology that creates more human connection. That's our mission. So, you know, we really, not even just like the way that we build this stuff is very different, but just fundamentally like, I hear a lot of people like, use the AI so you can fire your staff. And I'm like, I don't even want you to buy our products because I have no interest in that world whatsoever. What I have interest in is, let's use AI to empower your team to do better, cooler stuff and to save time on the stuff that they don't want to do so they can do more powerful things and that you can grow your company and then hire more people, right? That's what I want to use AI for. So, you know, I think maybe, maybe because we came at the whole thing differently and we've just, you know, from day one, you know, it's just the whole hype cycle, right? You know, you learn about this like, and what's going to happen, it might be happening right now, I don't know, but it's just like all this hype about AI. And this is a very long hype cycle, which means this is a pretty big technology. You know, the CEO of Google came out and said that, that AI is more profound for humanity than fire electricity and the internet. Dang, yeah. Like, okay, he's smarter than all three of us put together. Like, all right, you know, so, you know, it's, we all know now that it's here and the question is, what do you do about it? And how do you do it in a way that's going to create a better human experience? You know, not a worse one, not a disconnected one, you know, because that's not something that I'm interested in, you know, and it's like the number one thing I hear is, it's like, well, you know, AI is taking jobs. Well, it's like, it's also creating jobs, you know. Yes. Great jobs. And it's- You can do so much more with the human, right? And AI combined. That's it, man. Yeah, absolutely. So that's, we're, you know, we're very small players in this whole thing, you know, like for us, we serve small businesses. One of our company values is technology for the people, you know, so we want to make it very approachable, you know, very easy so that, you know, a plumber or a solar pernuer or anybody can really get in the game. So we don't, we're not doing any hardcore, you know, obviously we're all tapping into open AI and stability, you know, these big companies, you know, but we're just making it so that anybody can use it and use it effectively and get their desired result while creating a better human experience. That's nuts. And even to your point of just creation and adding more stuff, or Sam Altman, I think I heard a quote of saying that he thinks that with open AI, it'll be the first billion dollar solar pernuer company or somebody will, with the power of AI be able to, and I'm like, dude, I haven't fully wrapped my brain around it yet. Well, here's the thing, it's like what I was saying back in the day with the internet, right? It was like, I remember when I took a class, you guys want to hear a crazy story, I've never. Yeah, that's what we're here for. You guys are like, you guys are getting it out of me, you guys are good, I like this, right? So I am, here's the truth about me. I'm not the technology guy. Like I, when it comes to like laptops and phones, and I hate this, I hate it. Like I struggle to log in, I have to hire somebody just to keep me logged into my stuff, right? I'm really good at like marketing automation and moving boxes around and all those things, but I hate technology. So I'm in college and I get to this class and I realized that this class is a computer design class. And I'm like, I don't know, like not into this, but I come in, I sit down next to this cute girl and we start talking and it turns out that this class was taught by this guy. I had no idea it was like this famous interface designer, right? It was a very, very, like just like he's a legend. And anyway, he says in this class, you can, you can, the whole thing comes down to one project and you have to design either a piece of software or a website, okay? And you can have a partner to do it. And so this is right about the time that I have this roachclip.com. It just acquired the domain. Like we're bringing it full circle here guys, all right? And so I'm like, I tell her the idea. She's like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. Cause I have no concept of what I want to do with it, right? And then we go up to him afterwards and we say, hey, this is a little outside the box. And he's like, are you kidding me? This is the greatest idea I've ever heard. Let's do this, right? So it was the first time I was not a scholar at all. This is the very first time that I actually built a relationship with a professor and we're working on this thing. And this is what I loved about this. And this is where I want people's minds to be with AI, okay? Cause I'm not a scholar. And it's like, this is just really cool. This is like, this is a very cool thing. I want people's minds to be with AI, okay? Cause there's people like me that will teach you about this stuff, right? But we're gonna give you the box, right? Just remember that this is the time that you can think about anything, right? Like just come at this thing and just be like, what if, right? And if nobody's doing it, you could literally build it for pennies on the dollar today. It's crazy, right? So I'm in that space and we're designing this interface And literally the technology is just now getting there today where you could even build something like this, right? But it didn't matter and he let us think outside the box and we did this thing and we presented it and it was just like amazing. It was so cool. And the three of us were like high five and it was totally amazing. And a week after this class ended, I called the girl who I'd become friends with and her sister answers the phone. And she's like, you know, I'm really sorry to tell you this, but Beth, you know, died in a car accident last night. And I'm just like, whoa, like, man, like so crazy. And I wake up the next morning and I go to osu.edu. This is the largest university in the country. On the front page of this website is my professor, Professor Frieden. He passed away the exact same day. And I'm just kind of like, okay, you know, like this is I like some stuff, man. I mean, you feel terrible, but also something's going on. This is Twilight Zone. So that night I'm sitting in, you know, my favorite local bar and, you know, I go there by myself. I've never gone to a bar and just said, you know, but I'm just like in this weird space and I'm just thinking about this and out of nowhere, my friend that I haven't seen in forever, right? Oh my gosh, you ready for this? Full circle story. I don't believe I'm telling this story in click phone. This is insane, but the day that I thought of the Roche clip, okay, true story. I was walking down the street and saw this girl who was working in my restaurant that I never even got the chance to meet. And I told her the idea for the Roche clip. Okay. Last night I had this idea. I take a cockroach and I put a clip on it and she's like, no way. She's like, that's so cool. Can I help you? And I was like, yes, I don't have a car. Could you maybe drive me around to get some like true story? Okay. So this, this is the girl that literally helped me put these, my first business idea together in less than 24 hours. So here I am. Okay. So after coming up with this concept for Roche clip.com, joining this class on accident, meeting this amazing girl, meeting this amazing professor, creating this project, we're going through this thing, find out the, they both pass. I'm sitting at the bar by myself, haven't seen this girl forever. She walks out of nowhere into the bar by herself, sits down next to me and we're like, what in the heck? And she's like, what are you doing? And I told her the story. And she said, Matt, my grandpa, the pastor always told me that in life, there's something that we're put here to do. And sometimes in life, it's a very grand thing. And sometimes it's a little thing and something times it's something we're supposed to say to somebody or somebody we need to raise or whatever that thing is. But sometimes it's just, whenever you play that little part in the whole cosmic thing, that's your time. And I just broke down in tears. And I'm just like, I'm like, at this point, it's just like, I feel like I need to actually do this. Cause at that point, it was just this concept that was just drawn out on paper and shared in a class. And I was like, you know what? I'm getting into the internet business and I'm doing this. I am supposed to do this and I'm going to do this. That's amazing. That's so cool. Yeah. Wow. That's the right that happened. And so many of us missed those. What I refer to, I might call it divine rendezvous. Like God, universe, whoever is putting you into these situations often just times to see what's Matt going to do with this? Like here's a little bit. Yes. What's he going to go do with it? What can you go create? We're all here to be creators. Yeah. Right? So I think that's amazing that you kind of line that up. That's a crazy though sequence of events. And even yeah. You're staying true to like your calling too. Right? Because that's what it was. And you could have, like what you've alluded to multiple times kind of been scared or not, fears a compass and not kind of leaned into that. And what's the next step? What's the next step? Right? Even for us being God fearing men, like Chris, what you were just saying, like here's a test. Right? Does Matt pass or does he lean into it? Right? Okay. Then here's what's next. Right? Here's what's next. Congratulations. Which is interesting because I don't think the answer to that was like, oh, hey dude, guess what? Yeah, it's Roach clip. It wasn't, it wasn't that product. Right? No, it was just keep going. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's you're on the right. That's the lesson. Yeah. It's, it's these coincidences. Right? It's like when these coincidences happen and it, what to me, I'm a believer that when these coincidences occur, I'm using this air quote for those listening on TV. It's a sign from God, the universe, whatever you want to call it that you're heading in the right direction. And it's the more frequently that they occur. It's just this, it's just straight indicator. Right? You're like, okay. All right, let's go. I mean, last night I had one that hit me like, you know, I was like, I was like, literally the second that I thought of something like, should I do this thing with Chicago? The very second Chicago came on the radio. I'm like, oh, and those things happen. Right? And we just kind of brush them off and maybe sometimes, you know, whatever. But like, I don't know. But it gets you moving too. Right? Like whether it is like, if you're the person that's sitting there and being like, ah, it's probably coincidence. If you're going to brush that off, then, you know, God might brush you off a little bit and be like, okay, well, if you're not going to stay in tune to this, this frequency that I'm giving you, it's like, so, hey, you heard Chicago. Here's the deal. If that's God or not, who cares? Yeah. I'm going to act on it because the only way you're going to find out is going and acting on it. Yep. And guess what? I picked up the phone call and made the call. Right? That's what I'm talking about. That's, that's, you know, I mean, like I don't question it anymore. So, you know, you want to talk about all time podcasts that people came in for one thing and got another. I'm also fired up right now. Like someone will find me a helmet and a brick wall. Like I'm ready to go. Let's go. Cool. We could talk to you all day, but here's what I want to do. I do want somebody, if they want to be able to find you, tell us where they can go learn more about you, whether it's social media, if it's bot builders, where's the best place for somebody to go get in your world? Yeah. I almost said I don't use social media because I'm not, like I'm not really big on it, but I am now on social media guys. So that's cool. Well, you invented it so you should be. I know. I know. Yeah. No, but you know, you can always go to botbuilders.com. But if you want to learn, I hope it's okay to plug this, webclass.ai. And if you want to just get the fastest scoop on like what's straight line on where you want to go, that's what you do. But I'm so honored and privileged that you guys had me on this thing because it's Click Funnels is like, it's industry standard on so many levels and like you guys just haven't met you guys along the way, both super cool. And this is a privilege for me. So thank you for letting me tell my stories. There's quite a few of those stories that I don't know that I would have ever even saw the light of day publicly, but thank you so much. People learn from it, man. Thanks for being true and being all heart to it's people need to hear this stuff too. Like this is such a big part is the belief. And listen, just because somebody heard today, hey, you know what? Matt lights can do it. I'm like him. He was like me. I'm telling you this is going to change somebody's life. So thank you for that. Awesome. Thanks, Matt. Thank you guys.
