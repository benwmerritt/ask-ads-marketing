## Transcript
Hi there everybody. Welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are so excited to have you guys. I am getting up and starting because I don't know where Susan is. So like I've got the plan for today's we're gonna be fine. We're just gonna go ahead and jump in and get started and we'll go ahead and make it all work. Wait, what's going on? Hey, can you hear me? What's going on? I am at ClickFunnels right now. I am in the parking and I was thinking that it's time for Russell to give us the FHL speakers. So I'm here. I'm gonna go inside and we're gonna get him to tell us who the rest of the speakers are. Oh my gosh. Yes, please. All right. Should we do an intro or something like that? Yeah, do an intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Okay, so what's going on? Okay, I'm at ClickFunnels. I'm at the doors. Okay, speed ClickFunnels. All right, we're going in. We're gonna go find Russell. What the heck? Here we go. All right, so guys, if you're joining us, like Russell's been talking about who the ClickFunnels speakers for speakers is gonna be for Funnel Hacking Live and he hasn't actually like revealed like the final group and so Susan Storm in the castle. This is crazy. Going in. Going in. Okay, guys, Russell's office. Hey. Oh, wait. Okay, we're, Ben and I are on FHTV right now. Oh, hey guys. Surprise. We're gonna get signed on out to speakers. What do you think? Like right now? Right now. We're good. Let's do it. Can we shift gears? We're good. I'm gonna pull back up and work on the slides, but we're gonna get a little bit of a break. Let's see. Oops. We're gonna figure it out. I think, can you hear me around? Hello? Yes, we can see you. We can hear you. Okay. Welcome everybody. What's going on? What's it going? A little caught off guard. What is up, Russell? Welcome to the office. Thank you. Oh, welcome everybody. Oh, okay. We're gonna get a little bit of a break. Let's see. What are we doing? We need to know. We need to know. So, um, well, first off, what's up everybody? Um, as you know, we did a speaker contest a little while ago and everybody keeps telling me like Russell, who won the speaker contest? It's been a busy last couple of weeks for me. We did a whole groundbreaking ceremony. We launched a supplement company. We're launching funnels and we're gonna be doing a speaker contest. So, um, we're gonna be doing a speaker contest again. First off, I'm never gonna do a speaker contest again because it was the most stressful thing in the world for me. We had like 150 or something people submit videos and guess what? Almost all of them were insanely good. And I was just like, oh crap, we're supposed to pick just one. And so, um, then I was like, I'm not going to do this. I put on my team. Like everyone watch all these and tell me who's best and they came back with like another dozen. They're like, where's the dozen that are all insanely good? And there's also actually a lot of people who are really, really good who will fit in different spots but didn't fit in this year's agenda. As you guys know, fun hiking live, it's not just random speakers. Like there's a process and a flow, especially this year. This year we're going to be we're going to really deep into Lynchpin. And so, um, speakers had to fit with like, with the correct message and the right like case studies of things that we're actually working, that we're trying to share at fun hiking live. And so, um, but there are a lot of really, really good ones. And so instead of just picking one or two, um, I shipped us some things around. We got some late nights. We got some early mornings to be able to fit in more people. So, um, how many are we picking exactly? I remember, four, five, six, seven, eight. There's eight people we slipped in. Is that right? So I hope you guys are okay if we over deliver because we promised one and we got eight. Um, so I thought it was less than that. We have eight people. Make sure you come to Fun Hiking Live. You guys are ready to not sleep because we're going to make this event amazing. But I know we found places to fit everybody in and we found some really strategic cool spots to help, uh, tell the story of what we're trying to share at Fun Hiking Live even better. So, um, that's kind of what we got. So how should we do this, Ben? I know you were, um, it looks like you've been working on something behind the scenes. Yeah. Let me go ahead and pull this up really quick. I was just playing with this like for the eventual. I didn't know when you were actually going to do this. So I was like, you know what, let's just get kind of like everything prepped. So this has been on Photoshop just packing things together. Um, I'm just going to build it. It still blows my mind. You have to be a good photographer. Yeah. Can you see this? Do you have anyone who can see these pictures? Do you want to guess who these faces are? And the shape of the heads? It's always weird seeing the shape of the heads like this. Some of them are very distinguishable. Some are like, is that Marge Simpson? Anyway, so difficult. Okay, there are people guessing. I can't see. Hopefully, people are guessing who they think. Um, everybody gets below. Okay. Well, should I go through these like in no particular order? Or is there a particular order? You can take the order that you want. You go for it. I will light it up. Uh, we're gonna light I'm just gonna go randomly then. So the first person that I'll tell a story, this person has actually spoken in front of my life twice in the past, but she recently, her submission video was awesome, of course, but it was something that was really, really powerful and I had so many amazing women reach out to me like please pick her because she over the last year or so had her first baby, was offline, wasn't able to do what normal people do like when they're trying to run and grow a business, yet her business grew during the time running joint ventures and things like that. And so she wasn't even paying for traffic and her business grew while she was taking, it will take off a whole bunch of time to have a baby and be a mom and all those kinds of things. And so the first guest speaker who we are gonna be bringing back this year's Funal Hacking Live is Miss Catherine Jones, let's go. Woo! That was crazy. If you guys were at First Funal Hacking Live, at First Funal Hacking Live, she told a story about a boy who broke up with her because she was too ambitious or something and this year she's coming back married and with a baby, which is insane. And so anyway, we love Catherine and super excited to have her back and be able to share this. And I'm really excited because she's gonna be talking about how she did this with joint ventures, which is something that so many people struggle with getting traffic to their funnels and their websites and their offers and things like that because Facebook's getting harder, it's getting more expensive. And so Catherine's gonna be showing you how to do that without actually spending money. So if you want free traffic without spending money, that's what Catherine's gonna be talking about. So it's gonna be awesome. Your JV system is amazing. Yeah, I'm excited for it. We've never really gone deep on JVs in any Funal Hacking Live. This is the first time I have a chance to really do that, which would be cool. She went crazy on the campaign too. Like she was hitting up massively in order to speak. Like I got notifications, my friends got notifications. That is so cool. She's probably the one that was helping to blow up your communication. Yeah, once again, this is why I'll never do speaker. I was getting like on average like 40 boxes a second for like two weeks. I'm like, this was a bad idea. But it was really cool. In fact, for all the speakers who submitted who didn't get picked, I have something in my head really cool for everyone. Anyway, I can't announce it yet, but it's gonna be a really cool thing we're gonna do over the next year, leading up to next year's Funal Hacking Live to help find some really cool speakers earlier, which will be cool. Because again, a lot of people kind of came out of the woodworks and it was really cool. Anyway, so, okay, so there's number one, it's Catherine Jones. Let's go. Okay, next person, our next person to talk about. So this is someone who I've been aware of her for a long time. She is somebody who my wife actually was listening to her podcast for a long time. And so last year, you guys know we had Brooke Estillo spoke at Funal Hacking Live and Brooke coaches, life coaches and stuff like that. And one of her students, and what she encouraged her students is like, when you become a life coach, don't just be like, I'm a life coach for all people, but find like a market that you're in. And so this person is actually a huge life coach in the LDS Mormon market, which is really cool as a podcast. So my wife listened to her, all her friends listened. And it's like, and so I knew that her podcast, I had no idea that she was part of our universe in our world. And she submitted some videos and I was like, oh my gosh, Jody Morick, I am a huge fan of her as a person. And no idea that she was even in our community. And so we started talking back and forth. And so she's gonna be coming and sharing some really cool things about, with you guys about ability versus capacity and some really, really cool things. And so I'm pumped. In fact, this will be the first time I had a chance to meet her in person, but we've, in fact, we do a summer family vacation every single year. And like four or five years ago, we were going on this family vacation and she had a podcast so that my wife and I were listening to, to like prepare you for a family vacation. We were laughing so hard on the ride. And so I'm pumped to actually have a chance to get to know her better personally, but I'm gonna have her share with you guys as well. So speaker number two for the announcement is Jody Morick. Give her a huge round of applause. Let's go. So that's gonna be, gonna be amazing. And the topic on ability versus capacity, this principle is something that I think for most of you guys, when you hear it, it'll be one of the things that change life forever. And so I'm not gonna go deep with that other than just to say that first time I heard this, it was profoundly, had a huge profound impact on me. I think for any of you guys who are trying to grow and trying to scale and trying to change the world and trying to get your message out, what Jody's gonna be sharing with you guys is gonna be one of those things that's like, they'll be like, you before that moment and you after. And this is the transition that's gonna give that to you guys. So I'm excited to bring this to Funnel Hacking Live. I think it's gonna blow your guys mind. So it's gonna be awesome. That's crazy. All right. That would have been enough right there to make me go get my tickets. So if you don't have your tickets yet, go to FunnelHackingLive.com. Let's go. This is FHL9 by the way, which is crazy. Nine years have been doing this. I can't even, yeah, what year did you get bumped into our world? Oh man, I was like four years ago. Four years ago. But I was up into the last three. Yeah. That's amazing. Ben, you weren't in Vegas though, right? No, I had a ticket to Vegas. I didn't go. So I was able to go there. You could have been at every one and you missed it. For everyone here right now who's not at nine, like you could be at nine and you could miss it like Ben and be, and regret it for the rest of your life. Like do you regret this for the rest of your life? I do. I do. I do. I do myself every time. Like I've been to every one except for the first one. Oh. Don't miss it you guys. Anyway, nine is gonna be amazing. And this year's gonna be special. We're doing something we've never done before, which I think every year is amazing. We give like really cool frameworks and tactics. This is one where it's gonna be going deep on like one focal focal point. Anyway, I'm excited. Okay. So that said, should we jump to the next guest set of speakers? Yes. Okay. So the next speaker I'm talking about, this is somebody who got on my radar because he keeps winning all of our affiliate contest. He's been doing a lot of challenges. He won our affiliate contest, won a bunch of other big ones and a couple of things. Number one, he's awesome. And so excited to have him on stage to share things with you. But number two, what's crazy to me is I think he's done this entire thing, like winning our affiliate contest and others with a list of like 5,000 people. And so, which is amazing. So he's gonna be talking about how they're using a lot of Lynch pin things in his business, doing challenges, things like that, how to build a relationship with your list, like all the things he's doing. And so our next speaker is Doug Bouton. So Doug, let's go. I'm really excited to have him here. He's gonna be, he was here in Boise last week, the big groundbreaking ceremony. So he's gonna be amazing. And he's someone who like, came into our community and has had a lot of success. And I think for a lot of people who, there's some of you come into our world and you're like, oh, I gotta have a million person list to be successful. I gotta have this and that. And he's just proof. Like if you just have a really good personality, good work ethic and you keep doing the things, like all the stuff you're striving towards will kind of come towards you. So anyway, Doug's amazing. I'm pumped for that. All right. Three amazing speakers already. I know, like we could just stop right here. Should we just cancel the rest of this, just kidding. Okay. Next up, I should have you introduce the next speaker. Oh man, no, you go for it. We're still trying to figure out some things. What things are that? Now I'm nervous. Maybe we shouldn't do this. Go for it. So the next one. So obviously we've been talking a lot about Lynch pin as a, for people to do Lynch pin, but there have been a couple of agencies who popped up who are specifically teaching or like implementing Lynch pin for people. I think a lot of people understand is like, obviously there's like the opportunity on one side to be using these frameworks and models for your own business, but also to be able to do it for other people. And so I know Susan and Andrea who are announced in their agency do these kinds of things, people doing like actual Lynch pin, building these out, which is super exciting. And so Andrea, peer peer. Yes. Andrea is up next. Let's go. Tell me more, Andy, you know her better than I know her. Well, Andrea is amazing. Yeah. So Andrea and I have an agency together and we've been just exactly what you said. We've been putting Lynch pin into everything cause Lynch pin is the way. And yeah, she's been, she's had her own agency for a lot longer than what we've been doing together. And she's just amazing. She's worked with a ton of people, really helped them like implement full systems into their business. And it's awesome. She's also like a PhD in customer experience type stuff. So like, yeah. I'd not know that part. She's gonna be awesome. That's awesome. I think a big thing is for anyone who's got an agency or something that understanding like all the stuff you learned from Hacking Live can be like skill set, you're learning to be able to apply to other people's businesses. And so Andrew's a great example of that and excited to have her come and share as well, which would be amazing. So there you go. All right. One, two, three, four, we're halfway there. All right. Great for number five. Number five, I have an awkward story that I'm not gonna tell because it's really, well, anyway. So this is somebody, I don't have to tell the story. This is somebody who is a big believer in relationships and has been in our community now for, I don't know, six or seven years with a focal point like building relationships. He has a whole system called ROR, which is return on relationships. So the funny story is his son's a wrestler. Obviously I'm a wrestler. I was wrestling out in Florida at this tournament and it was a beach wrestling tournament. So we're under the sun like eight hours, sun beating on us. And I was getting like sunburn and blistered. I was trying to wrestle in the sand. So think about sweaty skin on the sand and sunburns. Like it doesn't feel good. And he was like, I have a suntan lotion. And so I'm trying to put it on myself, but I'm like, it was so funny. So he's like, I can put it on your back if you want. I'm like, this is so awkward. He's put on my back and I was like, this is the ultimate return on relationship, man. Like I owe you now because you saved me from, anyway, it was this awkward, funny moment. But Christopher Voss is someone who's, who has been in our community for a long time. And I'm excited because I, most of you guys are all voting for me to come and speak. And it's going to be really cool because I think a lot of times we get into business and too many people focus just on like, how do I make money? What's the return on my ad spend and things like that. And it's like, they don't understand the return on relationships. And so Christopher's gonna come and teach and talk about, oh, he's moving on the graphic even. He's an amazing, amazing person. And I think he's going to install something for all of you guys that it will be really, really useful. Just the importance of really doubling down on that. And I think one of the things I've been most successful in my business isn't like our ability to buy ads. It's been, you know, I spent 20 years now building relationships and like trying to keep relationships. Even I had people who have treated me really bad in the past. I try not to burn bridges and keep relationships. I think that's not talked about at all in our industry, especially in our ClickFunnels community. So I'm excited for Christopher to come and be talking about how to build a return on relationship and how to build partnerships and friendships and things like that that'll help you through your whole business. So, so Christopher Voss, give me a huge round of applause. Let's go. Yes. Okay. That's going to be a good one. I should have been more prepared for this. My energy out. Yes. All right. We got three more. Next to someone who, I didn't know how cool they were until they sent their submission video. And with the submission video, they sent a link to this documentary. They're working on like a TV show, I think to pitch Netflix or something. But this is somebody who is just like all of us. They do funnels and webinars. But the video I saw, which was insane, is he was doing a webinar, not just a normal webinar. He was on the side of the Grand Canyon and they to get, is this Starlink? What's the internet thing that? Yeah. Is that we got to get Ben? Yeah. Yeah. Cause the internet was horrible. So it's like Starlink. It's like, it was doing webinars on the side that they drive through all this crazy thing and doing these live webinars inside of Grand Canyon. And the document was crazy cause they were like driving, they're getting lost. And their webinars like starting at nine PM Eastern, whatever, and they're trying to like get to the thing. And then they did this webinar, like looking over the Grand Canyon and crushed it on sales and does these crazy things like that where they're doing like dramatic demonstrations, but like doing them dramatically. Like not boring like, I'm Russell behind my desk, like me on the side of a cliff, like insane. And like, anyway, I wanted him to come and just talk about those things to show you guys how much fun this business can and should be and how it doesn't have to be like the way that Russell does it on a stage or whatever. Like you can do this anywhere. Like literally on the side of a cliff if you want to. Anyway, and so just I'm excited for Tim Shields to be coming and presenting it this year's Funnel Hacking Live. And hopefully it gets the documentary on Netflix. We can like see this whole story play out for real, which is the amazing. So, Tim Shields, that's next. All right, next up after Tim is, this is somebody who submitted a video and at first I kind of laughed. I wasn't like thinking about too much. And then I watched it a couple more times over the next couple of days. And I was like, man, this is something that I think a lot of people struggle with. We don't talk about it because it's kind of a funny thing, but also like it's a real insecurity. So my question for all you guys, how many of you guys are nervous? If I published online, if I do Facebook Live or webinar or podcast or whatever, people might make fun of me. I might have haters, I might have to talk trash about me. I remember that when I first got started, that was the hardest thing. I would put something out there and someone talked trash about me online and I would shut down for like a week or two. And it'd be so like emotionally hard. For me, I'd get thick skin. I had like higher support staff to block it, but how do you deal with that? Especially when you're just getting started. And so the next guest speaker posted a video kind of showing what she did, which was she had some haters who went and talk some trash about her online. And she turned that into a whole campaign, which actually freed her and made her more successful. I think what she's gonna be sharing with you is gonna help you to get out of fear if you're afraid of like people judging you or talking trash about your things like that. So the next guest speaker is gonna be Miranda Pierce. Let's go Miranda, which is gonna be awesome. So this is one of the things to be really fun and give you guys just some cool tools that are, again, we don't talk about this, it's not like Facebook ads or analytics, but it's like the stuff inside of our minds that keep us from being successful and how to break through those things and have success. So I'm excited for Miranda to come present to you guys as well. And then with that said, we got one last speaker and this is somebody, I'm really excited for this speaker. He's one of my favorites. I met him initially because he was in the two common club X coaching program and I would go in live once a month. Every time he was the first person there asking questions, ton of energy. And he's like, how did these crazy, anyway, just crazy businesses, things he was doing. He was taking stuff that I was teaching and like showing what we were doing and like the click funnels world. And he would replicate it and build it in a whole different market with DJs and things like that. In fact, he spoke at our Mexico mastermind and he made, I wish I had it here with me. He made a Mifki that is like a necklace that plugs into like a guitar amp or something. It was like, I was like, dude, I'll do anything for one of your Mifki. So he gave me one. I wore the entire Mexico trip. I'm happy you're with me, unfortunately. I think it, I'll just hear somewhere. Anyway, but he's like doing all this stuff in these other markets and it's just fascinating and fun to watch, a ton of energy. In fact, you'll see the picture of him wearing the jacket he wore in Mexico, which was amazing. So the next is Dom. And so, yeah, Dom Peroni. Peroni, I hope I said it right. I was getting nervous saying that. That's right. Don Peroni's there. He's amazing, Dominic. And he was here last week and here for the groundbreaking ceremony as well. Just one of my favorite people in our community. He was gonna love him, a ton of energy. And he's gonna show how all these principles we're talking about, how they can relate to any business, not just like a Russell business, like any kind of business, including your DJs. And you'll see him doing it over and over and over again. They built a huge software subscription, whole bunch of other stuff, following the same things you guys are sharing. But he was, someone who came in the community, went to Funal Hacking Live, joined two comic club as ex, joined the inner circle and I just watched his business year after year, like just skyrocketing and so excited to share Dom with you. What's kind of funny, if you look at this, you think that Dom's got a little mini head because next to Dugs, but it's just cause the, he's like way further behind. So there we go. There's more lifelives. There you go. Dom's huge. Dom's huge. Yeah, Dom's tall guy. Anyway, so thank you Ben for doing this for the moment graphics to make everyone look amazing. But there you go. There's our next eight speakers for Funal Hacking Live, which means our schedule's pretty much filled. There's one more spot that I'm, someone I've been negotiating back and forth that I'm working on. So I have one more speaker announcement before we go live. But we're like, did we have days where we are 80, 90, 90 something days away? Excuse me, like three months away from the show happening. And I know we are way ahead of ticket sales this year versus every other year. So we're probably gonna sell out, usually sell out about a week or two early. My guests will probably sell out closer to month early. So that means like, if you don't have your tickets now, like I would recommend getting them now because they're going away soon. So again, FunalHackingLive.com obviously is where you get your tickets. And I know you guys have been doing, you started this week, you're doing speaker reveals, announcing, telling stories about different speakers and stuff like that. So those are coming out, but you guys, every single year people come back and like, they didn't get the tickets early enough. So there's no room blocks, they have to stay off site. And there's always different things. It's like, you guys make sure that you get your tickets so you can be on site with everybody. It's gonna be an amazing party. My entire family, all my kids are coming this year. They wanna see the big concert at the end with Andy Grammer. Anyway, this year's gonna be insane. So yeah. Every year is an experience. And it's crazy how many people you're fitting in this year. It's gonna be a legit party. I'm not so sure. So many cool people from our community. This is the thing about Funhacking Live versus every other event. Most events, it's like, they have 98% of the speakers, like professional speakers. And Funhacking Live is like 90% of our people are ClickFunnels members. Like it's the difference. That's why we get five or 6,000 people come to an event. Where nowadays most of our competitors, they're struggling to get 300 or 400 people in the room. Because it's just like, people that wanna see like, oh, here's the same speakers to speak at every single stage. Like they wanna see actual people like them. And so these are your peers, you guys who are here teaching and sharing exactly what they're doing, which is exciting. So do not miss this. It's gonna be amazing this year. It's gonna be awesome. So since this isn't planned, I don't know what's next. Do we just go back to you guys? Yeah, so we can reach out. I think that might be it for us. Like we've been trying to keep our phones down. I'm just like, and rustle out. Oh my God. No, it's... Go ahead then, go for it. I don't even know where to start. This is gonna be sick. There's so much happening at Funnel Hiking Live this year. Like, and the fact that you're giving so much away inside of the offer is just killer. So dude, I can't wait. I was talking to Miles a little bit before the call and he was like, we're filling up. We're filled up faster than we ever have. We have more people sign up for Funnel Hiking Live now than we have ever had. And like it's filling up faster and faster. And so if you're thinking about it, if you're considering it, the stack is ridiculous. The amount of people that are being brought in and Steve Larson came in yesterday, dropped in his bonus. We have more people coming in almost daily now, coming in and giving their bonuses. So guys, make sure that you're getting in there. Attach yourself to this event. I don't think there's an event that will, that will change your life more than Funnel Hiking Live. It's the energy, the movement and the training and it's unbeatable. And we got some things that I haven't told anybody that's happening at FHL this year that, anyway, Russell sucks at keeping secrets. But I got something close to my chest that you guys are gonna freak out about. It's insane. So that's all I got. You gotta be there. It's one of those things that like, this is the thing happens every year. I do like the one and the same thing. Everybody who's not there is like, well, do we get that? Do we get that? I'm like, no, this is only for people at FHL. Someone's like, what if I don't go to FHL? How do I get them? I'm like, I don't know, six months, eight months later, some months a year or two later, we'd give it, but like those who are in the room, anyway, it's ClickFunnels related. That's all I'm giving you. Ben's got a little hint of what it is, but I have to stop talking now before my team comes in and shoots me. So it's gonna be insane. Anyway, yes. Okay, well thanks for letting me infiltrate your office. And yeah, I'm so excited. All those eight, we went from one to eight that were coming in. They're all gonna be amazing. You're so awesome. Awesome. We'll talk about that before we deliver. All right. I think that's it for us today, right? I think that'll be it. Yeah, let's go ahead and close it. We'll go ahead and do a traditional funnel, our funnel hacker TV either tomorrow or on July 4th, depending on if we get somebody who's signing up, we might have one of our newest speakers signing up tomorrow. So make sure that you guys are signed up for the announcements. And if you don't have your tickets, you have to get your tickets to funnel hacking live because it's gonna be a blast. We'll see you guys later. Bye, everyone. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life, and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating, it's pulsing. I'm made for something more. We get scared. And then fear hits us. There's little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm gonna do it. The driven, are you guys here today?
