But you want to tell me about one more thing, right? Yes. Oh my gosh. OK, did you see? So this is truly water cooler moment. Like you don't want to work, so you just go over to the water cooling. You just kind of chat. Did you guys see when Russell started announcing all the speakers funnel hacking live this week, which we'll talk about later? He announced it last week. And when he did it, they launched a whole bunch of YouTube videos that were just like little teasers. One was the full trailer and one of them had me on the ground laughing. Just forget if you guys think that Garrett White is just crazy, like you have no idea what you're going to get this year because he's a black box, whether or not he's going to use swear words or not. You're going to love this little video. So what we've done is I've taken the video, downloaded it, and we're going to show it to you right before the outro today. So if you guys want to watch it, you can always head over to YouTube. But I wanted to make it easy just because I'm going to laugh all over again. And I want that moment. So if you guys want to enjoy it, we'll have a water cooler moment where we can just enjoy. That's so fun. Like I didn't even realize until Ben this morning was like, oh, my gosh, we're going to talk about this video today. I'm like, I didn't even see this video. What is all this? Like there's so much happening. Welcome. OK, so that's why we're here to make sure that everybody knows what cool things are going on. Which speaking of OK, so we're going to move into our community. And this is going to be a little bit different because we're going to highlight. Yes, we're going to highlight some of you in the community. But we also want to highlight Russell. Russell is our community leader. And he is the attractive character. And as an attractive character, you let people into your world. And one of the things that one of the stories I should say that Russell talks about is really hits hits. I don't want to say it's necessarily his origin story, but it is a story that he tells to talk about like a very important element, a very important trait of an entrepreneur. And I don't want to totally ruin it. But there is a post, the two posts. But I'm going to talk about the first one. Ben's going to talk about the second one. But Russell has been dropping wrestling videos this starting last week over the weekend, I think. And he tells his story again. If you haven't heard about when he was a wrestler and became the state champ in this post, I believe this is on his profile. So go to his profile. And he also dug into the archives of all of his videos. And he found the actual video of when he wrestled and won, was declared the winner and was state champ. It is so awesome to watch because a lot of us have heard this story a lot. And there's a lot of comments about how like, oh, my gosh, it's so amazing to be able to see the video that goes with the story now. And it's like the full match. I watched it over the weekend and I'm sitting there watching it and I'm like, I don't even like wrestling. Sorry, Russell, but I'm not into wrestling at all. But I was into it. I'm like, it was so intense. Like we know the outcome, right? We know the end of the story. But I was like, oh, my gosh, like, is he going to be able to do it? Like it's intense. And it was just so emotional at the end. Like right here, we're seeing his hand being raised. He tells a story about how that felt, how's the greatest moment of his life and just the emotion at the end. And then the way that that ties into just how we are as entrepreneurs is awesome. So if you missed that post, go and experience it for yourself. So cool. And then he dropped another one. He dropped another one. Like my morning was spent just watching these and just like enjoying it. Guys, if you are like driven, if you're one of the people who are driven, you just want to have success, this is going to work for you. Whether or not you like wrestling, Susan just said it. But the cool thing that was really neat here is he talks about how he got, he became, he won in state as a junior and in senior year, he didn't. So he talks about the journey, what happens afterwards and how he went and went to the national championship and what that was like and what experience that was and what prepared him and why he actually went and what would have happened if it didn't. A lot of us like, a lot of us want to gear our success towards achieving that moment. The first post is all about, I wasn't enough. It didn't work the first year. So I made it happen the next year and I made it happen the next year and I took it to a whole new level the next year. And life is a moment of leveling up, right? And this one just hits home at the very end of the post. You can just see him turn him up. He did not win state, but there was a statement that he said where he says, I wasn't good enough to place until I lost. That loss in state, while it seemed the worst thing that could have happened to me was the greatest blessing and gift from God. And he talks about how because he lost it put on a whole new drive and you learn what it means. Every once in a while, you're going to have that moment where you have that absolute drive where you're not going to sleep. You're going to get the funnel built. You're going to get everything. You're just going to do it. There's levels and you will always level up more and more and more. And this is just really cool, especially like almost as a pre frame for what's coming on Thursday and everything that's what is announced like previously. It was just it was a cool community moment where Russell actually got to share a little bit of himself. We've heard the stories, but to be able to watch it and experience it with him, especially with his discussion around it was a whole new level. So if you've missed that, go over to his profile and watch it because it's beautiful. It's wonderful. I liked I only wrestled for one year in high school and I hated it and I loathed it and it smelled and it was really hard. But I got to learn my limits, test your limits. One other thing really quick, because we don't want to go on for forever today, but there are also a lot of you and a community that we are highlighting every single week. We do these user spotlights. And so Laura Demetrius has been going in and interviewing people. And it's not just you guys who have won a two comic of award. These are stories from every all around. So Laura's been doing Christopher Cool, who's a magician locally and using funnels. She interviewed Adam Boag and he's a founder of Business Success Academy. And then she interviewed. I've been watching this guy this whole time. It's crazy. This is Marcello and Marcello is going through the Funnel Bill of Certification that stickers that you see on the background or the certifications that he's got. So he's doing them over and over and over. And just beginning to hear his story was ridiculous than moving. If you're ever feeling stuck, if you're ever feeling like you don't have momentum, if you just wish that you understood why people were succeeding and getting success, go over to YouTube, check out the user spotlights. These three ones are available right now. And they are there only like 20 minutes. And if you guys like do two X speed like I do, you're crazy. There's lots of them. You guys can get the motivational uptick that you need in order to get the fire reignited, but that's available for you. And they're really, really good, really moving. And we just want to cheer on everybody who's been highlighted. And those of you who have not been highlighted yet, but are moving towards your goals, which are you on as well. So thank you for being here. And there's still more gold. Oh my gosh, really quick. Can we can we do the trivia again really quick? Yeah, people who are jumping on are have the opportunity to win the backpack. Good call. Okay, so this is our trivia question. We're giving away a quick funnels backpack that has this little zipper cooler thing at the bottom. And the question is which funnel hacking line is happening in September 23rd 2023. Is it a is it the seventh one? Is it B the eighth, C the ninth or D the 10th? Just put your answer in the comments and we'll pick one of you. To win the backpack. So cool that we can do this. All right. So speaking of funnel hacking live, that's what's next. What's coming up is that we're all how many days? I don't know what the number is. They said it on Friday, but we're 100 and something days away from funnel hacking live coming up in September, the end of September, like the last week. And so what happened on Friday? Well, before Friday, what happened last week is that they launched a campaign saying like, oh, my gosh, we have one spot left for a speaker at funnel hacking live. If you want it to be you go and and post a video on social media, build up hype around it. Okay. And then they narrowed it down to eight, I believe. And you guys get to go vote who you want it to be. So funnel hacking live.com slash vote. Is that right? Where you guys can go and vote. We've got, do you want to talk about some of them? Oh, my gosh. Okay. There's a couple of these that I absolutely love. First, Doug Bouton, excellent affiliate marketer, really cool guy. He's been around for a long time, has a two comic club and a dream car award and all this stuff. He's wonderful. You've got Catherine Jones. Catherine Jones will blow your mind. You've got junior Anthony, junior Anthony is really cool. He teaches people how to do affiliate marketing and he's built a business of people who, you know, you look at everyone, you're like, oh, they're super successful. He's taking the people that are regular everyday people just like you and helping them find success. And it's just brain altering. And like, that's just the top that's just three out of eight. Go there. You can listen to their entire pitch for why they want to speak. We've got the whole video loaded in there for you and you guys can vote from my knowledge. Russell has not chosen this yet. And so you guys get to choose who it is that you want to speak still. So go over there, vote. It's, oh my gosh, it's so cool. Yeah. You got to be there. Well, I did, but I was going to say that you can watch their videos and learn more about them. Like, I actually know every single one of those. So I was like, oh my gosh, we can't go wrong. Like just any one of them would be awesome. But if you don't know who they are, their videos are linked on there. You can watch it, learn more about them, and then decide from there. But yes, I got to be there. Yeah. Oh, did you want to say something? No, no, no, no. We're, I did the math. We're 120 days away. 120 days. That's not that long. That's like three months. No, right? Three. That's crazy. Four months. So. Yeah. Four months away. Anyway, okay. So on Friday, they did, Russell did a announcement where he told us everything. He did. Usually what they do is they drip out the speakers to like build some hype and keep it, like stringing us out. But I got to be there in the room on Friday when he announced all the speakers that are confirmed so far. And so what we're going to do is go over some of those. They are so awesome. Like it's going to be an amazing funnel hacking live. I am so pumped for what's coming. But if you want to go check it out yourself too after this and really dive into who each of them are, just go to funnel hacking life.com. Yeah. And it was cool because like he revealed like each person. So they had a big question mark and it's still a wet on each of these and he revealed them one by one. You almost had to track who was where. So that was a lot of fun. Okay. So a lot of these are like personal friends. Like this hasn't happened before where like I have a lot of like close friends that are here. And so first off, the video is amazing. Go watch the video for this year because there were people like this last time on Friday when Russell revealed it like people were crying. Like it was it was emotional. It's a good video. Okay. So let's talk about speakers, shall we? Let me go ahead and scroll down. Oh, we get to hear from this guy again. So excited. And it's different angles. Like this is a totally different angle. This funnel hacking life is going to be different than all the previous ones. He talked about that. Like the structure is entirely different. And it's because he's teaching one framework. I hear you guys like, when is Russell going to give us the linchpin? I want the linchpin. I want to know what it is. Follicking live. You need to be there. It is. Okay. So and also like this particular as this particular spot here of your called adventure. Russell's been talking a lot about this to like his inner circle. And it's going to like I was blown away when we got a little sneak peek of what he's got planned for fun. Like we, we met and I got to go to inner circle event and he did some of this, your called adventure there. And I'm like, oh my gosh, this is going to be so good. It's like beyond being an entrepreneur, right? Being beyond the funnel hacking tactics and strategies, right? It's like, this is like, this is you. This is your called adventure. This is your purpose in life. Yeah. In terms of it. So good. And it's so cool because on this day, like we have Todd that comes out, Todd's going to talk about everything quick funnels. But the big speaker of the day, I'm just going to scroll down to it. Yeah. It's Jaco. And we've never, we've always had like the main speaker on the last day and put them on the first day when it's your call to adventure. Now take extreme ownership and stand up is such a cool like dichotomy. It's so cool. In between that, you've got Brad and Ryan from a cash flow tactics. They have spoken several times. This is not their first time. I remember the first time they spoke at the inner circle and it blew everyone's mind. When they found out how to do their message right and their business took off and they got the eight figure award in a year. It was like in nine months, they got their eight figure award. So to come go back. So crazy cool. You've heard Eric twice now. Eric is so good. Susan, like you've heard him twice. I only heard him. I have. Actually, yeah. Yeah, twice. Yeah. So and he's just killing it right now. Like what can I say? Short form videos. He's got content. He's a professional amazing videographer. Like his stuff is awesome. Russell just hired him to like, isn't it this week? Like this week he is recording videos with Eric Thane. Like Russell hired him to do their content. So cool. So like in the office, like, do you get like we sat down and we started mapping out like what our topics are going to be and how we're going to do it and what the goal is and Russell's schedule and how to, you know, when the launches are. And so this is organized. There's a lot coming and Eric's going to be really influential in how to do this. So if you guys want to know how Russell is one upping his short form video game, like this is, this is the way. Russell's going to talk about compounding continuity. Yes. We got Stu. Stu has spoken like, I almost think this is like the third or fourth time. I think Stu's been there every year in order to accept the check for Village Impact, which is a, it's a charitable organization that he and his wife runs in order to build schools in Africa. And that's really broad, but it's a very specific part of Africa in a whole continent. But they go ahead and do that. And it's really cool, but he's going to talk about how you create your continuity. Garrett White's going to come in for just a moment, just a hiccup of a moment and talk about this new idea that Russell is going crazy with. Like some of you have watched and Russell has teased some things that he is building on social media. If you have seen it, I'm not going to say what it is. I'm not going to drop any hints. If you've seen what it is that he's trying to build right now, this is coming in big time into these new things that he is starting to do. And so just, just watch for it. There's some cool stuff. Russell is going to start talking about continuity and Mifki, aka Lynchpin. Dan Fleischman. Did you know Dan Fleischman, Susan? I don't. Okay. I had a lot of people ask some questions about him. Dan is a king at influencer traffic outside of the ClickFunnels world. He is ridiculously good at this. And so there is just, this is how you go and you find the people to hire. So that way you're not giving Facebook money and praying that Facebook gives you an ROI. Kathy Yoder. There's, can you sense a theme by the way of what Funnel Hacking Live is going to be? It's really, I mean, we are in, sorry, this is a bit of a tangent, but we are in a time in our, in our society, in the market, in the world, like whatever you want to say, like we're in a period of time where we've really got to like slim down what we're doing, follow frameworks that work, follow people that know what they're doing. And there's kind of a theme that is happening of like, let's, let's turn to organic traffic so we can keep more of our money and not give it to people we don't want to be giving it to, right? Yeah. And so what's happening? And just as a note, like we're not going to spend time going through each of these step by step, what we will be doing is as we get closer to Funnel Hacking Live, we'll try to highlight these a little bit more for you so you know what's coming. Because often we forget we're like, oh, Funnel Hacking Live. No, me and my Davis spoke at Inner Circle and at the category King event and literally blew my mind twice. So he's going to be speaking twice, like Russell has brought him on to speak two different times. We have Satema, Satema, this is his second time. He blows everybody's brain. Dan Kennedy is speaking yet again now with Jim Edwards, which is so cool. I actually went and watched some of Eric Thomas. I've never seen any of his YouTube videos. This guy is cool. Very mission driven, very, very cool. There he is, Neo once again. Having Barry speak. Susan, I'm really excited for you to be able to be at Funnel Hacking Live this year behind the scenes, to be able to see Barry with her hat on, getting stuff done. She makes Funnel Hacking Live the event spectacular. She is a force to be reckoned with and how her strategy works. Like Russell even said, he will give Barry money every single time because the amount of ROI that she's able to provide on the event that she built, she's going to show you the framework on how she does it. She doesn't do this for everybody anymore, by any means. She's going into teaching mode. She's going to share it with you guys. Ben Hardy, I've been listening to 10x, the new book that he came out with. Have you listened to it yet? Have you gotten any of you? I've gotten through some of it, but I haven't gotten through all of it, but it's so good. I have two of his books up on my shelf that I need to get through. Everybody who's at Mastermind in Paradise said their minds were just blown because of Ben Hardy. And Russell even says, like when he, I forgot what the event is, but when he heard the idea of this 10x, and it's different than Grant Cardone 10x, it's totally, it's actually opposite. Right. Russell said it was like a life-changing pivotal moment in his life. And so he wants everyone to experience that too, which is why Ben Hardy is going to be at FHL. No joke. And Ben Hardy has done a whole bunch of really cool books. Kaylin Pooley is coming back for her third year, which is going to be cool. Like you guys, she did like a two or three day mastermind for two CCX folks. And it was, yeah, I want to say brain numbing, but at the same time massively empowering. She went into, so I don't know if anybody's gone into this much level in how you move your attractive character and how you apply analytics and be able to know what works and adjust. And it was nuts. And so she's going to be sharing that. We have a call back. I have a little bit of a bias. I've been with McCall Jones since she launched her first offer of her business after attending a Funnel Hacking Live three years ago, two years ago. She's back for her second year. She's spoken 2021, I believe. What? Do you remember what your Christmas style is? Oh, I do. I have it on a sticky note right here on my computer. I'm a lead fix impress. I don't forget that. I have a t-shirt and everything. But the way that this is put together is just brilliant because before McCall, we have Kailin talking about being an attractive character. And then we have McCall coming out of like, okay, yeah, you need to be an attractive character, but don't go copy Kailin. Don't go copy Russell. Like you have to be your own attractive character. So McCall is going to come in and show you how to like actually do it for yourself. How to be new. And not just copying somebody. Yeah, yeah. It's going to be awesome. It's crazy. Like she was explaining it to me and I was like, because I went and bought in at the same time too. I'm like, McCall, you're amazing. Let's go. And a lot of what she does is data backed, which is really powerful for me. I was an analyst before I was a marketer, guys. I wanted to know that it works before I jumped in. I dipped my toe in heavy. And so because that like she, like, I was like, what about this? And she's like, no, we haven't done any analysis on that. We're not going to present that to our audience. And I was like, this is super powerful stuff, guys. Super, super cool. And then once you understand that you need to be an attractive character, once you figure out that you can be the attractive character by being you, and how to be able to live into that, Kevin Anson is going to talk about how do you create ads and videos in order to present yourself as the attractive character appropriately and all the ways you can do it. He has nine different ways that you can create ads that are going to be really, really powerful. Ben Carr is somebody that Russell grew up with and is a motivational speaker. He's going to be there. Garrett White is of course going to be there. And guys, that video at the end, you just need to stay for it just for the Garrett White joke. It's beautiful. And then, oh my freaking gosh. Do you listen to Andy Grammar? I've only just started. Okay. I have a story to tell. So I'm sitting in QuickFunnels while Russell's announcing all of this and he's like hyping this up. He's like, and we're going to have this musician come in and I'm like, be somebody amazing. And he says Andy Grammar and I'm like, I don't know who that is. But then I came home and I was like, okay, I got to go listen to that song and I play it. I'm like, of course I know who he is. I've heard this song everywhere. And then I started listening to his other songs. I'm like, I know this one and I know this one and I know this one. And he's one of the, like it literally says on the page, a multi-platinum selling singer-songwriter. And he's just, for whatever reason, we know the songs, but we don't know the name of the art, at least for me. Maybe I'm the only one, but it's like one of those that comes along and then you're like, oh my gosh, I love this song, but you don't ever actually find out who does the song. He's awesome. And so good. I told my wife that Andy Grammar is coming. She's like, are you serious? I might actually come with you this year. I'm like, what? She's not in the marketing. Like she's like, follow Hiking Live, guys. If you've never been, it's a party. Like you see the videos and stuff, but the minute that the doors open and you see the lights and you feel the bass like blowing through your chest and just like every inch is like, it's, it's a blast. Literally. It is extremely powerful. Each speaker brings it home in a whole new way. There is nothing like Funnel Hiking Live on the face of the earth. And there's a reason why if you guys go to other events, you notice like the audience may be dwindling. Like there's fewer people every single year. They're all coming over. One last thing, one last thing about Andy Grammar that I think is going to be the coolest thing is that not only is he going to play his music, but he's going to tell the stories. And it says he's going to dig into the philosophies, failures and spiritual experiences. He's going to tell the stories behind the songs. And so it's going to be not just, oh, some cool entertainment. There's going to be like meaning and purpose and probably going to leave some of us in some tears, probably touch our hearts, but also be so fun at the same time. So the way that Russell put it was Andy Grammar is going to give you the soundtrack for the next 12 months of Funnel Hacking. Like for the next 12 months of you pursuing your goal, Andrew Grammar is going to, he's going to like literally give you the song, the reason behind the song and how it feels you. And like it's just going to be magnificent. So if you don't have your tickets, you should get it. You really really should. FunnelHackingLive.com. FunnelHackingLive.com, go get your tickets.

Okay. We're going to go in. Okay. Let's, let's show the trivia question one more time. You have about 20 seconds to put your answer into the comments. For all of you who are here. Which FunnelHackingLive is happening in September 23rd? Is it the seventh, eighth, ninth, or the 10th event of FunnelHackingLive happening? And if you were watching, you would have seen the answer in the FunnelHackingLive logo. And if I was smart and thought ahead far enough, I would have put that logo on the answer question that I'd heard on the answer video, but I did not. But let's go ahead and reveal the answer, which is, it's the ninth FunnelHackingLive. It is in the logo as a Roman numeral. It's pretty cool. So we're going to pick a winner from the comments. We're going with our usual way of doing that, Ben. Yes, we are, but I am, I'm having to open it up separately because you guys have commented so much. I can't count the comments appropriately. You know what we can do? Yes. Just say while we're, while we're counting them up and seeing who's in the comments with the answer, let's go ahead and run that FHL ad. Yeah, let's watch that FunnelHackingLive video really quick. Let's go ahead and watch that. And then we'll be right back with the answer on who's getting it. Yes. in the world. where is it?

Okay, those two may have come here together, but either way, don't they look happy? Well, I like what a funnel is. Sure, I'd explain it to you, but Russell is much better at it. Here's what a funnel is. In a nutshell, you got that good. What are those awards? Yes, they are. Make over a million dollars with a funnel and you can take one of those bad boys home. No way.

So awesome. All right. We'll be back on Thursday for more Funnel Hacking News. And we'll see you guys then. Bye. See you guys later. My name is Russell Brunson. And I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash to venture capitalists to get started. And we don't even have gold to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. But because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable in day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happy every single day. And it's happened through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
