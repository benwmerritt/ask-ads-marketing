We want to highlight you guys because funnel hacking live is yes, an investment, but it's an investment that pays off every single time. I don't know about for you, but for me like, even if I don't go in there with the idea that I'm going to make money or I'm going to like find clients or I'm going to, you know, I need this, there's always one idea that would change the entire business for the next 12 months and it would reorganize everything on my list and make everything more successful. It's going to be amazing. I just wanted to be, I said this last time, I just wanted to be tomorrow and you're like, no, we're not ready. And we actually have more about that in a moment of like, what is the team? What's the ClickFunnels team doing right now to prepare? There's just been so much happening. I'm going to take a second. I'm feeling a little under the weather today and it's because, you know, this is kind of the entrepreneur life. Like you just, there's crunch time and sometimes you just got to push through it and there's late nights and you're getting things done and you kind of have your health takes a bit of a hit and mine is right now. So going in and hopefully to recover. We've got another 13 days left, less than 13 days left. I have plenty of time to get better and energy back. No, it has been late nights. It's been late nights over here too. Like it's, there's, there's so many things to get done before Funnel Hacking Live. We're not the only ones staying up late. We are, we get to party with you guys. We get to celebrate the things that we're preparing for for Funnel Hacking Live are to help celebrate with you. And so we're stoked. We're going to have a lot of fun, but it's more so what's going to happen, what everybody else is preparing for, including Russell, which reminds us, we should probably do a funnel forecast. Let's go ahead and do a funnel forecast really quick because there's something going on right now. Now really quick, if we can share my screen, you guys should know we are less than 12 days away from Funnel Hacking Live and Russell, who's really good at keeping secrets, decided to share one of the secrets from Funnel Hacking Live before Funnel Hacking Live starts. So in less than 24 hours, Russell is going live. Okay. So in less than 24 hours, Russell is going live and he's doing a holy crap unplanned pop up webinar revealing something he was going to wait for Funnel Hacking Live. So this is what's called a level 10 critical marketing strategy that I was going to hold off on in Tulor Orlando. You guys can jump in and learn this really quick. This is a way to get 300 to 500 people to join your continuity membership program. It has nothing to do with Mifki. It's nothing to do with Mifki. Okay. This is something entirely new, entirely different. Like my family has just started like getting involved in this. And my little sister is texting me. She's like, I'm so excited for tomorrow's webinar with Russell. I'm like, you just started college. I know, but I'm so excited. Like it's so funny. If you guys are not registered, you need to go here and get registered. The link is clickfunnels.com slash cc-register. Okay. Now here's the deal. If you guys in the post, I put the link in the post. So you just have to go above the video, above the video guys can go ahead and scroll up and click on that link and get registered. This happens tomorrow at 2pm Eastern, noon, that's noon, mountain standard. And you guys do not want to miss out on this. So come over here, put in your details. You do not want to miss it because it is going to be ridiculously exciting. So excited for it. This one's, and it's funny because Russell hasn't even told us what he's really talking about here. He's like, okay, this is the hook. We're like, okay, so what's it about? Don't worry about it. I got it. This is going to be sick. Okay. Do it like this. And so last minute, literally, you guys need to be on this. This is going to be super, super cool. If you want to teaser a funnel hiking live, if you want to see what's about to happen and you want to be able to learn one of the strategies beforehand, you need to be here. So once again, the link is in the post right above. You need to get in there today because tomorrow will be too late. You need to be in there. Good. Good. Wait, 22 hours, 42 minutes and two seconds. Let's do it. That's all you have. You will hear this all night long. And you will know your way. Okay. So Russell's not the only one that's been busy. We're not the only ones that have been busy. There's been a lot happening behind the scenes. Yes. Let's talk about the water cooler. Yeah, let's do water cooler. Let's go ahead and go to water cooler because yes, there's a lot going on in Canton specifically. So it's funny. I was talking to them and they're about two or three hours away from me. And I learned this morning that the flew the team in in order to work on several specific features that are big features that they just needed the team's heads all in one place. They flew the problem with Carolina from all these different places and they're just meeting for the week and I'm like, will you be there tomorrow? We won't be there tomorrow. Go up. But they are smashing their heads together. I was on a call with them just earlier today and they said, you know, it feels like tomorrow is funnel hacking live. Does anyone else feel like that? Or is that just us? Like, are we just so excited and preparing so much? Are you guys feeling like you just wish funnel hacking live was tomorrow because they're feeling it and they are shining every little thing up and they're having impromptu meetups. They had a meetup where they joined up in Canada. They had one up in Canada where a couple of people live nearby and they all just kind of came together drove couple of hours to hang out and they listed here's all the things that are killing us inside of 2.0 right now. And the developers sat there took notes, took notes, took notes, messaged them today. They'll all be gone at the end of the week. They're like totally fixed. So we are working on making 2.0 as perfect as possible, including some amazing announcements that you have to be a funnel hacking live for. You have to be. There are some amazing things. I've said this before a couple of times and this is your first time watching. You need to hear it. If not, I apologize everybody. There are years at funnel hacking live where you state, oh, I was there that year that this happened, the year that that happened. This is one of those years. It is an unlocking. It is a explosion and it's a lift off and it's going to define the next several years of click files. And if you were not there, you're going to miss it. There's going to be so much momentum built up around funnel hacking live that you want to be there. So not only is Russell pulling crazy hours right now to try to get all of his presentations organized, not only is the team going crazy, not only are we going crazy, everyone is excited for funnel hacking live. It is the it's the focus point. And so I think I think this might be worthwhile guys. Every year, Russell shuts down like around this time. He does not do anything except prepare presentations. I think there's a video where he like talks about that. Are you guys okay if we like show that really quick? Because he kind of teases the strategy that goes into that. Susan, is that okay if we do that? Yeah, let's do it. Let's show that video. Do you guys believe it's like been another year since last year and we're here again? Funnel hacking live started as the ClickFunnels user conference, I guess you would say. People kept asking me and finally I was like, all right, let's go for it. Let's do an event. We sat down and said if we are going to do this, it's not what everyone else is doing. We have to do something that's better. People deserve something more. We put on an event like this. It takes an army of amazing people. Whiteboarder, whiteboard, whiteboard, whiteboard. These are all maxed out and none of my presentations are done. Who would be the ideal person? Who's that dream person we want to get? Our goal and mission was to make it your best experience for every single attendee. The goal to be the pattern interrupt to bring the magic every single day. And the goal for us is like to be an example like this is possible. Like what's the end result you're trying to get for your customers coming to them? Like what is the thing that they're looking for? And so your event is a vehicle to get them there. How does it do that? Like that's what you got to figure out. You guys got to be there. You got to go to funnelhackinlive.com. Right down there. There's probably a lot more. Can we share my screen really quick? There's something that's happening. I just want to give you guys a heads up on this. So Russell has been dropping like little pieces about the event. So he talked about like the get it done hack. This is how he's getting ready for funnel hacking live on the podcast. My three best ideas to fill a live or virtual event. This is all about the process he's using and has used to fill every event including funnel hacking live. There's a reason we sell out every single year. This is the reason. We had the afforded masterclass with Steve Larson, which was amazing. Tomorrow there's another podcast launching. It falls on the same thing. And he tells how many presentations he's preparing this year. And I'm just going to tell you it's a ridiculous amount and it is crazy. And after as he's listening to the podcast, I may or may not have sneaked in and just kind of gotten a peek at what they look like because I just wanted to see. You guys are in for such a treat. It is so good. I cannot wait for you to see what Russell and the team and all of these people have been preparing and just waiting to be able to get out to you. So if you don't have your ticket yet, go to funnelhackinglive.com and grab a ticket. Let's go ahead and do some hacker heroes and let's celebrate those who are going. Who are the people who are going. Let's go ahead and celebrate those. Susan, you've been on Facebook. You've been grabbing all of that list of people. Oh my gosh. We have so many of you. We're going to do kind of rapid fire today. We're going to start off with this one from Heather Blake. She actually, before we get into FHL, she actually just got her a linchpin book. She wanted to share that that she just got it. That's so exciting. A lot of you are starting to post that you received your linchpin books. So excited for you. And then we have Partiv who also just got his linchpin book and also he's going to FHL. So we will see you there. And I love he's got this little elephant with glasses on and he's like, I want to hug the most educated seven inch tall elephant in click funnels because he's got the linchpin book in his hands. So congratulations also for getting a linchpin book and for making it to FHL. And also this Partiv is from India, I believe. He's coming from India to be at Funnel Hacking Live. So we'll probably have the question pop up while we're there. Like who traveled the farthest, right? That always seems to come up. It might be Partiv. Partiv, figure out how many miles that is so that way you can like really compute. That's crazy. All right. And then we have out we got the name cut off here, Matt Pete just bought his FHL ticket. And a lot of you were showing up in the comments to James Wilson got his his and then maybe that was all that we have in the comments here. So we will see you guys there as well. It's gonna be awesome time. We have Bill Griggs. Okay, so there's a couple of you who actually watched the Steve Larson masterclass training, where Steve gave some great tips on if you're trying to get to FHL and you just need to find a way to make it happen. Go make it happen, right? So Bill is in this is actually in the Funnel Hacking Live event community is this post. But Bill is looking for someone who would like a funnel build in exchange for hotel FHL. So I'm assuming Bill already has his ticket. He's just looking for he needs a place to sleep. So if you're someone who is is looking for someone who to build their funnel for them, go check that out. And then we also have James Mitchell in that same situation. So there's plenty of posts if you're like, I need the who not the how right now, I just need somebody to help me get this done. There are people in these groups, this one's in the ClickFunnels official group, looking for an exchange. If you can help them get to FHL or have a place to sleep at FHL, they are they've got the same talent, same education. They've read the books. I actually know Bill and James, they've read their stuff. They can help you out with these builds. And they just want to help help get in there. So go check posts in both of those groups if you're in them. And also, can I just bring up the funnel hacking live event community? If you have your FHL ticket, make sure you're in this group. Right. There's going to be a lot of information getting posted in this group. It's already popping up. It's also where you can come in, hang out with everyone else who's going to be at FHL and start to network and connect. And so make sure you're in that group too. Yep. Couple of notes for funnel hacking live guys. For those of you who are trying to work your way to there and try to find somebody to build a funnel for, you guys all know tickets are like a funnel build itself is expensive. Like you can charge a lot for a funnel bill that's well done. Susan, what are prices that you've seen for funnel builds? Like a well done funnel bill? Oh, yeah. Yeah. A lot more than an FHL ticket. Much more. Funnel builds can, I mean, it's going to vary a lot, right? But for a well done funnel build, you're going to be starting at least at five to six K. At least five to six K. And so here's the deal, guys. You have this opportunity right here to be able to not only be able to get the lessons from funnel hacking live from somebody who's a builder, if you can't make it period, but you wish you had somebody there representing you and your business and understanding it, hire somebody. We've reached, we've shown you a couple of examples. There are people that want to go and want to learn and want to implement this in a business. They may not have a business of their own. They're looking for someone like you. Now you might be the person who's actually trying to do this. Reach out to people today. Go ahead and see what it is that you can do. Put the word out there. Steve Larson gave so many different secrets away. You guys can see all of that in on the podcast, which we just showed you. You guys can go ahead and listen to that podcast. I was talking to the funnel builders on Wednesday and we were breaking that presentation apart. I love this. This was great. This was perfect. And like people were listening to it multiple times, getting all these things out and trying to figure out, all right, what's my game plan? What am I doing first? Second, third, what are their game plans in order to grow based on what Steve dropped because it's gold. So if you're trying to figure out a way to get there, you need to go and check this out today. Today because tomorrow Russell goes live and the funnel hiking live tickets are going. Like we haven't given an official announcement on how things are doing as far as I know, but they are going and you need to check it out. So here's the deal. If you are committed to going, you're trying to figure it out. Go find the business. Go make it happen. Steve Larson gives you the path. You can knock on doors at this point. You can go and help businesses. It would help out. For example, we had a tree company that came over. We had a tree that was falling on the house a little while ago and it was like hitting another tree and it was just barely not falling like it was just sliding and he came out and helped when no one else did. I was like, how is business? Just as a conversation. He goes, it's doing all right. We're trying to do the following and this is what we're trying to do. And I was like, all right, why don't I help you out? Why don't we work something out and I help you out? I said, that would be great. There are opportunities everywhere. Everybody needs a funnel. Now, funnel does not need to be the super fancy quintessential one. It could be a local funnel where they're just gathering leads and you send out a promotion via email to all the leads. They've collected in the past that they don't message to or that the ones they do collect during this campaign that you're going to build for them. There are so many different strategies you guys can do. Just when you decide, things start to change. You start to see the world a little bit different and you can see those opportunities, but you have to first choose before those opportunities become visible. So go choose, go start learning. Steve's presentation was amazing. Go and sign up for tomorrow's presentation with Russell. It's going to be awesome. My friends, there's so much happening behind the scenes. I can't share it with you, but if we could, Susan would have stories. We would have stories for you. Russell had stories for you and he's sharing those tomorrow. The dev team is killing it and pulling late hours, flying everyone out, making sure all of everything is synced just right. So that funnel hacking live, it is the drop that's heard around the world. We have got some amazing things for you. You need to be in the room. So go get your tickets at funnelhackinglive.com. Susan, anything that you want to add there? Because I just keep talking. I'm so excited about this. I know. I know. I'm glad you're talking because my voice is going. So we're good. You guys got to be there. I think one thing that's really fun that I'm excited about, this is kind of like an impromptu journey to FHL, Susan moment. So we just have a big, huge ClickFunnels meeting about what's going on at FHL. And I'm just excited about, I'm going to be able to be in it more than I thought I was going to be. I'm like, oh, just going to do some funnelhacker TV stuff. But guys, I'm going to be there. I'm going to be in the hallways. I'm going to be greeting you. Come find me.

Here's this funnelhackinglive has always felt to me, if you have not had this experience yet, it's always felt like a family reunion to me. Like it feels like you come in and suddenly the family is there. And there's just all these people changing the world or seeking to change the world or with all the tools to change the world, all of them together. And there's this electric atmosphere. And it's like, this is how I feel when I have an idea, but I'm feeling it all the time. If you want to have that experience and you want to feel like you're not the crazy one, who's just wherever you are doing your own thing and you want to be surrounded by that, definitely go grab your ticket. We're going to be there to celebrate with you. We're going to have a blast. We're doing funnelhacker TV there. And so we want to see you. We want all the high fives.

If I'm freaking out about it and my little sister is freaking out about it and Susan's freaking out about it. And we have been living in this for a while. Russell's freaking out about it. The gift. Freaking out. You need to be there. There's going to be so much cool stuff. So here's the deal. Go ahead and register for the event by going up below or going up above. And then once you've registered for it, go ahead and grab your tickets to funnelhackinglive. We will see you there. We will celebrate you next Tuesday for funnelhackinglive. Let's go ahead and roll the outro. Thanks guys. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences. But all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating, it's pulsing. I made for something more. We get scared and then fear hits us. Little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven say, no, I'm going to do it. The driven are you guys here today. More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia and I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that made me all of my money. My best selling frame. What? Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers, rest in blue at third. This better blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning again. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this one precious life? You wouldn't be able to tell but I ran the New York marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. It wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People feel a sense of belonging here. It feels like home. I'm so encouraging because if they can do it, so can I. It's all I'm saying. Hey, next year we're going to get dead. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer ever lived. You'll find exactly what your business is missing. It's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day they're telling people how they met you. Oh, I can live change my entire life because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be black. Your legacy's going to be black. Movements are about to be burnt. My story hopefully gave women permission. You do not have to be great to get started, but you have got to start if you ever want to be great.
