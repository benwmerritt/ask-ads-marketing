Hey everybody, so excited to have you guys. This is Funnel Hacker TV. We get to go live a couple of times every single week. This is the day and this is a big day. There is something happening in less than an hour. You have to be on for. So Sticker on will give you all the juicy details. My name is Ben Moot. This is... I'm Susan Lennardsen. Let's get started. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. Let us know that you're here. Tell us. Hello. But we are going to have something to tell you about coming up that we are actually going to be sending you away for. So say hello while you're here.

It is right down there on the bottom. You can also get email notifications at FunnelHacker.tv. And you can also look at all of the past episodes there as well. It's awesome. So what we're talking about today is Russell has something coming up literally starting in 58 minutes. And we're going to talk to you about it. We're also going to be highlighting some of our hacker heroes. You guys in the community doing amazing things. We also have a user spotlight, another awesome user doing amazing things. But we also have some FHL news. We're going to just drop in, not news, it's our FHL news segment. But we're just going to show some cool stuff. So yeah, Ben, you want to kick us off? OK, so for those of you who've been watching like Russell and like seeing what he's doing, you have a hint of what he's doing. Stick with us for just a couple of seconds here while I bridge you over to that. Because I remember when I joined this idea of ClickFunnels in 2013, and I got the 108 split test book and I started going through. And the first thing that they, on the back of that funnel was a high ticket offer. OK, so you got the free book. And then you went through and I bought all the upsells actually just looking at reorganizing my stuff. And I found all the stuff that I originally bought. And it's about three months in, I joined the inner circle. I got a message that said, hey, we're creating a software. We want you to try it. And it was ClickFunnels. And it was the baby alpha, not even beta version. Like you do like three clicks and it breaks like it was just the idea. And I was trying all these other softwares and just, it just hit and it worked less than a year later. They were running a webinar and the webinar was doing one thing that was proving that funnels work using a supplement funnel. That was the original funnel hacks webinar. Does anybody remember that like back in the day when that thing was running all of that time, like it was the ClickFunnels homepage? I feel like let's go ahead and throw that up for everybody because whether or not you remember like this is how it ClickFunnels began. It was this webinar with Russell stating supplements work. Supplements work in a funnel. And I can make this work. This is the weird niche funnel that's making $17,000, $18,000 a day. And this is how it works. And it was simple and it was clean. And he made the point using a supplement funnel that he had started a little while previous. In the podcast today, he actually talked a little bit about it. And so he dropped a podcast today instead of tomorrow because of what's happening today. So I just, it was a cool look back moment. So for all of you who are the near crazy funnel nerds like me, if you're looking for those look back moments, if you're like, oh my gosh, I missed that too. I remember that this is about to come full circle. And I am so excited that you guys are here. This is going to be absolutely spectacular. If you guys know what it is, drop the URL down below. I'll make sure that it's unhidden. You can share the URL for where we're going because we're about to drop it. So yeah, just first full circle day. Today is a beautiful day. I'm so excited. So cool. One thing I noticed, just showed the funnel that you were talking about, the old supplement funnel. Not a whole lot has changed on what works with funnels. Like if you look at the structure of that funnel, it was like, that looks a lot like the funnel scripts funnel. Like the whole webinar funnel. Like it works guys. Just keep following the process. Just keep working. It's crazy. I'm like, I almost wish Russell would keep running that webinar because it was such a good bridge for people to understand the basics. And so yeah, but we get your first funnel challenge now, which is absolutely spectacular. But ah, good old days and it's coming full circle. So, okay, so Russell's been talking a lot about this, right? Yeah. Yeah. So like following him on social media. Yeah. If you're following on social media, you guys have seen the hints. This is a couple of days ago. He dropped another one last night, like at 1.30 in the morning. Cause it's webinar day and he is getting ready for this webinar. He's giving you guys hints of what's happening and it's called supplement secrets. You need to go to supplementsecrets.com. Feel free to drop the link below. Like there is some magic happening and it's really, really cool. Now why would Russell talk about supplements? You want to talk about this? Cause here's the talk about that in the podcast. So if you guys actually listened to the podcast that dropped this morning, I know Susan and I both did. Yep. We talked about this. Yeah. So, ah, it's, you can see it's a 45 minute podcast episode that he dropped and there's a reason for that. The beginning, he's kind of talking about like what he's doing, you know, how Russell is on the podcast, talking about what he's doing. Why is he in supplements even? Like what normally is the marketing guy? Is he talking about supplements? Um, but then also he did a presentation. I think he said at mastermind in paradise two years ago, um, that, that I think it's the same presentation he shares in this podcast episode, right? Um, where he learned something, he learned a hack, um, and he shares it in the, in this podcast episode. So it is awesome. I listened to it this morning and I was like, oh my gosh, I texted it to my husband and I'm like, here's like the simplest thing that we didn't know. And now we know it. So we got to follow this. Um, so good. I listened to, to every minute of it and you guys have to go listen to it, but we're also going to like kind of give you another way. You can listen to the same content here in just a second. Yeah. No joke. Like this is, this is a game changer guys. What's happening right now, what you don't want to miss is the supplements secrets webinar. Like I love you all, but if you have not signed up for it, it's okay for you to leave. I want you to know. The exit is right there. It's in the comments. Uh, I appreciate you guys for dropping it. Like this is the place to go. You want to be a supplement secrets.com. By the way, it's a fun, cool funnel too. Uh, it's, it's a simple webinar. Often you guys are like so dramatic about, oh, I got to make this perfect. This is not need to be complicated. Look at how simple the design is. First of all, okay. You have a big hook, 75 plus pills down to something ridiculously simple. Russell's going to share that with us in less than an hour. Russell actually messaged me and he's like, go hide your wallet then cause I know you're going to want to buy. I'm like, yeah, sorry. You know, and so it's, it's just going to be so ridiculously good. And they made the offer even better last night. I'm thinking, but this does not have to be complicated. So very simple funnel you opt in and on the thank you page, you're able to watch a video with Russell and Russell shares with you the strategy that he talked about in the podcast that Susan was just talking about. Yeah. If you want to like watch it, come just go sign up in the funnel and then you get to this video and it's the same content that's in the podcast other than it doesn't have Russell's like intro bridge to it. But yeah, and the bridge like Russell talked about the supplements funnel that he did way back in the day and why he was doing supplements and all that stuff. But this, this was, I love this. Like I've seen this, like I've seen this video twice now, watch it all the way through. And then I watched his one for mastermind in paradise a year and a half ago where he talked about this for the very first time. I've watched that probably three times and like created calculators out of it and strategies and like redone like everything that I would buy from, from my Instacart and we're going to be delivered to the house. Like I just, I'm a nerdy. And so yes. I don't know if we actually said this. So the webinar that's happening in next hour is about supplements. But if you are like, well, great, great. I love supplements, but also like, I kind of just need to lose some weight. That's what this video is for. And he is talking about that. Like, okay, you can take all the supplements in the world, but if you're like not losing weight, then you're still not going to be that healthy. So he like gives the entire hack. Like he's, he doesn't care about selling you the weight loss part. He cares about selling the supplements. So he's giving you the framework that he followed to look the way that he does today. Yeah. This is what he followed like pre COVID and then during COVID. Like you all guys, everybody got to see like, he dropped like 40 pounds and gained muscle and like his cheeks became like, we saw him like when he went to go wrestle, like he dropped like a whole bunch of pounds then, but that was unhealthy. This is the, this is the healthy way to do it and keep it off. And he's like, I have the hardest time trying to figure out this. I've got all the crazy bio hacking stuff, but this is what worked. So if you're looking to just drop the couple of pounds and able to make fitness part of the revolution that you are building into your movement in order to be able to have the energy you need to be able to do the things that you are required to view as the movement maker. This is really, really powerful and it's really cool. And then the webinar will actually show you how he continues to have energy and it's, I don't know how to tease it appropriately. So I'm not even going to tease it. Like I'll just say like, I've gone to the doctor before and I get tests back and I look at that and they're like, yeah, those numbers are fine. I'm like, but they're not where they're supposed to be. It's the only hint I can give you. Like this is about making sure you are in prime condition and it's crazy. And it's like, I would recommend this to friends and family and it's, it's a game changer. So go to supplements secrets.com. Make sure you're registered because in what is that 49 minutes, it's live. And I think in case you know, I just want to kind of reiterate and more emphasize the connection of like, why are we talking about supplement stuff on funnel hacker TV? Why is Russell talking about supplement stuff? Why is this such a big thing? Well, I don't know, if you go to the supplements secrets.com page, I know that the copy on there explains it, but to get you to go there, I just want to say like being an entrepreneur, we often do not move a lot. So like we park ourselves at the desk and we stay there for most of the day, right? It doesn't always equal or relate to a healthy lifestyle. But at the same time, like we're the ones that need that the most. We're the ones that need the energy and the healthy like stamina. Like we need all of that because we're the ones that are building the movements. We're the ones, as Russell would say, we're the ones holding up the world, right? Atlas sugar for it's there. So like we're the ones that need this. So that's the connection. Russell wants to make sure that you have everything that you need in all areas of your life to be able to go out and change the world the way that you can. It was really interesting. Like when I came into the office the first time when I was invited, like being able to see like that fitness was a part of the revolution he was building. Like it's not something that he talks about publicly usually very often. This is like the glimpse that you guys are going to get and you don't want to miss it. But fitness is part of the revolution. If you want to change the world, you need to not only have the ideas that can change the world, be able to have the ability to get your ideas out to the world with a funnel and as much profit as possible on the back end by building at your value letter and following the Lynch pin strategy. But you need to be able to have the energy to do it. So that way at the end of the day, you're not entirely depleted when it's time for you to come home and be with the people that matter most. And this is what's clicked for him. Like being able to be in the office and he's like, Oh, I got to go. Apparently I got to go swimming. I got to go do this with my kids. I got to go to that. I got to do that. And he's not like, well, I'm just exhausted. I don't know how I'm going to do this. It's always like, all right, got to go do that. And he's just running out the door constantly going. His energy is absurd. If you want to be able to have that in order to support your movement in order to support that, this is a place you need to be. And just as a side note, if you're like, yeah, that's still weird. Russell's building Lynch pin businesses. If you want to see it before he explains it and be able to see, Oh my gosh, this is how he's doing this. This is how this is built up. Oh my gosh, you need to hack the funnel. You need to be on the webinar in order to see what he's doing. Cause this is a Lynch pin business, baby. And it is, it's beautiful. And the crazy thing is like, I didn't think that they could make all of it work the way they are. But like, and they just changed the offer last night. Like I'm excited to watch. Like I am like, I'm going to get popcorn. I can't get popcorn. I'm literally going to drive over to ClickFunnels headquarters right after this to go watch it live in person. So I'm also excited to see what he has happening. It's going to be so good. So guys, do make the effort. Be there. Have it playing in the background. You don't want to miss this webinar. Supplementsecrets.com. Make sure you are there and make sure you are watching. It's, it's going to be so good. It's just, I don't know if there's any other way to plug this. All right. And we've talked about that enough. You guys know, go, go leave us, come watch the rest of this later. Okay. Up at the top over there. So, but we want to highlight some of you guys in the community. We're calling you guys our hacker heroes. So let's do that. Yes, let's do that. So the first person I want to talk to is Priyanshu Gupta. Priyanshu, he's a six-figure earner and it's quite recent and he shares what he did, like how he turned to dot com seekers and traffic seekers and the previous process that he used and how he was able to do it and how he has dreams of reaching the two comic club. He shows the results. So it's not just proof, but the crazy thing is this not just him patting himself on the back. So it's not just one of those posts. It's a giving post and you all said, thank you. This is the crazy part. You all celebrated with Priyanshu. You all like just absolutely gave and he gave in return when you, you asked like, I'm not sure how to do this. I'm a newbie. So these are the three things that I did. I brought in results. I collected testimonials and I created content about my challenges and my progress. And that was it. Like he keeps giving answers all the way through this. I just wanted to say thank you to Priyanshu, but I wanted to say thank you to the community as well for celebrating your wins. The big ones, the small ones, every single one, we want to share it with you. We want to celebrate with you. Like every once in a while you have that win. I remember in dot com secrets or expert secrets, or maybe it was Mark podcast. Russell talked about how our wins are usually silent wins. We jump up, we dance in the room, we freak out, we turn on some music. We freak out and then it's back to work. Mm hmm. That's it. When in truth, you should really celebrate that. Let us celebrate with you. He's like, I remember when I made my first hundred thousand dollars. I just, I thought we got ice cream. Like that was, we celebrate, we found a way to celebrate. So find a way to celebrate my friends and celebrate publicly with the rest of us. The other thing I wanted to celebrate, thank you Priyanshu, was also you guys helping other people out. All right. So this is a post really quick from Tiana. Tiana was on ABC news and she got traffic to her funnel and it didn't convert. And she just said, look, I've read the books, any help. And you guys gave like this was massive, how much you guys gave. Like I could scroll forever and ever and ever. And you guys just created ideas after ideas. She didn't drop her link. She didn't go against the rules. Like ClickFunnels has new updated rules in our group. Make sure you check it out. But she made sure that everything was clear. And then she accepted everybody's ideas from the newbies, from the experts. She had a conversation with you guys. So thank you to her. Like these aren't even all of them. I forgot to click refresh and keep going down. Like there's just, it's a massive amount and you guys gave massively. And it made a difference for Tiana. And I hope it made a difference for you guys. Like this is a place where we should be able to feel comfortable stating, I won and, whoa, I totally like lost. Something went wrong. Where did I miss it? And this is that place for that. And we want to be able to support you every single step of the way. So let's make this community worth living. And thank you for being a funnel hero. We love having you guys. Love it. All of it. All of it. I love it. I love the contrasting of when, but also like this didn't work out at all. And all of the support in both of those situations from you guys. So awesome to see. Keep it up. Absolutely. So all hacking live. Oh, man. Do we know who the next speaker is yet? No, I don't. As far as I know, Russell has not revealed anything. I still haven't gotten any news on it either. It's coming. I think I think it's coming. It's got to be coming, though. But we did want to highlight Instagram, right? Yes, absolutely. Yep. So we've been dropping all of the tiles of everybody who's speaking on Instagram. We want to celebrate the people that are there. And it's almost like an upvoting of who you're really excited for. So if you guys are in here, you're excited about this or you just know some of these speakers, come over to the ClickFunnels Instagram and just vote on the people that you absolutely cannot wait to hear or you're excited that they're speaking of funnel hacking live. Come over here. But I think we don't have McCall Jones on here yet. Like there are still some that are dropping. So make sure that you come in here and vote on them. You've got some. And Jaco's got 3600. But Stu's got like 38. Like we could definitely vote Stu. We can vote Mason and Russ and Steve and Neo and all these people like come in here. Show some support if you would. And if you don't have your tickets for funnel hacking live, this is. I'm so excited. It's going to be amazing. Today we're doing supplement secrets. And once we get supplement secrets up, it's going to become a case study funnel hacking live and you guys get to see how everything goes. You want to be there. This is going to be the coolest party ever yet again, but taken to a whole level. So go. So awesome. Yes. And then we'll keep we'll keep you guys updated as we can as we go live with funnel hacker TV on any more FHL announcements, news. I'm pretty sure the speaker, the last speaker speakers, who knows, reveals will be happening soon. So we'll make sure you guys are in the know with that as well. If you happen to miss anything that Russell's doing. Awesome. All right. OK, I'm loving these user spotlights, by the way. That's what's next. Laura has been interviewing people and this is one that we wanted to highlight. This is a villain and you want to talk about it then? Yeah, or a media buyer and he's using click funnels all the time. But it's these are these are user spotlights from people who are just like you. We're not going out and finding the people who have gone a million miles ahead. And you so you feel like I don't know. These are people like you who've been on the ground doing the thing. Maybe all revenue is in track through one funnel. OK, so you're making all the things happen. This is our villain and we're villain is doing a spectacular job. And he is this is a fun one to listen to like he knows how to be energetic. And so we've got tons of different spotlights for you guys to check out. Or villains just dropped on Tuesday, like right before we went live. And I was already going to talk about James. However, go and check these out. If you're looking for that extra fire, extra movement, go ahead and that's going to support you. These are for you and we have a lot more coming. Or villain, congratulations for excited for you, my friend. Awesome, awesome. Oh, man, to get through all of our things. They know that we kind of snuck it in there. But did you want to again, kind of like let everybody know the group rules change and update? Yes. So we have recently updated all the group rules. So if you guys haven't noticed, we've been trying to change the community. Just a click funnel steam in general, not me and Susan specifically. We just get to be talking heads, which is cool. However, yeah, it's a blast. The ClickFunnels community in the ClickFunnels group, ClickFunnels official group, we've changed the rules as we've been updating and making sure that things align and things work. We've updated rules to make sure everything is clear and concise for you guys. So that way, you know that when you post, it's going to be approved or not. And we don't have that fuzzy in between area. We're like, I'm giving value. Why is it not being approved? We want to make sure that's clear. We want to make sure that the rest of it is clear so that way, you know, what is OK to do and what is not what you guys can tell us is inappropriate so we can get the people out that are not building the community in order to make this that place where entrepreneurs can build and thrive. So if you have not checked out those rules, go up to the very top, go check them out really quick, just a couple of updates. But we want to make sure that this is that place where you can give, share and not have to worry about being spammed to death. Well, at the same time, finding posts that are extremely valuable and supportive. And the ambassadors have done a great job. I've been seeing a lot of posts from the ambassadors from Dan Havy, from James, just dropping all over the place, which is extremely appreciated. And we love doing funnel hacker TV, so it works out really good. All right. A lot of exciting things happening right now. Yes. It's awesome. It's awesome seeing everything. Everything that's happening right now and it's going to just all kind of come together, FHL, and then we're going to just go beyond FHL. And it's an exciting time to be in the ClickFunnels community right now. It's going to be so much fun. All right. So my last pitch. We're ending a little early. Like we've been talking a lot lately. We've been going over traditionally. We like going for like 15 to 20 minutes. So it has to have our we've been going like for 40 minutes. Some of these, which has been a blast. We love hanging out with you guys. We love hearing you guys. I see all of you saying, hey, hey, what's up? I'm live. I appreciate you guys. And I'll drop a couple names just so you know that I do actually see you. I see you and you are. Tega Lawrence and Michael. Let's see. Allegra, always Allegra, your spectacular. Luke, Tommy, Dean. We see you guys. We see you having to look down on my phone, but we see you. We see you. We're going to end a little short because that video that Russell gives on the back end of Supplement Secrets is a half hour long. And he teaches like the full framework. He's not covering that on the webinar. So if you want that secret on top of what he's going to give during the webinar, make sure that you go and register as supplementsecrets.com. I know that's super small text. I'll make it bigger next time. Scouts, honor will be good to go. But for now, make sure you go to supplementsecrets.com. Register for this webinar because it's going to be glorious. I've already bought. It's going to be so good. Anything else? Maybe I said anything, Susan? I think that's it. Just again, make sure you guys are signed up for the notifications for Funnel Hacker TV. You can do that through email or texting funnelhacker.tv or text FHTV to 208231 3797. That'll let you know right when we're going live. You just have to click the link in your text. It'll take you right here to us so you don't miss anything. And also let us know in the comments right here on this video, let us know what else you'd want to see from us. Let us know if you want to see someone come be a guest. And we have some awesome things in store for you guys coming up. And it's going to be exciting, exciting times. All right. I think that's it for us. We'll see you guys. What's today? Thursday, we'll see you guys next week. Yeah, absolutely. See you. Bye. My name is Russell Brunson, and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started. And we don't even have gold to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you that what we are doing is impossible to get us happy every single day. And it's happened through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you. It's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you. So if a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way, I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
