## Transcript
We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Music What's up everybody? Welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. Today I'm Susan Lennardsen. I'm Ben Moot. And we're in our, well I'm in my office. Ben is at a different location which we'll get to in a little bit. But welcome. If you are joining us, let us know in the comments. Say hello. Say hashtag live or replay if you'd like to. And make sure that you're signed up for the texts for Funnel Hacker TV. It's down here at the bottom. You can text 208-231-3797 and just send FHTV to that number. And you'll get signed up. You'll get notifications right before we go live. And it's going to be awesome stuff coming up. So we have a lot to cover today. Yes we do. There's a lot going on. There's a lot. But before we go into that, I don't know, was it two weeks ago, Ben, where you got to do a little bit of an intro of yourself. And then some time has passed and I haven't been able to do that for me. So we're going to do that. Take a minute. I'm just going to introduce who I am. And so you know a little bit who I am. And you're like, who is this girl that just randomly showed up and started doing videos with Ben? Well, okay. So I've been a Funnel Hacker for over four years. It's been awesome. And just kind of going through the motions, figuring out what do I want my business to look like. So I've been in the trenches like, and I still am very in the trenches with a lot of you of figuring out what are we doing. But one of the things that I wanted to kind of share with you all in this moment of introducing myself is through all of it, taking action and moving forward has been my friend in all of it. Like, I don't really know what my next step is, but I think this sounds pretty cool. So I'm going to do that. And then I find out, well, it doesn't really fit with what I want my business to look like. So then I make a pivot. But then I try something else. I'm like, oh, that was okay. There was some, some like not great things about that choice. Learn, move on, pivot. And I think that's the big thing that I would love for you to take away through my journey. The very vague journey I'm sharing with you right now is like, just move forward, keep moving. I had one of you in the community actually sent me a message this morning of like, hey, I saw, this is another open loop. I saw a post about you and the ClickFills group. And that's like one of my goals. And you tell me how you got that. And I'm like, same advice, like, well, share a lot of value, keep moving forward, build funnels like crazy, do it for free for a little bit if you have to, keep moving. And so that's what I did. That's what I did on my journey. That's what I started a year ago or four years ago. And now I have an agency, I have business partner. We have a whole team. We have a community. And now I'm co-host with Ben on Funnel Hacker TV. And that's just kind of what led me here is I just kept showing up. And yeah, If I can jump in really quick guys, like, so a couple years back, Funnel Hacking Live, I was doing like live recaps once upon a time. And Russell apparently would watch those at night. And I didn't do them this last Funnel Hacking Live. So I was behind the scenes helping out. And so he was like, oh, I missed that. And we went to Mastermind and Paradise and guess who he heard every single night? He heard Susan. And he was like, I love her. This is wonderful. Like, this is, this is, this is just fulfilling and it's helpful. So go give, be allowed. Don't be afraid to be you. And you discovered you along the path. Like, this is not something you just learned. So Susan, I'm so excited that you're here. Thank you. No, thank you. Okay. All right, we have something kind of cool that we're introducing for the first time today that I think is going to be a really good addition. And so we'd love to know your feedback by the end of this episode. What you guys think about it? Is it time to show that? I think it's time. Let's go ahead and show it. So we were thinking like, okay, how can we make this more, well, easier on us first of all to like keep track of where we're at and our things that we want to say. And also like there's this thing called wayfinding. If you've never heard of it, it's very key in any type of thing that you're doing of like making sure your people, your audience know where they're at in the journey. Like you guys are on this journey with us every time we go live, you're on this journey with us. So we have this at the bottom now. These are kind of like our segments. And we're going to just, we're going to go down the line by the time we get to the end, you know that we're wrapping up. So this is me. I think this is you. Okay. Okay, so a water cooler moment. This is where things that are happening at ClickFunnels. Like if you could be with us at ClickFunnels HQ, you could be sitting by the water cooler and just talk about stuff that's going on. That's what this segment is. And like once again, tell us everything that you want this to be. So like if you have a segment idea that you would rather see, let us know if you have something you would like to see in here. If you have a community post that you really like, if you want, you know, there's, you let us know in the comments we're watching you. Just as a note, let's see. There we go. Oh, there we go. Let's see. Rishanda, nice to see you and let's see Mambini, Patricia. Okay, cool. All right. So once you guys know to see it. I woke up at 430 this morning. And that's Eastern time. And I drove for three hours. I got lost trying to find out where I'm going until I found ClickFunnels in Canton, Georgia. So we have an office here and over here in Canton. And I got to come in and got to be able to walk through and I wanted to show you guys what it looks like. It's my first time being here. We got two comic clubs all over the wall. It's very similar. But you've got a ping pong table. You've got like so many comfortable places. And it's a place for all the devs to meet. So all the devs come here for the hackathons. So you've got a small group of people that are here traditionally normally they're working out and making everything happen. Then you have all the devs when they have a funnel hackathon come in and every seat is taken like even even these stairs on the side where you've got literal value ladder. All the seats are taken. Everybody's sitting down. Everyone's busy. We've got the refreshments area. We've got faces everywhere. You're going to notice there's damning washes face. Like they have all of the user spotlights running all the time. And then it's just it's a really comfortable place. So Russell came in. I came in because Russell's coming in. And I wanted to be able to check grab this for you guys. So Russell came into the office. He helped. He hung out with Todd and they started just trying. This is right when they met. So they're talking. Oh my gosh. This is where we're going. This is what our priorities are. And they went and had a meeting thereafter. And it was just it was so cool to be able to be here and be able to just hang out. It's it's a different field than Boise HQ. So if you guys have not seen the behind the scenes yet there's Russell and Todd saying bye. If you guys have not seen Boise HQ yet we'll go ahead and make sure that we get to do a behind the scenes on that. But I wanted to show you Canton because it's my first time. No it's really really cool. I have no idea when I'm going to get home but it's going to be a ridiculous drive because I have to drive through Atlanta to get back home. But overall sitting here was able to like Todd pulled me aside and goes I want to show you something with AI. Russell's like do you want to see something with with secrets of success. Do you want to. And it's it's literally just the being there and being pulled into these different things. That's really really really cool. Susan has that opportunity. I have that opportunity. And it's a really unique experience. But there's movement happening. There are things happen. A lot of us are going Russell hasn't done a pulse recently or that. I'll tell you what the pulse list of things to talk about is growing. There are things that are being pushed out and things that are out. It's literally just finding the time to be able to grab him and pull him into a pulse. So there is so much happening my friends and that is what's happening next to the water cooler. That's so exciting. Yeah I'm a little jealous that you're there. But that's okay. There's a lot that happens here too. Yes you're going to be hanging out and voicing and I won't be there so. Oh yeah. So okay. All right that's water cooler. We're going to move. We're going to switch to community. So what we love doing is bringing is a highlighting some of you guys that are in the community and so this first person that we want to highlight is and I'm so sorry if I say your name wrong Afreen Mansour. And then so yeah okay sorry I messed my I got a little lost in the video. So this is Afreen's post in the group she's constantly in there dropping value of like check out how you can make your page better if you just do these few things. One of the cool things though at the very end there if you on the our next video Afreen has been listed as one of the new ClickFunnels ambassadors along with myself and four other people I believe and Ben's going to tell us a little bit more about what the why this ambassador's program exists now but I'll just say like this was kind of a surprise to me this post was posted yesterday and I'm like why am I tagged on a ClickFunnels post and I go and I'm like oh oh cool so I'm also interested in knowing more about this program Ben. Alright so what is this exactly we just called out a whole bunch of you and said you were amazing Danny Walsh is in the know. So here's the deal guys. You guys remember we brought Danny Walsh on to funnel hacker TV like last week and or the week before somewhere around that Danny was on and we talked a lot about the community and what we wanted to do with you guys are just being thrown around at ClickFunnels guess what we ain't going to do that anymore. Okay we all agree here by raise our hand cross our heart all the jazz we shall not do it. Like if you've seen all the DMs you guys seen all these DMs that are just being thrown around at ClickFunnels guess what we ain't going to do that anymore. Okay we all agree here by raise our hand cross our heart all the jazz we shall not do it. Okay we're not sliding into people's DMs we are providing value in post there are things that need to happen inside the community to make it better. Alright and really quick I just wanted to highlight Danny actually goes into this in a quick video so let me go ahead and let's go ahead and pull that up. We've been talking about this concept of celebrating those people who really bang the ClickFunnels drum the people who show up who help out who clearly use ClickFunnels every day in the business. Not so much the people who just want to come in here and and you know post whatever they like and take the topic away from ClickFunnels. There should just be one focus in a ClickFunnels group right and that should be ClickFunnels. Right and I think that's the principle that we all agree on. Like everybody here you guys love ClickFunnels so why are you here it's the group's name and so the goal is to make it more centralized there. Now by the way that was Danny Walsh with Andy Ortega Andy is on our team. He is spectacular and you guys can see the entire post the post is in the Facebook group it's tagged as one of the first ones so go and watch it is spectacular and they describe what the ambassador program is but as a brief recap. Some of you beat the ClickFunnels drum a lot. We appreciate you we would love to have you want here but there's news going on we're trying to figure out how often are we going to do this what are we actually going to highlight. We will put in segments. This is still a process we're still building it up and we love the feedback that you give. But we still want to highlight everybody and so one thing that we're going to be doing moving forward is creating ambassador program where we're going to be giving out badges and being able to allow people to be able to share our platform with them so that way they have a voice in what's going on in ClickFunnels. So you're going to be able to share you're going to be able to have increased ability to share you'll have badges awarded to you and you will also get any talks about the potential of a of a show particularly with ambassadors where one ambassador gets to talk and everyone else gets you so there's there's ideas coming out if there's something that you want to see let us know because the ambassador program is going to be really really cool we just released our first batch of who you are so you guys you know who you are we're so excited to have you here. Welcome to the community and there's just you know just because you're not an ambassador doesn't mean we don't want to hear from you. The goal of the ambassador program is to award the people who are constantly giving. It's not a closed group there's not only a certain number of people if you want to be in there continue to give continue to comment we are watching the analytics deep we're making sure that this is a positive community and growing that so make sure you continue to do that. That's what. Susan are you okay with talking about an example of somebody who's doing just that really quick. Yeah. Okay so our next community spotlight is Ethan Sim. Ethan look those awards he is had revenue of over 20 million dollars this is a post of him in the quick funnels group and you can see there's like one two and then there's a number three that's on the screen right now. He is giving this is such a long post. There is so much value in here and he's not asking for people to come and work with him he's not asking for anything at all he just wanted to come and give back and share value. And that is what what we as if you're an ambassador now or you're striving to become an ambassador this is what you can be doing is just showing up serving without expecting anything in return. And so congratulations to Ethan for for doing that and all of their success as well and a freeing who is our community spotlight for a moment ago. This is these are the examples these are the people to if you want if you want to aspire to to hire up in the chain higher up in the community you want recognition like this is what to do. And it's it's all about giving so Susan somebody asked you about how to be able to be in that program and you said it's just all about giving it doesn't matter whether or not you've got the award on the wall. We'd be absolutely honest. It's all about giving what you've learned at any level we're all in the same spectrum of growth. All growing in the same direction whatever lessons you learn I can learn from. Please share. Yeah. We are all here to like build each other up right we all want to see everyone's a good person. We all want to see everyone's have success. There's a lot of us that are in this community that are funnel builders and so sometimes that might feel like we're all in competition with one another, but we're not there are hundreds millions of businesses around the world that all need our help so there is plenty for all of us to help each other build each other up. Absolutely is. So we're going to be joining better ways to be able to highlight those things be able to bring them to you so that way you guys can see everything. Really quick are you guys okay with jumping over to what's new let us know your comments let us your ideas about the ambassador program questions you may have. And let's talk about what's new. Okay, so next week. Something's dropping you may not have seen this but this is an rad or a video that Russell put on his YouTube channel. This is Russell pretending to be Pedro talking about challenge funnels and why it's so important and then it flips and Pedro is Russell Brunson and he talks about why files are so important how you wrote all of these books and why they're all so important and they just kind of swap back and forth is just so much fun. There's things happening. And next week, Pedro gets to come to the click funnels HQ office, and he is running the challenge secrets masterclass so it's challenge secrets masterclass.com. You guys can go over there and see go inside up this is what this is 100% free VIP is available. And when you go inside like it's going to be. This is a tell all Pedro has been ridiculously busy. I've been boxing him and he's like, I'm just really busy on PowerPoint and I'm like, I get it. Like you get it done he is creating something of massive value if you've never been a part of Pedro's challenges. Pedro has done challenges with kings and queens of challenges, kings and queens of the online marketing space of and beyond. This is somebody you're going to want to learn from. And this is the template that Russell uses and use when he launched click funnels back in click funnels 2.0 with your first funnel challenge if you want to know how we built that how we modeled it. What are the some most important things that we did. Pedro is your man go ahead and sign up for that it is going to be ridiculously valuable. It's going to be exciting. It's like the video that they did where they were swapping back forth. It's like a freaky Friday thing of like their swapped bodies. So funny. Go watch that if you haven't seen it yet. And so she signed up last night looking forward to it. Okay. All right, so next on our list, we're going to just kind of wrap this up with something that you may have missed you may have not caught it it was not publicly it wasn't. It's not marketing. So, was it was last week. I forgot which day, but we have Russell posted on the is that the click funnels YouTube channel. It's his personal YouTube channel. Yeah, yeah, this tribute to Dave Woodward. And if you're so new that you don't know who Dave Woodward is. Dave Woodward, in relation to the click funnels was the CEO of click funnels and he passed away this past December. And this beautiful video that Russell and the team put together is just so touching it's Russell talking about stories about fun things that happened between him and Dave and just memories. And then towards the end of the video. I had the opportunity to speak at Dave's funeral. And so at the end of this video is his him speaking at the funeral he got special permission to be able to share that. So definitely go watch it and I know Ben you have some thoughts on it as well. Yeah, I. So, I started working here in 2016. I got to be able to meet Dave. Dave was the biggest cheerleader for a long time and every time Russell said I don't know if I can take the step he says in the YouTube video, Dave would say I'll take it. We'll take it together and he pushed Russell forward in a lot of ways we see the momentum that Russell has we don't see the people who are supporting him. Dave gave Dave gave openly. And he never stopped trying to grow. And there was a, I got really emotional watching it so I was home with my family, and I watched it with my parents and my little sister, we just all watched it on the TV and my parents like who is this person. And just, it was a beautiful beautiful tribute spectacularly done his family is absolutely wonderful I love being able to rub shoulders with them again. And if you guys ever meet any of the words they are spectacular people. And they all have something of their dad in them they all have that light that desire to give and that that ability to be free of the fear of what would happen if one thing that no one really knows about Dave that we all know internally. Dave was somebody who came at you with a million ideas what if what if we could we could we could we could. They were shot down, they were a lot, but he was there he had the energy he had to give he had the drive and he helped move things forward so my friends give give openly give large give big. There is something beautiful about Dave's legacy that will forever live here, and it's going to live in funnel hackers that are willing to over deliver in being present and being able to support one another and be able to make this into a movement that is bigger than just funnels, or just being an entrepreneur, we're going to change lives and there's something very spiritual and personal about that and I know Susan and I both both both feel that. That's one of the reasons why Russell when he's came up with the idea of funnel hacker TV tapped Susan and tapped me and said, there's a reason you guys need to be here. So, my friends live out loud. There's beauty there and if you missed it feel free to watch it it is absolutely beautiful. And he changed quick funnels and funnels is forever going to be a justice trajectory by the way some of you may have listened to the podcast that was released a little while ago, the video one got approval from family and all that stuff so that way that's good to go so now we took a little bit longer to get out but Thank you today. Thank you to his family. And let's go make quick funnels amazing. All right. Okay, that's all that we have for you today. Quick reminder, if you want to get notified the next time we go live which is going to be Thursday this exact same time text FH TV to the number below 2082313797 and we'll be back then. See you guys later. See you guys. My name is Russell Brunson and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started and we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives because we're fighting against the big brands people with literally unlimited budgets. We have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happy every single day. And it's happened through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not only something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
