## Transcript
Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are so excited to have you guys. Today we get to interview somebody who's speaking at Funnel Hacking Live, but it's not just one person. It's two people in a business that went from zero to seven figures in like seven months. This is a story that you don't want to miss. It's all about building a movement. Let's go ahead and jump into the intro and we'll get started. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Funnel Hackers Funnel Hackers Funnel Hackers Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are back with another set this time of FHL speakers. Real quick, make sure that you guys are subscribed to the texts, the emails, whatever, numbers below. 208-231-3797. So you can get all the notifications. But enough of that. Okay, so who we have, you guys know, put your guesses in the comments. But this group, I'm gonna say group, they've been around this community for a while. They've worked with people. They've worked like Russell Brunson, Steve Larson. I'm in their thing and they just have awesome knowledge when it comes to entrepreneurs and how to handle their finances and even outside of entrepreneurs and how to just build wealth for freedom. And I am so excited. They've been in Inner Circle and Category Kings for like the past six years. They're, you guys should know these guys. And if you don't know who they are, you're gonna love this. So let's please welcome Brad Gibb and Ryan Lee. Yeah! Man, I'm excited to be on this microphone with the two of you talking about our favorite movement out of all movements. Awesome. It's great to have you guys here. Okay, so let's just kick this off. Like tell us your story. How did you get together? And then how did ClickFunnels come into the picture for you? All right, Brad. I'm gonna take the first crack at it and I'm gonna hand it over to you. My name's Ryan Lee. This is my business partner, Brad Gibb. We've known each other and been working together now for over a decade. And ClickFunnels has been part of that ride for us for about six, seven years now. And here's how it started for us. We, Brad and I met way back in the day because we were struggling with money. I mean, how many of you guys listening to this have ever struggled with money? And we tried all of the traditional things and we learned that most traditional finance wasn't built for us entrepreneurs. It was built for people who are willing to cross their fingers and hope that it works out one day when they're old and gray. That's not what we wanted. And so, we got into accountability partners is really where we started off. And we started bouncing ideas, strategies, philosophies. We started attending seminars together. We started doing all of this stuff. And over time, we found a system that worked for us. We were kind of the guinea pigs and we both achieved financial freedom. And in the beginning, most of our friends and family said, you guys are insane. You guys are crazy, right? You're doing the exact opposite of everything we think we know about money. And I'm grateful for Brad because he kept me sane in a world of insanity, right? When everyone's telling you you're doing something stupid and everything's gonna go to the ground and you're doing the exact opposite of what you've been told to do, it does feel scary. And in the beginning, even though people were throwing rocks at us, over time, people started coming back and they started asking us, how did you do it? How did you do it? And so, we got together when we ran our first mastermind. Brad, remember that? There were six people. We ran a little teeny mastermind. And we taught our first set of curriculum to people. And over the next couple of months and a few years, we watched those six people go, their lives transformed. And we realized that not only were we helping people with money, we were helping people in every aspect of our life. Like it or not, money is integral in every single decision that we make. And so, we got this crazy idea before Russell even started talking about it, that we wanted to change people's life using money as the tool to do it. Not just help people invest, not get a better rate of return, not show them less taxes that they had to pay. All those were good things, but it was the why behind the strategy. And we tried it for months with traditional, like we had no idea what funnels were in marketing was, we were financial guys, right? We were helping people with finances. And so, we hired all the marketing firms. They printed all the stupid brochures for us. And we got all the expected results that you could imagine from this. We had the best website though. It was amazing. It was so glorious. It was phenomenal. Just didn't do anything. Then one day, then one day, I'll never forget, we have a friend who worked in the past at Agora. We actually, he was a part of our first mastermind. And he's like, you know what? You guys should read this book. He handed me this book and I went through it. And it was like, I mean, I don't wanna say it's sacrilegious, but I'm gonna say something sacrilegious. It was like a light from heaven shine down on my head. And for the first time I saw what marketing was. And it was crazy because I read this book and I saw a playbook to do everything that I had wanted to do. And I got online and I looked up this dude, Russell Brunson, and he so happened to be having Funnel Hacking Live in San Diego. It was the second one that I found out. And so I said, hey, Brad, read this book and we're going to Funnel Hacking Live next week. He had no idea what it was. No idea what this book was. He canceled everything. I canceled everything and we showed up at Funnel Hacking Live in San Diego. Brad, why don't you pick up the story from then? And as anybody that's been to Funnel Hacking Live knows, like I was, we're financial guys. We were expecting like quiet conference. Everybody in like button up shirts and like we're gonna learn something. And it was like walking into a rock concert for marketers. But it, I mean, it delivered at a level that we couldn't have even imagined. Anybody that's been to Funnel Hacking Live knows that it is the perfect blend of yes, it's exciting. Yes, it's amping. Yes, it's belief building. But there's deep content. There's actionable advice. And then again, the network that we still probably, that the five or six people that were the closest to in the ClickFunnels community we met at that very first event. So it checked the boxes across the board. It was entertaining. It delivered value and it connected us to other people trying to achieve what we were achieving. So it crushed everything. But there, you know, this was the only time, and this is where we feel just super fortunate about where and when we came in. It was the only time Russell pitched inner circle from stage. He had just sort of come up with it. He said, hey, we're touring around with this thing. And his sales pitch was so bad, right? I don't even know what we're gonna be doing, but I promise it's gonna be super cool. Why don't you give me a bunch of money and we'll see how this thing goes? I mean, it was a little better than that, but I think he'll even admit it wasn't all that much better than that. And we, again, we were so overwhelmed. We had no idea what we were even doing. So we didn't take the offer. We flew home and I woke up at two in the morning with the phrase still ringing in my head. He says, my goal with this mastermind is to collapse a decade into the next 12 months. And he says, I'm gonna do it by teaching you not how to market better, but how to grow and lead a movement. And like I woke up with that phrase, just like rolling in my head, woke up luckily. Again, we were so lucky that we got in before ClickFunnels was as massive as it is now because they were still spots. I got in, registered, paid two in the morning, sent Ryan a text to be like, when you wake up, by the way, we just sent Russell all of our money. And I'm really hoping this ends up working out. And then of course, now the rest is history, but that's what sucked us in. So we went, so if you guys question whether ClickFunnels works, like if there's people on the fringe here listening in, like we read a book and then seven days later, wrote a $25,000 check to Russell because that's how effective whatever he does. And that was part of it. It's like, I don't know how to get him out of my head. So whatever he does works. So let's get some of that on our side of the table working. So that was kind of the transition. And then our first meeting with Russell, like that, we got a call with Russell to like break our stuff down. And we were so excited. We were gonna impress him. And he starts interviewing us about our stuff. And he's like, so what do you do? We're like, we help you with finances or like what? Like everything for who? Anyone that has any sort of money problem at all, we can help them. And we thought, this is the easiest job Russell's ever gonna have is to teach us how to market because we're so amazing. And he sits back in his chair and he says, dude, you guys are screwed. He's like, you're dead in the water. Like what? We just paid you $25,000. You said, we're like, we're done. And what he was pointing out was this whole idea that if we talk to everybody, we're talking to nobody. If we help them with everything, we're not helping them with anything, right? And if we're not clear and articulate about the problem we're solving that again, we're totally irrelevant. And we spent the next, really it was almost three years just spinning around the washing machine of trying to figure this whole thing out. And we struggled and we shared this openly before. Like we quit inner circle so many times on the way home. Like we'd leave Boise and be like, we're never coming back cause we clearly can't get this. This isn't working for us. We must not be smart enough to get this all figured out. But we then put our big boy pants back on and thought, you know what, we can probably make this happen. And luckily again, we stayed in until, and I'll hand it back to you, Ryan. Why don't you take it from here of like, what was the thing that changed that created the hockey stick for us? Yeah, so Susan, this is a long story, but I hope this is added value to your audience here. You know, we would every time Russell did anything, every time he opened his mouth, every time he put out a piece of content, every time he wrote a book, we devoured it. And not only did we devour it, we implemented it. We tried it, we tested it, we iterated it, we did everything. And over time, we started to gain some traction, right? We were gaining some traction, we were learning how to get new business in, we were learning how to get the right avatar in. And we were starting to figure out the concept of messaging and avatar and who we wanted to serve and how we wanted to serve them. And more than anything, going back to where Brad started, we started to figure out the language and the heart of our movements. And Russell, during that time, could start to see it in us. And he opened up his personal finances and allowed us to step in and work with him to help him create untouchable wealth. And when he saw what we actually did, I think it was the first time he said, you know what guys, you guys have been getting so much better at this. I now understand it. I want you to come and I want you to teach everyone in the inner circle. And here's what he said. He's like, most people that come to inner circle end up broken. Why? Because they don't understand how to master long-term wealth. Yeah, they can make money. They make money in this. They make money in that, but they cycle. They cycle, they cycle in inner circle, out of inner circle, in a business, out of a business. You've got to teach them how to become wealthy. And so he invited us up to do a special presentation for the inner circle. And this was, it was so gratifying after three years. We stood in front of our peers, people that had taught and trained and educated us so much on all the things of marketing that we had no idea what we were doing. And we got to share with them the philosophy of creating wealth for entrepreneurs. And why that is so important to become financial free, to become empowered with money, to become sovereign. And the room that was in that room with us, including Russell, for the first time, they were all on the edge of their seats. They weren't with their eyes rolled back in the back of their head, because we were talking numbers and spreadsheets and rates of return. No, we talked to their heart. We talked about a movement. We talked about an outcome. We talked about the destination. And at the end of that, if you can imagine this talking about taxes and wealth, they all stood up and they clapped. And most of that, that one moment changed our lives. Shortly after that, we launched What is Today? Cash flow tactics. And we went from not having ever really done anything in the world of ClickFunnels to having done just about everything in the last couple of years. Love it. Every time, like so, I remember watching the inner circle presentation that Russell had you guys give. I remember seeing your journey step by step. I remember when you actually walked on stage for the first time, get your Two Comic Club Award and your Two Comic Club X Award. Cause didn't it all take like seven months in order to be able to, like, once you actually launched, you had everything figured out that it just took off. Man, I tell you what, I lose track of timelines, but yeah, we went from that, like getting that first Two Comic Club Award, I'll never forget this, you know? And this is again, such a power of coming to funnel hacking live. Like we went to every single funnel hacking live, but this was the most powerful part of it. For those first three years, I'll never forget, you know, when they would do the award ceremony, most of the room would leave, right? They would leave for the award ceremony. The ones that weren't getting an award, most of the people would leave. But Brad and I stayed in that ceremony, and we still to this day do it. We stayed in that ceremony in the audience, and we clapped for every single individual. And here's the crazy part, Ben, is people walked across that stage from all different walks of life, speaking all different types of languages, offering all different types of products and services to the market. We could see over and over and over again, if they can do it, why can't I? If they can do it, why can't I? If they can do it, I can too. Like our language and our beliefs started to change, and I'll never forget, I wish I would know, remember this dude's name. But there was a guy that walked across the stage, and he was in like some of the coaching programs that Russell had for a little while. So I got to know him for just a little teeny bit. But this dude sold hot dog cart stands to retirees. Ben Wilson. Ben Wilson, dude, that's Ben Wilson made it, no you don't, Ben walked across that stage. I said, I am going to walk across that stage, or I'm going to die trying. Like, and when you believe the only variable now becomes time, that was all we needed to change, is we needed to change our belief that if they can do what we can too. And that was one of the most powerful parts of being involved in the ClickFunnels community, especially at Funnel Hacking Live, is it increased our sense of belief that it wasn't just possible for Ben Wilson, and for everyone else, no it was possible for us as well. So, go ahead, Brad. Oh, I was just gonna, you're probably leading to this next part, but you were kind of talking about that timeline. Like, and this is what we're so excited to share with you guys, and like, we are incredibly honored to be speaking, and what we get to talk about. But Russell, like, for those that want us to talk about money and finance, I'm sorry, that's not what we're gonna be on stage talking about, because Russell has wanted to us to speak and present on. What I, and both Ryan and I really believe is actually more important than the content that we actually teach. Because what we realized is, as like my very first sales presentation, I was not a sales guy, I was an accountant, I have a master's in accounting, and I used to just put up a spreadsheet and be like, let me know when you're ready, because the numbers here justify what exactly what you need to do, but it clearly obviously didn't work, right? And if nobody listens to you, you can't change anyone's life. So as much as you might resist wanting to market or resist wanting to sell, or will resist persuasion, resist influence, if you don't figure it out, you'll never be able to change someone's life. And so for us, what we're really excited about is, once we've figured out the movement piece, those elements that Russell talks about in Dotcom Secrets, the fundamentals of building a movement, we went from basically flat, just keep like no real measurable difference from being in the group, to a two comma club, to a 10x award, and now pushing to, we have our 50, and we're pushing to the 100 award all in a span. I mean, with that, in, we hit the first two comma club in four months, we hit the 10x in just over a year, and then it was under three years that we hit the 50 and we're proceeding past that. So the thing that accelerated everything that we're doing, it wasn't better at our craft. It was better at the movement part. And so we're excited to come in and talk about our movement and break down and dissect how we implemented piece by piece Russell's playbook, how we got over some of the barriers that were there and how we applied it and break that down for everybody so they can have an example of how to follow Russell's template to being able to build a movement. So, oh my gosh, the one thing they, okay, I just wanna jump in real quick. The one thing that's really cool to me too is like, you guys are speaking so early on at Final Hacking Live. Like this is Russell's painting this whole picture of the framework, the Lynch pin, and how you implement it, why it's important to implement and all these different pieces. And in order to make this happen, the first thing that he needs to create is belief. And you guys get to stand on the stage and say, look, this is how you craft the movement. This is why this is important. This is why this is how everything changes. So step number one is that belief. It's that ability to craft that movement. And that literally launches the rest of it. So I'm just freaking in geeking. I'm having a great time. Thanks for building up the pressure, right? Reminding us that it's Russell and us. Then I think Jaco goes right after us. So we're in a pretty powerhouse sandwich here, but no, you're right. When Russell asked us to speak, that's what he talked about. He says, guys, like, this isn't accidental. I'm putting you right here because if they don't see how to do this, implementing effectively the tactics of the Lynch pin aren't gonna matter to anybody. And so there's a lot of people out there that have to see what a movement really actually looks like and how to create and install belief. And he's like, there's nobody better that's followed my playbook. This is Russell talking, right? Nobody's followed Russell's playbook better than Brad and Ryan inside of the movements that they've built. And we've now done it copy and pasted basically three times over for each. And that's how we start. We don't launch products. We start with what movement do we need to launch and lead and then create backwards from there. We're gonna walk everybody through our framework for exactly how we've done that now, effectively three separate times that has then fueled and fed the empire, I guess that we're working on building here. It's gonna be amazing. Oh man, I cannot wait because I've seen you guys speak before, but it's about the things that you do, the finance part, all that. I actually got a preview of it in Mexico, right? That's where we're at. Or was it InnerTurtle? We gotta sneak peek apart. We're gonna mix it all things up. And it was awesome. So I cannot wait. Guys, you have to go get your tickets, funnelhackinglive.com. Like Ben said, we've got them sandwich, I think day one, right? Yep, day one. And there we go. There's so many amazing speakers and Russell's got it all planned out to be the best experience possible to get you exactly what you need from everybody is very, very intentionally planned. And not just their topics, but where they are placed. It's just an amazing event. It sells out every year. You guys need to go get your tickets right now. They're dwindling, far in view between. And also like when you get your tickets, so not only are you getting your ticket into the live event for this year, for 2023, but if we can pull up that offer stack, perfect, thank you. But you're also getting, scroll, scroll, scroll. Oh yes, swag. We all love swag, bring extra bags and suitcases. You get marketing AI integration that goes into your 2.0 account as soon as you get your ticket, inner circle bonuses. Look at all of the FHL replays, all of the past years. Every single thing on here is worth the value of the ticket like just on its own. Like there's probably one speaker that you will find in those replays that's gonna change how you think about something and not alone is gonna be worth the amount of money for your ticket. And then you get everything else and you get to be at FHL this year. And then all of the speakers that are speaking this year are throwing in their bonuses as well. And from what I understand, Brad and Ryan actually have something pretty awesome that they wanna throw in too. You guys wanna speak about that? Yeah, so when Russell invited us to come speak to the inner circle the first time, the time that it launched everything that we've now been able to build and create, we helped entrepreneurs understand a philosophy, a philosophy about money that differentiates the game that they're already used to playing. Most entrepreneurs are used to playing the income game, launch a funnel, launch a product, have a service out there and make money, get my two comic club award. But income and wealth are two radically different things. They're two different concepts altogether. And so that was really what sparked Russell to be curious about what we did because despite Russell's current success today, we all know his backstory, right? He had many ups and many downs. And I think most entrepreneurs have been on that roller coaster where they're high as high and they're low as low and entrepreneurial scarcity is a real thing. Most entrepreneurs cycle in and out of poverty. And so our objective is to empower entrepreneurs with money, to not just make money, but to build wealth. And so that's what we're gonna be giving away is our sovereign entrepreneur course. Brad, why don't you talk a little bit about that because it's launching next week. Yep, so it's brand new. We're just getting it all out. It's been all these years in the making. It's the most recent sort of installment of our movement launches. Ben, you've played around with some of our stuff and just wished to be like, why can't you just filter everything just for, and guys, it's not just entrepreneurs because there's a difference. Am I right, guys, that there's a difference between your average everyday entrepreneur that maybe runs a dry cleaning company, nothing gets dry cleaning companies, but and a funnel hacker, right? There's even a difference there. So what we've done is we've taken the work we've done with Russell, like you mentioned, many of the inner circle members, many of the category Kings members, many of the two comic club winners and said, what is the path for a funnel hacker, right? And a movement core driven founder of a company to use that as the fuel to create for themselves and their family and their legacy and their dynasty untouchable wealth. And this is wealth that will last regardless of what politicians do with taxes, regardless of what happens with future markets, right? What happens regardless of how much money that they print, it will create a dynasty that lasts a hundred or more years. That's our core philosophy. And it's all aimed again at the 1% crazy entrepreneur that believes that they can actually do it. So that it's gonna be formatted. There's a challenge that will kick it off and then there'll be a course behind that. We're gonna give you the entire thing, again, just because we owe everything to this community. So we don't wanna hold anything back. We're giving you the entire challenge and the entire course as part of that bonus. And one thing I wanna say about that, the reason we wanna give this away to the community, we've always believed because this is where we started. We've believed that we have a God given purpose, that we have a unique set of gift, skills, talents and abilities that when we put them in the service in the world, we solve a problem. I mean, problems in our world exist for a reason and it's the entrepreneurs that go out and see them, not as problems but as opportunities to use their talents to solve those problems. So when an entrepreneur can stay in business and be wealthy and show up in their business and position of power, they solve problems. And here's the other thing as well. We've worked with entrepreneurs at the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows. And when an entrepreneur can be in a position of financial sovereignty, they get to make decisions inside of their business that serve the best long-term interest of that business rather than making short-term decisions to put money in a bank account, launch a product that's not good for the business long-term, they can make the right decisions to keep their business in place for a much longer period of time. So our real belief is to empower, the fastest way to experience change in our world is to empower entrepreneurs, to do what they do best in the communities and with the people that they serve. So we are so passionate about serving entrepreneurs and we're just grateful to be able to give back to this community that has applauded us, that has supported us, that has believed in us. I mean, those times that Brad talked about driving home from Idaho, there were many times that we did quits, like we could not see how we could have a success path. And there were so many people, including Russell, that reached out to us individually and said, you've got this, keep going, you're so close, keep going. And I love that about the ClickFunnels community. I mean, Russell, the two of you and everyone in the ClickFunnels team have facilitated such a community of purpose-driven individuals. So we're just honored to be part of that community. I know like Susan, you've gone through all the stuff, I've gone through their stuff. This bonus is beyond, like we're both freaking out right now because we've got access to it. So if you do not have your tickets, my friends, you need to go and go to funnelhackinglive.com, grab your tickets. Scarcity is a real thing. Seats are limited. Hotels are the hotel, what is that? Rooms? Hotels are- Yeah, blocking, thank you. Our block of rooms that we have specifically set up for you on discount are extremely limited. We are getting very, very close.

And it's then that way every single time you've heard it from Brad and Ryan and how they were able to experience that, come experience it for yourself, we are inviting you and that bonus is truly amazing. Go to funnelhackinglive.com and get your bonuses. Susan, anything you wanna throw in? Cause holy- I think that's it. Thank you guys so much for joining us and being so generous and giving back love that and cannot wait to see you guys on stage for the first time at Funnel Hacking Live. Thanks for joining us and everybody else, we'll see you guys tomorrow for another Funnel Hacker TV where we will have another FHL speaker joining us. Bye. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating, it's pulsing. I'm made for something more. You get scared. And then fear hits us. There's a little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven, are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that made me all of my money. My best selling framework. Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust in blow-inters. This better blow your mind and allows you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning to begin. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experienced in this wondrous life? I'm going to be able to tell when I was 19. My mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People feel a sense of belonging here. I feel like home. I'm still encouraging. Because if they can do it, so can I. They thought, what's saying, hey, next year we're going to get better. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. He's a great teacher. He's a great teacher. He's a great teacher. He's a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer ever lived. We find exactly what your business is missing. You're going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body is not right or you didn't go to the right school. But in one day, they're telling people how they met you. I can live change my entire life. Because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be blasted. Your legacy's going to be blasted. Movements are about to be burned. My story hopefully gave women permission. You do not have to be great to get started. But you have got to start if you ever want to be great. Thank you.
