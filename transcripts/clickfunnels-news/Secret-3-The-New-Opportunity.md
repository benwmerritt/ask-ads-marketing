What's up everybody how are you guys doing? I don't know about you but I got fired up watching that little intro reel getting ready for this so we decided everyone's like showing up as we started these episodes up a little bit into it and so we thought we'll start 15 minutes with some previews some getting people hyped up and excited and check out we got 376 viewers already on live before I got started which is amazing so I'm pumped to take out the guys today. How are you guys all feeling? Let me know where you're calling in from today. In the comments I want to see where you guys are coming in from. Also if you are watching this live type in live live live so I can see you guys are live here with me and if you're here replay watching replay let us know in the replay as well which is really exciting but I am pumped to be hanging out with you guys today so I've been having so much fun as you guys know I made a commitment to you all all my funnel hackers back man a week and a half ago two weeks ago I was gonna go live every single day and I didn't want to live six days last week and this is day number three this week which is a lot of fun and this week we're doing a series so hopefully you had a chance to watch all the videos in the series if you haven't yet go back to the page and go back and find number one number two but basically the stuff I'm teaching this week is about from expert secrets okay and I told you guys early on Monday I said my job here is to get you guys to wake up to wake up to the fact that you have a calling that people are waiting for you to step into your calling to change their lives okay now every single one of us has been given different life circumstances sometimes very positive things we've done that have been amazing sometimes things have been very hard and painful and difficult that we've had to go through and sometimes we're like why did I have to go through this why did I have to do this and I believe the reason why is because you learn a set of skills to overcome that to become someone different to become something better and now that you have been given that gift and your job now is to step up as the expert to go back in time and find the people are just like you would serve them okay that's the calling that's what it is right is to figure out the things that you like the stuff that you've accomplished in life build back go back and help other people right and so that's kind of the game plan what I want to talk about today is another piece of that which is going to be so much fun so I'm curious now how many of you guys if you're listening to me how do you guys feel called you're like I feel that I think I need to be doing more I feel this called the contribution Alex Sharfing calls it the call of contribution I love that like that's the feelings this call of contribution right and you felt that before like I know that I'm supposed to be doing this if that's you and you felt the call of contribution like post it down below usually people in my funnel hacking community like that's who we are we are people who feel that call of contribution we want to serve we want to do things and so like that's the reason so that's you if you feel called let me know the comments down below comments going crazy today I love it you guys are feel called you're in awesome awesome okay that's kind of game plan what I want to do today so what we've been doing this week is we've been going through parts of the expert secrets book and I talked about this in the first and second one and now the third one in the expert secrets the whole goal is for us to build a movement right to build it like to have a following people we can change their lives so how do you do that how do you build a mass movement of people that you can change your lives with the advice the ideas the things you have right that's the question and so in here if you look inside the expert secrets book there's three core things that every mass movement has throughout time number one was the attractive character the expert the influence of you right now is Monday we talked all about that and hopefully I like freed you guys from some of that that fear and anxiety and and anxiousness you get when you are supposed to step into that calling that's number one number two then was the future-based cause that was the video that we watched yesterday which I thought was a lot of fun and showed you guys how we built our future-based cause with click for what we've been doing and how we've been doing it had you guys write your campaign slogans we had you figure out exactly what your identity statements were gonna be that you could put on a t-shirt for your people for your tribe as you were trying to serve them and on and on and today now is step number three secret number three but I want to call it which is the new opportunity now this is the one of the three that I think is the most important yet the most or the least understood this one most people struggle even I people read the book come to the events I got my new opportunity but I tell them what it's like nope that is literally not a new opportunity that is the opposite of new opportunity so we're gonna I'm gonna show you guys a presentation again this is part three of that presentation from Funnel Hiking Live a few years ago where I first taught this stuff so we're gonna watch that but I wanted to kind of I want to kind of preface that before we go into it so you put some context before we jump into it okay and so um and I'm actually this is the topic I'm speaking next week Dan Kennedy's got a big event we're doing in Dallas I'm speaking I have a whole session just on this I'm excited to talk about so you guys are getting kind of sneak peek behind that but um what I'm talking about in this presentation that I'm preparing right now for Dan Kennedy's event is you look at the history of things how things worked right so initially like there are only a couple companies that sold stuff right way back in the day it was like there's I don't know Proctor and Gamble whoever was like the big company Sears right they would sell you a washing machine and you get the washing machine right and that was business and like none of us people could compete in that business we didn't have a business right like there was a company who sold stuff and that was it right and then the very first wave of offers started coming right and the first wave of offers were repair okay you've got a washing machine it's broken and you would repair so repair is the first evolution of this right and so so many businesses were in the repair business that's when all the mechanics and the whatever started popping up in all the different industries people who tried to repair something it was broken right because they couldn't manufacture the money or the finances to manufacture to start a business right so someone to start a business they would you know have all this money to create something and then the repair market where you'd repair something that was broken right and that was the first segment of the market then somewhere along the way someone wrote a book about like how to build a better mousetrap and notice I said better there's this magic word ER better how to build a better mousetrap right and so that that was the next phase is like okay instead of repairing now like people started making money and they started being able to have the chance to manufacture and compete and stuff like that so now they started trying to build something that was better right better is an improvement offer they're trying to improve it right so something's broken or something sorry something's broken to repair it now something's there and you try to build a better mousetrap and make it better faster smarter i'm gonna add this feature i'm at this feature and start making something better right so better is the next phase and this is where most people in my world today fall and they try to create a better offer right they see someone on like oh here's tony robbins i'm gonna do it better here's so i'm gonna do it better here's um someone teaching how to drive traffic i'm gonna teach him i do it better faster like there's always an ER word when you're making an improvement offer okay and it's good you can make a good living with an improvement offer but if you want to create a mass move you want to change the world you have to go to the third phase which is not repair it's not improvement in fact and i'm gonna talk about this in the presentation there's so many reasons why improvement's not good but the last phase is you create an actual new opportunity that is the secret when you create a new opportunity that's how you create a movement right when we launched click funnels 10 years ago i can't believe that a decade now 10 years ago it was a new opportunity we were the only ones like we created a literal new opportunity which is why the movement grew so quickly right and now those people come out who were trying to make it better faster the ERs that all of the improvement offer people have kind of jumped in the last decade into our business but we were the first we were the beginning we were uh the new opportunity okay now for you and you are crafting an offer like understanding and mastering a new opportunity is the key to blowing something up and this is the hardest thing people struggle with i still struggle with like it's thinking to think a lot through to actually do one and so that's kind of the game plan so that's what we're gonna be learning about today if you guys want to learn about some new opportunities and oh new opportunities i've said type no in the box for a new opportunity but that doesn't make any sense means you're gonna say no so say yes we want some no and then uh and then we'll know okay awesome thanks for playing along with me guys i appreciate that all right so i'm kidding this presentation again this is the third part of the presentation we watched part of it monday on attractive character part on tuesday on future based cause now we're watching part three which is me talking about uh actually creating your new opportunity so with that said let's put our hands together for Russell Brunson from 2017 let's go here's number one talked about is the charismatic leader becoming that person you need to be to lead people number two is the cause the future-based cause inspires people to follow you to go somewhere and number three is this is one of the coolest parts and when i realized this like this was for me like when i got this piece was the key in fact when i got it i was sitting in a little car in kenya and my wife had just fallen asleep and i'm reading this book and i have a little pen and i'm taking notes we're on this like bump your road on my scribbling on my trying to underline stuff and also i was like oh my gosh they all have this this was like that was the third okay got that it was like that's it this is the thing to understand okay and it's the new opportunity okay now i hope i do this justice if you understand this this is like the key to your as a success this is the difference between uh a business making a hundred thousand dollars a year and a business making a hundred million dollars a year is this if you understand it okay most people when they're selling a product what they're doing they're selling something we call an improvement offer something to make you better okay in our last interstitial meeting henry said anything that ends with an er better smarter faster it's called an improvement offer an improvement offer is the easiest thing for us to create because that's what we always do i'm gonna make you smarter faster better whatever that is the problem is that for me to say yes i want to become smarter what do i have to admit that i'm dumb i want to become faster i have to admit that i'm slow like there's so much resistance to improvement offers if i'm going to try to make you improve it's going to be very very hard if i instead present you with a new opportunity it becomes better okay now i'm gonna look at the both spectrums again right we come back to hitler hitler didn't go to the nazis and be like hey guys this sucks like all these reparations where we call like all these things are happening this is really really bad like i'll lead you guys better we're gonna do some cool stuff it's gonna be awesome no hiller got it there he's like look guys this is the deal all these these trees all these things that are holding us back are wrong you make me the leader guess what we're gonna do we're gonna get rid of them this thing ends today it's over we're starting a new thing what do people do they stood up and they followed okay when christ came what did christ say he said look no longer we're gonna do the law moses we're not gonna be doing animal sacrifices and all sorts of stuff he said no this is the new law this is a new covenant now instead of doing all this stuff where it's different this is a new opportunity instead you're gonna come and you're gonna have a broken heart and a contract so you had a different message was not we're gonna make this better we're not gonna make the law moses easier or faster no it's like this is a new thing okay and if you like any mass movement that's ever been successful in the history of time they all have this the leader did not teach people how to be better okay if you look at corporations those of you guys who have a corporate job or came from corporate america what does corporate world offer advancements improvement you work five years you get a raise and you improve you'll prove like you improve okay no mass movement is based on that they're all based on this a new opportunity when you understand this piece of it like it's the key okay i guess nine times out of ten if what you're selling now is not converting it's not making money is because you're selling an improvement offer when you shift it to a new opportunity everything will change okay so here's some reason why people don't want improvement offers number one improvement is hard the definition of the word is like i have to go improve and become better okay most people who are gonna buy your thing this is not the first time they've tried to get better at it it's not the first time they try to lose weight or make money or invest things or whatever it is your thing it was it's not the first time they've tried it and it's hard right and you're saying no i can make you i can make you faster like that's pain there's so much pain tied to improvement okay number two desire versus ambition i would say probably one percent of the world has ambition that people that are ambitious right if you're selling improvement you are selling to people who are ambitious that means 99 percent of the entire world will not buy your thing so if your offer is not converting it's because you're selling improvement you're selling to ambitious people which is so much harder okay new opportunity plays on desire what do you want to be who do you want to become okay so it's an chance to have a whole new life no longer do i have to be doing this thing over here i get rid of it and start a whole new life like that's the key okay so if you're selling improvement offer you're instantly discounting 99 percent of the population gone number three when you're selling improvement as soon as you start talking about this time i'm going to help you lose weight it's going to be different this time whatever it is they have memories they they're remembering all the times they failed in the past and that's what you're fighting against when you're selling like i tried i've tried this 10 times never worked okay i'll try again like that's what you're selling against is every single other failure they've ever had at this point as soon as you're like no dude like none of that stuff is true like here's a whole new opportunity but it's not improvement like it's something completely different when you offer that they don't have any memory of like all the pain that like you're not selling inside all you're selling against is like i have desire i can actually do this this time okay it's a huge key there and the next thing is as soon as you're selling improvement you're typically in a bloody red ocean and what happens in a bloody red ocean is you become a commodity and as soon as you become a commodity that's a race to the bottom you become cheaper and cheaper like well you know i can buy your thing but it's here and you know so and so it's cheaper and cheaper and every time it's like getting cheaper and you have to discount to be able to compete which is the worst way in the world to be that's what happens when you're in this bloody ocean the best thing to be is i mean a blue ocean where it's just you you can charge whatever you want okay dan canady told me one time he said he said uh there is uh no strategic advantage of being the second lowest price leader in your market okay walmart's there yeah he were almost as cheap as walmart worst tackling ever right so if you can't be the lowest price leader in your market there's no strategic advantage of being number two but there is a huge strategic advantage of being the most expensive and we haven't seen frank urn's ads frank urn the highest most expensive paid copywriter in the history of planet earth right wherever it is like he positioned himself there and then what he's to get premium prices so if you can't be the cheapest be the most expensive you can do that when you're not selling improvement when your improvement instantly you're in commodities and you're fighting that when you're in a blue ocean when you're creating a new opportunity for someone it's it's it's completely different think about the presidential elections again okay how many the people who lost are always talking about improve improve improve improve improve people that won all about here's a new opportunity here's a new change we're going to drain the swamps in washington right we're all the things that trump said like those are all new opportunities versus the improvement okay understanding that's what people want okay the next thing that's important to understand that it's tied to this improvement offer that i learned this from perry belcher and when he told it to me i had this like one of those like just huge ahas he said that the reason why people buy from you and the reason why they don't buy from you is tied to one magic word when you understand this it's insane it's all tied to status every buying decision you make is based on status if i purchased this thing is it going to increase my status or is it going to decrease my status that's what they're asking that's the real argument you have with people when you're trying to sell something and they're looking at like cool i want that thing if i got that man i'd be cool like my status would be huge like that'd be awesome they start thinking about they get all excited and then i wait but uh last time i tried this i failed oh and then like my wife found out she was really mad i spent stuff on credit card still paying the credit card debt uh then my friends found out and they're going through all the stuff like how buying your thing is going to decrease their status right and so you got to figure out like how do i create anytime you're selling improvement offer you're you're pushing people down this like decrease of status but it's a new opportunity they don't know they don't have it something to base it on right so it's just increase in status so anytime you're creating a new opportunity i'm looking through it's like what are all the ways that them purchasing this thing is going to increase their status versus the thought of decreasing their status okay um there's a reason why people buy really nice cars i'm gonna get in that car i'm having increased status right and so many guys right now i'm hearing me say that and you're like that's not true about me nope status does not affect me in fact i would never drive a nice car russell i'd drive a minivan i said oh really well why do you drive a minivan i'm curious because it's you know economical and oh what would the other moms in the neighborhood think if they saw you driving a Ferrari oh well they saw me driving a Ferrari like they would all judge me decrease in status and they would think that i waste my money decrease the status okay the same reason why someone drives a Ferrari is the same reason why you may drive a minivan because you're afraid of decreasing your status amongst your peers and your friends is that interesting so you have to understand that as you're selling as you're creating opportunities it's all about status for people you understand that then it's all about okay how do i create an offer and a product and a service something it's so amazing like no matter what happens they cannot fail the only thing that happens increase in status and if not we give them their money back and they don't lose anything right that's why i live doing guarantees because when you sell something they're all excited about in fact this actually works isn't amazing but like what if it doesn't work oh and they start freaking out it's like well we'll give you money back cool time back to ground zero okay good so really understanding that and internalizing as you're creating things is that's why people buy and why they don't buy when you master that and you create your presentations and things based on that it becomes becomes really powerful all right so here are the reasons why people crave new opportunities and why they want those all the time number one is it's a new discovery it's so exciting like i found this new thing okay it's the reason why like when there's a new viral video it goes out how many of you guys will admit it as soon as you see a viral video if you're like the first one to see it you want to share it with everybody you know you're like i want to be the first one to share it no one's going to admit it but think about how much that increases your status if you're the first one right new discovery if you find out this new thing this new opportunity like holy cow i remember when uh when dav astre came out with bold proof coffee i don't drink coffee so i was like i can't do that soon every single person i know was like oh my gosh i found this new opportunity i found this new thing you put butter in your coffee you put butter in your coffee it was everywhere on news on tv i like every event i went to everyone's talking about it was like this new opportunity everybody was talking about and it went crazy right because it's a new opportunity that people discovered this new thing and they wanted to share it okay when you offer someone a legitimately new opportunity they share it right now inside of clickfunnels we get over 500 people a day that sign for clickfunnels i don't know where they come from because some of all you guys talking about this new opportunity you found that crazy it's really cool by the way thank you please keep talking about it it's in fact today we passed 32 000 active members today is that amazing so anyway that's all about that like the new discovery people get like they crave that about new opportunities number two there's no pain to disconnect okay with an improvement offer i gotta tell you like you failed a lot this time we're gonna try not to fail no like it's a whole different thing like you've never even experienced this before they have no idea they don't have this like pain of like this pain is gonna happen right they don't have to give up their own thing that like it's a completely new thing that they're able to do okay number three is dream replacement this is huge because it's like they uh they had a dream like like most people if you think about this with your audience right they're currently in some kind of opportunity trying to get a result right like if i want to lose weight i'm in a vehicle i'm trying to get over there where i'm gonna get this result i'm in that vehicle right i'm trying to it's not working for me and so if i come along i might try and give an improvement offer again it's gonna be this hard like uh but new opportunities like no this vehicle here and sucks get out of it come in my car over here we're gonna take you on this thing all of a sudden this is a new thing so they still have the dream of where they're going but not all the pain of like i've tried this before this car is horrible i'm still driving this horrible pinto trying to get to the thing no like you can get rid of that and this whole thing and so they still have the chance to get the dream of where they're going without all of the negative side effects and all the negative things that they have about the car that they're in okay and then greener pastures life's always green over there okay a couple things i want to help you understand as soon as i understood this whole concept of new opportunities i was like well how do you present and create a new opportunity right that's the next thing like it's it's cool but how do you make that and i realized after looking at like thousands of different things i was like every single new opportunity comes out of one of two things number one is an opportunity switch or number two is called an opportunity stack okay so an opportunity switch is you're looking at your potential customer and they're sitting in this opportunity this car this vehicle right and you're saying that car you're in is no good we're gonna switch you to this one right here okay it's a switch we're changing from this opportunity to this opportunity okay as we did the fat event last or two weeks ago that's one of the big things that came out of it for me was like understanding that your audience is already in some vehicle trying to get that result over here okay you're not making you're not gonna teach them like oh there's a result you want that they they they already want it they already want to lose weight make money like whatever your things they already have that result they want but they're in some vehicle that's not getting in the result they want okay so the first one is a switch you're saying this vehicle is no good switch it out for this one and that's an opportunity uh an opportunity switch the second one is we call an opportunity stack so they're already an opportunity they like but you're helping them stacking on a new opportunity okay and i'm gonna show that in about two slides i'll go deeper on the opportunity stacking parts that make more sense but traditionally when somebody's first coming into your world the first interaction with one of your funnels what you are presenting to them typically is an opportunity switch you've been trying this now instead you're gonna be coming over here and trying this that's the switch okay now opportunity switching usually happens at two different levels one if we came if we went early we talked about like the market and then the sub markets and then where you're creating your niche you're getting them to switch from whatever niche that they're in to your market okay to your the niche you've created you've switched them there or you can come one level out to the sub market where let's say they're doing real estate and you're switching them to internet marketing or they're doing uh investing and you're switching them to uh real estate one of that thing is okay so you're just switching them from one opportunity to the next okay now if you look at this um typically the way that most businesses work is the first thing somebody comes the first time they come into the world you're doing an opportunity switch okay so when most of you guys came into my world you were doing something already right you had a result you wanted to make money get your message out you wanted to change whatever your thing was and you were in some vehicle right and i was like look the vehicle you guys have is horrible okay it's probably lead pages or confusion software something like that vehicle's bad okay the only option is like certain death and doom and frustration and i was like but look at this there's this new opportunity called quick funnels come over here boom and i move you to a new opportunity i present that to you and you're like sweet this is awesome right now this is the key i want you guys to understand i actually voxed this to dan henry yesterday okay in your business you want one opportunity switch the fastest way to kill your list destroy your audience and confuse people is to give them a switch and then a switch and a switch and a switch i looked at the first eight years of my business and guess what i was doing to my audience i put them in a new opportunity oh and they're like this is awesome and i was like hey guys there's another new opportunity and then they all jump over here and like what about that one i'm like that one's good but this one's even better like okay cool they'll come over here i'm like oh over here i kept by switching and switching and very quick people like lose faith in you they're like oh all these things are awesome but like what am i doing like and they kept i kept moving and moving and moving right and so in each of your business you should have one and only one opportunity switch after you've switched somebody into your opportunity now you go deep there okay now you go deep there and this is where you start doing opportunity stacks so what are the opportunities within this vehicle that i'm offering you so for me most you guys are familiar with my value ladder right you come into my world you switch into funnels now what do i have i've got different things i i can offer you guys click funnels i can offer you guys funnel scripts i can offer you guys certification like these are all new opportunities within the opportunity i've switched you into can show the other again okay so the initial thing i offer is a switch and after i stack new opportunities but they all but they're all based on this foundation of the opportunity that i put people in initially does that make sense okay that's how you get people to follow and go deeper and deeper and deeper with you it's not by switching from thing to thing to thing like if i did this and next week i was doing a webinar about how you guys can make money on in real estate and the next week i was not talking about is that how to do the forex trading and next week i was like how to do sco like you guys would all leave me none of you guys would be here usually you guys are here today is because everything we're talking about is in this thing for the last three years i've talked about nothing but this thing because this is the vehicle that i believe in and if you keep switching from thing to thing to thing people aren't going to believe you you have to believe that deep that this becomes your mission like this is i want everybody into this opportunity and after that then we'll stack other things that can take that to the next level you can become certified and make this into a career you can join in a circle and help you know there's other things that we have but there's only one switch now that's the stack does that make sense cool so that's kind of that's how those things work all right i hope you guys are getting this i just gave you the secret to everything you want in life now this is not the most easy most simple thing to figure out that's why it's hard right anything that's great is hard to do like people got it if it was easy everyone would do it and wouldn't work right most people are gonna again back in the day everyone just to repair businesses now everyone's doing improvement offers like the the masses they look at the market as a whole it's like 99% of people are offering uh improvement which is good you can make an okay living doing that but if you really want to change the world and change the people's lives you've been called to serve and actually make the money that you deserve it all comes down to that which is figuring out like what is the new opportunity you have to spend some time thinking about like it's not just something that's like oh this is my new opportunity like it's not that simple um it's gonna be have to think through we have to figure out that you have to craft it you create it becomes this new thing um it's interesting because people always tell me well Russell of course it worked for you you picked you picked a great mark you picked funnels and like you understand funnels was not a thing a decade ago right we used to call themselves processes we don't even names for like when we decided like funnels were our thing that we call it a company click funnels you see it right there you said click funnels is the way this is what we're doing funnels are the new opportunity and like and I went to war for a decade convincing the world that funnels were the new opportunity right and it's it's worked it's happened like like there's no one in the world but like I go into hairdressers like I was talking to Dean grassy OC he's like he's like my wife's hairdresser and the other hairdressers are talking about click funnels like this is ridiculous so he's like what you did like transcend anything else any of us have done in the marketplace like you've you've brought a new opportunity and brought into all these businesses all these industries right and so that's what like that's the power in in creating figure out where your new opportunity is but it's going to take some time to think through it so that's the homework today in fact if you guys want homework assignment go get the expert seekers book experts seekers.com and then go obviously the whole book but if you want to go deep into just the new opportunity stuff it all starts on page number page number 77 in the hardbound version is where new opportunity starts and it goes deep in here it gives you exercises and things to work through and to think through as you're creating this new opportunity for your audience for your market. I think the biggest thing that I can I can biggest hint I can give you is you're trying to figure this thing out is again it's coming back and stepping back and saying okay who's my dream client right that's number one who's the person I'm trying to serve okay so I draw that person over here on the left hand side right and over here I say what's the result they want right and usually if you see my videos like there's like a mountain right I'm going up to the mountain like this is the result they want and the question is like how are they current how is your dream customer currently trying to get that result okay because they're trying like I think I talked about in the video but like in fact some of you guys know I bought Lady Boss from Katelyn Poland a couple years ago and I talked to her she said the average woman in America goes on eight diets a year right eight diets that's almost one a month so what happens is like here's the dream here's the dream customer down here here's the result they want to lose weight so what are the all the different things that they're currently trying right so they're trying paleo keto they're like they're trying all these other things right this how you figure out what are the other uh what are the other things in your market and your job is look at all these things right here and not say I'm going to make paleo better I'm not going to make keto better it's like what's your version that's different it's a new opportunity it's not the same thing right so you have to figure out what that thing is and the easiest way for me I always do is sit down ahead of time it's okay here's all of the different here's the result they're trying to get here's all the different options what's my how's mine different I remember when I spoke at Grant Cardone's 10x event this is where we set the world record and like sold more in 90 minutes than anyone had ever sold in the past that record still stands this day by the way so yeah let's go um but the very first thing I did right when I was going to that event I said okay everyone's coming to Grant Cardone's event trying to learn how to 10x their business right that was a whole theme of the event I said I looked at all the other speakers I'm like what are all the other speakers what are all of their where we at what are all of their um their opportunities that they're trying to present people to get that result I said I said okay there's someone teaching sales someone teaching traffic generation someone teaching so there are always different things that people are teaching I said okay these are all the opportunities they can choose from I need to present a new opportunity I'm not like there's like three sales guys and then I'm trying to say my way of selling is better than everybody else's like that's not a new opportunity right um mine comes in saying like like look you could do this you could do this but like I don't realistically you could actually 10x your business with any of these but here's when you can boom introduce my new opportunity 3.2 million dollars in sales like that that like that was the difference right I outsold all the other speakers combined because all of them were fighting over this trying to make improvement offers on everyone else's thing on how to 10x the business I was like no no no I got something different boom new opportunity everything else shifts okay so for you it's like spending some time thinking through that um so that's the gold nugget I want to give you guys say is that helpful is that good that blow your mind a little bit hopefully hopefully it was helpful for you guys I've not again go back and watch this um all these are if you go to to my fan page Marussel Brunson whatever my fan page google or go to
