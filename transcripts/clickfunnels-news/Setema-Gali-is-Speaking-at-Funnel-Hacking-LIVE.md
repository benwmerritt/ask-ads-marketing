Sema Satemah. How are you sir? Man? I'm so happy to be here. Thank you for having me It is an honor to be with you my brother. It's an honor to have you it's I can't I can't believe so Russell was like Do you want to like interview everybody for fun like I'm like Freaking out because I know what this means.

Who you are and why you became an entrepreneur and what that path even looks like you got it So let me take you back football BYU football with the Patriots when a Super Bowl ring retire and jump into the mortgage industry But I knew even when I was doing mortgages real estate my heart Called me I felt it like some of you out there I know if you're a funnel hacker and you're in our community You feel called to do something significant. I felt that calling to be a coach a speaker a trainer And before I had a chance to do that we lost Everything in 2000 and we got killed Decimated like annihilated to the point where I sold my Super Bowl ring to put food on the table I sold my wife's wedding ring to pay bills. We sold everything We had cars repossessed homes for clothes portfolios for clothes And then I filed the bankruptcy in 2010 and By 2011 I am four years into this wilderness so to speak like I do not like maybe my best days are behind me Maybe it's time to just settle and give up on the dream. Maybe I should just be grateful and I took three years to go knock doors as a door-to-door salesman with the end in mind I always knew I was supposed to be this person who was supposed to change lives Fast forward finish up my third year knocking doors and again I call it the voice the voice is like it is time you are done knocking doors It is time to go and into this world of marketing coaching speaking funnels. I came and You know today again, I live on the beach here in Florida. I'm an amazing team We have clients that like I love this and again Russell talks about the hero's journey, but Been on my own heroes journey over the last decade and a half Well, it's funny because you think that you reach that pinnacle and like it always seems to flip on yourself And you realize that no you just walked through the threshold again You're about to go on a yet another journey life's got another twist for you And you've taken it like a man like I remember you have talked about how motivation is for children Like it's not enough in order to move you for it. There's a specific quote around that I'm getting it wrong. I know that It's oh There are things that have just stuck with me for years that I appreciate One thing that's that I wanted to ask how did you like even discover? Russell like how was that a thing because at this point in your life? You're trying to grow everything back you're trying to get back and Reach that pinnacle again. I remember you talked about in your story like when you sold your Super Bowl ring You flew out you gave it to the fella and he gave you a lot of cash and you said I'm coming back for that Yeah, well so Russell first of all we were at BYU together. He was a wrestler I was a football player. Oh, and then you know you like we come from the same religious upbringing So I know about this guy who's doing this thing called funnels And I was working with the guy who's been on Russell stage is really really good friend of mine Garrett and Garrett and I were doing some work together and we kind of get a second go do your own thing and Garrett looks at me and says You suck at marketing you're a lead at coaching you're a lead at speaking you need to go pay Russell. I Said great. I called up Russell's office. I said how much is the mastermind? They told me the inner circle I paid it and into Russell's world of funnels and Marketing and I'll tell you what like it was hard to I showed up to like Boise Idaho first of all I show up from SoCal It's February. I have no winter coat. I'm like I gotta go to Macy's and get a winter coat But I showed up to the room and I learned so much about just the concept of No matter how good your product is no matter how good you are as a speaker as a coach No matter how good your service is if nobody knows you if they can't find you if they can't differentiate you You're gonna lose because someone else out there is marketing and again. I've that was 2016 16 into 17 so I've been in the click funnels world and again I've got I've got the triple hard copy books, right traffic secrets expert see your calm I mean I I buy all the stuff. I got the boxes. I got the stickers. I'm a guy who believes in investing and You know Russell has been one of those guys for me again. I've seen his transformation physically needs to be kind of you know a little Portly my man is lean Never mess with the wrestler never mess with a guy like that But I continue to learn from Russell and what he is built inside of the community and I'm so grateful for him Now you spoke on stage at funnel hacking live was it 2018 was it 20? 2017 Dallas 2017 it was the other oh is Dallas. Okay, so Dallas like I had just left So I worked at click funnels for like four months And then I was gone I was on my own and that first year was the year that I had to pay my own ticket and I'm like I don't know Like I'm not sure if I want to do this and that was like my decision moment So that's why that sticks. Holy smokes So now and the quote is like, you know, we always talk about I'm I always say like we have a shirt that says like doing your best It's for kids because people will say I'm gonna do my best. I'm like man doing your best is for kids Adults do what's required like that's what it means to be committed You do what is required to get what is desired and so again in our world where people talk about I want to build a funnel And I'm gonna shoot these videos and I'm gonna influence. I'm like you're either doing what's required or you're not but doing your best That's that's the elementary and doing all that you know that don't that don't make it no more Like you have to be a person who can do the necessary required actions to go get the desires that you want Was 2017 the first year you were a funnel hacking live or did you come before? That was actually the first year ever I've been to funnel hacking I got I had 30 minutes on the stage and it was interesting because I was in the inner circle the year before And I got up and spoke, you know, I got up and did what I do like hey, let me get some help and Russell was like You should come speak on the stage. I was like I'd love to and Like I love like Russell no one does it like like I just gotta plug it If there's a conference you go to it's funnel hacky like this man puts on the production He puts on the lights the show the entertainment the wow factor Like you really get to see where he came from and I remember the first funnel hacking because I saw videos of it in Vegas I think it was in Vegas like it's just a room. There was nothing. It was just bunch of people that showed up and And then again, I'm locked the secrets. I want to say was last year which I loved like I love I love giving back to the community So I'm excited to be at funnel hacking here in Orlando man. It's gonna be amazing I can't wait to have you like the last time so To bridge this like Russell is always trying to figure out how to make the game one step better for everybody So if you've ever come before it gets better and better every single year last last year We got a whole new place that we're at over in Orlando and it was Huge and the party was bigger and the base was deeper and like it was it was presented in such a way that was powerful And the minute that that was over he started speaking with everybody and saying how do we one up this? How do we make this bigger and he created this lineup of what he wanted to teach and what if we could do it like this? And what if we could pull from the community people who are doing the thing and Actually have them on stage talk about how to do these things piece by piece and it becomes like a master course No matter where you're at how to grow your business and scale it Massively and how to build it up in today's world where ads can be expensive and like it's just it's more complicated to scale and As he's preparing all this he did the unlocked secrets of it that you mentioned like and that's that's for like coaching customers and mastermind customers and they bring their kids and Russell was talking like whether or not he should he should bring his kids again like is actually gonna be worthwhile and you were on stage and He turned and looked and one of his kids was looking at you and She was so enthralled with everything like she you had 100% of her focus and you could tell like what you were saying was hitting her personally and That moment for Russell meant so much and he was like I Missed a tema we need to tema Okay, we got to work this in how do we get to tema how do we get and it's like it became so important When Russell reached out to you what was it that he said like I want you to talk about This because he always has a plan. No, so I love the frog You know when you see a message from Russell in the DMs I'm like, okay, it's probably his team and he's like sit in my it's Russell. I'm like, okay Are we wrestling or what are we doing? And of course like I'll be real like if Russell reaches out to you. It's a big deal But he is very iconic in our industry in our space and just being an entrepreneur So he invites me to to come speak and I was like I sent a message to my team and I was like, hey it's like I got the call from Russell and What he asked me to talk about was just really what I do and I'll never forget I was in Boise Same thing. He was like, hey, can you come speak to our people? I'm like, what do you want me to talk about and he looks me dead in the eye and he's like You and I both know They need what you talk about Because Russell's he gives everything he gives you the tips the tricks the hacks the blueprints he gives you everything Yeah, but what people lack and this is what I talk about and it's a word that I love It's it's this word I call power like real power How to take what you know and what you know how to do and when and what and why to do it and actually execute and I'm so excited to share that because I know I truly believe Ben in my heart of hearts Everyone coming to funnel hacking a funnel hacker. They have a mission. They got a purpose. They feel strongly They're convicted about their program product or service Sometimes they just don't believe it that their belief is just not there But if they had that belief that power They would actually have the courage to ship their podcast to ship their funnel to get the videos out Because on the other side of that fear there is a client who is desperately waiting For your program. They're waiting for your book. They're waiting for your podcast They're waiting for you whose voice they need to hear not even Russell's not even mine But your voice and they need you to have the courage To go put it out.
