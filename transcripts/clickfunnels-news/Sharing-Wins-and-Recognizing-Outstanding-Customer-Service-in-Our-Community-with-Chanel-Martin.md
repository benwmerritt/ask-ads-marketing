Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm joined by Chanel Martin. Chanel is an award-winning technology founder, business mentor and founder of Beyond the Book Media, where she helps Christian thought leaders create a legacy in income through published books. Using her book writing formula, Chanel has taught thousands how to complete their manuscripts quickly. Welcome Chanel. Thanks for joining me today. Thank you so much for having me. Of course, I have all kinds of questions and I'm really excited to learn more about you. So start by telling me a bit about your background and what brought you to this industry. Oh wow. So I actually have a background in beauty technology. I co-founded a beauty tech company with some ladies I went to Georgia Tech with over 10 years ago called Myavana and in that process we learned how to fundraise because we were bootstrapping and we won tons of awards and I got my base in entrepreneurship there. Then I ended up stepping down as a visible co-founder to pursue ministry honestly and I felt like I had a calling from God to really help entrepreneurs. So one of the first assignments that I did was I wrote an e-book on how to fundraise and there's a funny story behind that. I wrote the e-book because I wanted to buy a couch that my husband would not buy for me and so I had never done info, info, pernure, ship or anything. So I write this e-book on fundraising and people started going crazy. They loved it. Then I turned the e-book into a webinar that I shared often with other entrepreneurs because I realized that because I had a background in tech I had access to a lot of startup accelerator programs and mentorship and there were people in my community that didn't have access to those resources so I started teaching and that's how I developed thought leadership and I started making more money in coaching and consulting even though I wasn't even thinking about that that all kind of came from the book. So then after that book that e-book it was just an e-book I wasn't like oh I'm just gonna write all these books. I felt led to help Christian entrepreneurs pray through their business challenges. So then I hosted a prayer challenge for entrepreneurs for 31 days and then I turned that into a book. So I started this whole challenge model and I was like wait I wrote a whole book in 31 days. So then that was my second book and my first outside of my thesis published the book. So I have this published book and then people started asking me well how did you publish and I was like well I'll show you. So I did a free class teaching people how to self publish their books. So now we have the e-book we have my prayer book that people are still using to this day okay. Then I wanted to write a third book and I was struggling and I said I remember I wrote that last book because I was doing a prayer challenge. What if I get people together and we hold each other accountable and we write our books in like two weeks or three weeks. So I go on my Facebook page I said hey anybody interested in writing a book? They all said yeah I got lots of feedback it's okay I'm gonna start a Facebook page and the group was called Write With Me at the time. So I started this Facebook page where like 50 people then before you know it it's 300 people and we're doing our first writing challenge and it was to finish your book in three weeks. I never finished my book but everyone else finished their book. I ended up managing this group because they had so many questions and long story short people started finishing their books in seven days, 14 days, 21 days and they asked me they said who's gonna publish and I started looking for peak publishers. I'm like well I'll bring publishers so I sold ad spots in my group for publishers to come in and pitch their products. Well one day I really felt there that the Lord had gave me this group and so I said what if I'm supposed to be publishing their books? So I had people that were begging me they didn't want to go to any of the other people. They wanted to pay me and I was like okay so I created Beyond the Book Media and that is how we started publishing books. We have been doing the challenge model every quarter except 2020 I was pregnant so we missed two we missed two quarters when I had my baby but we've been doing it every single quarter since 2019 and we host regular challenges every quarter to get people excited and pumped and finishing their books and that's really my founder story. Wow what a robust background and I love that you got to where you are by doing things and realizing other people need this. I can help other people and offering that value before realizing there's a product here there's a service here. It's really cool so what was it that brought you to ClickFunnels? Okay so of course in my transition of understanding info pernurship you know you start watching all the gurus everyone's on ClickFunnels and I would be honest I was a little overwhelmed at first this year we're talking 2018 2019 I tried to get on the platform I got overwhelmed I ended up trying out another platform and sticking with them you know I don't want to call it a bad relationship but I just was so used to them so I stayed on that platform and I kept dipping my toe into the whole ClickFunnels the whole ClickFunnels pool right I was like oh I'm gonna try it we started having issues conversion issues it was just other minor things that stem beyond your basic tech issues right you're gonna have any technical problems with any software and finally I just really felt led I said you know what I really want to scale my business and I believe that ClickFunnels is going to be the platform and and then everyone was telling me I need to switch every time I would have an outage or or or some sort of issue in my I'm in a business mastermind they're like you need to go to ClickFunnels everyone in there is in ClickFunnels they all go to the the the funnel hacker conference and it's a lot to change software oh like it's a big deal oh it is so I was just like so then finally I said you know what I'm gonna change I really felt led I really felt like God was telling me if I'm being completely honest I really felt called to go to ClickFunnels and that probably sounds crazy but I'm a woman of faith and I do everything by faith so I said you know what I'm just gonna make this switch and I ended up going going over there and I realized that you guys had your new platform which is 2.0 which I believe solved a lot of my frustrations or confusion issues that I had with the original platform because I didn't feel like having to plug in all these different things and the integrations no longer needed yeah I didn't have to do all those integrations so I said okay so I signed up and we've been figuring it out and we're starting a migration process and I've already started making money and I'm excited to see what I can do on the platform yes very exciting and I wanted to talk to you today because I saw a post in the community about after one week with your funnel live so I'm interested in learning a little bit more about that so tell me of your your products and the things that you've been doing what did you do with this funnel and how did you find success with it oh wow so um I'm a I'm in what people would call a contributor so I love to share my wings and share for other people because I know sometimes you feel like you're on an island by yourself and you're the only one struggling right because everyone today is an expert so I was in there if you go search you'll see my post like uh how do I do can you do I was so confused at first and guys I'm at the community's four exactly but I said you know what I'm gonna ask I do want to mention side note you guys have the best customer service okay I was struggling and one of your customer service representatives dropped on a google meet with me and walked me through one of my challenges I've never had that I said oh yeah I'm sold for life like I've never been able to get on the phone with any of these other software providers or anything I'm just like trying to figure it out in email and sometimes the messaging system email isn't enough so I just wanted to say that amazing we I was doing one of my challenges and I was launching a new program which is a monthly subscription to a virtual writing space and I've been doing a virtual writing boot camps for years um we were doing them in the 21 day model like that that I wrote my book and I really felt like we kind of outgrown that model and with the economy I wanted something just a slightly um uh lower end on the lower end scale something that's like a no-brainer right um and then potentially putting them into a hire ticket offer so I came up with the writing room and it is a monthly subscription I wrote it out to a small group of people and they seemed to like and I said okay I'm gonna I'm gonna try to roll this out to uh my audience and so I pitched it to them we did it we did a free challenge my upsell was for them to join our 97 dollar a month uh virtual writing space it was the first time we offered it and then the people signed up and I had to I had to I had to explain how to create my first channel now you guys are watching this it was it can be a little overwhelming and I'm not going to tell you guys that it was the easiest thing for me I'm going to say for me um I did have to rely on the amazing customer support I did make some mistakes um but I was really determined to power through I said you know what I'm going to figure it can't be that I'm all chemical I used to be a chemical engineer I said oh chemical engineer I can figure this thing out and so I launched it and then we were able in one week to capture our first five figures um using uh the the click funnel software and I'm like okay I can get used to this so in the process of migrating some of our higher ticket we have a conference we're getting ready to do in K-Koon I'm I'm I'm launching another uh subscription for authors in the literally today in the next uh week so that's what we're doing oh my goodness that's so exciting and I'm I was so inspired by your post and I hope more people are seeing that and at least checking that out um because you dropped in there what you made in that first week and it was so fascinating and exciting you have so many products and services that I'm sure you're already thinking of you know different funnels that you can do and how you can find success with those and I just I think that's really inspiring and I know a lot of people in the community who haven't yet pulled the trigger on launching their first funnel are probably thinking like wow like this is one week like let me bring this to the finish line let me do it and done is better than perfect like not everything is gonna be perfect maybe you're not gonna know the technology but like it is worth putting your stuff out there because people want it yes yeah that's amazing I'm so inspired by that so thank you for sharing that um so what goals would you say that you have with this business and what you've done so far with click funnels um over the next few years what do you plan to do oh absolutely so I of course I want one of those awards to jog you about yes I want I want one of those awards I'm just gonna already claim mine you know what after your first week I can already see that happening very soon exactly exactly yes I want I want one of those awards um and I really love the customization of click funnels and how you can make it look and do what you needed to do and we're not in a box I think some of these other platforms while they may be easy for you to start up I am an out-of-the-box thinker so I usually find a way Laura to break a platform I usually find some sort of feature and not because you're still building on it I know that click funnels 2.0 there are so many new things that you guys are still building on it but because I'm like they should do this yeah and my husband is a web application engineer and data scientist and he can build anything and so I'm like talking to him I'm like why can't I have you know this this this isn't this and then he looks who's like oh it doesn't let you do that and so having that kind of background and understanding that you can make something be whatever you want it to be if you have the right tools that is that is I feel like click funnels allows us to do that from a customization now am I there yet absolutely not I am getting the hang of funnels and automations but I did figure out how to integrate it with what I'm already using so what I did Laura was I have a WordPress site and I just created the funnel link to as and put it in a button and so they went to my WordPress site because I was like wait a minute I don't know how to make this pretty yet I stick with what I have and then it clicked to I did the checkout funnel where I just put the checkout and thank you page and that's where I got my start and I and I came up with that Laura honestly was because I was trying to do the build the landing page and make it pretty and it just wasn't getting what I needed to give I sell hold up now I'm overthinking this let me get to the money and so Laura if I were to give anyone any advice figure out the fastest way you can get to the money and then you can optimize on top of that and I think that's where a lot of people get stuck they want everything pretty and perfect instead of realizing like okay if you have people that are ready to buy from you they don't hey they're probably not even reading any of that amazing yeah I think that's actually really great advice and it brings up a point that a lot of us talk about internally at ClickFunnels and that is there shouldn't necessarily be this this point where you're you're kind of like in a roadblock of do I move to ClickFunnels 2.0 do I use ClickFunnels at all because I already have a website that I love and that's okay like you don't need to change you don't need to create a funnel hub or a brand new website you're you're able to we have that capability however you can keep your beautiful website elsewhere and still use ClickFunnels for all of the things that are going to drive people to that sale at the end and I think that that's what's really important for people to know is that if you have a site that you're in love with you don't you don't need to change it you don't need to move that over ClickFunnels is a great addition for all of those extra things that actually guide your customer to the sale without having to change your website it's just if you need generate leads if you need to sell an ebook if you need to create a continuity offer or program or a community like those are the things that you can use in addition to a beautiful website that you already have which I think is really cool yeah now you already gave us a fantastic piece of advice I want to ask you one last thing and that's where can people go to learn more about you and your business of course though if you are an author and the spying author you can go to beyond the book of media dot com and what we do is we work with brands influencers and thought leaders so those of you that want to build an info preneur empire and you want to start it with the book and publishing books even though it may seem a little archaic with ebooks it is still the oldest and most convincing form of media that you can have and so it's not going anywhere and a lot of people have successfully launched businesses like me using using published books and it really does stamp you as an expert and so we want to work with those of you who are who are who are looking to transition into thought leadership expert coaching consulting or you want a way to connect with your community at a greater deeper level and you can do that with a book so if you're like I don't have a book yet join the writing room you can learn information about that on our website it is where we keep you accountable and coach you through writing your book if you already have a book or if you have multiple books we're launching a new program called Publishing Pro in which you pay a monthly subscription and you can publish a book every 90 days and it covers everything that you need from book publishing so we've literally got you covered for your first or your 50th book amazing I love that and I I've always thought a book whether it's an ebook or a physical book is really the best type of business card that you can give somebody absolutely it really does position you as an expert and you have all of the products and services to help everybody from all over the spectrum in terms of creating that authority in their industry and I think that's really cool so congratulations on your business I look forward to seeing all of your success and hopefully seeing you walk across the state funnel hacking live very soon so they collect that two comma club award. Exactly period. Thanks so much to Nala it's great to talk to you today have a good one. All right thank you for having me.
