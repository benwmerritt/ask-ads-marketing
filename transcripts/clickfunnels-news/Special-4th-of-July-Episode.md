This is going to be a loaded episode. You guys ready? It really is. And so because we haven't talked for a while, there's a lot of stuff that we wanted to load in here. We wanted to give something away and we wanted to be able to talk and just celebrate with you as well. So we're going to just do all the madness. Let us know how you guys are enjoying it. Let us know in the comments that you guys are here. We're so excited to get moving. Susan, why don't we do a giveaway? Let's give away something. Okay, trivia question for today. And if you get the answer right, put it in the comments. You are going to win the lovely new ClickFunnels beach towel, which is awesome. I want one. It's brand new. So last week, Russell had a PLR webinar. The question today is what does PLR stand for? This was like the question of the webinar. Everybody was jumping in and asking, what does PLR mean? So what does it mean? Is it A, public library repository? B, private label rights? C, patriotic liberty rejoicing? Or D, proudly lighting rockets? Let us know your answer down in the comments. And you could win a beach towel. So we'll bring that up throughout the episode. And then we'll announce the answer at the end of this episode. And then we'll announce the winner after we're done. Absolutely. And we're seeing your guys this number. Christopher, I see you coming in. Wayne, I see you coming in. Lisa, Tommy, this is awesome. Wonderful to have you guys. Thanks for being here. Danny, yo, yo, yo. What is up? Shirley, good morning from British Columbia, Canada. It's wonderful to have you guys. So 4th of July is basically a United States celebration. It's our celebration for the Revolutionary War and the Declaration of Independence and all the things that happened therein. So Susan, we need to try to take an opportunity to be able to talk about something that's important to us as we kick everything off. And Susan's like, I don't want today. Okay. I was like, yeah, I was on Vox. I'm like, Ben, I want the monologue today. I have things to say just because this is an awesome holiday and I wanna kind of tie it into something that means something to everyone, whether you are American or not, or you live here or you don't. And the essence of Independence Day was the birth of certain principles and ideas. And those have grown beyond the borders of our country. And those ideas are that everyone can have, they've been given the, creators given them the endowed rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, right? And so I think, this was a thought that came to me this morning was, the world of entrepreneurship, the world of like what we are all doing, pursuing a business, pursuing that success, we have these principles kind of just in us to even become an entrepreneur to begin with. Like I think that we have to like have a certain level of belief in those things of like, yes, like I want the freedom to be able to live my life the way that I wanna live it according to my own terms. And I wanna pursue happiness and whatever that means for me and have that freedom and whatever that means for me. And entrepreneurship is also those things. It's not just an American idea anymore, it has grown bigger than that because, yes, it was kind of the birthplace of defining that, but even like America didn't create those ideas, right? They just got written into a document and were adopted into the culture. And I think that also ClickFunnels here is a tool to help us be able to do that, is making it so much easier for us to go and create a business and get our message and our ideas and our expertise out there and share it with the world. And not only to help us be able to live the life that we wanna live and pursue that happiness, but we can help others to do that too. And so I'm just so proud to be part of a community outside, yes, America, but outside, it's bigger than that, of this culture of being a funnel hacker where we wanna help people, we wanna live that life, we wanna have that freedom to have a business and do what we wanna do with it and help people. So that is what it means to me. It's funny, like you look at the Declaration of Independence, I had to Google it really quick because it's me. And it says, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. That's something we strive to realize and strive to live every single day. That each person is endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And funnel hackers, that's what we do. We're trying to live a full and happy life. We're trying to give and we find that learning and growing ourselves and then helping others grow is what provides that happiness. And so being able to do that louder and broader is absolutely wonderful. So everybody happy 4th of July. We're so excited to have you guys here. I wanted to do something really quick too. So in the past, if you guys know what funnel hacker TV used to be, Russell used to do funnel hacker TV and he did it over three years and there were something like 200 plus episodes. And for three years, he covered funnel hacker, he covered 4th of July. And the very first year that he did it, he did a firework war. Now look, there's giant disclaimer on this. This is not something that you do. This is not something that you just jump out and run and have a great time doing, okay? So be very, very, very careful doing this. But they would do a firework war. And he did a whole episode talking about how they set it up, what the process was, whose idea it was, what it all did and kind of like what it represented. So it was a fun episode, it was really been cool. I'm gonna give you guys the titles to these. If you guys are bored today and you wanna be able to watch some fireworks a little early, this is a way to do it. So this is one of the episodes. This was six years ago, which is absolutely weird that they did their firework war. AKA disclaimer, this is unsafe, have professionals around. But, he talks to you about like their journey in order to make sure that it was 100% safe. And so like there's a world to discover around all this. But the next year, it was a celebration with family. And so he gathered the family around and you will see Jesse, which is his quintessential always in the Funnel Hacker TV days of old. He was always on the calls with Russell. He was always there. So you guys are able to see those moments with Jesse. There we go. Captain America's shirt. Love it, yeah, we can see it. Okay, cool. And so you're able to see like him celebrate with family and what that means is including the bubble ball, snowman, like they just played with everything. And you're able to watch their firework shows. It's just a really nice, fun experience. So really quick, what I wanted to do is if you guys want to celebrate with us and be able to go back in time, this is where you go. So on YouTube, let me go ahead and share my screen really quick. On YouTube, there are three episodes. The first one is called Firework War Warning. Don't try this at home, okay? It's episode four of the feature films. So it's just absolutely a lot of fun. And he's talking about all the injuries that they got to your previous, I think you can see a little bit on his neck. Yep. And then the one where it's with Jesse and they're all celebrating as a family is this one. This is actually like the opener for today. If you guys joined us as we open Funnel Hacker TV, it's just a lot of fun to be able to go back and kind of see the history of it. And it's fun because you get to see faces that used to be a part of this all the time. Then you've got this last one, which is, here's to the crazy ones, Fireworks Awards and Giving Back. And it's Russell getting the award for Entrepreneur of the Year at the same time as celebrating Fourth of July. And so really, really, really cool stuff. We just want you to be able to have an enjoyable time this Fourth of July. If we can be a part of that, that's great. There's gonna be hearts that if you guys have been in the community for a while, it'll pull on your heartstrings and you'll just be able to enjoy. So I wanted to be able to share that with you guys. If you guys want to walk down Memory Lane with us, Memory Lane is there. You can jump through and have an absolute good time. We'd love to see you guys there. Really quick, Dan Hibbs asking, Susan, where did you get your shirt? I got it at a Funnel Hacking Live event. What? I don't even know if they make these anymore. Hopefully they bring it back. I think that I had to ask somebody to get it for me because they were running out. And I was like, please find one in the back somewhere for me. Because I love it. Built on the hook, story and an offer. Absolutely. All right. So Fourth of July, we love having you here. We appreciate you guys. Couple of things. Let's just talk about what's happened recently. Let's talk about what's happened recently and kind of get you guys ready for what's coming. So one of our best performing episodes ever was when you guys wanted us to go live randomly for the groundbreaking, which was really cool. So we went live for the groundbreaking. We were able to show you guys just kind of the behind the scenes of what's going on. Russell posted this on Instagram. So if you guys wanted to see the behind the scenes, you can. And this is like Russell talking through everything that we did piece by piece, how it all went. You're able to see where we broke ground, which is right there. And you're able to kind of experience this with us. And so really crazy stuff, but you guys really enjoyed that. And it was really cool for us. Right after we got done recording our video together, we ran outside and we were the last, like Russell was just standing there. And he's like, I think we're done. We're like, no. We're like running down, trying not to fall down. And we got to get our pictures with Russell. And so we got to break ground with Russell as well. And it was absolutely cool. And so, oh, hey, Susan, you're in the video too. It feels me. It feels me. And so it's just looking back on that has been really, really cool for what it represents. And it was a really cool episode. So first we wanted to thank you guys for watching. And we'll keep sending you really cool stuff. Let us know if you want to see anything really, really cool. Christina Cabral got PLR. We're going to talk about what that is in a minute. We'll get there. But yeah, there's some really, really cool stuff. Did you, is there anything still lingering from that for you? Because it was cool. From the groundbreaking. Yeah. So when you and I went live, the event wasn't even over yet. So we haven't even talked about what happened after you and I went live. We didn't! That was just during the actual literal groundbreaking of the shovels. And then, yeah, like Ben said, like we were doing that while everyone was standing in line because we put ourselves at the back of the line. And I was like, hey, why don't we just go over and inside and do a live real quick and then we'll run back out. And then my time we ran back out. They're like, OK, we're done. We're like, no, wait, we haven't done it yet. And so hopefully we see that picture someday. But then after that, let's see, there was dinner. But then there was a speaker. There was a speaker at the end of the night who was Joe Vitale. And he was awesome. People keep asking me still. Like, what was it like to see him speak? What did he talk about? And I took pictures of every single slide. He had this whole presentation put together. He basically put together a presentation of all of the books that he would recommend people to read, even though some of the books on his list you can't even get. Like, you can't make this. And he was like, Russell asked me to make this presentation after he took all my books. Yes. So he doesn't even have some of these books anymore. But what I thought was really cool is it wasn't just like, here's books that I think everyone should read or learn from. But it was he tied lessons into each of them of like, here's this book. And here is the lesson that I got from this book. And so he tied it into all these lessons. And I forgot how many lessons there were. There were at least a dozen of them. And man, it was so good. It was so good. And like, it makes me excited because Joe Vitale is speaking Fumble Hacking Live. And so like, for us, it was almost a preview of the greatness of Joe Vitale. If you've not known, like, Joe Vitale has 100 books that he has written that's out there. Like, this is a prolific individual if you've ever seen The Secret. Joe Vitale is on The Secret. Like, Joe Vitale is a student of history. He absolutely loves hypnosis, absolutely loves it. He's actually got like an award for the Hypnosis Association. It was really cool going through the library and like, oh my gosh, look at that. But there's a whole room that's like the Joe Vitale room because it's all hypnosis. And it was really cool to be able to see this because it wasn't just the lessons. Because like, for each lesson, he had like four or five books. And every time he was like, do you know this book? Do you know this book? And you're trying to write them down as fast as possible because they're so good. One of the crazy things though was like, he would ask, okay, have you guys heard of this book? And the room was just like dead silent. No hands going up, except for maybe a couple of the books. He's like, wow, like nobody's ever heard of these books before. He's like, this is perfect. So he was naming books that like people in the room. And these are people that are very successful people that were able to pay to be in the room, hadn't even heard of her read. So what an amazing collection. Absolutely. One of the take away, one of the feelings that I took away from after he spoke was, I just want to read. I just want to like, live my life reading all the books. Like that was what I walked away from of like, man, I really need to read more. I really need to be a student and all these books. But then I also had the thought of like, then I need to learn how to read faster because there's so many books that I need to read. Each one had like this powerhouse lesson. He was like, this is the book where you learn this. And he'd pull out the quote. He was like, it teaches a whole bunch more than that. But this is that piece. And he probably went over at least 30 books. Yeah. Like this was not like, oh, and this is one book. That is like 13 lessons and each had a minimum of like three. It was crazy spectacular. And it was really powerful. And so I can't wait for the library. Yes. I can't wait for it. We can actually access these books that are so rare that we probably couldn't even find them if we wanted to go read them. Part of me hopes that like, whatever he creates as the Mifki and all of his, all the systems for secrets of success in library, it contains a way to be able to access those books because I want to be able to watch the Joe Vitale presentation and be like, ah, these are the books that are like the beginning of this matter for me. And this is where I learned these principles. And oh, I need that in my life. And I can like, it's a my beginner guide from Joe and it was really, really, really cool. So there's some cool stuff coming guys. Before Funnel Hacking Live, there's amazing stuff coming at Funnel Hacking Live. I'm literally salivating. I want to tell you guys all the things so grand, but I'm not allowed to. So there is amazingness to come. Joe Vitale at Funnel Hacking Live. That is right. That's gonna be crazy. Before we move on, so we have like a few more things that we want to talk to you guys about. Let's bring up the trivia question real quick because someone's asking like, what's the B for? The comments, people are typing. So, and then we're gonna be talking about this next is the PLR webinar. So what does PLR stand for? Is it a public library repository, B, private label rights, C, patriotic liberty, for joicing or D, probably lighting rockets, which we've seen in videos that we've covered so far. It's D. D, Russell would say D in if he was in one of those other videos. So put your answer into the comments. You could win a Click Funnels Beach Towel and we will reveal the answer at the end here in just a few minutes. So. I want to give you stuff. We have a couple of new stuff that's new just for the summer. Camp Promise is gonna be around forever, but if you want a Click Funnels Beach Towel and have one of the first people to be able to get it, let us know what your answer is down below to the trivia for sure. Let's talk about last week. Officially the doors have closed on this offer and so this is FOMO, pure FOMO. If you guys were not paying attention, I absolutely love you. If you weren't paying attention, you know exactly what it is. Christina, you know exactly what it is. Let's talk about the PLR webinar for a moment. Last week, Russell had the PLR webinar and he brought on Sheria and Paul and they talked about how they have 52 funnels that are pre-made for different niches and different products and the products are built and all these different things, what it is, how it works, and you can understand the process of what PLR is and how you use it. And it was an epic webinar. What were your thoughts? Like the entire time I was just drooling. It was awesome. It was a little, it was like a webinar, obviously a webinar, like the typical things got put into the webinar, but they also had a little bit of a twist on it because they were giving like, here's how you can use PLR. Here's another way you can use PLR. Here's another idea you can use PLR. Here's another idea. And I was like eating it up. I'm like, oh, I'm getting so many ideas. Like I didn't even know that I wanted PLR in my business, but now I have so many ideas. And then the crazy part was like PLR wasn't like, this is the one product that you need. They're like, this could be bonus products. This could be add-on products. This could be, you know, how you win affiliate competitions is adding all of these things in. Like there were so many different ideas. It's like, of course you need this. And the offer just got better and better. Like, so Russell was like pinging me and he's like, Ben, you're not gonna believe this offer. What did you think when the offer was dropping? Oh my gosh, I was ready for it to be like five figures, at least. And I'm like, there's no way I'm gonna be able to like, put money down on this today. Like there's no way I'm gonna buy this. And then it wasn't, it was crazy. It wasn't even the typical 997 offer that we see, you know, the, it's almost cliche now, like, oh, 997. It wasn't even that much. And I was like, okay, you've like, if you're on here and you understand what this can do for your business, like there is no reason not to like give Russell money now. He needs to buy this thing. Like, and the crazy thing to me was like, so he, they built out this PLR piece, which is private label rights. Yeah. They talked through this. And yeah, the offer was absolutely incredible Lauren. It's like, I was just like credit card, credit card. Russell is now telling me like, before he does a webinar, is I'd go find your credit card then or hide it. Hide it, go bury it in the ground. And like, like the week up to it, Russell's like, you know, we could throw in this when I did this back in the day. Or, you know, if you remember that one place, they're like, oh, I remember that. It'd be so cool if we could do that. Well, let me reach out to them. It was like the stories they told on the webinar were 100% real. And like at the end, it was not 52 PLR webinars. This was like the get started kit for all businesses. And I got started with PLR. Like I remember buying PLR and going and rerecording all the courses and rebranding it. And that was like the first time I learned how to do courses and how to do videos. And I became comfortable with my own voice and listening to it over and over. Like PLR was the introduction. And so the offer was available. If you guys got it, congratulations. It closed last night. And so real FOMO. But wanted to talk about it because it was such a good offer. And this should be something that's fun. When you're like number one funnel hack the process. When you guys are creating your offers, when you're playing with all this stuff, have fun with it. This should be something that you should just light you up and you get someone on a call. What was the thing that I could add that would make this really, really cool? Oh, what if we did this? Have fun with the offer. Adding all the bonuses and stuff afterwards is great. Get the core piece, a couple of bonuses, and then create the bonus offer as you're creating the webinar, as you're creating this. You'll always notice that Russell always announces the webinar. And then he publishes during the week about creating the webinar. And he's creating it. And he's creating all the different pieces and making sure it all works. And like they're staying up late nights, it creates the attention. And so look at that as a blueprint as you go and do yours. Because Fennelheiser process, it is absolutely welcome Fennelheiser. I think I'm gonna go and do that this week. PLR fun. Dockman yourself creating the event. Russell, you're making me wanna do nothing, but create offers and pitch. This is bad. He's like, oh, it'll be fine. I'm like, no, it's not. It's just real. I think for bringing it to Lynchpin for a moment, if you notice, all of, so there's been a lot of launches recently, a lot of events happening. And everyone that is directly click funnels related, the strategy is the same. Every single one of the funnels, it's a free event. And then it's a VIP upgrade for free if you do a 30 day trial of click funnels. And I think that that's just, it's cool to see that, I mean, that's a testament to the strategy, first of all, if they keep doing it over and over, it must be working, right? And then it's always the same core offer. Everything comes back to like, we just need to get people using click funnels. And so whatever that is in your business, whatever the thing is in your business that you're like, I just need everybody to use this or get this offer. And then there's a bunch of different hooks and other offers out there, dramatic demonstrations that are bringing them into that offer. Now, Russell has the team and the resources to be doing so much, but I think that you don't see him doing a webinar and then selling something totally different and then doing another webinar and selling something totally, like it's all coming back to click funnels, right? For the directly related click funnels things. We're talking more about that at Funnel Hacking Live, if you want like the details, like Mastermind and Paradise, Russell went over like the stats of how this works. The Lynch pin stats for this one were spectacular and I cannot wait to be able to report on it or to let Russell report on it because collecting and letting him report is just so much fun. But like making that a thing and letting you guys know, this is the process, this is why it works and show you proof time after time, business after business, process after process, that's why Funnel Hacking Live is gonna be a blast. So if you guys don't have tickets, you should at FunnelHackingLive.com. And we've been talking a lot about Funnel Hacking Live, we're gonna continue to. All the rest of this week is Funnel Hacking Live, all of next week is Funnel Hacking Live. We're bringing on the speakers, the people you wanna talk to and so there's some really cool stuff. If you guys wanna get those notifications, make sure that you're putting in your details. But because we're doing all that, we haven't really talked about the regular stuff. Like for example, user spotlights. And I wanted to be able to just show you guys really quick like there's user spotlights and things that are still going on just cause we don't talk about it, does not mean it does not exist because it is still very much an active thing. So if you guys are not watching the user spotlights on YouTube, should definitely go check it out. So Laura is interviewing people every single week. And it is a user spotlight, just a regular user. Sometimes they're a two comic club winner, sometimes they're a dream car winner, sometimes they're somebody who's in the Funnel Builder program, someone who just got some success, everybody loved on Facebook and we're bringing them forward. So today, this last week, we dropped Camilla Markson. And so we talked about Camilla and Camilla came on and talked about her story, how she was able to go from digital marketer and coach and be able to use ClickFunnels and how she loves ClickFunnels. And so you guys are able to see these. If you guys are not taking all of these in, make sure that you are going to ClickFunnels Facebook or YouTube channel. There are so many of these already. And they are, if you just need to know that you're not alone, the Funnel Hacker community is real. We are all active, we're here with you and you wanna know, this is proof in the pudding. Come to the community, come here, that's why it's built for you. This is available for you. So good. All right. Can I talk 2.0 updates really quick? Are you guys okay if we have time for this? I wanna talk really quick about 2.0 stuff because we haven't had to pulse in a while, we haven't had a couple things going on and I'm talking to devs more and more often about what's coming down the pipeline and I'm freaking out. But like in a lot of these things, just so you know, like a lot of the developments that we're doing right now are leading up to events that are coming. So what you need to do is make sure that you're paying attention. So really quick, let me share, oops, I totally got rid of this. Let me share with you just a couple of updates that are going on in 2.0 because they be some good stuff. The first one is tagging. So right now you're able to see your tags next to the customer and you're able to add them much, much easier. So tagging in 2.0 just got ridiculously easy. As you guys know, in QuickFunnels 2.0, we don't have lists, it is all run by tags. And so when we send an email out to everybody who has subscribed to Funnel Hacker TV, we're going according to the tag that is created when somebody opts in. Yeah, that's how we do it. So it's all tagged to base. Now you can search for tags. You can see the tags next to the lead. You can go ahead and add them super, super easy. All that process has been updated. It is far easier, far simpler. And now you can add, you can do even more of a tag. So tagging is there, it's working great and is available for you. So use it. Use it. It will save you so much heartache and headache if you just use the tags. Couple of other things. There are some things that block you from using QuickFunnels and building out a funnel. And one of those things have been images. You have copy, you have images. If you guys have your tickets to Funnel Hacking Live, you also have the AI system inside of QuickFunnels, which will help you generate images and write copy for you that's there for you. But if you're just a regular QuickFunnels user and you wanna be able to add images, we just added a new software called FreePick. And so when you go to add image, just on the left-hand side, you will see there's a whole bunch of places that you can import from now. You don't have to go to a different site in order to find these. You can find them inside of QuickFunnels and say, yes, import this into my library. And you can have that automatically inside of there. And so the newest one is FreePick. We're just adding a whole bunch of these. And like our tool sets just getting better for you so that we can make this work better for you. One last thing. Style guides. How many of us have tried to build a page and it reverts to our style guide? And we're like, oh, this looks ugly. What if you can choose your style guide when you're building the page? Yay. Did you catch that? So like I can see, you know what? The page has its own style guide. I just wanna use that style guide for now. Or I have my style guide or there's a specific style guide for the funnel. When you're building out your pages now, there's this new menu item right here. You click on that, you're able to choose your style guide when you're building the page. You can also change the style guide afterwards. We've talked about that a couple of times. If you guys are ever stuck, there's lots of help and support available. Just go to the very top of ClickFunnels when you're in the main menu and you're able to search for anything. I can search for all my contacts. I can search for my tags. I can search for help on any topic right there. But we did make that a lot easier for you guys. So congratulations, that's available to you now. And it is awesome sauce. And just one little thing, cause I'm a nerd. Does anybody here use Giru? Giru is one of the softwares that Russell loves. If you guys are in the Fundamentalist Certification, you guys have a special bonus with Giru. I had Giru way before Russell got it. And there's always been a thing that irked me. It just bothered the ever-living Tora to me and it's fixed. I don't wanna highlight it just because it's been moot. All right, so I'm a nerd. So it's awesome because, and I'm so glad that he owns this company now because this one and there's another company and it's just like, it never was quite right. Like, I like this, I like the idea of it, but like it's limiting in what I can do. And yes, they fixed it. So yay, show them. Okay, so check this out. So if you guys have ever used Giru before, you're able to map out a full funnel here. You're able to forecast it, add on my products. It's a ridiculously cool software. But if you were trying to create a product and sell it and you added an order form to the page, it would throw an error. Nope, you need a sales page with your order form. And it was like, why? Why do I need it? And so like, for example, if I grab a sales page over, it brings both pages over. And I'm like, no, I just wanna be able to do it. And you had to create the product here and do it here. Even if I'm selling the product on one page, it would have an issue. We'll check this out. I'm gonna delete this and just double click on sales page. Okay, new settings here. Number one, you can add multiple products. That's been there before. And I can split the orders between those products, which is cool. But now I can say, is this a single page order form? Yes. And if it is, is it a one step order form? Or is it a two step order form? Ooh, it's a two step order form. Slick. I can say, you know what? The sales conversion on this is going to be, let's see, it's a book funnel. So I'm providing my physical book. So let's say my conversion rate is 6.5. That's really good conversion rate. And then let's say I want an order bump. Did you see this? It's an order bump. Yes. I've been dying for this. And so now I can say, you know what? It's my $37 audio book and we're gonna convert at 18%. That's pretty good rate as well. And I can save that. And bada-bing, bada-boom. You can see the two step image right here. I wonder what it looks like with a one step. I didn't even look. I wanna go and see. Does it change the image? Oh, it does. It just does the, oh, that's cool. I like it. But at the same time, it helps for your customers. So if you're building this out for yourself, it's nice. If you have customers, being able to show them there's a two step order form, it's a sales page, and it orders on the page is just so much more helpful. It cleans up your forecasting massively, and it's just all nerd out, just absolutely cool. So I wanted to freak out about that. There's other stuff that's being updated. If you're a tune lead user, now like so many cool things going on. Awesome. AKA all the boats are being steered in the right direction. And it is absolutely cool to be able to see. So if you guys are using click funnels and you're actively using it, we're updating it. If you're using Giru, we're updating it. Vroomly, tunely, doodly, all the stuff is being updated. And there's just some really cool stuff for you guys. So congratulations. And not only being updated, but all being updated with the strategic frameworks and everything in mind of what Russell teaches. So those things were awesome, separate, but now they're gonna be even more awesome because the things that we're missing in each of them to make it work for the strategies we're using, the tactics we're using, they're building it. They're making it happen. Cause Russell needs it to happen cause he's using this stuff too. Yes. And he's like, it should do that. Why doesn't it do that? And so yeah, things are being cleaned up. Things are being clarified, simplified. There's magic happening behind the scenes. And as it keeps coming out, we'll highlight as much as we can. If you guys want funnel builds, if you want walkthroughs, you let us know what you guys want. We'll see what we can do here. But for the first little, for the next little while we're doing funnel hiking live. So this one was a little long cause we had so much to catch up on.

Enjoy the holiday if you're celebrating today and go make some sales if you're not. We'll see you guys next time. See you guys next time. My name is Russell Brugson. And I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started. And we don't even have gold to go public either. In fact, our motivation is the exact opposite. You see, we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands, people with literally unlimited budgets, we have to do things differently. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happening every single day. And it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you, it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you, who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own little way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
