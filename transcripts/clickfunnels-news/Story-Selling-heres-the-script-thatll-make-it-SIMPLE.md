much fun so anyway I'm pumped for you guys and excited to uh for all the fun things are happening so um today we are talking about story selling how many guys um you have a product or service to sell and you're like I don't want to sell I don't like sales sales is scary for me I feel nervous I don't really like it as much but you know you have to sell a product you're like I just don't know about selling I feel uncomfortable you feel uncomfortable be like yes I feel uncomfortable selling or thinking about selling or doing selling okay those are my uncomfortable people let me know how many other side you're like I love to sell something I was born to be a salesperson like this is all I want to do is I want to sell stuff all day long every single day it's gonna be the coolest thing in the world because I love selling things I know selling is serving and if I sell something to somebody I can actually change life how many guys are on that side you're like I love selling so we've got the we've got a little bit of both sides of it looks like we got those guys who are amazing you love to sell something that they hate selling and you got a bunch of guys in the middle so we're all over the place um I was the same way okay you guys saw my old videos from the smaller lives of a while ago like I was awkward I was nervous I was shy the thought of selling was horrible for me um and and I didn't want to do it but I love telling stories I never I never put those two things together until one day I was hanging out with my buddy Dagan Smith which by the way if you read expert secrets and you open to the very intro of this I dedicate the book to Dagan Smith Dagan was the one who and I was in a dark time in my career and I wanted to quit and he got me cited and we literally spent like day like hours and hours on the phone for multiple days talking about stories selling and he got me refired up about it and so I started tweaking how I was doing things and shifting from like me being a salesman to me telling stories now I'm still kind of a salesman I like to sell um now but I do it through story if you notice if you've gone through my perfect webinar training or any expert secrets book you notice that when I'm selling it's 100 based on story selling initially that's how we do this whole thing right we're telling stories we're even things together in a way that gets people to move the goal of the story is to figure out what's somebody's false beliefs that they have and how we break that false belief and then from there how do we replace it with with the correct belief the belief they need to have to actually move through things and the only way to do that effectively is through story because story story goes beyond the conscious mind into the subconscious right you're communicating subconsciously to your audience in a way you can't consciously explain things right um and so story is power I could I could geek out for like three days and why story is so powerful but today um what I want to focus on actually like how to tell stories correctly in a really cool way so that's kind of the game plan um so with that said um the first thing to pop up so if you've got the expert secrets book with you um we're gonna talk about the epiphany bridge story um so that do you have the hard bound uh ben got me all the the link so if you go if you're the hard bound uh um the new book basically starts on page 155 is where I show the epiphany bridge script right here boom if you're on the if you're on the softbound the initial book it's on page 91 but I think we get uh are we able to throw that image up real quick ben so this is the core the the initial concept called the epiphany bridge yeah so you guys have probably seen this doodle before um and I'll explain this really quick and then from here I'm going to watch you this presentation I'm going to give you a really cool assignment and the winner of this assignment is going to get a really cool gift um which I tell them the gift is yet ah I'm actually wearing the gift right now I'll I'll show you I'll show you in a minute okay there there's the hook I'll teach you and show you here a second first I'll explain what epiphany bridge is so the way that most people try to sell they sell incorrectly is when they try to sell something they try to sell logically right so if you look at the person here on the right hand side it says logic right what happens for most of you guys is there's something that happened in your life they got you excited about the thing that you geek out about right for me I remember I got excited about wrestling I got excited about funnels like something happened I had this epiphany where I was like I'm a funnel builder I want to build funnels for the rest of my life or I decided when I got into wrestling I wanted to be a wrestler and I became obsessed with it right and if something happened right this epiphany where I was like I am a wrestler for the rest of my life I had this identity shift right and most of you guys have had that in the thing that you're most passionate about right but the problem is like you have this emotional experience you go on this journey and then you logically like convince yourself why this is the greatest thing in the world you can do right and then us in our brains we have all these logical explanations like why we should like why this path is the correct path so when we find someone who's working to try to sell on the product or the service the thing we're doing we walk up to him the first thing we do is start spewing out all the logic on top like we look like puke out this logic on top of them okay the first time yeah I talked about this in the in the books the first time I like I really got this fact the first time I taught this concept I was to a proven event and proven it's a network marketing program that sells uh ketone drinks right and I helped write the original scripting for that company and did some really cool things with them and I remember going to this event and they wanted me to speak and so I get up there and I'm in the lobby checking in the hotel and look around I see all these fitness people in spandex head to toe wearing shirts to say glucose or ketones are greater than glucose and I'm watching these people it's like a herd of uh you know of lions and I see these these people walking through the the lobby almost like they're like the zebra walking through the lion's about to pounce on them and also they see people run over they start jumping on them I'm listening what they're saying and they're coming up and they're like did you know that the ketones are better than glucose like uh have you ever tried beta hydroxybutyrate salts and they're like jumping all this techno babel on right like it'll increase your blood and like all this stuff they've learned all the scientific studies like pukiness on people and you see the person you know this like this uh uh the zebra walking through all of a sudden these people pouncing on them and they're like oh and they're running away and I look at that and it was so funny because I'm like that's how most people sell they have all this logic all the techno babel they built up in their life and they see the person and they're about to try to convince them that their way is right and then it all comes out all over them and I remember at this event um after um after I witnessed this I was speaking to all the leaders it's like I'm from the leaders and it's the first time I ever drew this this little image out I remember getting whiteboard I was like all right I'm like every thing when you guys got in this company because it's something emotional that happened to you like what was that and uh and I had my friends like I took this stuff and I lost a ton of weight I felt better someone else I took the stuff and I my skin cleared from acne and I had more energy and like everyone had this emotional experience they had while like why they got into this company why they love the product why they were obsessed with the mission and I said then how come when you guys are in the hallway and I'm watching you guys try to sell these people you're jumping on and you're puking at all this logic my people don't buy logically you didn't buy logically there's like your bottom this is because you had some emotional experience some epiphany you had that changed your life that got you on this path and they're like oh my gosh I said if you can tell that story it'll shift everything for you okay uh and so that was the very first time I ever explained this concept of the epiphany bridge I remember I had a buddy I have a buddy who's a chiropractor shadow holder he's in dot com seekers and I think expert seekers too but I met him and I was like he was trying to figure out how to market his chiropractor practice and I'm like well how how does it like like why are you chiropractor he's like because I get Fridays off and like blah blah and they start telling me all this techno babble I'm like that's not gonna inspire anybody to come to you if you want people to follow you you got to have a story that that syncs with them like again I told you guys yesterday like your dream customer is probably you five years ago so you have to go back in time to you five years ago like what was the thing that you experienced that made you want to become this person and when I asked my question he thought for me he said you know what he's like I was actually planning on being a dentist and he's like and I just married my wife and she got this car accident and then remember she went to uh to doctors and medical things and all these things and the medical doctor wanted to cut her open and fix it and other people want to do this and all these different things and like my wife has been so much pain for so long we were trying every single thing we could possibly do and he's like one day we took her to a chiropractor and the chiropractor adjusted her I saw how this man put her hands put his hands on my wife and within like 30 seconds she was out of pain he's like when I saw that I was like that's my calling that's what I'm gonna do the rest of my life I got chills just telling that story I was like dude that's the story that should be every ads your webinars your friends come into your clinic like that's the story that builds this emotional connection like you spew in this techno babble it's not getting people to follow you right it's you telling that story okay so that's what the Pifny Bridge story is right and so everyone has one the hardest thing for us as marketers is to figure out like I had to go back in time and remember like what was the emotional thing that got me into this like what was the emotional experience I had that got me into building funnels what was the experience that I had that got me into if you want to be a wrestler everything I'm trying to sell right you have to think about that experience you had and that's the story you tell that gets people to want to go on this emotional journey with you now if you tell the story correctly the goal is for you not to give the person the epiphany okay this is the key the goal is to tell the story in a way where they have the same epiphany you had like a lot like you tell your story and then they have this epiphany like oh my gosh I need a funnel oh my gosh I need a whatever and so that's how you tell the story correctly and so the next question is like well how do I tell that story correctly okay and so um that's what I'm actually going to show you in fact uh let's throw up the the next image Ben the the the script so this is the picture of the script from the from the original dotcom secrets or sorry original expert secrets book if you guys have your camera take us picture this real quick we're gonna talk about this I'm gonna talk about I'm gonna come back and talk about it afterwards but why don't you see this real quick feel free to grab a picture of it I'm gonna show you a video so the very first time I taught this concept it was the inner circle I was doing an event called the fat event and the who who's like the who's who of click funnel royalty was all in that room at the time and I taught this concept and then I actually after I taught this actually went live and I did it live and so I'm gonna show you guys this going live I'll give you a real quick recap of what this looks like because I don't think Ben I don't I don't share this in the video clip right okay so okay so this is the epiphany bridge script and it's following it's sinking with like the hero's journey very similar right so it starts with the backstory so you tell the backstory this is like coming back to the epiphany bridge right you're telling the backstory right start with the backstory and then you talk about your desires like what did you want you talk about the internal desires like sorry the first of the externals the external desires the thing you want to achieve right like I wanted to go make a bunch of money I want to do whatever and then you come back you know but the internal the rule desire is I wanted to be happy or whatever that thing might be right so you start the back you tell me backstory talk with the external desire which is the journey of achievement where you're trying to achieve and you shared your internal desires which is the journey of transformation who you're trying to become and by sharing those things initially that's how you start building rapport very quickly with the audience okay um if you haven't read the expert secrets book I can spend like two days just on this one topic of desires internal external but we don't have time for it today right but that's the beginning and that's how you get quick rapport with the person you're talking to and then you talk about how you you know like on this journey went to you hit into a wall now what is the wall this is the same wall everyone else is hitting into right again you you five years ago what was the wall you kept hitting into because the same wall that your dream customers are hitting into now so what's the wall you hit into and what's the epiphany you had what's the new opportunity you discovered okay if you watch the last couple days you know what we're talking about with new opportunity and then here's the plan that you discovered from that and there was conflict his conflict is what makes the story interesting here's the conflict when I was trying to execute on the plan and eventually I achieved the thing I wanted right which is the very beginning of the story your your external desires but then more importantly you transformed which are your internal desires so this is the hero's journey kind of a little nutshell and this is how we tell stories I literally had this printed out on my monitor like taped to my monitor and every time I tell a story I'd have that I was glancing to I was like what I was doing Facebook lives every day and periscope lives all the ones I would glance to the script I would like literally sync to this script flawlessly okay so this is the picture of it again when you go through the expert secrets book you can actually you know read it and go it goes into a lot more detail about this but this is the epiphany bridge script okay so I'm doing else I'm gonna queue up this video um let's see we can drop this okay so I'm gonna keep this video and we're gonna show you guys this of me actually doing this entire script live one time so you can see the experience like what does it actually look like if Russell's going live following this script to a tee as close as I can and I'm gonna give you a hint after this is done I'm gonna give you guys a homework assignment the homework assignment is going to be for you guys actually to record one of these on your phone and then to post it in a certain spot I'll tell you about and if anyone who does that we're gonna put your name into a drawing to win something free you guys want to see what I'm gonna give you guys for free all right here we go and they step back so you can see it this right here this is the click foodles belt um that I'm wearing today uh we got one right here so this is it's a brown one we're trying to find other colors maybe blue and red and white but anyway right now I got one of these for sure so what we do is anyone who does this exercise and posts in the click foodles group we're gonna pick one person maybe one or two depends how good they are we'll pick a couple of the best ones to actually uh to send out a free click foodles belt too which will be exciting and these belts are amazing they have this really cool like ratcheting system they're my favorite belts all I wear now and I got some really expensive belts these are way cooler like anyway they're awesome so uh and it doesn't mean like you're the best at like doing it it's like the person who tried the best right like you could be horrible but as long as you do the assignment it's like that person it looks painful and they were not comfortable but man they did it they're gonna win so don't think it to be like the most articulate to win the belt you just have to be awesome and like give it your all and just try that's not fair okay so I'll talk about how to win that here in a minute but right now we're gonna uh clip or go over to the clip um uh okay so this is gonna be uh you watching me actually go live during the the first ever fat event uh teaching this concept I went live to show everybody how it worked and then afterwards I made everybody in the room go and like get their phone and go live into their faith into their facebook groups which is awesome so with that said here is a video of me doing wait I'm trying to find hold on I got too many screens open I'm trying to find the right screen so I can keep the video um this is Russell having way too many monitors um sorry about that you guys oh man how in the world did the hours disappear okay Ben taught me a trick to find these really quickly let's see gosh dang it okay I'm trying to find the live pigeon one we're streaming this live pigeon which lets me keep the videos each time uh which is my new favorite app so you guys should all uh go get live pigeon if I want to do this but don't do what I do where you close you have so many tabs open you can't find the actual one okay I'm opening everything I got give me 22 seconds now you guys and I'm gonna find it in the future I'll never make this mistake twice um are you able to push from your side Ben if you are go ahead and push it otherwise I'm gonna go find this keep looking for it we're getting closer we're getting closer I literally have so many tabs open you guys this is a lesson for us all I've almost got them all closed down there can't be that many more still floating out here okay okay I'm just going back to live pigeon give me one second I'm so sorry you guys I'm so sorry all right going back here hey Ben I'm sure you're showing me the wrong the stool story thank you very much all right cool the story stool hey guys the story story story story story story story story story story story story story story story story story story story story story story well this story stool is autographed by a storyteller just kidding all right okay I've never told the story live in all the details I'm gonna go through and hopefully I won't mess up I've got my notes I'm sure I will okay here we go and we're going live in three two one everyone this is Russell hope you guys are all doing awesome so I'm here right now in the room of I think 48 or 49 amazing entrepreneurs and uh you guys all see me again and we've been talking about storytelling and like how to tell your story kind of the origin story of where where you got started what got you into what you're doing and so I've been challenging all of them to go and do that and I thought it would be kind of cool if I just told you guys my story and some of you guys have heard pieces or parts of this but probably not the whole thing and so what I'm gonna do is just kind of share with you guys a story about about click funnels and why this for me became my new opportunity the thing that I'm so excited about and and why I have so much passion some people say Russell you've been talking about click funnels every day for the last two and a half years I'm like I know because I'm so excited every day so some of the backstory if you don't know so I got started in this business I guess it's almost like 13 or 14 years ago now and when I did I was a college guys going to Boise State University which is just down the road from it right now and I was like a wrestler which means I wrestled and I had to go to school so I barely graduated like it was like barely like I think my acumen level is a 2.1 which means I got a whole bunch of C's like 1b over like five years so it's kind of painful but but I graduated which made my mom happy it was pretty cool but during school as I was wrestling I started learning about this internet marketing stuff and you have to remember this is 12 years ago pre you know it's before Facebook it's before Instagram all these kind of things like we had Google kind of and in fact I don't even remember how we were driving traffic we didn't have a website anything like I was using front page some of the old timers remember front page so I was creating these things in front page and it was it was pretty bad so I was doing that but I believed that it was it was possible I saw people like some of my mentors were Armand Moran and Alex Mendoza and some of these guys who were making money online I was like god these guys can do it like I'm pretty sure I can do it so that was my goal I wanted to accomplish now the other side of that I don't really share a lot of times was it wasn't just that I wanted to make money like that was a desire I had but like the bigger desires I had just got married to my beautiful wife we're still married now it's been almost 15 years this year which is amazing and and I married her she was working full-time to support me her jobless wrestling and I don't know about you but like I was a vision like when I got married I'd be like the man and I would be like the supporter and it was it was honestly pretty tough for me like that she was supporting me and I didn't have anything to contribute other than like I'm gonna go to school and wrestle and hopefully and it was hard for me and I remember like I kind of figured out a way to contribute like I don't want her doing everything and it was it was uh and so I was like the real driving fact like if I can in fact my goal is if I can make a thousand dollars a month that would like match what she was making we were making very much money at the time I was like then like I feel like I'm contributing as well and so that was my goal like I need to figure out do this and I tried all sorts of stuff I was doing um I was trying eBay I was trying uh Craigslist I was doing stuff we had like little like I had like a $20 a month which was like big deal for me I was excited but like none none of the things really hit big and about the time I started learning about information marketing in fact I was at uh I was at a post office mailing something I'd bought from eBay in this huge awkward box I thought it was gonna sell huge and uh I didn't sell if I could like a buck 50 or something I lost tons of money and then I did a post-it and it was a nightmare I'm sitting in the line at the post office next to this dude who had a big box full of CDs like thousands of them I'm like dude what are you selling he's like well I have one CD I sell and I burn it and I'm like so these are orders for like the month he's like no these are my orders for this week I'm like I'm doing the math me how much you're selling for he's like 67 bucks I was like oh my gosh and I had this like this like I need to sell information like that is the future so I started trying to figure out uh information I started doing stuff my very first product I ever created was uh a DVD on how to make potato guns I sure some of you guys have have heard this story before so I started making potato guns and it was working really good but then what I was doing is I was going to google I was buying ads on google and we were making some money back and forth but eventually I probably had four or five months of success and then google change their algorithm and it got really really hard and the harder thing for me was like during this time like it was me building things in front page and I had to figure out how to like FTP pages and images and then how to go to PayPal and get the order button it was like it was super techy and I'm not a techy person at all but after google change our algorithm we tried some stuff and I remember one of my friends called me is Mike Philson some of you guys may know Mike and he said he said Russell I figured out like how to make this whole internet marketing game work again I'm like what do you mean is like well is your potato gun thing still making money I was like no like I can't I can't break even I can't make a profit he's like well I went back to all my sites and I added these things he called them OTOs I was like what's an OTO he's like it's an upsell and one time offer I'm like oh and so he's like I had these upsells and people start buying the upsells and suddenly like I'm making two or three times as much money from everything I sold and I was like dude I can actually do that and so I remember jumping online I was googling like potato guns trying to figure out like what would my upsell be I don't know like all I had was a potato gun DVD and I met this dude up in Northern Idaho who actually made potato guns and dropped shipped him and I was like dude if I sell those we drop shipping for me he was like yeah like I love to not have to sell these things and so I partnered with him and I started selling DVDs and people started buying this upsell and it was the first thing I had made a funnel and I was like this is a funnel and that was like this new thing I was so excited and so I had this epiphany like this is the future like if I can make more funnels like this funnel's gonna make me like I don't know 20 30 bucks a day but what if I had two funnels or three or five or ten and so I started going a little bit crazy and I created funnels in the couponing market which by the way is a horrible market people in that market do not like to spend money so I don't do that one but I did couponing we did dating we did weight loss we did network marketing I've done diabetic supplements we've done and that's like the ones on top of my head like there's like I show you guys there's like a trail of thousands of offers some that worked and a lot more that didn't work but we were doing these things over and over and my plan was like if I had 10 of them they're each making 100 bucks a day or 20 or 50 like whatever it is so I was doing this and at first it was working but like the problem I kept running into was like front pages for something like me was hard and I had like to do these pages and they might have looked ugly other people's like look awesome so then I had our designer he would design these things so I'm making front pages ugly I sent him he designed it look cool and I put it up then it was up and then I couldn't do anything I couldn't touch it again like I had one shot and then I like bug him so then I hired like a web guy to go and like do edits for me and then like I was using PayPal and I couldn't do anything else and so then someone like invented like a one-click upsell so I was like dude I need that so I had to hire a programmer to connect that to the next thing and like it kept getting more and more complicated to the point where like soon I wasn't able to do anything I just look at it and be like change that and then they try to change it and they didn't I'm like no they move it over here and then they put it in the wrong spot and like it would take days sometimes weeks going back and forth with the guys in Romania and India and everywhere trying to get them just to move an image and make it a little bit bigger like things that like were so common sense but I couldn't like actually do it and it drove me nuts and about that time one of my friends and partners in fact he may not be in the room right now is Todd in here still oh he's already in lunch so he's already gone but Todd was like one of my partners that were doing these things with me and he saw my frustration he's like what if we built something where like and the joke was like that Russell could actually like edit the website and actually could move things we quit bugging us all the time and I was like dude that'd be awesome he's like okay that's what we're gonna create and that day we we uh sat in front of whiteboard so I'm mapping like what would it look like how would it work and so we mapped out this this vision of what became click funnels and he went home and actually built it and then it was funny him and then another part we brought in was Dylan Jones they were working he did the editor and they would build part of it and they're like we need to like make this so simple Russell can do it so they do it and they can Russell test this and I log in and I'm like how do I do it he's like we're not going to tell you gotta figure out on your own I'm like okay so I'd like do some stuff and if I could figure it out then like good we got it if I get if I got stuck I'm like I don't know what to do then like hey we didn't do it intuitively enough so I'm back and forth and back and forth for probably six or seven months and finally it was a point where like I got it like if I can do this like then anyone can and first it was just a tool for me like that was really the the initial goal click funnels like I think it was it taught and Dylan like this way Russell will quit bugging us and I don't have to design sites anymore redo his headers like all this stuff that was happening and then after I started using it and I was having success I was like we have to make this a tool for everyone like it'll free all entrepreneurs and like it freed me and so because of that I was able to start creating funnels quickly I went from having five or six guys and take us on average almost two to three months every single time to build a funnel where I was actually able to do it by myself in like an hour an hour and a half sometimes less which was cool and so the cool thing is like I was able to achieve that and have success we started rolling out funnels like crazy some of you guys probably remember seeing a lot of them I still do a lot of them because it's so much fun to do um but the cooler thing for me was the other side like I was able to make money to support my wife and support my kids because I didn't no longer had to spend three months doing something in my time to be with my kids it's completely freed up um like I have a chance to like go home every day and play with my kids I'm not like stressing out trying to like talk to programmers in India at three in the morning and like stressing all the stuff like it just it just works and that was really the the biggest thing for me and uh it's been an amazing thing in fact now my kids are using click funnels they're building stuff in click funnels and it's like not just um you know not just for me it's not just a product it's it's a mission I'm seeing people's lives change I'm seeing uh other people who had messages they couldn't get them out because they couldn't move things around on this stupid page we're now like the power is back in their hand and uh that's what power that's what fires me up is being able to help entrepreneurs and other kind of things so um so that's kind of my click funnel story so if you guys haven't heard before I want to share that with you guys and to share um why I'm so passionate about this and um you know for me it's not just I talk about this all the time but like it's not a matter if you're gonna become a click funnels member it's when because it's the only way to do what we're talking about like the only alternative is do what I just used to do 10 years ago and hire guys in Romania and India and the Philippines and like have a team of 30 people to be able to move an image or you can just use click funnels and uh it gives you and me the entrepreneurs the power back which is awesome so I hope that helps you guys and uh hope you guys see why I'm so passionate about click funnels and with that said I'm gonna check out and uh if you like this comment down below uh if you have any friends who are like what is that click funnely thing uh share this to them tag them down below so they can see uh why me why I'm so passionate and probably why you're so passionate too so thanks you guys talk to you guys all soon bye so kind of go back with like um what I talked about like the the mistake that I was making the first time I was telling the story I tell the potato gun story and then I stopped after that and I was like that like that got me to the wall and I was stopping I was like the exciting thing like the thing that makes the big domino real was afterwards and I realized like wow like the funnel is the key like that was the epiphany was that and then when I started creating all these other things and and then on the new slides I have like 50 different uh offers that we've created like throughout time some of the work some of it didn't and it's like that was the and then here's the conflict like all the people we had hired and ups and downs like that's the interesting part that's where the conflict is we're actually people care and it's like and then now I was able to achieve this and I transformed this way and because of that like you guys can too and that's like the the cool thing all right you guys got it I'm glad we got technical difficulties out you had a chance to watch the video so that is me doing the epiphany bridge script telling my story about why I love click phones I'm obsessed with it right and Samir's already asking me where's this fit in the perfect webinar is this the like we'll get to that don't worry keep hanging out with me we'll keep we'll I'm doing line upon line thing by thing giving you guys little pieces of the long way to help build up the the core thing we're working on together so hopefully that was helpful but what are you guys doing now is my job is to push you guys beyond your comfort zone so I'm going to push you guys to actually do what I did okay again when I was in that room I went and did my facebook live right there that was live the page ever seen it and I had everybody in my in the the room right now go and do it as well so it's funny because you saw like the Hermoses were in one corner like with their phone we saw Dave Lindemann another corner I said uh to think who else was there like Ladyboss like came pull like they're all in the office someone outside they're all doing their thing all using the perfect webinar uh or sort of the piffing bridge script can we throw up the text version of piffing bridge script real quick Ben uh all right so this is because it's hard like how do I remember how to do this right so I showed you guys the image but this is how you easily do the piffing bridge script you just ask yourself this question risk question number one what is the back story that gives us the vested interest in your journey okay so hey my name is Russell Brunson let me tell you my backstory about why I got started in funnels right so like you just start by exactly right there right by the way take a picture of this everyone so you have it because I'm you're gonna be doing it today to win the belt right so uh we asked the backstory and the second question is desires what is it you want to accomplish well I wanted to accomplish and you talked about the dream I was trying to make money I was trying to lose weight I was trying to like learn how to invest in the stock market I was trying to bubble off whatever your thing is right and what was the what was the uh external struggle you're doing right and what was the internal struggle you're dealing with like actually I wanted to try to achieve the thing but I was really doing it because of this like because I really wanted to change my life I wanted to be that my wife would be proud of me or my dad would finally like love me or whatever your internal desire is right the internal one's the key because most people aren't willing to ever share that when you do share your internal desires of why you want this thing uh that's when people actually connect with you the the strongest okay and if you go back and watch the video notice how I did that right then in the wall what was the wall problem you had important then your current opportunity what's the wall you had I was trying this and didn't work I tried this didn't work I tried this didn't work and then boom now you tell your epiphany like then this is what happened you tell the story about that whatever the experience was you had the epiphany else was like oh this is amazing right until the epiphany and this is the new opportunity that I discovered through this epiphany and based on that here's the plan I created and as I tried it these things that I struggled along the way and then finally achieved the thing more importantly here's the transformation I had so that's the epiphany bridge story we want you guys to tell and there's a million ways we can teach you guys how to use it like this script is one of the most powerful things I could possibly give you guys but for today what I want you to do is I want you to actually do this so that means all of you guys are gonna grab your phone and when we get off of this I want you to literally like look at this thing hopefully you printed a copy of it just you know take a snapshot I take a picture showing your phone whatever it is and I want you to record yourself doing your epiphany bridge story of the reason why you got into the thing you're doing right now what is your what is your um the new opportunity that you've created that you're excited about that you're passionate about sharing with people what is that thing I want you to tell us that story and record it okay and unfortunately I wanted to like I want all you guys to post it in the click funnels group apparently can't go live in the click phones group but you can't create a video and then you can post in the click phones group and we have moderators who moderate everything to make sure that spam's not coming in and garbage but we have a passcode this is just for you guys so if you're not if this is the win when you guys record your perfumery bridge story then you're going to click funnels group and you guys know how to do this because I saw you all post 2000 pictures of nude squirrels in the last week so you know how to do this but go into that group post your video and in the title whatever you have a hashtag epiphany and epiphany is a weird word to spell but you hashtag epiphany figure out spell that then the moderators will see that and they will automatically push it through and then what's gonna happen is just start flooding our click funnels main group with all your epiphany bridge stories and I want you to go like obviously see your own there but then go see other people's comment give feedback hard at like it like tell them how excited you are for them and be be nice because this is gonna be hard for a lot of you guys like a lot of times this is your first time ever going live that's okay but record the video post in their hashtag epiphany and after you do that our teams can go through and then tomorrow on live tomorrow I'm gonna be giving one of you guys one or two maybe three we'll pick we'll pick a couple we'll pick one's like the best one one's like the person who like I'm most proud of for like being awkward and nervous and still doing it and then one will pick for the funniest so let's do that there'll be the three ones we're gonna write three belts three people I'm gonna announce the winners tomorrow that means you've got today to get that out there make your video post and click funnels group and then go comment everybody else's that's like fun who's here for the challenges that who's willing to come play this game with me okay if you want to play this game you guys I promise you if you want to grow and stretch which is why you're here right you want to grow and stretch you got to play this game with me right so come and play this game post the video uh and someone's gonna three people are gonna win a belt the funniest uh the best and the person I'm most proud of for for taking the leap of faith and doing it uh it's gonna be a lot of fun so everyone go do that right now but still top of your mind now you saw mine when this live end you go back and you watch my video again if you want to see how I did it like see how it syncs with the with the storyline uh hopefully it'll be it'll be awesome so I'm pumped to see you guys stories I want to hear I want to hear uh how you guys created the new opportunity for yourself why you're so excited why you're so passionate about the thing you're doing right now and that's gonna be a big part of it so uh yeah you gotta someone asked you you have to record it on your phone and then post it into the group because you can't stream into the group uh the moderators have a lockdown you can't do that so um yeah that's the game plan so there you go you guys and you can all win a click funnels belt boom these are the coolest belts the coolest belts in the entire world so without saying to you guys I gotta jump off they got a call that I'm about to jump on for something exciting we're gonna be announcing to the community
