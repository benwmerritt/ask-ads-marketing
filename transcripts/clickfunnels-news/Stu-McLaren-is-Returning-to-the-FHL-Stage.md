## Transcript
Freddie, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We are back with another amazing guest who is going to be speaking at Funnel Hacking Live this year in September. Countdown is on. You're going to know this person because he is known for his membership program. So put it in the comments who you think it is and we're going to roll the intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Hey there, everybody. Welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. My name is Ben Moot. I am here with the wonderful Susan Lennardsen. And we here get to talk to all of the speakers for Funnel Hacking Live. Here's the deal. If you guys did not get a text for this or you wanted to get texts every single time we go live introducing the Funnel Hacking Live speakers. And when we're back to the normal, we're going over all the news, make sure to text FHTV to 208-231-3797. So that way you get all the details and go to funnelhacker.tv. Get all the recaps every single week. There's so much going on. But here's the deal, Leo. Today we don't get to talk about that. Today we get to talk about Funnel Hacking Live. And Funnel Hacking Live is the bee's knees. We get to actually talk about this. So we are officially 41 days away from Funnel Hacking Live. In two days, we'll have breached the 40 day limit. Now here's the deal. Everybody's tossing their bonuses. They're giving all these different things. If you are not sitting there watching this and you don't have your ticket for Funnel Hacking Live yet, there is a giant universal mistake in your reality. You need to grab that ticket now in order to make sure that you have that seat. You have all those different things because as we tick ever closer to that zero mark, all of these bonuses, all these different things that are in Funnel Hacking Live that you can see it. Find at funnelhackinglive.com. They're all going away. And so my suggestion is as we're getting filled up as bonuses are going to start to be taken away, get your ticket now so that we're going to go. And today's speaker is a dead ringer. I have seen him speak four different times at Funnel Hacking Live. I am freaking out about it right now. So question, who has spoken four times at Funnel Hacking Live? Who has known Russell for 20 years? That's way before ClickFunnels was even imagined folks. This is like understanding like this is back in the JV days when you're looking for people like who you're going to JV with and how you're going to actually build these relationships. This is one of those relationships that Russell built way back in the day. He's brought this person on multiple times. You may not know this, but every time we build a funnel inside of ClickFunnels and it gets 100 clicks, we send a dollar to this person's charity and that goes out and it's built out by his wife and it's just it's super cool. If you guys have not guessed to it is yet, let's go ahead and bring him on. Welcome everybody to the virtual stage before Funnel Hacking Live stage, Mr. Stumaclaren. How are you, sir? Well, hello there. Good to see you guys. Thanks so much for having me. It's wonderful to have you. All right. So, okay. The first time I ever heard your name was at Funnel Hacking Live and Russell made fun of how you guys met because you had met near the Lutrin at an event. He tells it one way. You tell it the more nice way where you're walking. Well, he tells it one way and then I tell it the real way. Yes. And then you came in and taught 2CCX how to do continuity. And you gave a whole big training that I just digested a couple of days ago and like Russell's like, I want to get like snippets out of here. I'm like, okay. So I went and watched the whole thing and just like ate it up. It was absolutely wonderful. So that's just happened recently where you talk about like you guys created a program for affiliate marketing way back in the day. And that was like the next step. Can you talk to us like how was your relationship built with Russell over the last 20 years? Because apparently he likes you enough to keep coming. Have you come back? I know. I'm super grateful for it. Yeah. We've built an amazing friendship that this year we're going into our, it'll be our 20th year of friendship, which is crazy. Now here's why by the way, everybody should be attending funnel hacking live is because we initially met at a live event. And the reason I share that is Russell back then wasn't the Russell of today. You know what I mean? Like we were two young whippersnappers in the beginning of our, you know, entrepreneurial careers and I share this because you just never know who you are sitting beside and what that relationship can become. This is why I believe everybody should be at funnel hacking live because it is an amazing opportunity. The people in that room are unbelievable and they can be and can turn into lifelong friendships like Russell and I have had and tremendous partners like Russell and I have been tremendous, you know, affiliates, tremendous partners, tremendous masterminders and I would say like Russell and Todd and the whole ClickFunnels team have been amazing supporters for the charity that my wife and I run. And so this is why people got to get there. Now, Russell and I first met as you mentioned at a live event. We then became business partners. There's all kinds of shenanigans and stories around like the early days of that. But you know, one of the things that I love about Russell is he goes from hearing an idea to taking action faster than anybody. I know here's a perfect example. This whole event is centered around the Lynch pin model. It's centered around, you know, continuity. It's centered around memberships. But I remember the moment that Russell first ever began thinking about continuity. Now, this was a moment years and years ago when Russell's business had taken a turn for the worst and it was a really challenging moment in time for him. He was, you know, having to lay a whole bunch of people off. He's talked about it publicly and I remember talking to him on the phone and he was, it was right around like, it was right around Christmas time because I remember we were chatting and we were talking about what was going on in his business and I'm trying to be a friend and trying to help him and trying to think through, you know, what he could do and how to move forward and I was telling him, I said, dude, like, you know, one of the things that I highly recommend is like you get continuity and recurring revenue in your business and this was not something that he had at the time. He was selling like higher ticket offers and he had a sales team and he didn't have continuity and I said, dude, like, I mean, I'm in the membership business. I've been in the membership business since 2008. Like that's a long time. We've literally helped tens of thousands of people in all kinds of markets with membership. So this is something I've been doing for a long time and I remember saying to him like, dude, you got to get into memberships and recurring revenue because it creates stability in the business. So like, you know, if anything ever happens, you know, where markets change or, or, you know, whatever happens, continuity and membership is there. It's like that safety net. So he's like, well, what would that look like? And I remember talking through different types of, you know, offers and different types of, you know, membership programs and continuity. And I said to him, you know what, I'm going to send you a recording. I'm going to send you a recording that I think will spark a bunch of ideas for you that kind of unpacks some of the things that we had initially discussed. So here's what Russell did. And media, as soon as we hang up, I send him the recording. He puts it on like a, I don't know. I don't even know if it was, I don't even think it was an iPod there. I think it was like a Walkman. It was like an H3 player. And I remember he was telling me he was hanging up Christmas lights. Like, you know, as he was listening to this thing, he was hanging up Christmas lights. And then the moment he finished it, what that recording was all about was creating a newsletter subscription. He went from the idea of a newsletter subscription to creating a newsletter literally the next week. And I don't know the exact numbers. It was so long ago, but I do know that it immediately added tens of thousands of dollars of recurring revenue into his business. And that created a base upon which he then could have a lot more creative freedom to begin thinking about how he was going to make his next move in the business. And so I just show this because like we always hear different ideas and concepts and so forth. But the people who end up achieving the most in this world are those that go from hearing the idea to taking action on the idea as quickly as possible. Russell is a poster child of that philosophy. And this was an interesting moment because his business was in a place where he needed to pivot. He heard an idea. He ran with the idea a week later. It's off to the races. And now we have a whole funnel hacking life about continuity and memberships. But it just goes to show this is one of the reasons I love Russell is that, you know, he not only talks to talk, but he walks the walk. And this is a great example of that. So let's back up a minute or actually maybe it's fast forward, but tell us about your first funnel hacking life experience because, okay, we've heard a lot about Russell Russell's great. Right. What about Stu? What is your experience and like how did what does that mean for where you're at now to like from your first FH? I mean, obviously you knew Russell before that. So, okay. So what's amazing is that Russell has always been an unbelievable, you know, marketer, creative business mind. And we've always stayed in touch. And this is why our friendship, you know, has lasted, you know, all these decades. But they launch click funnels. It starts to grow. You know, I'm like, you know, I'm doing my own thing over here, but I'm cheering him on. I'm like, I'm super sto-formed, you know, because, you know, Russell has always been a dear friend. And when my wife and I started our nonprofit charity now 14 years ago, Russell was one of the very first donors who, you know, they didn't have click funnels then, but he was like, I'm in, I'm on board. He came to Kenya with us like, you know, on our very first donor trip, like he's always been an incredible supporter. And so he said to me, he said, Hey, Stu, listen, like we, you know, the click funnels thing was going well. And he's like, we're going to, we're going to do like a live event. And he's like, you know, you know how nervous I've been about, you know, live events because he's told this story many times where, you know, he's held an event and sold hundreds of tickets and there was like barely anybody in the room that showed up. So he was nervous about it. And he's like, you know, I'd love for you to come. He's like, again, we've sold a lot of tickets. I mean, I'm pretty sure most people are going to show up, but like, I have no idea. He's like, but I'd love to like do some kind of a fundraiser for Village Impact at the event. I was like, dude, that's amazing. I'm like, of course I'm there. So I'll never forget going to the first one and, and walking in and oh my gosh, there is just like this electric energy. It's hard to explain, but like there's this energy, like there's this buzz. It's like, it's like that feeling when, you know, you're coming up with your business and, and you're like, yes, this is it. And there's like that. And it's the same energy like in a room of other entrepreneurs who are buzzing in the same way. And I remember walking in and I was like, dang, dude, like I, I teach people how to create community. I teach people how to grow memberships. This was community, live and in person. People were wearing the t-shirts. People were excited to be there. People were showing up. People were engaged. People were masterminding with each other. There was all kinds of business deals that were happening in the halls. It was just like this unbelievable place to be for an entrepreneur. And I just remember thinking like, I am so stinking proud. I'm so stinking proud of the culture that Russell and Todd and the whole ClickFunnels team have created. I'm so stinking proud of the lives that are changing, like watching real time at the event, people building their funnels, people helping each other, people masterminding with the speakers at tables. Like it was the level that he took and the access that he gives at these events is amazing. So when I think about Funnel Hacking Live, to me, there is no other entrepreneurial event where you're going to get that electricity and that buzz and that interaction and that engagement and the ideas and the strategies that you can implement right away. Now, with all that said, for me personally, I've been in business a long time. I've been in online a long time. And yet I could not stop taking notes at this event. This wasn't like one of those events where it's like, oh, I've been in business for a long time. So I'm just going to hang it on the halls and network. No, like I wanted to be in the room during every session. And the reason is because they're so stinking actionable. Like it was, that's this one of the things I love about Funnel Hacking Live is it's not just a bunch of theory. There's like actionable things that you can implement right away. So I love the event. This is why I come every year and I'm so grateful and honored to be speaking again this year. But for me, it's an event you can't miss. What was it like this time? Because I mean, you speak with Russell all the time. I remember doing a launch and I was working in the office with the Russell and he's like, pull that up. And so like we had you like you were doing your launch and he's watching and he's going, oh, he's taking notes as he's doing everything else. He's like, ah, Stu's launch. This is great. Like you guys watch each other. You support each other always in contact. What was it like and what did he tease was kind of the topic this time? Because it's your fourth time speaking like it's and it's usually along the same topic, but there's a different flavor this time. Well, so as I mentioned, I've been supporting and helping entrepreneurs. Adrecurring revenue into their business since 2008. We've helped businesses in all kinds of markets from photography and calligraphy to fitness and finance and music and art and health and dog training. Heck, we even helped Holly George, who has a membership helping people make balloon animals for crying out loud. So like every market you can think of, you know, we've been in there helping supporting them launch, grow and scale these memberships. And so over the years, like Russell has invited me to come to funnel hacking live and I have shared different parts of memberships. And this year he's asked me to come and I'm speaking right at the very beginning. And the reason I'm speaking at the beginning is because there is one element that every single membership site should have. And if you don't have it, what happens is you'll see high turnover in the membership, meaning you'll get people in and Russell's going to give you a bajillion different ways to market a membership and to get people in. But the money is made in memberships, not just getting people in. It's in keeping people happy and paying month after month after month. And by the way, what a great business to be in. Like we're in a business of keeping people happy, right? But if we can't keep them happy, you're going to see high turnover. So one of the myths about memberships is that people only stay for three or four months. And that is total bogusness because in our world, people don't stay for months. They stay for years. Now, what is the difference? Well, when people tell me that their members are only staying for a few months, right away, it tells me that they're missing a vital ingredient. And many times when you don't have this ingredient, your members come into a membership and they're excited. And then when they come in and they see all the content, then there's like this moment of like, ah, it's like this, this awkward excitement because then they're realizing like, oh my gosh. This is, this is, this is, this is a lot. And then this seed of overwhelm gets planted. And once that seed of overwhelm is planted, now it's a matter of time before they're going to leave. And for years, like I talk to Russell all the time about memberships. And as I mentioned earlier, like he's a student, he, he goes from idea to implementation faster than anybody I know. But in doing that, sometimes you miss the little nuances that make a big difference. And, and I would talk to him, you know, we get together as friends all the time. And, and I would say like, dude, you know, like there's a reason why you're not growing at the rate that you want. And it's because you're missing this one thing. And so when I mapped out this one thing for him, it was like this light bulb moment of like, oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, I see it. And in fact, I mean, I just, I just got my copy of the linchpin. But, and it just so happened that I was cruising through this. I just got this literally hours ago and I was just cruising through this. And what's funny is I saw a screenshot. I saw a screenshot of Russell's membership. I'm not going to say what page it's on, but I saw a screenshot of Russell's membership. And I can tell you that they have implemented exactly what I'll be talking about at Funnel Hacking Live. And it's the difference maker in all memberships. It doesn't matter what type of membership. It doesn't matter what market you're in. If you don't have this one ingredient, you are going to struggle in keeping people locked in. You're going to struggle in keeping people happy. You're going to struggle in helping your people get results. But with this one thing, you're going to give them so much clarity. They're going to know exactly where they are in their journey and know exactly what they should be focusing on. And also exactly what to ignore so that they don't get overwhelmed and they get better results. And if they get better results, they stay. So we're going to kick off Funnel Hacking Live. I'm right near the beginning to set the foundation to give you that one foundational element that will set your membership or continuity up for success. So good. Can't wait. Obviously, like if you guys got this, you can probably go get a sneak peek of that. But it's going to be, you're going to dive into it. Like we're going to get so much gold from you on stage, which is going to be exciting. And I'll be talking about not only what it is, but I'll be talking about examples. And in fact, I haven't talked to Russell about this. I'm not totally sure how this is going to play out. But my plan is to do like a real world example of what we're talking about in real time in the room with 7000 people. I've never done it with 7000 people before. So this is why I say it's going to be an experiment. I'm either going to fall flat on my face and it's going to look disastrous or it's going to have the impact that I'm looking for. And it's going to be amazing. Either way, people will be entertained and informed. So we're going to do that and Funnel Hacking Live is going to be fantastic. That's awesome. If you guys don't have your Funnel Hacking Live ticket yet, like you have to go get your ticket. I don't know what else we can do to convince you that you need to be there. FunnelHackingLive.com, this is what the site looks like on the screen. You can see all of the event information. You're going to see all of the, it's stacked. It's there. The stage is going to be stacked. We're going to do the next thing, Russell Designs Funnel Hacking Live to give you exactly what you need. Sometimes without you even realizing you needed it. Every year it sells out. So it will sell out this year. So you need to make sure you're going and getting your ticket today. Also, we're going to talk about this next, but there's some bonuses that are involved in you getting your ticket and they're going to start disappearing as well. So if you don't go buy your ticket today, you're going to miss out on the awesome bonuses that are there. Ben, do you want to do the run down of the? Yes, please. All right. So here's the deal. You get your four day ticket to FunnelHackingLive. It's four crazy packed days. You don't want to miss the room. You want to be in that room because all these things are actionable. And Russell's bringing on a more people than he's ever brought on before on the stage at FunnelHackingLive. So if you are not there, you're missing it. It is jam packed. It's super, super powerful. You get crazy swag. The room in your suitcase, he will over deliver. That is the job. Okay. Then at that point, you're going to get marketing.ai integrations. You're going to get a whole bunch of bonuses from the inner circle that they're giving you for free, which is a bonus that is leaving soon. So be very, very careful there. Make sure that you jump in and get it. Plus you're going to get all the replays from every single FunnelHackingLive. Do you want to hear every time Stu has talked about continuity? If you want to hear every single time Russell has talked about all the different pieces that are important, it's all available for you. I had to pay a thousand dollars to get in the door every single time, not including the hotel. Not including food, not including all the rest. And you guys get it all for free. You could go through a FunnelHackingLive once a weekend at this point in order to prepare for it. You might blow your head off and you'll totally freak out. But you have access to it for life. And that is a crazy ridiculous bonus. And on top of that, Stu, I hear we're tossing something onto the pile. Well, as I mentioned, I am no stranger to memberships. And one of the things that I am very honored and privileged to do is serve a community of literally tens of thousands of membership site owners and continuity program owners. And so in that, I've always got my finger on the pulse of what is working right now. And this is particularly valuable to everybody coming to this event because the whole theme of the event is continuity, memberships and subscriptions. And so one of the things that I'm going to do is I'm going to break down in a presentation, nine membership funnels, because not all memberships are sold the exact same way. And so we're going to walk through nine different membership funnels. I'm going to give you an example for each one of those funnels. One of the examples pulling from markets like the nonprofit space and market helping nonprofit leaders and membership that has more than 5,000 plus members. We'll have examples from I think of Ginger Dean who she has a membership with thousands of members serving women who have just, you know, broken up from a, you know, a terrible relationship. And now they're looking to kind of rebuild themselves. She's a former psychotherapist that used to work one-on-one with clients. She now serves thousands in a membership. We'll have examples of people who have art memberships for goodness sake, but there's tons of different examples in a variety of different markets. But we're going to break down nine different membership funnels. And so you'll not only get the strategy that they're using, the breakdown of how the strategy is working in their business, but you'll get the full blown example with examples of exactly what they're doing and how they're saying it in this presentation called the nine membership funnels. I remember looking through this. I remember watching this as I was going through the bonuses and being like, oh my gosh, I remember it now. This was so good. You guys don't know what you're getting. Okay. If you guys want to get that, you definitely need to go to funnel hiking live.com and grab your tickets because it is going to be worth every single sense. Stu, thank you so much. Thank you. Not only for constantly being at funnel hiking live and giving, but you will always give at such a high level everywhere you go and in everything you do. And it's seen and your joy is like everybody you get off stage and I'm sitting in the audience. People are like, I like that. Stu got it. The energy is always there. We appreciate it so much. Thanks for coming on. And we cannot wait to see you one stage with us. Well, listen, I'm super excited. Funnel Hacking Live is definitely the place to be. If you're an entrepreneur and you're looking to grow your business, you've got to get there. Number one, number two is that you are going to learn so much. And when I talk about learning, I'm not just talking about the theory. I'm talking about actionable things that you can do while you're at the event. I want you to embody the spirit of Russell going from idea to implementation, literally many times within hours. Like that's the opportunity you're going to have. And then thirdly, like this event is magical for the connections and relations that you can form. And I don't just say that lightly. Like I remember meeting Russell nearly 20 years ago. We've been friends for 20. We just got back from Kenya where he and Collette brought the whole family, like all five kids, like seven Brunson's. I remember they literally land and the airlines had lost all their luggage. So I remember seeing like Russell, I'm excited to see him. He's not so excited. I'm like, what's going on? He's like, they lost all our luggage, but he was there. He was there in Kenya. And like that's the kind of friendships that can be formed and partnerships that can be formed at Funnel Hacking Live. You know, our life, we can only progress if we put ourselves in the environment and in the situation to set ourselves up for success. This is it. Set yourselves up for success. Come to Funnel Hacking Live. Get your tickets sooner rather than later because you get more amazing stuff. It's pretty easy. You get more stuff just by making the decision now. So go get your ticket. Go to FunnelHackingLive.com. Can't wait to see everybody. It's going to be epic. I think with that, we will see you guys later. See you everybody. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life, and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it. It's beating, it's pulsing. I'm made for something more. You get scared, and then fear hits us. There's little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven said, no, I'm going to do it. The driven, are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday, I realized, I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia, and I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that's made me all of my money. The quite best selling framework. What? Start out closing, and you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust the influencers. This better blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning again. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experienced in this wondrous life? You wouldn't be able to tell, but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened, and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People feel a sense of belonging here. It feels like home. It's so encouraging, because if they can do it, so can I. It's all I just want to say, hey, next year we're going to get there. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer in Everland. We'll find exactly what your business is missing. It's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day they're telling people how they met you. Well, I can live change my entire life. Because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be black. Your legacy's going to be black. Movements are about to be burned. My story hopefully gave women permission. If you believe me, stand your feet. Stand in the way. You do not have to be great to get started. But you have got to start if you ever want to be great. I'm happy now. I'm happy now.
