So the title again everything we know it's hook story offer hook story offers We hope we threw out there the titles presentation the text message went out all the stuff says the number one secret that almost Everyone missed and how we scale click funnels from zero to a conglian But infinity billion just kidding we're not there yet, but working on it But we've grown into a huge company we've been in this business now for ten years And we grew and scaled we've let to take on a penny of VC outside funding and questions I was like, how did you do that? How did you do that? And so there's a lot of things right? I wrote books. I've done webinars do live events do everything, but there's one thing There's one thing that's like the key. I'm curious how many of us think you know what it is You know what it is drop down like we need the key is like what is what was the secret if I look at it down like Like there's a lot of things we did but there's one that was like the most important thing I'm curious like dropping the comments We just think Some says tussle Brunson. Oh, yeah tussles here. Let's go I've heard people in past say oh, it's the two comic couple word like yes. That was a big deal continuity Yes, that was a big deal. Those are both good the heart to serve. Yes. It's a big deal webinars Is a big deal consistent work webinars a linchpin is the key membership linchpin We got my linchpinners out there. No, I'm talking about traffic. These are all good But so far none of them are completely correct. They're all partially correct. They're not completely correct. There's one thing conviction is big Yes, I Josh this is that this Josh was honest. I honestly don't know. Okay, good helps integration marketing customers These are all these are all fantastic. So okay, you guys are all on the right thing Mifki God Positioning click phones against websites the Mifki the Mifki Okay, all these things are good hook story off for the yes my people you're speaking my language This is the best thing ever. So all these things are good, but I'm gonna tell you what What was like the thing and I'm telling you guys this because the last two weeks hanging out the eyes of a lot of fun for me because I'm like re Thinking through these things like things I haven't thought about for a decade It was a 10 years ago. We launched click phones, right? I started going the process started building growing scaling launching. It's like By going back in these lives. I'm sure he has videos from back in 2017 when I was talking about Expert secrets, you know talking about future-based college talking about your new opportunity talking about things like going on on so like I've Been going deep into it and I'm actually I'm flying out on Wednesday. I'm flying to Dan Kennedy's Super Conference So this week's a couple weird schedule on me going live So I'll be traveling and flying and in weird hotel rooms and stuff, but I'm trying to keep someone said nude squirrels. Yes Dude squirrels. What's the secret you guessed it? No Anyway, I'm gonna try to keep things as much live and much to schedule as possible But it might be a little weird this week just because of that but as I'm working on a presentation, I'm actually doing four presentations at Kennedy's Super Conference this week which I'm so excited for and And Anyway, it's kind of start rethinking through all these things. It's been top of my mind So it really fun and I'm actually message Todd. They're down my dude. I'm an idiot. I was like, I know the answer I know the answer to this stuff and I totally forgotten about it and somebody hasn't heard me told it tell the story before but I'm Tell you this for a couple reasons number one is because this was the biggest thing This was the number one thing it was the secret to everything and I did it for a year And then I did it less often the next year and less often next year the point now where I never do it And it's funny because I totally kind of forgotten about it. I wrote the expert secrets book It was top of my it's always talking with our community with our tribe with all our people talking about it Everyone's bought into it and I'd forgotten about it. I look right now I'm telling you this because number one I want to point out out to you But number two is I'm gonna be committing to you guys today that I'm gonna do this exact same thing It's been a while. So this is how important is I'm gonna be using it to grow and scale Click-Fones 2.0 click once the next levels because I totally forgot about it. So this is what it is you guys ready drum roll, please Good published not publishing dream hunter. No, these are all good. These are all good. Okay, this is what the key was The key was I did a webinar every single week Consistently week after week after week week after week after week and some years where we talked about this before But I want to re-bring it to the top. I talked about in the expert secrets book It's like the key to everything. It's the fuel that drives and builds the business. So let me go back in time. So click-fones Excuse me. We launched click-funnels. We hasn't heard the story before we launched with the funnel It didn't work and another funnel didn't work three four five five hundred phones didn't work and I was about to throw it I'm like no one's buying the thing. This isn't working I give up and then remember my friends called me like hey have an event you and I need to speak out I was like, okay. What do you want me to speak on? He's like only to sell like speak about click funnels and sell it I was like nobody's buying it like no one understands the value of fun Like I couldn't get people to understand why they needed this thing like I was so passionate about but nobody cared It makes me laugh now people like Russell you pick such a good market called funnels I was like it was not that good of a market when I got started nobody cared I had to make the market care about this topic, right? And so Anyway, I'm gonna go speak at his event. I remember I was like no one no one wants to buy this thing It's like it doesn't matter to you like you have to figure out a thousand dollar version of this to sell At the event and I was like they're not paying for the free trial let alone give me a thousand dollars He's like dude, you know speak from stage create a presentation my people are already waiting for you Your face is on the sales letter. So I'm like, ah, and so I remember it was an event. They were streaming it virtually So I remember watching I was at home. So I was in Boise still watching day number one of the event Watching it from my home as I'm working on this presentation. I literally pulled out my perfect webinar script I'm building the webinar putting it all together day two. I'm watching work my webinar that after I jumped into a plane I flew down there to San Diego. I get the San Diego next day and I'm on stage so I get on stage and I do my webinar presentation and And some of you guys have seen the prime years have seen the front the funnel hacks presentation by the way I did the fun hacks presentation and boom And I sold a thousand-dollar version of click funnel. It was crazy people were jumping over the table People throwing credit cards in the back there was the first time I'd ever had like a legit huge table rush And I was just like, oh my gosh, this is crazy. I don't know the Zach numbers. I can't remember I think we closed like close to half of the room into buying click funnels that very first time and remember that night Like we're at dinner having fun and you know Todd and deal my two co-founders initially were talking about stuff And we're having a good time. I said, you guys really what's happened? Yeah, we made some money fine women working on this project for two years and nobody didn't make anybody now I made somebody like I don't know like I'm like now that I know the message now I know how like we can blow this up like this is the beginning of the rest of our lives and and I remember the next morning I was leaving I was leaving the The the the lobby the hotel is walking out and that's late in the hallway And she's like hey your presentation was awesome yesterday I just I wished that I could have a wish that I could have bought it, but I'm a coach and I don't have a supplement I couldn't buy click phones like what she's like well Yeah, all the all the all the the case studies you showed her supplement phones. I don't have a supplement company I'm a coach so won't work for me. I was like no like I'm a coach too. I have a book. I have a webinar Like it works for coaches who she's like are you serious? I'm like yes And she starts freaking out She said don't move and she runs into the the event room and she grabs two of her friends They all three run out with order forms She's like we had no idea the coaches could actually this work for coaches and they gave me the three order forms I have these three order forms as I'm leaving and I get in the plane. I'm sitting and thinking like, huh What did I make like my presentation converted great, but obviously I didn't make I didn't I didn't illustrate Well enough that people could think oh, this is exactly what is right like like there's something that missed there And so I remember on the flight home tweaking my slides and putting in some slides like hey the search for coach or worse If you're this or this or this is showed examples of funnels I'd use in the past right so I'm flying home and then afterwards I'm at the airport and I'm texting everyone like hey, I got a presentation is hot Who wants to promote it? Who wants to promote it? I started lining up people to start promoting the webinar, right? And so then I get back home and we you know the next day we're running like we're putting up to building a funnel webinar registration page We put it out there This is an original click for us. It's like again three four months in the click funnel So it's one of the first webinar registration pages ever created. I have one of my I have three or four Versions that we we built one and the clone that we clone it So I three versions of it one for me to promote to my list and then two of my friends who said they were promote as well so I had three people promote it and we lined up so I had two webinars on the first day and webinar the second day and then I had a third Anyway, I was just lining up. I was doing two or three webinars a day. It was crazy And so I did the very first webinar. I remember I can't remember how many were on it It was like 400 500 people or something were on the webinar I get on there I do the presentation and it crushes this really well, right? And I don't remember the exact dollar amount. This has been a decade But it's something like 30 40 thousand dollars in sales. I was like, yeah, that's amazing Now the next webinar was the same day, but it was like four hours later So four hours later. I'm about to go get on the webinar But before I do I was like remembering what happened in the hotel lobby And so I think Todd or some of my team they exported all the questions people asked during the webinar and I went through I saw reading him and I was like, oh my gosh, everyone's getting stuck Minute 22 they're all asking the same question. I just ignore it. I don't even bring up the question So I went and I added slide in there to resolve that concern and then a little while later I noticed on you know, slide 72 everyone's again stuck there So I tweaked that slide then during this the stack in the clothes people asking questions are getting confused They can't figure this out this out So we're tweaking it tweaking it tweaking it and then like I jump on the next webinar boom four hours later same amount of people on the webinar and this time instead of making 30 or $40,000 in sales I remember like 80 or 90,000 in fact, we might have broke six We might have broke six figures. I can't remember but I was like, oh my gosh same people way more money What did I do? I made some tweaks and I was like we've another webinar tomorrow I download the questions again, so we download all the questions like where people still get stuck like oh You know, no one's gonna stuck here here, but they're asking this question this question A lot of people are asking for work for them here and there's so like we're finding where they're asking the questions We're tweaking the slides adding a slide deleting a slide Making less confusing the offers confusing tweaking this tweaking that like we're doing that kind of thing right next day The webinar crushes it and they're doing it next one every single time for the next year every time we webinar Export all the questions tweak the presentation launch it again export the questions tweak it launch it boom But and just keep doing that over and over and over again. Okay. I did it so many times I'm gonna fucking show you guys this actually I got this testimony from one of my buddies that It made me smile and laugh You spend cells page here. Yes, it's still here. Okay. I'm not use I'm not showing you this to sell you anything I just want to show you the actual The actual Testimonial This book okay, I'm gonna zoom in like crazy. You can see this testimonial. It's my buddy Joe Lavery He he he posted she said Russell I mean odd how good you are webinar pitching watching right now every trick in the book being used like a pro every slide every section Every word craft intentionally the sequence the stack the FAQs the video testimony You offer almost every objection planned for and obliterated the countdown timer overwhelmingly awesome execution I don't think I've seen a better presentation, bro Hashtag on top of your game hashtag good guys get much richer hashtag much respect, right? and so that's what Joe said and And maybe laugh cuz I was like if he only knew the reason why You know every slide every section every words craft intentionally right while every Objection was obliterated before it even came up because I had seen those a hundred times I wasn't just guessing wasn't hoping that my presentation work. How many I show up on your webinar? You're like hey, what's up everybody? So today we're gonna talk about and you're just hoping right? I remember when I was learning from Dan Kennedy my original mentor one thing he told me that was so powerful He said that when you create he said you can have presentations with your teaching having fun and like being more free So I was like but when you are selling you follow a script to a tee He's like if you watch myself's presentation the original magnetic marketing He's like he's like if you watch it, you'll notice that I say if you watch ten versions of you know So I say I laugh at the exact same time. I grab my drink of water same time I like he's like everything I do is fly. I don't mess with it, right? I may tweak and test little things because like but the script does not change Okay, it's funny because like I'm last year I chance to be in Salt Lake in front of like two or three thousand people in the vent And I was saying it was Ryan Panetta who Ryan Panetta I actually just flew in did a podcast interview with him last week, which was really fun get known personally But he was at the original TEDx where we did the set the world record and everything he bought there is like his first intro into this Whole mark in this whole world right and fast-forward like five or six years later We're both speaking this event. He's like what you talking about tomorrow Russell. I'm like same thing I was talking about same presentation you watch. He's like you're doing the same presentation. I'm like, yeah, it works Why would I mess with it? Right? I'm gonna make it better and better and better now This is a couple things I want to jump into Because some said the voice and the video aren't sink well do my best So It's interesting like this is what and this is a piece of something is gonna get wrong Okay, so the goal is to do webinar every single week for as long as you can for at least a year, right? And and honestly maybe more than once a week again I was doing it two three four times a week some days two or three times a day when we were growing click-fung like that was the Initial momentum and nursery we needed to excuse me to get this off the ground, right? and I remember at first it was like confusing to me because I was like Well, if I do the same webinar on my list every single week, they're gonna get bored of it They're gonna like stop showing up, right? And I said yeah, that's the secret like to do a webinar every single week You can't keep doing it to your existing list future your existing list every time yeah, it burns them out So by doing a brand new webinar every single week It forces you to get new traffic new eyeballs new people new blood new fuel into your business Does that make sense? Like it is the key and so it forces you to do that, right? And so what happens is you create the webinar put it out there You start buying ads you drive as much traffic as you can you get your invention part of there Everyone's promoting a single crazy you do the webinar live in fact if you go here Let me go and walk you the model if you've got your expert secrets book in front of you if you go to page 308 boom here's the here's the thing right so we start a webinar Create a brand new funnel so it's clone the old funnel and we make a brand new one if you look at our click-fung scout We have a date for every single webinar so you can kind of see the whole history of them all right So you we create it boom the Monday report Tuesday for a Wednesday product Thursday morning We're proud and then Thursday. It's blurry here. We go Thursday boom. We do the live event Okay, and then whatever you sell during the live event, which is good Then you should make more or sooner sorry you should You should double yourself through the replay signals So you have replay on Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Sunday of urgency and scarcity close it down It ends every new registering that window it ends and then you start back over again on Monday You create a new funnel right and these people who sign up they don't see this funnel right? So it literally ends for them the traffic ends It's over and then you start buying ads again And you push for people Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday morning boom boom boom and like you Like riddance and repeat that process over and over and over and over again that was the secret That's how you do it over and over and over again, okay? And now a couple things with your existing list What we would do is we would do every single week for again for for a month and then once a month We would do a webinar to our existing lists So once a quarter we do it to our existing lists and it what happens like sometimes people have fallen away or they forgot Or they weren't ready at the time But like the once the once a quarter webinar to our existing list would crush okay So this is once the quarter to your existing list once a week to new traffic And it's forcing you to figure out how to get new traffic new leads new eyeballs coming into your world Does that make sense like that's really the big secret most people are missing okay? And some say is automated or live this is live okay because you have to learn how to master your script over and over and over again Yes, we're buying new traffic every single webinar Yes, yes, okay. I had a friend And It was she's Mary Lone Tribby's me hasn't met Mary Ellen. She's amazing But she she's gone to two different companies and taking these companies from like Three million dollars in sales to eighty million dollars in like a year things like that And I remember I asked one time like how do you do that? And she's like oh Russell? It's not that hard all you get it marketers you guys just think you're so smart now She's pretty nice about she gives her so smart She's like you guys do the equivalent of creating a Broadway player I think you hire the best screenwriters in the whole world the best actors and you produce it and you practice You know get amazing and then you would do you because you're the boys I know you'll do the play in Boise, Idaho You'll market it give her to show up, you know opening night curtains come up you perform it goes crazy it closes down people clap It's like the Houston sensation and then and then ends and the next morning you wake up You start writing a new play so you guys doing you can funnel after funnel after funnel She's like what I do she's like I take that funnel I take that play that worked already in Boise, Idaho and I take it on the road Okay, that was the whole premise of what I did here with with click phones, right? I had the webinar worked it worked at my friends event worked on my own list now instead of me going right into the webinar I take it on the road. I do to every other person's email list. I can I can convince to promote it I start buying ads every single week. I'm doing over and over and over and over again And that is what you need to get your business into Into the stratosphere that makes sense. Okay now a couple other things that I think is really important to understand Bill said okay good question bill bill said how is it counted on time or ethical if you restart the offer every week? Isn't it false urgency? No someone's coming into that work They are finding some random out there. They click on it They create account right they sign up for the webinar and that webinar the beginning in the end it ends for that cohort of people Right and then we start a new cohort those people don't know what that funnels that they can they don't have access to unless they go And they refine the ad but after someone's gone through we block them so they don't see the ad again, right? And so no it's not an ethical because it's a different cohort for everyone who's in that cohort. Yes, right? That's how that's how how we do it great question Okay, now I want to stress a couple things number one is I've been telling people do this for years The amount of people who have actually done this besides me Everyone I know who did this besides me ended up with a business that's done multiple eight figures or beyond But very few people done it right? I told you guys before I start publishing every single day Yes, that's part of it publishing but eventually where's the publishing leading tours you publishing every single day should be leading towards an event a Conversion of it where you're trading where you're getting somebody to actually buy something from you, right? Like that's the that's a big secret now. How do you guys know mr. Garrett J? White? I post this on my podcast La la last week and so I want to I'm gonna play here just yes can hear this But I've been telling Garrett for a decade not quite decade seven years probably six seven years It's like hey gear This is how we build clip phones follow the model follow the model follow the model I kept telling him to do this right and he He hadn't done it apparently and he sent me this message last week talking about this model Specifically we're talking about so I'm gonna play this little clips like 30 20 seconds or so from Garrett So the private message he sent me when he actually finally did you know hashtag do it Russell says when he finally did Russell said And this is really cool. So check that out what Garrett said hopefully you guys can hear this Insert Oh man, I want to send you an audio. Thank you And I'm having one of those student moments Here's a student. Are you ready? It's a moment when you have your coach aka mentor or Leader telling you to do something for years and of course you don't do it. You're like, ah, you know, I'm not gonna do it I Don't need to do it blah blah blah. I've heard you talk about Doing a paid traffic perfect webinar every week for a year You did a 60 or 70 times perfect the pitch and offer that webinar that pitch you built 100 million dollar empire which is cool fun I am 17 paid webinars in live in 2024 with our current offer and We are liquidating and profitable and making money And I'm sitting here having this moment being prepped for another one tomorrow and watching your proof webinar content again And I'm just in here going dude. What kind of idiot wait for fault and yet my students do the exact same thing So your frames work. They're incredible and I don't see how anyone could think about automating a webinar without doing this It'll read 30 to 40 to 50 times and I know my content in and out every week We're like twist adjusting and tweaking frames. No wonder your presentations are so solid And what it's doing for me is allowing me to sell under a gamut structure that has deep containers for all of my energy Whereas up to this point, I just sell on energy dude. I just sell certainty I deliver by the bucket holes So on this glorious Monday wherever you are it might be around the world my friend Thank you for who you are and thank you for what you do and hope you're having a fantastic day okay, so You guys hear that Awesome, right? You're he said this is Garrett who's been doing this for a decade who knows his content I don't know how anyone could do it could automate a webinar that your 30 or 40 or 50 times prior Like that's the big a ha you guys. That's the big secret. That's how click phones became who we did Um So anyway, I want to show you guys because I'm thinking about that myself like I am going back I talked to my team everyone like I'm recommitting to this and so for me I am starting and I'm still trying for the details. I have traveling loss I'm gonna figure out how to make it all work, but it's gonna be amazing. I've been watching garrits gear does his He does it if you register for as you watch it He does not give you replay like if you're on you're on if you're not he does not give you a replay and it's done Um, and so that's another way you can do it. You can definitely not do the replay sequence like I do I'm not sure garrits numbers But I'm sure he's getting he's getting more people to show up live because he does not give them a replay It's like if you miss it you missed it and that's it and you're out. So Which is kind of cool. I've not done that yet, but very interesting as well. So Um Okay, so that's what I want to share with you guys right now When I'm committing to is I'm committing to on my side. I'm gonna be doing a live webinar every single week that I'm able to Moving forward. I'm I'm restructuring. I'm making a new webinar that I'm really excited for I'll invite you guys to the second instance. You can come come check out hanging out I'm creating that webinar right now and the second thing I want to do is is um, I haven't committed this part yet But I want to have a live webinar every single week And then that way the this isn't the fasting especially the reasons that those of you have teams and stuff We do live webinar every single the fasting thing is like This automated like everyone forgets about it. I don't even think it's like oh, there's something happening over here Right? We have a live webinar every week like everyone's thinking like the ads team This is the customer support team like there's energy in the office like everyone's like it just changes the Changes everything when that's the focus point, right? There's a focal point always happening where there's there's you're selling actually happening every single week Like the company companies are about selling we sometimes get so much like companies about management about this like no No, like your company's not selling like you gotta get a marketing and selling marketing and selling right like that's the whole point So it's like you gotta be you get it like doing this. And so anyway, um, that's the goals I have to live every single week and then once I'm not sure I'm gonna do it once a quarter or once a month yet. I haven't decided yet But once a quarter once a month, I'm gonna do a three-day virtual event That pushes people into a more of our high ticket and so basically all of these all of these These weekly events would all push into the bigger one and the bigger one to be worried to send people up to the highest level So, um, anyway, that's kind of the game plan of what I'm what I'm doing with my size on my side So because I'm actually committing to this myself right now. I want to actively commit you guys to this as well Okay, so this is what um This is what I want to to challenge you guys too. Okay. We already talked about like you should be going live every week Right building of your audience getting connection all those kind of things, right? I'm going live here on facebook I'm also posting youtube videos every week. I'm gonna podcast every single week We're about to up our podcast of two a week about to ump our youtube to two weeks. Like I'm increasing my volume. Um, it's interesting. I talked to um Alex Ramosy about how he's blow up so much and he was like he's like the secret. He's one of the secret lean in the secret volume More volume. He's like do more post more be more often I went hung out and yell at the other day and yell at post two youtube videos videos a day and six instagram Or six shorts a day every single day consistently boom boom boom like so I'm trying to increase my volume because I want to get more noise out there So you're gonna see me increasing my volume. I'd be louder and louder more stuff happening all driving to one course spot Which is my weekly webinar boom and that'll happen once a week and then I'll keep happening It'll keep happening and then from there again. It's a funnel, right? Here's rustle out in the world creating volume all pushing one webinar It happens every week those types of webinar are then get invited to the three day event happens once a quarterish And then three day event will push to world domination for that person and let's keep going through like that So that's what I'm gonna do you guys, but it's me coming back to just um hyper aggressive posting and you're going live going live posty every single platform being being you know Dean calls it um me present everywhere. I'm gonna go right here. See me. It's gonna be annoying to you But if there's gonna be like come hang out on the webinar come check out the webinar You come see the webinar like okay. I'm on fire. I'm in rustle sign me up I'm part of the movement and then we'll move move over from there. So that's the game plan Again, I literally did that um for the first the first year of click phones. I think we did I can't remember the number 70 or 80 live webinars I did uh before I had one that I started evergreen and then I just transitioned to instead of me spending You know three days a week doing webinars then I transitioned So I was doing it like once or twice a month live and then we were the off weeks I was I was doing evergreen one but I still kept rotating through I want to keep sharp I want to keep like up to date so I could keep giving that presentation Um and then by year three and stuff then I'm gonna start automating it Um, and I think that's one of my mistakes like if I could go back in time I would have continued that cadence at least once a month But because of that I'm punishing myself in a great way. I'm saying okay, Russell You got to go back to the foundation so the basics back to every single week So publishing every single day and for me multiple platforms you pick one platform do it once a week live event Uh, uh live webinar and then we're selling and we're having fun and it's gonna be awesome So that's happening my side of the world to you guys. That's what I'm doing So I'm committing to it. So I want to commit you guys to it How many guys will commit to first off creating a presentation worth doing this for okay? You got to go craft a presentation That's number one and number two is like since you got a thing down like okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna commit to this once a week I'm gonna go out there and do this presentation Like that's the key you guys. That's the big secret. That's the big aha Okay, and I know at first it's tough because it's like how do I get an audience? How do I get an audience like when you have webinar converts? It's not hard to get traffic Right Garrett said he's got 17 weeks in profitable every single week, right? Well, he means profit means like he's spent a thousand dollars ads the first time he made two grand right? So the next week you put two grand into ads and he made five grand next week put five grand ads I made 15 likes you don't have to go and like spend a hundred grand ads week number one, right? No, it's just about like like putting in what you're able to do the first presentation or do it to your own list And make some money from there like then reinvesting that money back into ads for next week reinvesting reinvesting reinvesting over time it grows and also by the way those who follow the linchpin model which Hopefully you keep up all my stuff. I know we're we're jumping in the dance to the deep end of the pool over here By doing that if you have continuity in the thank you page. That's how it everything grows on top of it.
