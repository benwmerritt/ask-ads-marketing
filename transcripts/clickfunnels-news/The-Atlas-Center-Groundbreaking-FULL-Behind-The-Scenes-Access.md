Lennardsen we are at the groundbreaking for the Atlas Center it is so cool so I got in early because we needed to like set things up and they're like Ben you're gonna help set things up okay him to work seriously I'm tired and there's a lot more than still going on like I think we're at the halfway point they're still they're outside so right now we just we're just now doing the groundbreaking the actual groundbreaking part and they're outside everyone's getting a turn doing the shovel thing into the dirt with Russell yeah I'll take in a picture it's like it's like the two comic of words like fun like in live but everybody's now going in doing that like with the golden shovel digging in the dirt and there's a long line and we're like you know we should go live now yeah it's kind of quiet in here so oh my gosh it's been amazing so they put Ben to work he kind of had to stand guard in a room because there's some pretty expensive stuff in these rooms and I got to play just a tendon I just got to be part of the part of the group go on the tour and it's been amazing so we went to the like library temporary library storage place yes you don't know there's two libraries right now there's two buildings and if you guys are following along on Instagram Russell's Instagram is literally blowing up he's showing you every single step if you wanted to see the libraries you can see them on Instagram if you want to see like how we set up the rooms and what's in each of them you can see it on Instagram go follow Instagram like it is massive how much is going on right now so do it because literally like they're grabbing image videos and stuff and they're doing it they're going to the computers and they're throwing it up as fast as possible so there's two different libraries one is just across the street from HQ and then the other one is down the street away and so we went to that one first and that's where I got to man the success room like so in that building you've got names they're all like going crazy you got Samuel smiles we got we got Orson Sweat Martin you've got you don't have you don't have Napoleon Hill he's over here you've got Robert Collier you've got a great showman PT Barnum you've got all of these names and they're just all over the place everywhere it is madness it is so cool and like your head's full of names and like my short-term memory is the shot because I'm like Russell went through is like okay this is what I love about this room and like taught all of us kind of what we what he loves about us that we could have that conversation with people and so we did that it ran well I think it went well it did it was it was awesome it really ran well we got to spend like a surprising amount of time in there looking at things and we were able to take pictures we weren't able to touch which is great like we don't want people touching at all but we could take pictures he pulled out hit so there was it was like in each room definitely go look at the Instagram in each room is like in the center it was like the library typical library shelves and then along the sides of the room Russell pulled out like his most like favorite things in that room and so it was fun to just have it all laid out we got to look at it they have these awesome like sheets printed out about if you want to learn about the author more and so I collected all those but I can grab because I'm studying them up it was it was awesome it was so cool and it was interesting like having everybody walk in because the first group with you guys you were all like really excited you want to learn everything like you came in the room you're like okay what's going on in this room and you want to know the second group was almost introverted in comparison so it was quiet but each of them came away with this increased gratitude for what's come before which is a really cool thing that's that's happening with this like because it's got all the stuff because Russell's putting together all the different pieces and all the different all the different things that make this even possible because he's doing all that like there's this added sense of historicity that's just here and it makes you automatically grateful it makes everything just kind of work and it's absolutely spectacular to be able to feel that I'm gonna be able to feel gratitude in the moment you're like oh my gosh this is how it progressed here's the people who we stand on the shoulders of we see on the shoulders of giants and are asked to become giants ourselves and it was cool too because people were coming through they're like okay tell me the one thing that Russell does with this what is what is the biggest all hot here because we're all trying to take ourselves to that next level and one of the thing that I noticed every name that was big they all had their own newsletter they all had their own magazine yeah I left there I'm like okay well I gotta go like create a magazine or something now because everyone that's in there has published in some form a magazine or newsletter actively okay it was heavy that's the key to success right there the master key don't let Robert Caller tell you anything different okay or Charles oh Charles dang it Charles the master key system there's so many different things that like it just all fit together it was beautiful so there's there were massive takeaways but then the group of people that were around like it's just crazy like that's Eileen Wilder right right right right and it's about yeah I feel the mastermind genius and so like we've got crazy people here and it's really cool to be able to rub shoulders like we have the the head of the Napoleon Hill Foundation and the Ein Rand Foundation they're both here and so it's just really cool to be able to be like oh I don't have this PC it was so much fun and they're like doing the tour with us so the Napoleon Hill Foundation what's the title I don't know so that's what I mean of them oh the people over it right like okay so the Green Brothers is how I remember Don Green yeah so they were in my group they're just touring along with us and it's like oh they're just kind of hearing them talking about things and just so it was and it's everybody here was a learner and that was the one thing that stands out everybody here is a learner and like there's more going on so everybody came in and meet and greeted and had all the enjoyment like of doing that which was really cool and then after that like we all got into the we had a welcome and we all kind of saw the vision of where it's all going and then we went and saw the two libraries once again all of this is on Instagram hey we didn't talk about the Napoleon Hill Library yet so that was your arm getting tired I'm gonna hold it for a minute oh but I'm on the wrong side okay we're gonna do this okay I'll hold it for a minute for a minute so then the Napoleon Hill Library which is like if you guys see Russell's podcast like the videos where he's recording his podcast he's in like the study library room one of the rooms is that and so one of the rooms is that the room where he's like recording that stuff but then there's another room that is Russell's private study room which he does not record seven here's the way for a sec and that was special because I got to go in there and we all got to go in there and actually look like okay this is like Russell's sacred space like this is where he does his scripture study this is where he does any of his studying and just the artwork in there and the sculptures and statues that are in there and the story so CJ who he I didn't know this but CJ is the one who sold Russell he said like 90% of his religious collection his LDS collection where is that light coming from? It's coming from right? I have no idea. Turn this direction. Okay and so CJ was the one that was in that study telling us because he knows that he was his collection before he sold it to Russell so he was in there telling us about the pieces and the books and the artwork and it was just it was the coolest thing that was my favorite part. It was a really interesting opportunity to get an insight into Russell. I don't think everybody has an opportunity so definitely look it on Instagram it's absolutely awesome but we're not done so right now everyone's doing the Golden Shovel they're all getting their groundbreaking moment they're getting pictures with Russell but after that Russell's gonna speak for just a second just talk to everybody and then we have a special guest coming on if you want to know who that is you need to follow on Instagram because it's really cool. Couple notes next week Funnel Hacker TV is gonna be different. It's gonna be very different. Very good way.

Alright I think we need to go get our picture taken with Russell doing some groundbreaking stuff and then we gotta go eat some sushi. Alright everybody thanks for jumping on we see you in the comments and we'll be back for a another update officially with some footage sometime in the future. Yeah sometime in the future maybe not next week yeah as soon as possible. Alright bye everybody. Bye guys. My name is Russell Brunson and I'm part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We don't rely on cash from venture capitalists to get started and we don't even have goals to go public either. In fact our motivation is the exact opposite. You see we have products and services and things that we know change people's lives. Because we're fighting against the big brands people with literally unlimited budgets we have to do things differently we have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that how is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks they will tell you what we are doing is impossible yet it's happening every single day and it's happening through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you it's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
