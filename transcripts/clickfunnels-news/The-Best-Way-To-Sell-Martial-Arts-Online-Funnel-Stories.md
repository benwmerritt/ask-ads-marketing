I remember like it was yesterday that was my sister's birthday and everybody else was in the kitchen having root beer floats. And I was in a different room with him and he was just drinking and he thought it would be fun to let me try it. So he did again and again. Which is kind of odd considering you're only four and you're drunk like shot after shot after shot to the point to where I remember walking down the hallway to go to my bedroom and couldn't walk straight bumping side to side into the wall just trying to get into the room. You know it was a rough ten years. It was a rough ten years. It wasn't my father. It was my sister's dad. He was my father figure and he was a third degree black belt and he was very physically abusive verbally, mentally and unfortunately he was a drug addict and an alcoholic as well. So any little thing that triggered him I was the source of his outlet I guess. I was his training partner I guess you could say but I mean I learned from it. It toughened me up. I learned how to take a strike. Unfortunately it shouldn't have happened that way but I think I've done okay considering the type of trauma that somebody would have to go through for ten years of their life. Lost my childhood from two to twelve. That's you know you're supposed to be playing shoots and ladders you know not drinking bourbon. My name is Tony Janini. I run martial arts businesses and I have an online site called dojohero.com where we help other school owners run better classes and help them to grow their school. I also have a two brick and mortar martial arts facilities here in South Jersey and we also do a transported martial arts business where we send buses to the schools around here and we pick them up and we bring them back to the karate facility. I met Dana in my karate school. She came to do kickboxing class. I only caught her coming in you know like once or twice before and the girl that was teaching it knew that I had a thing for blonde hair and blue eyes I guess and she said oh you guys make a great couple so she had introduced us. She's beautiful. I mean white dress, long blonde hair, blue eye sparkling. Yeah it was a sight to see. I remember we were at Eshalan Mall. She was saying that her legs were very very tired and weak. I just remember her getting out and only walking a few steps and then she had to sit down on the curb. So that was the very first like real sign that we both saw as far as like the decline in her legs like that was the first time that she ever had to stop. We had an appointment to go see a neurologist and they did CAT scans and everything else and we went to her office and we were sitting there and I just remember being very cold. You know said oh yeah you got an MS. She was like there's no there's nothing we can do. I mean we can just hope that we can stop the progression from moving forward and she got up and basically walked out of the room. It was about 18 months after Jack was born and then later on found out that sometimes pregnancy will trigger a dormant MS that's within you. I just thought to myself I'm like what is she going to do if something happens and she needs me here. You know if I'm at work every single night until eight or nine o'clock. So I kind of read the writing on the wall and started thinking about different ways to kind of curb that and figure out you know what I need to do in order to be home basically. I wanted to do something online because I figured that was probably my best opportunity to do something that I was good at which is martial arts and that's where I kind of found the drills niche for me because that's what I was really good at. That's where I first started to get a better idea as to what I needed to do and it also led me to realize that this isn't probably something that I'm going to do because working on a website that type of thing just was foreign to me. I didn't want to do it to be honest with you. I wanted to go kick stuff. I want to go hit stuff. I want to sit at a computer but I knew that it had to get done so once I realized that I couldn't do it I had to seek out somebody that could. I just remember like two months going by and it was only supposed to take four weeks to get the whole thing done and I kept getting the run around about oh yeah yeah everything's going really great the pages look awesome I'll send you over some examples. Cool. You know weeks go by don't get any examples don't hear anything don't see anything I don't even know if they started I don't even think they started on the site to be honest with you I don't think they ever even worked on it and then I never saw anything I never got anything. There was no way for me to know whether or not they even did one thing on that. It was very very frustrating you know having that inability to do something for yourself right that's dealing with a website it's painful it's painful when you when you have to rely on others to get things done and you don't have the power in your hands. This guy came over for an interview one day and he's like well this is what I can do for you and I was impressed I was like how are you making all these like how are you making all these pages like so fast oh I use a soft-article click funnels I had this idea and I was like you know what our industry needs this because martial arts guys when it comes to computers stuff building websites and that type of thing we're not that great at it and about two weeks of me playing around in there I had built 65 70 funnels from everything you could think of from parents night out to summer camps to lead generators like full blown out from page one the opt-in all the way to the thank you page like four or five steps I just didn't give up I was like there's no going the other way anymore I was like I gotta figure this out I got to figure this out there's no option and that was the best option for me. You know so many people make excuses and don't believe that they can learn something just because they don't like it listen I didn't like it and I'm glad that I learned it like I said it puts a power right back in your hands and then it's just what's your imagination what's your limit what are you gonna come up with well it doesn't really matter now you can come up with whatever you want and just build it. It's funny when I think about it because to think that I spent maybe 500 bucks on the camera the lights the lavalier and to think that I'm still using all the same stuff today within five year period I'm right at almost a million dollars just on the website by itself to have a website do that kind of number without having to put a ton of effort into it after the initial effort that's pretty good and when you think about the return on investment on what I had to spend on a camera and lights and a backdrop and then you put on top of it how many people you've helped you know the money's just a that's just a side factor you know that comes when you provide a good product. It's not that difficult what's difficult is getting inside your own head and letting that defeat mentality take over. It's that constant what we used to call baby steps in class okay you can't do this today that's fine take a step towards it and every day if you do that it's gonna compound on each other and eventually you'll be able to get to where you need to go but just don't over warm yourself because you can do it and it doesn't matter if it's a karate kick or if it's learning how to use click funnels if you want to be happy try to find something that you love you know for me how can I not be happy you know I teach martial arts to kids for living I mean it's the greatest job there is.
