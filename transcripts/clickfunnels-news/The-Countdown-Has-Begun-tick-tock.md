Yeah, trivia and treasures. Trivia and treasures. Yes. OK, last week I went winter with sweatshirt. This time we're going back to summer because we want you guys to come to Florida for funnelhacking live. And it's hot. It's hot in Florida. So bring your beach towel if you're the winner of this. OK, so trivia question is, what does Mifkey stand for? The acronym we say all the time. Sometimes we don't always explain what it is when we're talking about it. So here's your moment. What is what does Mifkey stand for? Is it a most incredible funnel growth ever? Be most interesting funnel genius ever or see most incredible free gift ever? So put your answer what you know it is or what you think it is in the comments. You can put A, B or C and we will announce the answer at the end of this episode. And we may choose a winner at the end of the episode, maybe after. See how many of you are there? That's tricky, too. That is so sick. I love that. OK. So as you guys are entering all of your all of your submissions, I am writing down your names and we'll see if we can choose you guys as we go. So oh, this is cool. Justin, I see you. Justin, I see you every single time and I appreciate you. I love you, brother. Mark, wonderful, beautiful. Cool. All right. So trivia and treasure. Step number one, step number two, Susan went somewhere. I think we all would have loved to have been. I think everybody wants to be a fly on the wall for this. Let's talk about Funnel Hackers on Location and where Susan got to be last week. Susan, where did you get? OK. Yes. So this is actually like the second week of this. We talked about it last week as well, but there was another round of it this last Friday is Russell's decade and a day. So you don't know what decade and a day is. It's Russell hasn't done it for like a few years, but he's doing it again. It's for his inner circle members to attend in person and virtually. And they get 15 minutes to ask him questions. It could be one question. It can be multiple questions, but they have a 15 minute allotment of time for both asking and him answering. So I got to go to it down the road, click Funnels headquarters and sit in for a couple of hours. And it was awesome. Oh, my gosh. I am so glad I was able to do that because I didn't really know what to expect. So I was like, OK, inner circle. This could be go one of two ways. It could be like they're asking like really high level questions that I'm like, OK, I'm not ready for this, you know, in my place in my business or they could be asking things that I already know the answers to and like be super bored. So it's like, I don't know what to expect. But neither of those things happened. It was awesome. I was actually was messaging Ben after I'm like, OK, I showed up and I have like been here for a couple of answers, a couple of questions and answers. And I was so excited. If I wanted to stay or not, because I had so many things I wanted to go do after bringing Russell's advice to them. I was like, OK, I could stay and like get more golden nuggets or I could leave and like go put something into practice right now. Yeah, I had a hard time deciding what to do. But I ended up staying till lunch because it was sushi day and I had a I had a partake in sushi day. But one of the things that I noticed between all of the people that were asking questions and there was we got to see during that video, several people. I got to see their questions asked and answered. There was kind of a recurring theme for most of them. And that is so some of them were like, how do I scale from this number to this number this year? How do I build out the rest of my value ladder? How do I communicate to my team and like not confuse and overwhelm them? These questions, Russell, pretty much gave the same answer to. So for a moment, can I let you guys be the fly on the wall with me? That's cool. Because you guys have the answers like in your fingertips. If you have ordered this book. This one, I don't even know where to talk about it. Yes, he most of the answers he brought it back to Lynchpin. He was like, well, you know, have you seen my Lynchpin framework? Or did you get the Lynchpin book? And guys, his answers that he's giving in our circle that they are paying him a lot of money for. Come from this book in this book. And all of those example questions that I just gave people actually asked and literally his answers to every single one of those questions was in some former fashion related to Lynchpin. You guys are all fortunate enough to have the opportunity to come to Funnel Hacking Live this year where it's all going to be about Lynchpin. So you have the book, you have a cheaper event than joining Inner Circle. If that's where you're at in life, you have opportunities to come and learn these things. Maybe not as directly from Russell as they were and as intimately as they were able to get that information, but you still get the same information. We all still get the same information just delivered to us in different ways. It was just so cool to be able to sit in there and realize that. I'm like, oh my gosh, like all of the things that he's telling them. I have it right here. And they stayed up like really late too. And they all went in and started like Russell went live on Instagram and on Facebook and they kind of did this like, what was your biggest aha from Funnel Hacking Live? If you notice all the people that are in the room in the Inner Circle who get to do a decade in a day have all gone to a Funnel Hacking Live. They've all been there and they all have a two comma club award. Well, how do they do that? They follow the simplest of frameworks that Russell has. Then they get there and Russell starts to implement the linchpin with them. If you're able to come to Funnel Hacking Live this year, this you get to take all of these ideas of the linchpin and see how they are ingrained step by step with everything Russell's ever taught ever since, aka the trilogy, aka the perfect webinar, everything you get to see how it all works all the way through. So first off, if you're like, I'm not sure about Funnel Hacking Live, you should go to Russell's Facebook page or his Instagram and go and check out this video. He did it last week as well, where everybody like in the decade of the day just came in on, they shared their story and it was like, this is why this works for me and my unique business. It was really, really powerful and really, really cool. So with that said, maybe we should go into some Funnel Hacking Live news. Maybe we should do some speakers and news. Because we are counting down. We are counting down to Funnel Hacking Live. I'm starting to get all my preparations in order. And we have 22 days left. We have 22 days. Guys, do you know what that means? Like if you start to count the days, it is nuts. We got so excited. We created something for you. Let's roll it. One more time. Funnel Hacking Live is lit. Wild. Epic. Prolific. Tick tock. Time is running out. Tick tock. Tick tock. The motivation that leads to the activation that leads to the transformation. The only event you need. As of today, guys, you have three weeks before Funnel Hacking Live starts. As of tomorrow, we are less than three weeks, which means if you guys want your tickets, you need to get them today. There is so much that is just going off the shelves and is like you do not want to miss out on all the opportunities that are available. Go to funnelhackinglive.com. Grab your ticket because I can't tell you what's going on. But maybe maybe I can do some some fly on the wall myself. I've been getting messages from Russell. All this is this is more almost more water cooler. But like I've been getting messages from Russell all weekend. Like what if we did this? What about this? What? And he just showed me like several things and that just blew my brain on. Like, oh, my gosh. And all morning long, like he's been flying people into the office now in order to prepare new things. Like in order to get all these things ready. He's like, you know what? We should pivot. We should do this. It is like creation. It's madness. It is utter madness right now with us preparing for funnel hacking live. And if you are not there, you're going to miss out on so much. Like I cannot even begin to fathom not being there because of how much you will lose out on. So here's the deal. If you have not gotten your ticket, go to funnelhackinglive.com. Grab your ticket and we can't wait to see you there because there is some crazy stuff going on behind the scenes. And let's talk about that for a minute. Shall we talk about the water coolers ideas for a second? Let's do water cooler. Yes, do water cooler. So the idea of water cooler guys is what if you guys could sit with us at the water cooler or click funnels and just kind of sit and kind of talk about what's going on? There is some crazy stuff going on. So over the weekend, Russell likes to spend time where? In his library. And so he went to the library and he just started going through all the stuff that Don from the Napoleon Hill Foundation is sending. Shout out to Justin. There is so much cool stuff. He now has all of the all the golden rule magazines that have ever been written. He now has them. So thank you, Don. That is spectacular. He's got he was going through. Like, did you know that Napoleon Hill created a personality assessment? And like, he's like, how many of you guys like want this personality assessment? He goes through all these things. It's right now. It's up on Instagram still and on his Russell, his personal profile at Russell Brunson. If you guys want to see like what he's going through and like all the stuff that's been sent to him, you guys kind of want to get a feel about where Russell's going, because as Russell's going through these ideas and he's creating the ideas for Final Hacking Live, he decided to go a little crazy. There he is showing like a manuscript that no one has ever seen from Napoleon Hill. Secrets of success is going to be so cool when he actually gets it going. But it is it's so good. And so this is the piece of mind manuscript. You guys can see all the different pieces. But he got so excited about all this, guys, that he started to write sales copy. Like he just sat down and like opened up Google Drive and just started writing sales copy. Russell does not get that excited or is like midnight. He's like, let's go. He just starts writing. So if you guys want to sneak peek at what's coming, you want to understand how he's creating his new Mifki. What does Mifki stand for? Let's pull it up really quick again. What is that question? What does Mifki stand for? Guys, he is creating a Mifki right now. And so let us know in the comments if you guys are here is a Mifki A. The most incredible funnel growth ever. Is it B. The most interesting funnel genius ever or C. Is it the most incredible free gift ever for a chance to win a towel that you get to enjoy in Orlando, Florida when you come to Final Hacking Live? So so much stuff going on. That's so exciting. Oh, I can't can't wait for the secrets of success stuff to come out. I'm itching for it. It's so cool because like the way that he's creating like the programs and the processes that are going to be talked about at Final Hacking Live, you get to see this and it's it's you get to see it live as he's like organizing all these different things. So guys, if you do not have your ticket, you need to be there. It's I was talking to somebody behind the scenes, Brant to see your answer. Thank you, sir. I got you down. It's potential for winning. I was talking to somebody behind the scenes that we did an interview with Final Hacking Live, someone who's written many books, someone who's very prolific, somebody who's blown Russell's mind multiple times and has helped other coaching programs. I'm not going to drop his name because I don't have any right to. But he was like, you know, this idea of the linchpin. It's very rare that you find somebody who is on the bleeding edge of where everyone is about to go and is about to move industries with one idea. He's like this one. And so guys, if you don't have your ticket for Final Hacking Live, go to funnel hiking live.com. If you do not have the linchpinning book, go to linchpinbook.com because just reading this, just spending the time reading this, your mind just starts to blow up with ideas. Oh, my gosh. And when you start to realize that every day in Final Hacking Live, they are talking about one specific piece of implementing this and how to do it from successful ways that we have done it over and over. You do not want to miss it. Hashtag live James loves seeing you, man. Appreciate that. So get your ticket. Can I I'll give I'll give a quick hint for the trivia question. Ready? It's in linchpin. What page is it? What page? We have your linchpin book. It's page 73. Page 73. Page 73. If you guys have the linchpin book, you guys get the right answer. All right. Amazing. All right. OK. Anything else for water cooler? I don't think that I think that's it. I think we're good. All right. All right. Well, let's go ahead and move into our funnel forecast because we do have another event happening. We're counting down this one as well. Ben, tell us all about it, though. OK, this is cool. So I got to sit down and watch. So we we both went into the office for several different events. We love doing funnel hacker on location. We get to do that for funnel hacking live. It's going to be so cool to be able to show you guys like the little snippets. Nothing will like nothing will match the experience of being there. But we'll try to bring as much to you as possible if you're international and it's too late to be able to get your visa. If you have, you know, whatever your reason for not going is, we'll do our best, but there's nothing that can replace funnel hacking live. So get your tickets at funnelhackinlive.com. But. We were sitting at a event and I got to watch Dan Henry. You guys may know Dan Henry. Dan Henry was in the Air Circle program. Dan Henry is listening to Dan Kennedy. And everything Dan Kennedy is talking about is blowing Dan's mind. And Dan Dan Henry is just leaning in more and more. And so Dan went up to Russell and to the Magnetic Marketing team and said, I want to do this thing with you. I want to implement this lynchpin thing. I want to test this out with you guys. And I love Dan Kennedy. What can I do with Dan Kennedy? And Russell's like, well, you know, we're doing these things called dramatic demonstrations. Why don't you come on and do a free challenge with us? He goes, yeah, let's do it. So Dan Henry is doing a how to write like Dan Kennedy challenge. Just go to how to. I can't remember the URL. It's right like Dan Kennedy dot com. So you're going to learn how to write, how to get magnetic personality, how to create your magnetic marketing system and how to have magnetic selling power over three days of training. It's a really cool program. You're absolutely going to love it. You get to see Dan Henry just as he explains everything that is absolutely about Dan Kennedy. And if you want to see a lynchpin funnel in progress and see it and funnel hack it and save it for forever, you need to go. So once again, that is right. W R I T E with a pencil right like Dan Kennedy dot com. OK, really cool stuff going on. You guys want to make sure that you are registered because there's some really cool stuff happening. This is going to happen next week. We're going to give you a couple of little reminders on it. This is our main reminder. So here's the deal. If you guys are interested in it, you need to be there because it's going to be sick. That's going to be really cool. Awesome. Called the Dan and Dan challenge. Yeah. Oh, OK. OK. All right. We are going to do hacker heroes now because I've got my eye on a couple of things that I want to do in our community and make sure I have the right one. OK, I might screw up names, so please forgive me right now, but we'll go ahead and share my screen. Awesome. OK, so Margette just won or not just but received her two comma club award. Congratulations. But I love her post here where she was sharing her story. She said seven years ago. Seven years. For some people, it seems like it's quick that they get their get to that goal. Right. For a lot of people, though, it's not that quick. You they put in the work. And so just come and check out her post. It's awesome. I love how she wrote it. It's almost poetic. And there's like what they're doing now. Yeah, it is just awesome. Gratitude for the journey of entrepreneurship. Grateful for all of you being part of my journey. A lot of gratitude. Proud of my team. Proud of the impact. Proud that I never gave up. Amazing post. Amazing post. Congratulations. Go give her some love on this post. A lot of you already have and can't wait to see how do you spell her name again? Yeah, let's back up to the top. Yeah, it's Margette, M-A-R-J-E-T. So you can find her in the quick funnels group, guys. Yes. OK. All right. So hacker hero number two. I love this post also. What we have Sherry Mackey Ron running. She got her linchpin book, which we obviously love. Sherry is a chef. You see her other beautiful pictures over here on the side. And Sherry is excited about her linchpin book. She says that the book was easy to digest. She's intrigued by all the great step by step instruction. But she actually had a question. Can I get your help? And she thinks she's too close to the subject. So she's asking her question. Is hurt. Basically, the question is, is my business going to work with linchpin? Is the wrong model what she lays out up here? Is it the wrong model for the linchpin? And how can I have an itic offer? Can I get my Mifki? OK, like basically all the parts of the linchpin, she's asking for advice. A lot of you showed up. We want to highlight some of you in the comments. We have James Curran, of course. Love you. Showed up with great answers. So if you're also in the same situation as Sherry, we're like, I don't really know. I think seeing it being applied over and over and over is the best way you can start to see how can this apply to my business? That was also true during the decade and a day. It was like, oh, that business is totally different from mine. But I love that idea of what Russell just said about linchpin. So I think hearing it in in different ways is going to get your brain going. Also, Nadim Akram showed up with some great answers. So if you also have some advice to come give Sherry, come do that. Yeah, leave some comments on her post, but also come check out her post as well. I see you have some questions. I've seen some of you guys going through the book and like reviewing it chapter by chapter. Love you guys. You know who you are. I've seen you guys like just absolutely like devouring it. If you guys have any suggestions or support to give, please keep giving like this is an amazing community and we're trying to turn the tides in order to make sure that this is a community where we're not DMing and we're not letting people DM like mad. We're trying to give value and support each other in comments and make this a community. And so, guys, if you guys have any ideas, we would love to hear them. If you guys have any thoughts, if you have any questions, let us know because this is a community that we are changing the tides on and it's really cool to be able to see like everything start to shift as you guys do this. So first off, thank you for your questions and thank you guys for answering. Thank you guys for promoting and supporting each other. It's always cool to see. Always, always. All right. I asked Susan last minute to do something really quick. There's this option that we have to be able to do these things called funnel hacking with Susan or funnel hacking with Ben. And I wanted to Susan to talk to you guys and be able to share a little bit about like what it's like because every once in a while, things are crazy. I was the thing. I had to grab something for this and Ben has no idea where I'm going with this. By the way, because it just came to me while we were talking about Russell stuff. So. So what I what one of the things that I have been hacking, if you will, in a way, because we're funnel hackers, but I've been watching Russell do something bigger more recently. His secrets of success, his his school, his research, the research and library and the Atlas Center, my what's it called? Atlas Center that he's been kind of working on has become so interesting to me. And I'm just fascinated by it. So I've been watching what he does with it. And I actually recently had the opportunity to to begin my own little history like the library of old books. And one of them I started reading this weekend. I don't know if I should hold it up or not. I'll hold the back of it up. I'll decide maybe to hold up the front. But this book was in my great grant. Well, not actually this one. I have a story to tell about this exact copy. But this book was in my great. I think two greats, I think great, great grandfather's book collection. And I kind of acquired some of those books while, you know, in the last couple of months. And if you guys are following me at all, you know, I'm like building bookshelves to house them in because I'm like, OK, I have all these books now. And I don't know where to stick them. So I think one of the things that Russell is teaching us is that we need to. He has it to a much higher level than any of us probably will ever have the desire or funds to do, but preserving history, preserving. Books where knowledge has come from. And this particular book isn't marketing. It isn't even. I know it's not. I don't even have. I'll just follow me on social media if you want to know more about this book. That's not the point of this part, though. But I cracked open this book on on my my father's bookshelf where we were getting old books from actually comes from my mother's side, and I was like so intrigued by the first page. The first page like really grabbed my attention. And I loved it so much, but my sister was also there. And she's like, I want to read that book, too. And this book was printed in 1923 and we were both like enamored by it just from flipping through it. So I let her take the copy from my that's our family copy. And then I went and bought this book on Amazon so I could have another copy of it. So I could read it. So this isn't the exact one that came from my from my family's bookshelf. But one of the things that it says in it is, I don't know if I should read it or not. Basically, what it is saying is that we should have the words that they use in the book is that we should be egotistic, but in a way that is rising to our potential. If we do not have the desire or motivation or ego to rise to our potential, we're not going to be able to help people in this world that we are meant to help. And I am so excited to keep reading this book. But the main thing is that these ideas are not new ideas. The ideas that we're always talking about in the community and at Funnel Hacking Live and, you know, in our masterminds, they're really not that new of a new ideas. They may be packaged in a new way. Right. We got to create new opportunities. But they're they're found in history. And I think that that is so important. I don't think that anyone knows what this book is. I had never heard of it before. It's not by a famous marketer author. It's not by an author I've never heard of. But there are some really cool ideas in this book. So someday I will probably share that or follow me personally if you want to know more about it. But yeah, it's so cool to see that in history. I'm like, oh, I'm reading an old book. It's I'm like, does it smell good? Like Russell says. That's awesome. No, it's funny. Like a lot of the things that are taught in Linchpin, a lot of the things that are taught here, there are other like Russell has been very specific about like making sure that every time he has an idea, he gives reference back to the people who gave him that idea. Like he's very careful to make sure that when he's standing on the shoulders of giants, he gives them the recognition for the idea. But those ideas are lost unless they are brought back. And so like a lot of us have that journey where we're either a, discovering something for the first time or B, we're rediscovering something from the past that's forgotten that becomes our calling to share. And so that is so cool. Susan, thank you. My own book collection happening. So I'm glad that was the point of me saying like I'm.
