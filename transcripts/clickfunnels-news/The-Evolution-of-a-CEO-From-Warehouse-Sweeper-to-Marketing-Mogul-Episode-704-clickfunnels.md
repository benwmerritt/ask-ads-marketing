I never was the person who was like, I'm unemployable. I got to be my own boss. I want the freedom. I remember that guy. I'd actually never wanted to be an entrepreneur or business owner or a marketer. I'd always just wanted to be a pastor. But I was always the person of like, I can't be constrained. Like I got to be allowed to build. My first job in marketing was when I was 16 years old. Before that, I sweep the warehouse and did some construction. You know, I think our agency went from zero to 118K and monthly recurring revenue in like 86 days. It was just rapid, rapid growth. And at the end of it, we were doing 2.3 million a month in revenue.

And we've got to guess that I know you guys are going to love today. And before we get into that, I need to give my man, Chris Cameron, the mic as the co-host. Chris, what's up, dude? Oh, hey, Ben. What's up? Good to see you. And we've got a guest that is, at this point in his career, an absolute mogul in the paid media space, probably the smartest walking, talking human in terms of the persuasion of the written word. Someone that has worked for amazing companies in this industry will let him get into that. He's learned from some amazing people. And now he's teaching amazing things. And super excited to welcome Aston Shanks to ClickFunnels Radio. Aston, how are you, man? Wow. What an intro, bro. I don't know if I've ever been called a mogul before. I was going to ask that. I saw your eyebrows kind of go up like mogul. Hey. Yeah, go back deep. And close that one. Yeah. It's going on the Instagram bio. It's in my LinkedIn. That's right. That's awesome. And we are super excited and honored to have you on here to share a lot about what you've learned and kind of what's gotten you to this point. Yeah, man. I'm excited. Where do you want to start? Super cool. I mean, I'd want to start from when you and I, I guess, personally met. I remember you telling stories about packaging eBay orders after high school or middle school or something like that. But I don't remember. I guess I asked that selfishly because I don't remember it fully. But it starts from the beginning, man. Yeah. Yeah. So my first job in marketing was when I was 16 years old. Before that, I sweeped a warehouse and did some construction. And I had a buddy who worked at this old ladies house after school. And apparently they sold cell phone parts on eBay. And one day he was like, yo, we need some extra help. Like, could you come over and help us do this? And so went over. And at 16, it's like just one of those fun jobs, right? Like I'm just hanging out in the garage, playing music, sunflower seeds, and I'm just packaging up orders. I'm getting paid. That's cool. Well, the company, they started to grow pretty quickly. And at that point, they're doing like $200,000 a year from a garage. Pretty cool. But they started to grow. We moved into a storefront. And then six to 12 months in there, like, hey, we should start a marketing department. Ashton, you've worked here the longest. Do you want to be our marketing director? And at 16, I didn't know what marketing was. But directors sounded awesome. So I said yes. And that was my first start in the marketing. And I'd always carried that habit of whatever I was doing, I wanted to be the best at. So at the warehouse, I was like, I'm going to be the best warehouse sweeper ever, right? It was the same with marketing. And so when I got into it, though, I really fell in love with it, the psychology side of it. I was in high school. I was in debate all throughout high school. And so I love that side of marketing. And anyway, long story short, that company, I worked there about three and a half years as their marketing director. And at the end of it, we were doing $2.3 million a month in revenue. Cool way. We had like 19 years old. Yeah, at this point, we'd been 18 years old. Yeah, 18, 19 years old. Cool. And I got to learn a lot. And the funniest part about this, though, this is the funniest part. If you look up that company, Flash Technology, Springfield, Missouri, you'll actually see an article from the Department of Justice about them that says, you know, Nixle Woman convicted of $80 million in counterfeit sales. Apparently, at some point. Holy cow. Yeah. So we sold self-emparts, totally legal. The partner was in China, would go to the Apple factory, same song, in the US. And we would sell them on eBay, totally legal. Well, at some point, I guess what happened was they were making so much money, they built their own factories in China and started sending those parts to the US for us to sell. And I never knew. Big stuff. Yeah, yeah. So basically, like two years after I left, a friend of mine like texted me, he was like, yo, isn't this the company that you helped build? And so you didn't you didn't get named Ashton or anything like. I mean, they definitely must have saw me because I was I opened them to Amazon. They were all eBay. I opened them to Amazon. I was on bank statements. I know that. But I was a minor. So I didn't get anything, you know, so that's my one of my best case studies. Wow. Yeah. So that was my first job in marketing. After that, I I'd actually never wanted to be an entrepreneur or business owner or a marketer. I'd always just wanted to be a pastor. I just happened to do marketing. And so I then eventually moved to New Orleans, helped by a church down there as a creative director for them. And then I was in sales for Verizon as my job and then moved to Seattle a little bit later and worked at Verizon there with sales. And this was around the time that the Sam ovens of the world started to come out. And hearing seeing this thing, I didn't know what consulting was or info. But I just started to recognize it. And then one day, essentially a buddy of mine was a client of a company called Trafficking Funnels and started making 20 grand a month, doing Facebook ads for people. And, you know, I remembered him from school. We were friends. I was like, that guy was kind of a goofball. If he could figure it out, he's making 20 grand a month. Like, I didn't even know people could make a month at this point. But I was like, if he could do it, I could figure it out because I already had this marketing background. I just never thought I would use it. And so started following them, started figuring things out. Was then a digital marketing manager for an agency in Seattle and managed some really big spend accounts like Google and Dell. And that kind of kicked off the marketing career. Essentially, long story short, eventually moved to Nashville. I got an internship with that company, Trafficking Funnels that I'd heard about and worked my way up from intern to copywriter, media buyer, marketing manager. Then eventually their director of advertising and then started my company in 2020. And, you know, been doing that ever since. Huge. Even out of curiosity, because you just kind of like drop some massive bombs and then just sort of like, oh, yeah. And then that happened and we scaled up to, you know, 2 million. And, you know, that was that even from the eBay business. And you mentioned, you didn't know anything about marketing, right? You were like, a director sounds pretty rad. I mean, what were some things you studied or maybe some things, you know, a couple of things you implemented that moved the needle there. Yeah. So I think it's a couple of things. One, like I'm a big reader, a big learner. If I obsess over, like if I want to learn something, I kind of obsess over it. And so, like, I remember the day I got the job, I went to Barnes and Noble and got Jab Jab Right Hook by Gary Vaynerchuk and then Marketing for Dummies. And those were my first two books into marketing. And from there, just kind of started consuming everything around it, right? When you're connected to Gary and his stuff, like all of a sudden, all these other windows open up. But I think the biggest thing that I did there was a couple of things. The main one was opening Amazon. I went to them and was like, I think this Amazon thing is going to be a big. And at the time, Amazon really wasn't around. Everyone just used eBay. And I was like, but I think Amazon could be a big deal. And they're like, no, that's a bad idea. Like we're doing well. We have all these stores. I was like, you know what? Let me build it myself. Like, let me, I'll do all the orders. I'll do all customer service. Like, let me just build it and let's see what happens. And eventually that was doing 1.8 million a month by itself. And so I think that, you know, strategic things like that. But then really on the marketing side, the funniest part was was kind of like more outbound relationship building. You know, I just started building relationships with other wholesalers rather than just the repair shops, which is where we were originally all targeting was like repair shops who needed parts. But I was like, well, if we could get prices cheaper than other wholesalers could get, we could go to them and they would buy a lot more quantities. And so that was probably the next biggest strategic move I made. Well, you know, it's wild is a lot of times you listen to these different stories and being an entrepreneur, like inside somebody else's company, often leads to that entrepreneurial journey. Right. Yeah. You see this opportunity in Amazon and you're like, hey, well, I'm just going to go do it myself. I think so many people, if they're working for somebody, they wait to get promoted or they wait to get a raise or they wait to do all this stuff. Instead of like, I see an opportunity and I'm going to go do it. Was that one of the biggest reasons that you became an entrepreneur? Were you able to kind of cut some of your teeth as an entrepreneur first? Um, yeah, it's interesting, right? Because I never, I never was the person who's like, I'm unemployable. I got to be my own boss. I want the freedom. I was never that guy. I've always been a great employee and I knew what it was to serve and I worked hard. But I was always the person of like, I can't be constrained. Like I got to be allowed to build. And I was just very fortunate from a young age, especially in that first company where honestly, they were making more money than they knew what to do with and maybe not great fiduciaries of that money. But it was like any time this 17 year old Ash and had an idea, they're like, let's try it. Why not? And so I really got the chance of just like, I can come up with great ideas and try and see how it goes. So that was really lucky for me. I only became an entrepreneur, kind of almost out of necessity. When I was working at traffic and funnels as a director of advertising, I had was in Nashville, my family lived in Missouri and had some family having some health issues. And so I needed to move back to Missouri to be around them. And so I had to transition out. And by that time, I just had developed, I guess, enough of a reputation for what I could do that really was just like an instant inflow of clients. You know, I think our agency went from zero to 118 K and monthly recurring revenue and like 86 days. But it was just rapid, rapid growth. So it was kind of like at that point, it's like, well, I guess I'm an entrepreneur now, you know, like, I guess I'm going to just do this thing. When you decided to leave traffic and funnels to form human, did you was there a moment you're like, I can't do this anymore. You mentioned you never wanted to do that or you let, you know, you're a great employee. What was that tipping point like for you? Just to decide to transition out. Uh huh. At that point, it was family matters, you know, you know, at the end of the day, like you can look back on life and, and, you know, family and relationships is going to be the thing that like you're going to wish you prioritized, you know, and so I think by that time it was like, I kind of knew that I would be fine. I'd make enough to pay my bills and that I could figure anything out, you know, give me a month and I could probably figure something out. Um, and so I think it was just more of a family is more important and I don't really know what's going to happen, but I got to make this decision. That's amazing. You, you've now though moved into doing stuff with Eddie, you got bad marketing. Like what was the transition like to this now? What made you say, okay, wait a minute, there's another agency out here that's doing great and you guys kind of decided to merge. You want to talk about that a little bit like, what are the things that led up to that? Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, Eddie and I had known each other for quite some time. Eddie's the owner of an agency, his old agency was called Four Media and we met all maybe four, four years ago at a MassMind and just kind of kicked it off real quick. We could tell we liked, you know, the way we each other operated. I could tell how much excellence and conviction he had in the business. And then really Four Media was really well known for content and retention email. And they're really, really good at it. And we, at my agency, He-Man, we were really known for advertising, media buying, copywriting. And so there was a lot of times where we would have a client that would be using us for media buying and ads, but would be using them for like content or using them for email. And so our teams would work together quite a bit. And then three years ago, we started a MassMind together called Agency Founders. Basically, me and Eddie go to events all the time and honestly, we're just really disappointed in most events, especially in the agency world where it felt like everyone was just teaching people how to get more calls in their calendar, close more sales, but no one was training anyone how to actually build a business like culture and hiring and HR and operations. And so we decided to put together a MassMind and started that three years ago. And so we'd been business partners on that for three years. And then essentially, last year, long story short, we'd always kind of talked about merging someday in the future when we wanted to exit. But there was a situation that came up where essentially they had to rebrand their name. And he came to me and was like, you know, we've always kind of talked about doing this. We're going to have to rebrand our name. And so if we were to ever do a merger, that would actually kind of be the perfect time. And so when we looked at scaling and getting to exit and looking going, okay, we really wanted to build a hundred million dollar valuation, the things that we would have to individually build in our companies to get there, the other company had what we did not have Eddie had and what they didn't have we had. And so we spent about seven months really digging in. And it was just kind of one of those things of like, there's no reason we shouldn't be doing this. Hey, while you're enjoying this, I want you to check out something else we've been working on real quick. Why don't you let me invest? No, 5% Nope. 6% and that's my final offer. No. Oh, you want to play possum on me? How about 8%? What? Take one marker. Start off for the first final way challenge today and learn how to launch your business without any investors. You're supposed to go down in equity, not a 9%. It's great branding too, man. Bad marketing. And what is this for? Tell everybody it stands for. Yeah, it stands for bold and disruptive. Yeah, it's so good. You know, we just knew that like, what's what's the brand name? It's like, it's Balzy. It's bold. If you see it on a list with all these other agencies, you know, the big companies are like, what's ones should we try? Bad marketing is going to get your attention. It totally does. Yeah, yeah. So but you have to back it up. Like you can't just be average. Like if they can't go to your company and be like, hmm. You got to be so good that you're bad like Michael Jackson bad. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Well, internally in our company, we see uppercase. You know, is it uppercase? There you go. Yeah. That's awesome. Well, you guys, you guys proved it to a trafficking conversion. Like, I don't know. I mean, that party too, like these guys rented out this huge space and they gave everybody like, I don't know what do we get? I somehow I got like half. I don't know. Ben had like double what I had as must have been the new. Oh yeah. Right. Oh yeah. Right. But I don't know. You gave like every like two or three grand or something in chips and the winner that night and they had tons of different like, I think it was all blackjack and you guys had branding everywhere. And what did the winner come out with? The winner came out with like, I can't even remember how much chips. Oh, it was like 392,000. Yeah. Holy smokes. That it was so much fun. And like, you know, if you guys do everything in your agency, the way you do those type of parties, man, you guys are going to be top notch for a long time. That was a lot of fun. That was really cool. That was a blast for us too. You know, I had a boss one time that told me that, you know, every level is another devil, right? As soon as you ascend and whether you grow in revenue or size, employees, anything, there's unforeseen, I guess, circumstances that appear where you're like, holy cow, you know, in just everyone's learning, right? Everyone's going through this life learning. Since this merger, has there been anything that has sort of come up or presented itself that you're like, well, I didn't see this thing coming. Let's go ahead and, you know, keep on growing. Yeah. It's a great question. And ironically, it's kind of funny. It might even not sound true, but not really. I think because we had spent so much time vetting this, even behind the scenes before Team New, Eddie and I, like we had access to each other's quick books for like six plus months where we're like, we could see everything. And I'd known their team so much. And because we had been doing these agency founders events, like we knew their teams really well, they knew us really well. That there really wasn't too many surprises. I think the only thing that has caused friction or not even really friction is just more like this is tough is the idea of no longer being a solo founder when it's like, oh, everything's not on my shoulders. Oh, you know, it's so funny because me and Eddie are so used to like whatever it takes to get it done. Right. And so now having the conversations of where we've got to check each other because we have our individual focuses and going, yo, yo, yo, you don't actually need to do that. I got that. Like let me take care of that problem. You go do this. I think having that has just been more like the newer thing of like, oh, that's cool. I'm not the only person that has to deal with this. Cool. That's, that's nice. You mentioned going in like masterminds and everything else. These relationships, it's funny in marketing and that's Ben's whole job here too. Like a click funnels is these relationships. You also have a mastermind. How important is it and maybe explain why it's important to be in the right rooms with the right people? What has that done? Obviously, you know, your partnership with Eddie, but beyond that. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's so many things. Um, you know, and realistically, like with He-Man, I think that's probably the best way that we've grown is through just going to events, meeting people in person. Um, I think it allows you to build more authentic relationships and, and really people buy in large, the more sophisticated they become, the more the relationships matter. Like they almost care like less about who is the best and like, who do I like working with? Right. Once you've kind of accomplished the income part, it's really just like, how do I have fun? And, and how do I have fun with the people I work with? And so I think masterminds really allow that to happen. But also, you know, there's the whole thing from, um, um, who is Charlie Munger that's like, I'd rather live vicariously through the challenges and problems that other people have had to solve for me. Right. Oh, that's good. And, and so being able to glean the wisdom from other people has been absolutely massive. You know, and even me in my business career and my short leadership career, um, I definitely would not have been able to do it without learning the wisdom from other people. And I'm 28 years old. There's, I know very little, uh, but I have been able to be good at learning from other people, uh, realizing that I know very little and being able to be coachable, uh, and glean from other people. It's been massive. That's awesome. Have you had a scenario come up and I had an agency founder tell me this one time where they're like, it's hard to say no when you see that dollar sign on a contract where it gets mentioned, you want to work with people that you like where, and it could, this may in this scenario I'm describing, could not be a personality issue. Just whether it's a service issue or something where like this may be a pain to take on this client, but the money could be worth it. Have you had a snare where you have had to turn it away and actually say no? Oh, plenty. Yeah. Yeah. Plenty of times now. And I think, you know, that's why it's so important for business owners to really try to solve. I also want to know what's the biggest number you turned down. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. That'd be crazy. Yeah. So I mean, starting with, I guess the side of like turning it away, this is why it's so important for business owners to really try to get opportunity volume down first. Like as a CEO, if you're, especially if you're in info, things like that, like to nail opportunity volume, it's so important because that is the thing that allows you to say no. Right. Whereas on the opposite side, people don't have opportunity flow and they're forced to say yes when they should have said no. And A, it creates the bad reputation in the marketplace, but B, it's so much stress, so much headache and no one wins in that situation. So for us, you know, we have to do this honestly quite often inside of our info division because we have a performance side where, you know, the retainers are solid. They're normally anywhere from 20 K a month plus 25 to 35% of net profit. And so every deal is highly, highly valuable to our company. I mean, we're talking seven figures a year if you look at it. And so really on those deals though, we've had several, now it feels like maybe once a month where they're willing to do it, they're in on it, but we don't like the business or we don't trust the business or the founder itself is, we just know is going to be a headache. And the lens that Eddie and I have to have now is, it's our team dealing with them. It's not us. Right. And so even if Eddie and I have the skill, we know how to work these people, we've been around these people enough, we understand this like it's not going to be us working with them. And it's going to be our team. And if we burn out the team, or we overstress the team, or we churn team, because they don't like working there, it's way more costly than the revenue that we'll earn from this client. That's wild. And even on the flip side of that coin, have there been clients that you now have taken on to where, let's just say dollar wise, and this could maybe not something that happened recently, but just in your career towards like, they're really not going to move the needle fours in our bank account. But I can tell, thinking long term here that this would lead to bigger growth for our company, rising tide lifts all ships. Right. Are you thinking that they would just be a pleasure to work with anything like that? Yeah, absolutely. Plenty of times that you'll make that decision is like, this especially happens in agencies of clients that you've had forever. Right. Like you had them four years, right, when you're charging nothing, but you've just kept giving them the same cost over and over again, and eventually becomes relationship. But there are other times where you can just see the potential if you have a performance incentive, we have several right compliance, like, we might be breaking even on payroll. However, we know this business can scale, we know that they're willing to scale if we can crack the results. And if we can, the upside is massive. Right. Right. But we've had even one now that like, it's worked taken seven months to really get it to a place of holy cow. Now it's really, really awesome for our business. But when it started, man, it was just baseline level retainers. But now it's like, now there's been in 20 grand a day. And now we're getting percentages of all of it. And it's like, oh, it's all paid off. And so, you got to choose wisely. Definitely got to pick your battles. What, Chris, do you have anything? Cause I'm going to keep going. I've got some questions firing. No, go for it, man. I'm just, I'm enjoying all this too. I mean, my, one thing I want to know at some point too is it's easy to talk about successes. It's easy to talk about what we're so excited about now and how everything is going. But I also want to get a little bit vulnerable. Like, of course, what's tough right now, you have all this experience, media buying everything, Eddie has all this experience, you guys have come together. What's the hardest thing for you right now? Like, what are you struggling with? And that you're really just trying to like, what hurdle are you trying to get over? I think I've recently just come out of a very difficult season. And I think now it's, it's honestly felt much lighter and feels good. I think if I had to say the biggest thing I'm working on right now is just more of a, it's a transitional period as a CEO for me, like the, the life cycle, you know, to go from, you know, realistically, like we had human media and it was an eight figure company, but it was, you know, 40 people, you know, and now after the merger, it's like we're 180 people and we're going to have 22 million this year. And so big difference. How I have to show up and operate as a CEO is very different. And in, in probably a lot of people get this of when you transition from that, you built the business because you're a really hard worker, you're really good at what you do and you worked all the time, you solve problems. But now when you're in a position like me now, where the baseline level of the company is four layers deep, I can't be just the guy who fixes things because he works hard, it's very smart. I have to know how to activate people. I have to know how to think long term and efficiency in people in the right spot, you know, and patience, which is not something I'm normally great at. And so I think right now that's kind of the biggest thing of going, all right, we're trying to build this company to hear the next year. What does that CEO have to look like? And the weird things is battling even things of like some days, I feel lazy because I'm not grinding. I've had meetings and I consulted and I reviewed things and that's it. But that's exactly what I'm supposed to be doing. It's a great answer, man. That's a great answer. And it's vulnerable too. Like it's very real. People need to hear more of that of the entrepreneurial journey, like, especially on podcasts like this, we talk about, oh, you did this, it's awesome, cool. But, you know, we try to focus on, it's not always roses. So that's awesome. Well, this is a basket of roses compared to my last two years. So this is good. What do you feel like is going to be a tough transition for you 12 months down the road? As you guys continue to grow again and expand, grow employees and size wise, do you foresee anything that could be another lever of growth for you? I think so we're working a lot in acquisitions for our growth plan. A, because it's what I love, but B, because we are fortunate now to where opportunities, great, great opportunities are falling into our laps pretty consistently. And so I know that my next biggest hurdle is that there's probably much I still have to learn in those worlds. And being able to even just understanding lingo and understanding reading cap tables better and understanding multi-dimensional PNL sheets that have many subsidiaries underneath them and leading up into one org. And so there's a lot of things there, I think, but also probably discipline and wisdom. When you haven't had a, realistically, you look back six years, seven years ago, I had nothing. I was a nobody. And so when you have that very quick trajectory, there's that very, very real danger of like confidence is here, but skill is actually down here. And so I'm trying to be very conscious of that and make sure that I don't make dumb mistakes. That's, that's a very mature mindset, dude. Very mature mindset, you know, that's any superhero too, when they first get their powers or whatever, right? They're trying to figure this out. The old Spider-Man quote, like, with great power comes great responsibility. And dude, you've kind of experienced this, you're only 28 and you've got to figure out, man, how to wield that for good, how to have impact and income. And so I think that's a mature way to look at it. I appreciate that, man. Appreciate it. What would you say to somebody, and maybe I speak from the ClickFunnels lens, because sometimes you see, I'm sure you can test this as well, a lot of people when they're beginners, choose agency route, right? Low barrier for entry, where there's not a lot of cogs involved when you're starting out, right? You're only using your wisdom that you've accumulated accumulated up to this point for someone you six years ago, that is trying to start their own agency. What would you tell them to do? Very, very much figure out what you actually want to build. I think one of the things that when I started He-Man, I started building the company I knew how to build. But when I found up a year, maybe a year and a half later, it was like, I wasn't building the company I actually wanted to build. And what that just means is like, we were very successful. But when I looked at my life, the way I showed up to work, the way I led other people or culture internally, it wasn't what I would actually have wanted. It's just what I knew. And so I think it's very important for people who start the agency route or even just start any business is big, very clear, like, what are you trying to build this thing to do? What is it doing for you? If you don't figure out what you want the business to do for you, you're just going to be doing it for it. And it's going to have to control and you're going to work all the time and you're not going to be happy about your life. And if you're not careful, it's very quick to do that because most people are entrepreneurs or workaholics. It's just who we are. And it's not necessarily to say that that's a bad thing. It's just saying that that superpower that you have to be able to work 18 hours a day and love it can also be the thing that you wake up one day and be like, I hate my life. What am I doing? True. So if you start that way, it's great because a lot of people who start an agency and say they want to build an agency, really, they probably should just be a freelancer because you can make the 30 to 40 K a month very easily work very little and like, you're great, but you want agency agencies are HR companies. They're not marketing companies. And that's what a lot of we're seeing other agency owners now of going like, all I just want to do is marketing, but I have to do ops. I have to do sales. I have to do people. I hate this. This is terrible. I'm like, yeah, because you just wanted to make money doing marketing, but that doesn't mean you wanted to build a business. It's different. Big difference. Is that what you mean when you say they're HR companies? Yeah, like agencies live and breathe off the talent they have within their company. There's only so many accounts. Ashen Changs can run. And if I want to grow and I want to maintain reputation, I have to find other people that can have really, really good results to maintain brand, maintain reputation. And so basically all my job is is to find great talents, do a great talent, activate great talent and make sure that our talent is always great because that's the only way we're going to maintain a great reputation. And so all our job is is managing people. That's it. Wow. One question would be, you see these trends come and go, right? You see NFTs, you see bitcoins coming back a little bit. All these like buzz things, AI, like, is there anything that you guys are leaning into right now that you think is the future? And you're like, okay, we're going to now go all in on this. Anything in particular? As a marketing agency, I think it's kind of for a couple of different purposes. So on the first side, let's say for clients or what is our competitive advantage, it's very much data. We just know the more data we can acquire, whether they're like in December, we put in a decent investment into a software company that has a ton of data. And they're an email based company that we know will, a, serve our clients really, really well, but b, will actually become eventually a client acquisition system. But the thing that we loved about it was it how much data it collected, and the future potential of what that does for us, not only evaluation wise as a company, but also just what we can do for clients is massive. And so how do you actually separate yourself from just a service company, just a company that does email or does ads or whatever? What can you actually bring tangibly to the market that's like, it's separate, it's competitive advantage and data when it comes to marketing is like the thing. So it doesn't lie. If you acquire data, then it's huge. I think the other thing, naturally, for just promoting is just content. We're so, so all in on content and developing as much as we can there. I think Eddie is, he's way better at content than I am, which is one amazing reason why we emerge because he's just a naturally so good at it. And mine was like, how do I make the best product inside of the company, our service? How do I make sure that we're providing the best services across the board? And so we have a really good partnership in that way. Love it. Are you guys diving into AI much? We do and don't, meaning we are always looking, we're always testing, but there's nothing that we're just like, this is it. Got you. Now, chat, GBT has grown a lot. That's awesome. Naturally, every business needs to be aware of AI. It will change every business. No matter who you are, I don't care. It just will. But right now, there's nothing that we're just like, this is everything outside, but we're doing a lot of internal AI reporting. And can we have models being built and things like that? But nothing, I would say, that's revolutionary. Yeah, I got it. So you mentioned at the beginning, you're an avid reader. Love reading. You got a power rank, your top three books in order, but you got to go from three to one, right? Give us a teaser so we can wait for number one, your favorite one. And you have to pick any category. It doesn't need business related. Okay. Three to one. It was also on the spot for those listening and or watching. I'm trying to think of the number one. It's like two and three, I know. Number one is a Tuffy. I would say this. So number three is rehearsing death by Seneca. I would just say like in the last, you said last year, right? So that's fine. Yeah. So recently, top three be rehearsing death by Seneca. Number two would be super, super thinking. And then number one is the creative act. Why is that your number one? I think in the past season I've had in my life, I think I've had a lot of identity rebuilding and shaping and shifting. And there's so much of my life so far that's just always been work, hard work, responsibility, you know, very stoic about life and things like that. And over the last year and a half, I'd say I've really started like, almost like rebuilding of like, again, this is the life I know how to build. Is it the life I actually want? And rediscovering, I think a lot of even the parts that I remembered as a kid, like that was like me as a kid. And a lot of that is, you know, being artistic and, you know, loving to travel and, you know, a lot of metacognition thinking. And so I think a lot of that has been shifting and molding to where the creative act was honestly a perfect book for me of really showing you like art and being in the moment and being present and how do you do this? And there's it's written very poetically, which is like perfect. And so I definitely know that that one's been like the top in the last year for sure. Very cool. That's awesome, man. Yeah.
