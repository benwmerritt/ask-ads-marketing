What's up everybody? We live. How's it going? I am literally here. What's up, Ben? How's it going? Going good, dude. I just want to make sure you're all good to go. Are we live live right now? We are live live right now. What's up everybody? How you guys doing? Hey, here's some context. I'm at the airport jumping on a plane in like 15 seconds to go go hang out Dan Kennedy's event. We're speaking there. We're camera looking this right camera. There we go. Anyway, and but we started going fly every single day. We got live every single day except for Sunday for the last two weeks and I couldn't miss today. This is gonna be the best day ever. So I'm at the airport hanging out with you guys right now. Here with John. What's up? John's a day. John's a day to click phones and runs all the ads. He gets all the people to show up. So we're gonna be plotting and scheming on the plane. It's gonna be amazing. But I wanted to hang out with you guys today. I can't see your comments. Hopefully you guys are commenting if you are. What's up everyone? I miss you. How you guys doing? Where you calling him from? Anyway, so hopefully it's in here because echoing here. Anywho, Ben, should I just set up what's happening? Ben's here with me. Ben's in office today to help make sure that it's acting the roles. Yes, go ahead and set up what's happening today. You're good to go. Everything's all set. Awesome. So what we're gonna do today, Ben and I were at the office last night till two in the morning, two a.m. working on presentations, the perfect webinar slides and pitching because we practically preach we are product of the product. We do what we say, unlike most of our competitors, not that I'm throwing on the bus, but like, come on now, they have funnels. No, none of them do. Are they still playing this game? No, none of them do. I'm here with you guys. I'm one of the people. Anyway, so we're up to two o'clock last night working on the slides and presentation, right? What's your tomorrow? I'm like, Oh my gosh, just going through all the old fun hiking live presentations. And there's this one presentation. So how long is it like 20 minutes long? Yeah, it's about 14. Yeah, 14 minutes. 14 minutes. Okay. So it's the presentation. There's one year we did this thing called funnel frameworks. So I come on stage and we're sharing like different little individual frameworks. And I was like, Oh, Ben, do you remember I taught this one where I talked about emotion logic close and he was like, that was my favorite one. And we started freaking out. And so he found last night. So that's what we're going to share with you yesterday. The motion logic close, which is one of the most simple, the most powerful frameworks for closing. And we use it everywhere as you will see, we use it in on on our funnel pages in our email sequences in our retargeting campaigns, like everywhere we use it over and over and over and over again. It's like the most simple thing, one of the most powerful things for you guys to understand and to master. And so that's what we're going to teach you guys is that framework. If you else they need to know Ben? No, any other than that, are you going to be on the plane by the time we by the time? I was actually walking through. I was walking through security right here, right when Ben popped up, are you showing up like, Oh, crap. So yeah, I'm gonna go through security. I'll probably be on the plane. So if I'm not here after Ben will pick it up and keep running with this afterwards. If I'm here, I'll see you guys afterwards. If not, then we'll be running it. But with that said, should we show them the show in the episode? Yeah, let's go. You guys ready? Let's go on comments. Give me some comments. Tell me you should go crazy. Say flies Russell, don't die in the plane whatever. Give me some good, good mojo. It'd be awesome. Yeah. All right. So that's our path to the band to pass it over to his presentation for funnel hacking live teaching you guys the emotion, logic and close. Sweet. Here we go. Alright, so this is the presentation guys emotional logic and closes the process. It's taught and like a secret program like you haven't taught this openly a lot of different ways. So if you're an expert secrets, you can find an expert secrets. I'll go ahead and find the pages for you right afterwards. And then we're going to go through all of this piece by piece. Now, Russell is at this moment flying over to flying over to Texas for the Magnet marketing super conference. So that's where he's going. That's what's going on. So we're gonna play this. Let us know what your biggest ahas are as they come. And we'll see you on the other side. What they start freaking out. I was like, didn't this is a framework that I've been using for myself for a long time. And I assumed that everybody knew it or did it. And one time we had a marketing meeting. This is probably about a year ago. We flew most of our marketing team into Boise. And we're sitting there and I remember mapping this out. I was explaining the layout of a landing page. I said, Hey, just you know, this is the three closes and how we use them on a landing page. And everyone went he was like, what they start freaking out. I was like, didn't everybody know this? Like, I don't think anybody knows this. You've never talked about it before. No one's ever shared it. I was like, Oh my gosh, that's amazing. So I've never really talked about this publicly anywhere before, besides right now and right here. So I want to kind of go through this. So I call this the three closes how to quickly double cells by weaving these three invisible closes into every step of your funnel. Okay, and this is what the framework looks like. And it's emotion, logic and fear. Alright, so step into kind of the the preframes. You can understand how how this framework works. So the first thing you have to understand, I learned this originally from Perry Belcher. I think Perry learned from Dan Kennedy, but I'm not sure. But he says something really interesting. He said, So if you look at at anything in life, the reason why people either move towards you or they don't move at all is because of this weird thing that we have as humans called status, we like to fill status, right? And so that's kind of the how this this, like all the selling is based on this when you start understanding it, okay, it's all based on status. And so when somebody's looking at any opportunity you offer them, right, here's the new thing, here's my product, here's my service, here's my whatever, what they're thinking about subconsciously, because subconsciously in their mind is if I do this thing, if I buy this product, if I move forward in this way, is this thing that I'm considering doing is it going to increase my status, or is it going to decrease my status? That's the psychological turmoil they have in their head every single time you can offer. It really boils down to that simple. Okay, is this going to make me feel better about myself or is it going to be worse about myself may increase my status or decrease my status. Okay, some of you guys are thinking, Oh, that's not me. I don't make my decisions that way. Okay, I'm not I'm not so self centered that I'm worried about my status all the time. But it's interesting to status works both ways. Some people buy really amazing things, like to say a really expensive watch or nice car because it'll increase their status like I'm gonna feel really good. Right. And so that's one side of it. Some people, they don't buy a car, it's really expensive because they feel like that will decrease their status, right? First time I ever shared this concept. I remember I was talking about a Ferrari and I'm going to share a Ferrari store here in a second. So I was talking about a Ferrari and I remember I was talking about you go to you go to buy a Ferrari you do it because you want to increase in status. And I remember a lady in the insurance hand, she's like, I would never buy a Ferrari that would not increase my status. Just that would actually decrease my status. Like exactly your your fears the other side like if I buy this thing is going to decrease my status. I was like, What do you drive? And she's like a minivan. I'm like, Why do you drive a minivan? And she says, Well, it's because it makes me feel intelligent because I know it gives gas mileage and makes it's safe for my family, all those kind of things. I said, So you bought a minivan because they increased your status. She said, Oh my gosh, I never thought about that way. I thought that everybody, you know, status was like this thing that was a negative connotation. But all of us do it. Okay. And so that's what you need to kind of understand. So as we move into this framework, I want to look at it through that that that frame of understanding status. Okay. All right. So the first clothes when we're selling anything is our emotional clothes. Now, motion is the most powerful tool we have for selling anything. Okay. And so that's why we spent a whole session last night for like two hours talking about the epiphany bridge and story. Okay, story is an emotional close. I'm telling you a story. I'm getting you engaged. All your feelings are happening, right? Okay. And so you're getting the emotion now motion, like I said, is the is the most powerful thing. And for years, this is the only way that I knew how to close it. I would tell stories that were emotional people feel it. Right. And then we go in there to buy things. Okay. And so emotion, people feel this emotion that gives them a status increase like, Oh my gosh, this is amazing. If I get this thing, if I buy this product or the service, right, I'm gonna have better style, I'm gonna have more happiness, more wealth, my physical appearance, I'm gonna feel better about myself, I'm gonna lose weight, I'm gonna make money, I'm gonna, you know, whatever the thing might be. Okay. So it's an emotional decision. Right now, if you if you look at the metrics, about 50% of your cells will come from the emotional close. And some of you guys, that's all you just the emotional close. And that's okay. That's what I did for probably the first decade before I understood the second two closes. But 50% of your cells will come from the emotional close. Okay. Now, this is a picture of Todd. Just like that red car. So this is Todd's red car. And I remember he saw it, and he was like freaking out, he's like, I want to buy this car. And he went and he jumped in the car, he sat in it, he drove around, he felt amazing. And he was like, this is amazing. Can you imagine driving this car every single day how awesome would be, right? And he's sitting there visualizing the increase in status, like, I'm gonna feel really good. People are gonna see this car, it's gonna be awesome. Right. So the very first thing is he's emotionally sold. He's like, this is good, I need this thing. Right. Okay. And so most cells happen emotionally initially, right. If I imagine you guys the last car that you bought when you got it the first time you sat down, you're like, Oh my gosh, this is amazing. Right, it's the emotion you feel of it. This is true to anything in life, by the way, think about the last five things you bought. You sat there emotionally like, Oh, this would be really cool to have. I want that thing. Okay. But then what happens is after the motion kind of runs its way, and you're like, I need this thing, I have to buy it. Then we have people we love around us. Like, for example, Todd, this is his beautiful wife, Ashley. And he's got to drive home in this car until Ashley about the emotional experience he just had. She didn't have the same emotional experience that Todd had when he first stepped in this car, I'm pretty sure. And so from there, now we transition to the second close, which is the logical close. So after Todd bought the car, he signed on the line, he voxed me and he started talking to me about the gas mileage, about how the resell value is so great on this car, and he's going on and on and on. I started laughing like Todd, I'm the most emotional person you have ever met, you do not have to logically convince me of anything. He's like, I know what I'm driving home and in a few minutes after logic convince Ashley that this is a good purchase. And so the second close is logic. Okay, and logic is all about avoiding a status decrease. Okay, so all of us we buy things emotionally and then we justify them logically. Okay, so if you don't have logic in your in your pitch in your your presentations and the way you're selling a big percent 50% or more of your audience will not buy even if they're emotionally moved to buy. Because like this is amazing. But like, oh, what if the decrease in status, right? They feel the emotion of the increase in status, they're excited by it. But then they fear the decrease of status like, what's my wife and think my family, my friends, if I drive this car to school, whether the other parents going to think like all the different things that they start freaking out about, right? They have this fear of the decrease of status. And so because that you have to also speak to the logical mind. Okay, and so the second close in any sales presentation is the logical close. Okay, so start with emotion, 50% of buyers come from motion, and about 30% of buyers will come from the logical close. So would you logically explain things mostly so that they have the ammunition they need to logically explain to other people so they don't feel a decrease in status. Okay, there's no logic in buying a Ferrari. I had one for a while. It was the worst car ever. If you don't plug it in every night, it dies. Okay, you can't jump in, you have to plug it in takes a week to recharge it. It's the worst car ever it broke down every time I drove it. It was insane. Like there's no logical reason to have a Ferrari. It's horrible. In fact, I was talking to other days like I left unplugging sat in the driveway for a week because we couldn't get it back. I'm like, it's the worst car ever. Right? Emotionally, though, man, it looks good. Like, I've, I've never been a hot girl ever. But when I drove my Ferrari, the two times that worked before I broke down every time, I would drive to the gas station and also men from everywhere would start popping up from the gas station and come around me. I was just like, and they're like, how many horses are in there? I'm like, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not a car guy. And they're like, can I get a picture with it? I'm like, I guess like, I feel so violated. This is the weirdest thing in the world. The other weird thing is you drive down the street and you see the other cars coming. And it was funny because the women driver never noticed any of it. But the men would be like, every single man. And I say to people like, flip around and speed pass me with their cameras, getting selfies. Like, oh, look at the front. I'm like, this is the weirdest thing ever. Emotionally, it was amazing. I felt like a rock star. Okay, but logically, it's the worst car I've ever driven ever. It gets horrible. Okay. All right, you understand, emotional is that increasing status, logic is about is protecting yourself in a decrease in status. Okay, and 30% yourselves come from logic. And then the third close, so we call fear or fear, FOMO fear of missing out. This is the urgency and scarcity. Okay, there's some people that matter how much status increase they think they're going to get or how much logically they convince themselves and others around them that they can buy something, they won't buy, they won't take action unless you're going to take it away. The fear missing out is the thing that gets the last 20% of people to buy. Okay. And so this pattern is happening everywhere. You guys will see it at this event alone, I'm going to be using this process a bunch of times on you. Hopefully you guys will respect that and appreciate it and see it. Okay. But I want you guys to start seeing where these things are we've done a lot of things. Here's some examples. Okay, so emotional logic fear. So just feeling this event alone. How many guys were last year's Funnel Hacking Live? And at the very end, I was like, Hey, you should buy tickets next year. You're like, what? You ran the back of you bought tickets. Where are my, where are my emotional buyers? I love you guys. Thank you for doing that. Yeah. So these are the emotional buyers. They had an amazing emotional experience last Funnel Hacking Live. They're like, this is insane next year, I'm going to be on stage, I'm going to get my award. This is the most amazing thing on earth. I'm going to commit to myself right now. I'm going to do it. Those are my emotional buyers. You guys all signed up before the event even left. So grateful for you guys. I hope by next year, you are all emotional buyers that would make my job of selling tickets so much easier. Okay. That's step number one. Okay, so we get the emotional buyers and it's like, everyone's like, well, I don't know if next year if I'm in a win award yet, I don't know if this what if the speakers aren't good? What if this what and like all the logic, right? Like, oh, what if I go and like, I don't learn anything new because I already know everything Russell's ever said, I've read all his books, I know everything that what and also the logic starts coming in, right? And so like the next set of closes for us, we start introducing speakers and each speaker, I'm like, here's the speaker. This is why you need to hear from them logically. This is the part you're stuck on. This person's give you that piece. Here's the next speaker. Here's the next speaker. Here's the next speaker. Right. I spend the next two months of my life doing interviews all the speakers. Everyone's like, okay, all right, so if germane's going to come, then I'm going to come because, you know, logically makes sense. I need that piece. Oh, logically, I need design hacking. If Catherine is going to be there, I'm going to come right. And logically, for two months, I start closing the next set of sales through logic, right? So the next 30% of ourselves came through the campaign like this, right? And they guess how last 20% of tickets were sold. Literally the last day when I'm like, hey, ticket sell out tomorrow and then they're gone forever. And all the rest of you guys are like, oh, oh my gosh, Russell been talking about this every day for 12 months of his life. I think I'm going to finally get it. Right? Let me close down ticket sells the next day people I didn't know it was closing down like I need tickets. I'm like, are you serious? Every day for a year, I've been telling you about this. It's painful. Okay, but this is the process. Okay. So I'm showing this because this is a typical campaign. We lead with emotions, we lead with webinars or product launch videos, things that things like that video is like, we're getting emotional close, right? Then we transition to the logical closes and we end with urgency and scarcity, right? Emotion, logic, fear. Okay, if you look at the perfect webinar script is strategically designed to do this exact same thing, the very first section of the perfect webinar is all about emotion. We're breaking false beliefs. Am I right? Then we transition to the stack and the clothes was a very law logical argument. Right about why you need this thing and this thing and this thing and the value logically convincing you why it's actually worth the thing you did. Okay, so if I go back step here, you're feeling the emotion of like, yes, this is an increase my status if I get the thing. And I transition the clothes like, what's my wife gonna say if I have to talk to about this? Is it really good offers or really good deal? Like what am I friends gonna think? What if I buy it doesn't work? Also, the logical mind starts freaking out. So I come in and I do the stack and through the stack, I walk you through that. I'm like, this is the offer. This is the value. And you're like, Oh my gosh, this is a really good deal. Okay. And you grab it your wife or your spouse, your husband, like, look, this is really good deal. Check out the offer. And they're like, Are you sure this is a good deal? And you're convinced them logically, right? And then at the end, call the action with emergency and scarcity. This is why you got to buy now. Okay, so that happens inside of the actual webinar script. Okay, same thing happens in the webinar funnel. Okay, at a macro level, you step out in the webinar funnel, the first part of the webinar campaign is all about emotion, right? They register, they get the indoctrination videos, they watch the webinar, like it's a very emotional cell. From there, we transition to the replays, which are very heavily pushing like the offer, right? We talked about go watch the replay. Here's the offer. Here's the offer. And then the end of the campaign, we do our urgency and scarcity, and our last 20% of the cells come the last day, when everybody's like, Oh, the software's disappearing. Now I must finally go. Okay, emotion, logic and fear. Okay, we also see in our landing pages. If I know that the best opportunity to have to sell is emotion, the top one third of my page is all speaking towards emotion. If you look at any of my landing pages, you'll notice that the emotional pitch is everything above the fold. Above the fold means without having to scroll everything you see on the page, it's all emotion. Right? And it's crazy if you guys use analytics, like the the tracking software, see how people scroll down. It's like most people never scroll past the initial thing, right? What happens is emotional buyers like this is amazing, boom, they buy. And then the logical buyers like this is amazing, but like, and then they start scrolling for more information. So they scroll down. It's like, Oh, here's all the emotional arguments about why you should buy the thing. We speak to emotion or speak to logic here. So my logical people who are typically more readers will start reading through the longer form of the thing, right? They get the justification they need. And the bottom is like my urgency and scarcity. This is why you got to act now. You start noticing this in all my landing pages, you'll notice top one thirds motion, next big sections logic last last 20% is urgency and scarcity and fear. Okay, same thing happens in my email campaigns. Somebody comes into my list, they join my list. My first few emails are all my first few emails are all going to be speaking towards the emotion. Okay, notice, I'm telling stories, maybe excited. And then I'll transition to like, Okay, let me talk logically why this is the thing you need. And then we end with urgency and scarcity and we close down the campaign. case happens inside my email campaigns. If you look at my value ladder, how we send people up through it, at each step in the value ladder, boom, this follow up sequence that takes somebody to that step of the value ladder and then moves to next goes through motion, logic and fear. Then you move to the next one, then boom, that X one goes emotion, logic and fear. So that pattern is we've throughout every single campaign is removing people through our value ladder and sending them up. Okay, it's also happening, not just not just there but in all our campaigns. This is kind of a map of my campaigns. So again, motion logic fears up at the top here, left hand side like here's here's where somebody comes to this page, they click on the ad, and we have our retargeting campaigns. Okay, even our retargeting campaigns follow this process, right? The first set of ads they see after they hit a landing page to click on ad are all very emotional based ads, right? Okay, and if they haven't bought off the emotional and we transition to logical based ads, and they haven't bought off the logical based ads, and we transition to to the urgency and scarcity ads. case what happens there in retargeting campaigns happens in our email campaigns happens in every single aspect, the pattern happens over and over and over and over again. So that you guys is the urgency and scarcity. The three closest framework you guys like that. Very cool. Alright guys, what did you think of that was that helpful? Alright, so I found out where it is. So if you guys look for emotion, logic fear and either dot com secrets or x four secrets, you'll only find it mentioned here and there. It's actually not inside of here. They talk about a little bit. But Russell goes into depth. You guys got traffic secrets out? Okay, so inside of traffic secrets on page 98, Russell starts to go through the emotion logic fear. Now we've been having a lot of questions about CRM. We've been having like, how do we actually get the CRM working? What about message? What about opportunities? What are all these different things? There's so many different options for you right now to actually get in touch with your customer. So maybe you're just saying, look, I just need to get my sales letter written. And I'm stuck. I'm not sure where I'm supposed to start. Emotion logic fear, he actually talks about it just a little bit inside of comm secrets emotion logic fear is the process. So as Russell's flying, I'm just going to give you a quick summer really quick. Go over to traffic secrets. It's on page 98 is where it starts. And it goes through all the different pieces. So if you're trying to figure out when am I supposed to be sending text messages, if you have the CRM fully set up, when am I supposed to be sending messages in messenger? When am I supposed to do all these things? How do I respect their time? Traffic secrets is going to guide you through that process. So what you need to do page 98 in in traffic is exactly kind of so make sure that you guys are over there. That's going to get you taken care of. Alright, so what were your biggest ahas is you were going through this? What were the things that really stood out for you guys? Um, yeah, there's so many different pieces inside of here and retargeting as well. If you guys are going to retargeting, I'm always talking to some about retargeting traffic secrets will show that as well. So make sure that you guys get into traffic secrets. It's got it's not just all the gold here. This is the place to be. So come in here get inside of traffic secrets go to traficethiers.com. Alright, a couple things that are going on. Russell is going flying right now over to Dallas. He's going to be on stage for the Magnetic Marketing Superconferences. The first time this has happened in a really long time. And so being able to bring it back after all this time is really cool. Russell is going to be on stage. We're going to be trying to grab all the shorts and different things that are going to be on funnel hyper TV. They're going to be in all the different places to make sure that you guys can stay up to date. But what I want you to do is we're still going to try to go live wherever we can. So we're going to talk and Russell back and forth figuring out what presentations we're going to do and see if he can come on in the middle of all the presentations just see if he can sneak backstage and be like hey guys check this out. So that way you guys get all the different details. And the only way to do that is to text make sure to draw the texting list. Now here's the deal if you're on the international list. Okay, if you're international, if you're like oh my gosh, I'm not inside the United States. The number hasn't worked for me. You can pull out WhatsApp today right now and go ahead and text. All right. So Russell's going to drop the text here really quick so that way you guys know what number you should be talking about. But this is where you go. So the event is not being streamed at all the super conference that is a in person event. It's really, really cool to it's a small group of people that all decided to go. So it's going to be really intimate, really, really powerful. And there's some things that are being tested. I'm just I'm ridiculously excited. So if you're going to super conference, let us know sharing inside of everything but make sure you guys get on the text list, use traffic secrets and this really, really cool script and we're going to be able to get this moving a little bit faster. So with all that said, get on the text list because you do not know when Russell's going to go live. The schedule is going to be kind of up in here. We're not quite sure. We'll see how it works. The only way to know for certain get on the list. All right. And Russell's got a really cool, irresistible offer because of course Russell does, right? Russell's got an amazing, irresistible offer that you need to get in on in order to be able to see what's available. So in order to get all the details and we will see you guys hopefully tomorrow. And I am kind of freaking out right now. I'm so excited. I just got a brand new phone. This is called my funnel hacker phone. And in this phone, I'm actually setting up a private community where I have a chance to text with my funnel hackers and people like you about entrepreneurship and business and personal development and all the fun things that we love to talk about. And inside of this, this phone, I've been sending cool stuff that I don't send anywhere else except for people in my texting community and I want to invite you to be part of it. Now, a couple of things. Number one, the first thing I need you to do is grab your phone right now and I want you to actually text me, okay? The phone number is 208-231-3797. I'll probably have it above or below or somewhere. But the number again is 208-231-3797. Text me right now. Text me, hey, text me what's up, whatever you want to do. And that's the first step. The second step is my goal is I want to get 50,000 entrepreneurs and business owners and funnel hackers on my phone here in the next before the end of the year. So that's my goal and my game plan and I need your help. If you will help me to get 50,000 people on here, I'm going to invite five of you to come here and fly to my office. We're going to hang out and I'm going to spend a day with you coaching you on your business. The first half day, I'm going to sit down with you. I'm going to brainstorm your funnels, your structure, your offer, all that kind of stuff. And then I have my top copywriter helping me with your copy. Our funnel builders, our designers, we're all going to come in and tag team and spend a day with five of you here in the office. It's going to be so much fun. So that's the prize. That's the reward. The way you can win that reward is number one, you have to text me. If you haven't texted me yet, you are not eligible to be part of this. I need you to text me. So you can be part of my texting community. Again, the number is 208-231-3797. I'm going to memorize that number, but as of right now, it is 208-231-3797. Text me. That's number one. Number two is every single time you help me to share this message, you get a vote. That means if you like the video down below, you get an extra vote. If you comment down below, you get an extra vote. You share this video, you get an extra vote. And if you comment again, you get another extra vote. At the end of this, after we have 50,000 people who are on my texting platform, then what I'm going to do is I'm going to pick five of you guys to come to our offices here in Boise. We're going to spend a day going deep into your funnels, your business. It's going to be so much fun. You work with me, my copywriters, my designers, my funnel builders, and we're going to get your business up and launched live. This is a free gift for five of you guys. So again, the way to win, text me. Stop everything you're doing. Pause this. Text me 208-231-3797. So what do you got to do right now? You know what to do. Text me.
