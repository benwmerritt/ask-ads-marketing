Yes you do. What got you that award? What specific funnel, if you don't mind, kinda diving into that for us. Absolutely, it was a book publishing funnel. What do you know? I know, imagine. Can I back up a minute? This is fascinating, I love this, because there's a lot of parallels here, and people need to understand how this works. One, that's a big part of how ClickFunnels grew, expert secrets, you know, dot com secrets. But one thing I wanna really dive into here for a second is this entrepreneurial mentality. And maybe at that point, you didn't have it so much, but Dean did.

We have an incredible guest that's here today from someone who I've had the pleasure of recently meeting, but has been in the ClickFunnels world and in the ClickFunnels community for quite some time, and has had some insane accomplishments that I can't wait for her to share with us. But as the co-host, Chris Cameron, are you also pumped to be back some players here? Yeah. Absolutely. I got my Taco Bell headset on. Like, I'm up here in the office with you. We're actually in two of these little soundproof pods, like back-to-back for those who are listening. Like, kind of cool to be here in the office, and Ben and I are just too loud. They don't let us out in the main area. They're like, no, you guys go sit in there where it's quiet. You guys can podcast away. This is going to be fun, though. I'm excited for the guest today. That could not be more true. If they could lock us in here, I think they would. But for those seeing, yeah, Chris's new setup. But today, we have an individual who is a best-selling author, turned her skill into an amazing business. She's a philanthropist, an amazing mother. But we are super excited to welcome Chris Colley to the program. Chris, how are you today? Doing great. Thanks for having me, guys. Excited to be here. Absolutely. And I like some hardware that you got behind you. Just over your head, like a nice halo, the two-coma-global. Looking good, girl. Two-coma-global lord, yes. I got to be breathin'. Got to breathin'. Yes, you do. That's awesome. Before we dive into some stuff, even briefly, what got you that award? What specific funnel, if you don't mind, kind of diving into that for us? Absolutely. It was a book publishing funnel. We did... What do you know? I know. Imagine. Right? So we did a challenge, and we sent lots of people through the funnel and had lots of people sign up and do books and do good things. And yeah, it was really cool. We're actually on our way to a few more of those. We actually have... We have to... We're going to apply this year for the next year's event. So we're super excited for that. Let's go. Heck yeah. And you're speaking to the right people, because that is our team. So after we wrap this up, let's talk about that, getting you set up. Absolutely. Yeah, you mentioned book publishing, and I know you threw that realm as well. And I really want to dive into that. But first, I'd love to ask you, what got you so interested in creating a business around books? Sure. Absolutely. So it started out, actually. So I was back in the day, I was doing courses and programs and all the things. And I knew Russell way back then. I had a real estate course of all things. And I was speaking on a stage, and someone came up and said, hey, you should come do this infomercial with this guy named Dean Graziosi. Do you know who that is? No kidding. No kidding. And I didn't know who Dean was at the time. And this company was in Utah. They were just kind of like bringing in speakers to do different things, different projects. And so we came into Dean's studio. I was like, all right, I'm up for a challenge. Let's see what you've got. I'm guessing this is response. Yeah, right? Got you. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This was a direct response. This was on an infomercial back in the day, dating myself, right? This is like 20 years ago. And so, yeah, so we flew down to Arizona, went to Dean's studio, and we did some infomercials. And the interesting thing was, when I got there, they were like, oh, we're going to do a book. We're going to sell a book on TV. And I was like, guys, I don't have a book. Like I have programs and courses, but I don't have a book. And it's like, oh, that's okay. We're just going to create it this week. And I was like, what do you mean we're going to create a book this week? Like, what's that look like? What do you mean? Right? And so I kind of learned this process for taking our material and turning it into a book. Then we sold that book on TV for like $25. And the cool thing that was really interesting to me throughout that whole process was it wasn't really about, I was like, all right, this is the fast way to create a book. This is super cool. But what was really intriguing to me, what really got me and what kind of stuck with me was the fact that the book drove to our back end 10K and 25K programs. And so really wasn't about the book sales. I was like, all right, this book sale thing is cool, but it costs a lot of money to run the media and do all the things, right? But I was like, all right, even if we break even over here, we made a little bit of money over here, back in the back, where we were driving people, of course on a book we'd live with value, we'd leave with value and give all kinds of value, but the book drove people to a back end program, a high ticket program. And back in the day, I mean 10K and 25K, that was like super high ticket. Sure. So, but that's really what that concept and that process, I mean, my list grew, my following grew, my influence grew, my impact grew. We were getting invited on stages. And back then it wasn't podcasts, it was tele-seminar. So, you know, we were, people were asking us to do webinars on their list, we go to our list, that whole thing, JVs and affiliates. And it really, really opened a whole new door for me to be able to see what was possible from just this little $25 book, you know? And that's really kind of what started the whole process. And then interestingly enough, when I sold that company, the biggest thing, I consulted for a while, it took a few years off, I consulted. And the most asked question that I got was, how did you like do that book? And how did you build a list so fast? Cause we had a very large list that we had grown from the book and people just, I kept getting the same questions, but they all tie back to the book. And I'm like, wow, this is interesting. People really want to know how to do this. So, that's kind of where it started and how it started. And, you know, fast forward almost 20 years and here we are. Can I back up a bit a minute? This is fascinating. I love this because there's a lot of parallels here and people need to understand how this works. One, that's a big part of how ClickFunnels grew, expert secrets, you know, dot com secrets. But one thing I want to really dive into here for a second is this entrepreneurial mentality. And maybe at that point, you didn't have it so much, but Dean did. What I mean by that is you show up and they're like, oh, you don't have to have a book, we're going to do it right now. Like, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Yeah, exactly. And this stuff, hey, by the way, this stuff still happens today. Russell, kill me if he listens to this. But I was just in his office and I was like, dude, we're shooting stuff tomorrow for stuff. And I'm like, are you ready? He's like, yeah, I'm doing it right now. And most entrepreneurs don't think that way. You know, and I'm helping facilitate training. I'm like, all right, dude, let's meet this afternoon so we can lock it all down. He's like, yeah, yeah, no problem. But most entrepreneurs, you know, can be wired that way, but most other people aren't. Is that something that you learned to kind of do? Like, okay, well, hey, we can sell it. And if there is a market for it, I know that I have the chops to deliver on it. How do you kind of handle that? Is that something you still do? Yeah, for sure. And I can relate to Russell so much on that because that's the way I roll. But back then I was like, okay, like it just showed me, that's always been the way that I rolled, but I didn't recognize the power of what was possible with it, right? He showed me that, hey, we're gonna do this thing, we're gonna do it this week, we're gonna roll it out there, we're gonna test it, we're gonna split test it, we'll see what happens. And it was like, oh, okay. But the fact that I think that a lot of people, maybe some of us are wired that way. I don't think that's the masses for sure. No, it's not. I select few of them. I struggle with it. Right, of course, that are wired that way. But the power of what it did, like when I saw it in action and I saw what it produced and what it did and what was possible, I was like, wow, like that was pretty cool, I'm gonna go do that again. And maybe I can harness the power of my crazy entrepreneur type A personality for the good and make really good things happen and big things in business and impact more people's lives. So it really just kind of opened that door to like, kind of sparked that kind of turn the light bulbs on for me a bit from the other perspective, which was really cool. Did you, as, so you were doing real estate stuff before that? Course it, yeah. Yeah, okay, but you're also an author. Like how did you get into, you know, was that the first book that you did right there with Dean? That was our first book. Yeah, so we did a couple of books doing it that way. So cool. And this is, this was before, this was before Amazon, it was before social media, before any of that. I mean, I think along the way somewhere, I can't remember the year, maybe 2000, gosh, what was it, five, six, seven, my space came about, do you guys know? Do you guys remember? Of course, Ben doesn't. He was just a baby in diapers, but I remember. Oh, do you say that people are like, what? Some people are like, what's that? But that, it was like pre-social media, pre-Amazon, pre-best seller or anything, pre-best seller list, there was none of that back then. But it was just the power of a book that, and even today to this day, like we did a book with Anthony Morrison, we never put it on Amazon at all. It was just something that we used for a funnel to drive people to a funnel, we sold it. It was pretty cool. So a lot of people now in the community, like the Myron Goldens of the world, I mean, there's a lot of big names that people know and recognize that just use the book in a funnel. And it's very powerful. And of course now it's like, oh, the best seller list and all the things and social media and Wall Street and USA Today and New York Times, all of that's around. But even the power of back then, before any of that existed, it was like just the power of using it as a tool to reach people on a global level and then drive them to your back at lead with value and then drive them to your back end product service, speaking, whatever it is that you desire to do. That's the epiphany that I had that I was like, ah, this is like incredible. And I didn't even realize it until everyone kept asking over and over and over, can you help me do a book? Can you help me do a book? It started off kind of like that, like one-off consulting. And I quickly realized as we got into the up to it, up in my neck, you know, neck deep, I was like, you know, it's really hard to control the quality and the time frames and all of the things. So I need to bring it in-house to make sure that we can produce books in a short timeframe and we can produce good books and we can produce the quality that we want and all of the print quality, all of that. So we brought it in-house and now we have a great publishing company that's done a lot of business and we serve entrepreneurs, which is so cool. Yeah, and there's something special about a book. I think everybody knows like, okay, why a book, right? It gives instant credibility. Like when somebody reads your book, they're like, oh, this person knows what they're talking about. Oh, they're a published author. But it seems like a really heavy lift. Like, okay, I have all these other things I want to sell. Do I really need to go do a book to try to go sell these other things? And is that where you come in to show them and break this down and be like, okay, stop freaking out. A book is not that hard, but it's essential. Is that kind of how this works? Absolutely, and it's not that hard. You know, I think traditionally when people think of, you know, publishing, they think kind of like old school publishing and how it was like in the 80s and 90s. It was a different model, right? It took a year, two years, three years to publish. And still, yeah, some of the older publishing companies that are like really well established, the names that people would recognize, it takes a year, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, and then... Is that typical structure where they're like prepay for a number of books if they like your transcript, or like, is that different than kind of self publishing or what you do with Game Changer? Yeah, so we don't do self publishing and we don't do traditional because we're not doing advances. We're not, because advances are like, these days, I feel like it's really difficult to get in advance unless you have like a massive list. If you're a type... Yeah, you're like a... And then you can send a few emails and sell a few million books, you're golden. But if you don't have a following, if you don't have influence, if you don't have a way to monetize yourself books, like a large list, we haven't seen authors that are getting like advances, but they're taking a piece of their... They're basically saying, okay, we're not gonna charge you, but we're gonna take a piece of everything you do for as long as you do it. And even though I'm okay with that model, what I'm not okay with is that how they control sometimes, it's controlled, like, if I wanna go back in and add a call to action or a QR code... Oh, boom. No, no, no, we can't do that. Like, you don't know, that's the reason I wrote this book. That's the reason I wrote this book. Right, right. And it is, it's definitely, I mean, of all the things, and being online and being an entrepreneur, there's a lot of competition out there, there's a lot of people doing digital things. And so I feel like it, you know, back in the day, it was like eBooks, you know? Remember the $7 eBook? And it was like, oh, an eBook. But I feel like a published book, a physical book, that you can carry with you, give to people, write a handwritten note, send it to someone. I mean, we've seen all kinds of things. And sure, it's more visibility, it's credibility, it's authority positioning, it's all of those things. But we've seen some really cool, like someone will come to us and say, hey, I want to be on this podcast or this show, and they're gonna charge me $30,000 to be on it. No kidding. And then they're like, you know, they write a book, it hits bestseller, they write a little handwritten note, they send it to that person, and like, oh, they come and write them on the show for free. And we've seen a lot of things happen like that. They get on a stage that they never would have dreamed they could have gotten on, that kind of thing. So it does build your business, it does build your influence, it does build the impact that you're having. So yeah, I feel like it's a critical tool. I mean, Ben and I were talking the other day about Russell, we're like, those books have done, those books that Russell written, they're amazing books, they're amazing books. But look what it's done for ClickFunnels. I'm sure it's, you know, who knows if we were to add it all up and go, how many people came from books? I'm sure it's a lot. Oh, it's the gateway drug. Yeah, oh yeah. For sure. And even Russell says, and I think he got this from Dan, and even, you know, I'm a disciple of Dan Kennedy and Russell Brunson, but book buyers are the best buyers, you know, it's maybe, you know, qualitative, but there is some sort of factor where it comes to someone buying a product on the internet, walking out to their mailbox, unboxing something that's physical and being able to hold it like you mentioned, something that has a physical presence, first an e-book or a lead magnet, et cetera. Yeah. Chris, I've seen you speak on stage multiple times, and this might be, I'm asking for some secrets all here. So if you shoot me down, we can even edit this out. But you've mentioned three main ways you've seen books being used as a way to grow your audience and email list. Would you mind sharing that with our audience? Sure, absolutely. So the big things that we see are speaking. The biggest thing that we've, the biggest opportunities we've seen are to come from the person authoring a book, somebody who had an author to book the author a book, and they get invited on podcasts and stages that they just dreamed about before. That's one of the biggest things that driving it to the back end. The second thing that we've seen, and again, we're publishing like this month alone, we have 133 books in our queue. So we're publishing a lot of books. So we see, not just like from one perspective, but we're seeing it from hundreds of authors for perspectives every single month. And the other thing that we're seeing is business growth. We're seeing that they're using it to drive, like it's interesting. The event I was at where we met Ben, not too long back, that person hosting that event said, this is what I, every time I come up with something, like an offer, I put a book in front of it, right? And that book, then that offer, that's the very front of everything that I do, and then it rides all the way out. And then I'm using that as my offer. That's like the one thing that kind of leads. My offer leads with the book. And so we see that a lot, a whole lot. And the other thing that we see, and the business growth is like selling their products or services, they're consulting, software, whatever it is that they have on the back end. Then the other thing that we see a lot is building a list. It's a, everyone's doing kind of the low ticket products and services, like the book is like the best, lowest hanging fruit, lowest ticket product you could have out there using it to build your list. And whether it's like a free plus ship or a free gift funnel, whatever, because we use funnels with all of our books and all of our launches, absolutely. And people will say, sometimes somebody who comes from the corporate world will say, well, do I really need that funnel? Like when they don't understand funnels, I'm like, oh yes, not only do you not only need it, it's a necessity. Like it's not just an option or, hey, do I need it? You absolutely need that. Yes, you do. And here's why you need it. And here's what it's going to do for you. But sometimes when they're not from the crazy entrepreneur sandbox or the entrepreneur land, they don't quite understand if they're like, because we get a lot of people too who are transitioning from like, let's say they're like a CEO of a company, they're retiring, but they're not really ready to retire. They just want to kind of like, transition, but they're transitioning to like speaking, consulting. A book is the first thing. And then a funnel, those are the people that are like, what's a funnel? How does that work? Why do I need that? And so we talked about using funnels in connection with the book and how that really helps hardest the power of and grow your business. It helps the impact, the influence, income, all the things grow as a result of that when it's done the right way. So true. So true. And traditional publishing too. I don't feel like they quite understand it with the funnels. No, not at all. Yeah. No, their goal is to sell books. Right? When you're an entrepreneur, you're trying to make some impact. You're trying to make some income. And that can go 100 different directions. And then that lead, that first part of what we refer to as the value ladder is the book. That's the entry level. And then we scale them up and to help them more. And then obviously you can charge more. Yep. And I don't think everybody looks at it from that perspective. And certainly the old school perspective is just sell this book, make a little bit from the book for the next 35 to 50 years, and that's it. And it's really about way more than that. And it can be way bigger than that. It's just the author has to see it. And sometimes they don't always see it. And that's why we're here to guide. I feel like we're unique. We're kind of a hybrid publisher because we're not self-publishing. I mean, there's nothing bad about self-publishing. This isn't carrying the weight and credibility. And traditional publishing doesn't get the business sense of it. And we kind of take the purpose of having to offer and pull it together and put it out there to give the author the best outcome and result as a whole on the short term and the long term. If somebody's wanting to do a book, just give us an idea of like pricing. Do you? What I mean, is that a big cost? Is that a high ticket thing? What is it? Yeah. So we usually start right at about the $9,800 mark. And sometimes people will say, oh my gosh, that's so much money. That's so high ticket. But I'll tell you something. I mean, there's a lot of companies out there charging $150,000 for a book. I mean, they're out there. It's on their website, right? But when you look at the cost of something we do a little bit different than most people, I mean, we do build out funnels. And we do build out the, we have a developmental editor. I think the two biggest things are, because a lot of people are like, well, I'm just going to develop. I'm going to make my book cover on Canva. And I'm going to edit it myself. That's like the two biggest mistakes because the book, the cover is like the first impression, the first thing that everybody sees. You need a quality cover. And the editing, we're not talking like punctuation grammar spelling. That's a given. That's the obvious. But a good developmental edit where they're looking at the syntax, the tonality, the repetition, the flow, the readability, all the things. Stuff that they don't think about at all. Oh, they don't know what they don't know, right? And you know from all the experience and from testing and everything else. Yeah. Well, you have to, the editing, the formatting, the, the, I saw a book the other day of a big name person and you open the book and you know, all chapters start on the right hand side. It started on the left hand side. And I was kind of like, huh. So someone who ever laid that book out didn't do it right. Right. And I was like, oh, that's embarrassing. You know, it's embarrassing. I never even thought about that. All chapters start on the right hand side. All header pages start on the right and all chapters. I'm kidding. You read from the right and you flip to the left, right? Yeah. And this book, huge name. Everybody knows the name and it was, it started on the left. And I was like, oh my gosh, like the desktop publishing rebels. Yeah. And the formatting was, was done improperly. So it's like little things like that, but we do all the things in the funnels. The other thing that's different about self publishing is the distribution. So where does that book going to live? Is it only going to live in a funnel? Is it only going to live in Amazon? Is it going to? Barnes and Noble or what? Yeah. Barnes and Noble, bookstores, libraries, schools, universities. Is it going to live globally? Is it going to live just in the US? Things like that. And the one thing I will say about books like distribution matters, because even like when you do an audiobook, if you did an audiobook and just kept it to yourself on your funnel, cool, but there's Audible, huge, that's Amazon. And then there's things like Spotify and iTunes and, and nook and all these. There's like 35 to 40 places. The distribution of that book is what matters because while everybody's over here squabbling over Facebook and Instagram and YouTube leads, it's like, guess what guys, every place where that book is, is a lead source. So if your book is in 40,000 locations and you have an audiobook and a hard cover book and a funnel and all the things, that's like 40,000 places where people have the opportunity to purchase your book and online and at physical stores. So I feel like that matters. It does. Yeah. And you know what? I think we have like a reverse thing that's happening, right? Like we always laugh about what does Dan Kennedy call lumpy mail? Like a lot of times we'll send out these things like, oh my gosh, I something really cool in the mail. Well, me some lumpy mail. That's right. I just had to bail that out. I went to Barnes and Noble. We had a new Barnes and Noble in town on Saturday, excuse me. And it was packed and I went up to the lady. I'm like, I waited like five or six people deep in line to get this little book. Anyways, and I was like, is this just kind of cause a Mother's Day or like what's going on? She goes every Saturday. I'm like, no way. People love books. This is not going anywhere. The credibility in everything of this is massive. It is. It is. People do love books and people still love a physical book. I know a lot of things are going online and we can have funnels and do all the online distribution to like places like target.com and walmart.com and Costco.com. Those are great resources. Lots of eyeballs, right? But the physical books, there's nothing like a good physical. Like when you go on a vacation, you have time to read, which most of us don't have tons of time, but when we do have the time, it's like you want to dogged the pages and bookmark and highlight. Plus smell it, you know, Russell always gets caught on the word, the corny smell in his books. It's creepy. I'm just kidding. But you walk into Barnes and Noble, right? Are you walking to his library or whatever? Heck, yes. You smell it, right? It like it's a nostalgic thing. And I also have a question for you, Chris. Like, does anybody in the funnels that you've done and you've done so many ebooks kind of as a front end, do people really read ebooks? I don't know that I've ever gotten in like done. Okay. I can say maybe three or four where I actually get on my computer and be like, I'm going to scroll through an ebook. No, I don't. Well, I will say this, the couple of things, the advantages of ebooks and the things that I love about ebooks is that they're able to measure the pages read. They're able to track how many pages are read. Quick deliverability too, maybe. Well, well, yes. Absolutely. Like if I want to see something quick, I'll buy the eversion not because I'm going to sit and read it there, but I might want to scroll through the table of contents or see what it's always going to order the physical version. So the physical, we only use the eversion like Kindle version, the nook version. We're only publishing those because a lot of our clients use them as a lead source. They keep it at 99 cents. It's a little bit. But the people who actually read, engage, make it to the back of the book, take action, raise their hands to do business. Those are generally are coming from physical books. But I will say again, the one advantage I love from ebooks is, is that now everything that we do online is they're tracking all the data, right? And so they're looking at like the average pages read and something I think is interesting is like right now, the average pages read in a book is 115 pages on a digital book. So it's very interesting. It's gone from, it used to be way, way higher, like triple that. So the fact that it's gone down, tick, talk, well, all the things fighting for our attention, right? Yes. So it's really interesting, but even on audiobooks, like they can track that. And I feel like people do make it through audiobooks. I feel like people like us, busy people, I only listen because I don't have time to read. I just finished one on the plane this morning. Yeah, that I, that I had set aside for a month and a half. And I'm like, oh, I'm gonna play and gonna finish it. 100%. But that's another great lead source. Like a lot of people never put their book in audio version. It's like, that's, that's an incredible lead source. And it's a very, it's a good audience that people listening to audiobooks are busy, successful people. So if you have a business on the back and that's a really good audience to cater to and you're missing up, missing out, you're not having an audio version of your book, for sure. Yeah. And, and Russell says this to like, people will pay for the same material delivered in a different way. And they may pay a lot more. Like when he was talking about, uh, you know, was it, um, it was thinking girl, rich, first off, he got that book and he's like, Oh my gosh, this is daunting. Am I going to read it? And then he went and got the audiobook spent like a hundred bucks on eBay or something to get it. Yeah. I don't remember where he got it, but that's very, very true. So I love this niche though that you have, Chris, you are helping entrepreneurs specifically. It's not just somebody who wants to write, you know, a fiction or, you know, a tweener book or something like that. It's entrepreneurs. So you've helped a lot of entrepreneurs and a couple of those are family members. You have a couple of daughters that are really have gotten this entrepreneur spirit. So this is Maddie and Skye. Tell us a little bit about them and what they're doing. Yeah, for sure. So I brought my girls to, um, it was the year Tony Robbins spoke, whatever. I know a couple of years. I'm sure I know. Yeah. Yeah. It was the city was it? Uh, Orlando, I think. Okay. Yeah. Probably 2018. Maybe Orlando. So, so I brought them there and my husband goes, that's the biggest waste of money. They're their invention spans. They're not going to be paying attention to that. They're not going to listen. They're not going to care about that. They're going to sit by the pool. And I said, that's all right. I just want to like take them and see what they, just what they think, you know, bring them around, get them around this entrepreneur community. Sure. We got there and I will tell you, we almost missed our fight. That was the year 20. What like it has like an hour of presentation. It went like six hours. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Delivering like value, so much value. Yeah. But they were like on the edge of their seats, like taking notes and like, I mean, they were just like mesmerized. Come on, we can't be late. The next session starting, they absolutely loved it, soaked it in, loved it, came home, started something called the young entrepreneur school. And started teaching and started learning and doing it and then teaching other entrepreneurs and it's funny, they were kids themselves. So they were teaching like, I would say 12 to like 25 year old kids that want to kind of learn how to do funnels and how to do things. They had a lot of success in five months. They made almost $200,000. No way. Yes. And how old were they at this point? Uh, 16 and 19. Come on. All right. Teenagers. Super cool. You're sitting at home playing Fortnite, eating Taco Bell. Yeah. Like let's shift the attitude here a little bit. I'm talking to my kids. All right. Like you can go do this. Oh my gosh. That's amazing. Once they saw it was the same thing. Like once they saw what was possible, you know, they just made a lit, even a little bit of money. They were, their goal was $2,000 their first month. They made 11,000 and they're like, Oh my gosh. This is like, it works. It's working. You know what I mean? All the things. So once they just got a little bit of that bug of what, huh, well, I could do this or I could go work at Chick-fil-A or wherever. And not that it's bad to go work a job and it teaches kids great skills and all the things, but there's options. Like if I'm either going to go get a job and do this or I'm going to create something over here. So let's try to create something and see where it goes. And it went really well and that kind of lit up their entrepreneur spark and yeah, it hasn't stopped since. So they're still doing it. What are they doing right now? Same thing. Yeah. So, so they still have young entrepreneurs school and then Skyler is doing kind of like website and logo take. She went to design school at TCU and now she's in New York. Cool. But she's got really doing a lot of like the logo stuff and graphic design. And then Maddie's building funnels like a machine. So many both funnels for us and then other funnels, branding funnels and such. So, and she's loving it. She's like my two favorite things, sports and websites. So my, you know, funnels is it. So that's like her, that's, she's developed an entire business around it. So it's really cool. It's cool to watch because I'm like, I never like, I wasn't, I was kind of maybe secretly hoping I was like, I hope one of them turns out to be an entrepreneur, but I wasn't like, I didn't push it their face. I just kind of showed it to them. And now they're like eating it up and really recognizing the power of how much impact they can have and spreading good and doing good things and helping people and still making money and, you know, making a living. So it's really cool. I feel really blessed. So on how fulfilling is that like your own success versus watching your kids? Talk to us about that. It's amazing. You know, I always say to myself, if I had known what they know now, cause I kind of started figuring it out at like my mid twenties, I was like, wow, this is pretty cool. This whole online thing. And it's just funny to me that I think, man, if I knew what they know, what I know now at their age, cause I'm pouring into them every day, I'd be like unstoppable. Right. I still feel unstoppable, but they have 25 years on me, you know? Um, but I even, I hear it. It's so interesting to hear a lot of people now. Like, I think what, after the cold COVID thing, you know, I think people kind of like started second guessing, like, you know, maybe I'll change my job or maybe I'll come up here and build a funnel or this whole online thing. Like I have adult friends that are like, this sounds really cool, like what you're doing, but you know, I don't know what I would sell or what I would do or how I could do or would that work for me? Or, you know, it's like, they just don't know what they don't know. So they just have to be shown, um, by someone who's doing it. And then they, you know, kind of installs a little bit of belief, uh, confidence. Um, then they go out and do it and you make your first, whatever, 1000, 5,000, 10,000, 100,000, you're like, Oh, this works. You know? And so I think it's really great that that's the thing I really love about, um, I mean, most of our people, they're all entrepreneurs anyway, but showing them how the power of a book and like the funnels and the online thing, like how much bigger it really can be, just kind of opening their eyes to those things. Um, that's really where the gratification comes in, especially my own, two of my own children. I mean, it's the most gratifying thing in the world. I'm so grateful. Um, but I really love helping other people envision and see that too, because I don't think they have the, always have the belief or the confidence that they're like, yeah, I'll do this book thing. We'll see, you know, and then they go crush it. They're like, huh, I'm going to write another book. That's right. And you're over there going, I told you so. Right. Right. Yeah. I met John Gordon the other night at an event and, uh, for the first time in person through a really good friend and client. And I'm just like, yeah, I was on book number 30. I was like, Oh my word. Like, wow. Never. Yeah. You just really said another one, which is, and he has like, what is it like 19 New York times best sellers or something? So, but it was, it's really cool. It's like, it works and people come back and do it again and again and again. So it's a fun business to be in. And I, especially that we're serving entrepreneurs because it's like everybody has a cool story, you know, where they came from, where they are now, how they got there, it's fascinating. And then they're all doing something. They're all very, um, impact driven heart centered people that are doing good things in the world, which makes my heart happy because that's the side of fulfillment. It doesn't just come from the money side, you know, you're younger, but I'm not chasing the money anymore. Now I'm like, I want to do something that helps people and impacts people in a positive way, you know, very cool. And, uh, and high school, our team, we read the energy bus like as a team, like chapter by chapter. Anyway, I'm like super geeky about that stuff. I love it. Yeah. You know, John Gordon's a Clemson fan. Oh, just kidding. Love you, John. Um, actually quick, fun fact, someone who we all know, I don't want to call anybody out, they had said, they told me about a year ago. So. 2022 into 2023, they're number one lead generation and they have hundreds of funnels was a book funnel with the two step order form. Cause they said the buyers were their best buyers and actually. Their costs per lead on a two step order form, just the abandoned carts ended up being their most profitable segment. So even just from people who are even interested in books prove themselves over and over and over again. Yep. We hear that all the time and we don't only hear it, we see it. We see it because somebody who comes through your book funnel, like either a free plus ship or we also do like a free gift funnel and a free gift funnel. I like that idea. Oh, it's so good. And like one of the free gifts and when you think about a free gift, like you give three, three gifts, you've got to kind of meet people where they are. So the people who read the book and go, Oh my gosh, this is amazing, but I want a little more information. Okay. Here's my webinar, right? Or here's my VSL. So we give them that. Let me tell you something. Somebody who comes through your book and reads your book and then goes and listens to your webinar or VSL and then raises their hand for more information. That is a great lead. Those are great, great leads. And then the other thing we see is there are some people that are super. Like I'm a decision maker. I'm a risk taker. Like an educated risk taker, right? But I don't like, I don't take a lot of time. I don't do over my decisions. I don't like to think about it for a long time. So sometimes I just want to like, just tell me what it is and how to get it. Right. So you have like a book of call as one of the free gifts, right? Like schedule consultation for the people that just want to raise. They read the book. Now they want to raise their hand. They want more information. That's for the type A people who are like, just give it to me. What is it? How much is the cost? Sign me up. Yeah. And then you have something physical, tangible, something they can download. Something they can see, touch, feel for the other group of people. So you're reaching all three audiences and types of buyers with that. And that that funnel crushes it and it crushes every single time. Because again, somebody who's read a book, raised their hand, wants more information and you give it to them the way they want to consume it. Those are fantastic leads. So yeah, business growth all day long equals lots of good things on the back end. Can I drill down on that? Again, this is just me being nosy, but I get to interview people. So this is fun. Sure. What is, you know, you talk about book funnels and how incredible they've been for your business and we're a test of that, right? Like we have jobs because of the power of, you know, what you're talking about. What's one of your clients that sticks out to you specifically? Could you walk us through their funnel and maybe even no names or specifics? But I'm curious about price points, how they ascended their buyers, what they did to acquire them to begin with. Walk us through that. So, well, we honestly, what's funny is we do the same thing over and over because it works, right? So all the, if you go on our website and you see, you'll see a lot of names there, right? Just a small fraction of the names. But every single one of those, we like the free plus ship is great for over here kind of long term. But when we're launching the free book funnel where the books usually, the 99th, say Kendall 1497 to 1997 for the book cost 97 to 24, sometimes 2797. It kind of depends on the genre. If it's a hardcover book and it has a beautiful dust jacket and dust cover. When you put it into distribution channels, the, the, they, they take a percentage, right? So you want to make sure you have margin. So it kind of depends on page count and all those things, but somewhere between 1997 and 20, say 2797 for the hardcover 1497 1997 for the paperback book. So we're taking them through the book funnel. Almost every time if the person has a webinar or BSL, that's one free gift. The second free gift in a perfect world. If they don't have people in the back to take the calls, we don't always do that. But that's the ideal situation that they have people to take calls and they have like either a call center or someone working with organization. And so the, the consultation, scheduling a consultation, Calendly, the whole thing. That usually for high ticket then? Yes. Yes. For high ticket. And if it's a course, obviously the webinar is going to drive them to a course. Course. All roads lead to the backend. So book to webinar to backend or book to sometimes like a mini course, right? Or like in like Anthony Morrison, we did the audio book, the audio book, just like the first couple of chapters, right? So we give them a little sneak peek, like a tease of that, right? Cause generally we like to kind of stage that too. When you do a launch, we do the audio book after the fact. We don't do everything at once because we want to stagger the momentum. Like they get, they, they launch the book and then here's another wave of momentum with the audio book, right? Here's another wave of momentum with a mini course. So they get kind of another, like it's another reason to talk about the book because when you launch, people are like, okay, we get it. You launched a book, right? But then if you didn't launch the auto, but you can come back to like, hey guys, you launched the audio book, right? So they're like staggering those things, right? But we could say here, here's a sneak peek. Here's the, if they have a course or something, don't have a high ticket. We could do the webinar, the BSL, some sort of downloadable cheat sheet, template, something like that. And then the other gift would be like a version, like the first two chapters of an audio book or like a mini course, like a sneak peek into the mini course, put into a membership area, they log in, they see all this other stuff in there. So there's like an ascension ladder, obviously. But we've used that successfully, that whole concept. This way I'm explaining it every single time. And it works. I mean, it works beautifully. Every single person. Replus chip works too, obviously. It's just a little bit different than this that we're explaining with this. I hope listeners were taking notes or if you, you know, weren't paying attention. Re-wine, yeah. Yeah, you just got the entire framework formula right there in the last like two minutes. That is awesome. Yeah. Yeah. And it's proven over, this is over like thousands of clients. It's not just like, oh, we did this one time, it worked. I mean, we've done it over and over and over and over and over in our clients' ClickFunnels account. We build the funnels out and we don't like maintain ownership or try to like piece ourselves to the back end. We charge them a fee upfront and then they own the, we build it. We build everything out and then we give it to them. They control it, own it, they can change it and all the sorts of things. But so we built it out in their funnels, but it's in their ClickFunnels accounts. But it's a great, it's a great, it's a great strategy. We honestly got to that. We were testing different types of like free plus shit versus free gift versus, you know, these different types of funnels. And it's like that when every time we land on it, it works every single time. So it's good. That's really good. Yeah. Have you ever had an offer that maybe you would, before you knew the ins and outs of it, you know, as a client, maybe just consider a little bizarre, like an industry that you're like, Oh, I didn't see this one coming. You're like, wow. I knew this question was coming. Like, what's the weirdest? Yeah. Yeah. Cause even, you know, we were at Super Conference, Dan Kennedy's magnetic marketing two weeks ago, which was a, we put it back on at the four years of a lot of fun, but you see, you know, HVAC technicians, right? They have books, you know, cause they're, they're Dan Kennedy's disciples. Have you ever had a client like that that's just in a little bit of an odd industry, like a makeup artist or it's something that you wouldn't necessarily think. And it's, it's people that you wouldn't think. And it's like, we never judge those people because in the beginning, I was like, Oh, I don't know if that's going to fly. You know what I mean? I'm like, uh, they kind of have a back in, but how does that work? And it's, it's a little less traditional, but I'll tell you something. Like home services businesses and brick and mortar businesses. I mean, we've seen books do amazing things for people in industries that we don't judge anymore. You know, I mean, we get, we do get some really weird stuff. Sometimes we're like, yeah, I want to write a book about, you know, aliens abducting my mom. It's like, oh, we don't need that. We might need that. Yeah. I'm just kidding. We don't do that. We don't do, you know, cook bugs, fiction bugs. We don't do any of those things. It's just literally entrepreneurs who have some sort of. Secret. Product, ticket, service on the back end. Um, because really we're showing them and a lot of them know already. We've done it before and they know, but the ones that don't know, we're just showing them what's possible, combining a book with the funnel and the business and using it as a tool for business growth. That's really our niche and that's who we serve and that's what we're really good at. Um, but yes, we get a lot of weird, you know, this being an election year, we get a lot of people that just want to like tell us all their opinions and we're like, yeah, we don't do a lot of this stuff. It's like outside of our, we kind of stay in our own little sandbox, which is smart, which smart niche down. I mean, okay. So for entrepreneurs who want to, you know, you've done a beautiful job of telling people like the what, like, I feel like we've done a little bit of a perfect webinar here is like, well, go do this, go do this is, but you could go do it on your own, but if you want help, right? Doing this. So Chris, tell us how people could get involved with you. Like where do they go? How do they, how do they get in touch with you? Sure. Sure. Well, we get a lot of inquiries on social media, obviously. Um, I kind of drown in social media. I'm not going to lie, but I've got quite a following on Instagram and Facebook, LinkedIn, those are kind of our three primary platforms, but gamechangerpublishing.com. Sometimes people put an S in there. They say game changers. It's just game changer. No, us gamechangerpublishing.com. That's where you'll go in. You can see oodles of success stories and the things that we do or process, how we do, what we do. And, uh, yeah, always happy to have our conversation and talk about, you know, I feel like a lot of people, they say that 80% of the book of the world has a book in them. They're like thinking like, Oh, I have this book. They either want to have right for a legacy play or, you know, just, uh, for business or whatever, but they just don't know that the ins and outs, right? And so, um, yeah, we're here to kind of just have those conversations and see what it looks like and talk about where they are and where they want to go and we can serve. We're happy to do so. So love it. Well, you've been an awesome guest. This is like valued bomb after value bomb. Like honestly, great stuff. Uh, thanks for being such a good guest. We're happy to have you in the podcast. Thank you. Thank you for having me. I really enjoyed it. And, uh, yeah, appreciate the invite. Awesome. Thank you, Chris.
