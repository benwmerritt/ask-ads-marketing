Hey everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. We have a special guest joining us today. So excited about this one. But first, before we get started, make sure that you are signed up to get all the notifications, text FHTV to the number below, 208-231-3797. You can also go sign up for email notifications at funnelhacker.tv and get access to all of our past episodes. So before we jump in and introduce our guest, we're going to roll the intro. We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers, and these are our stories. Hello there, everyone. My name is Ben Moot, and this is? Susan Lennardson. And we are here with Funnel Hacker TV guys. We're so excited to have you guys here. When you're here, let us know that you're here. We are doing trivia and a giveaway today. So make sure if you have friends that want to be involved, make sure you tag them, make sure we're all good, so that we're going to go. In the future, I'm playing with the idea of maybe giving you guys who are watching the replay an opportunity to be able to get that as well. So maybe we drop it a little bit later. But if you want to be online, make sure that you text FHTV to choose 082313797, because literally, the notification is dropping now. So you're about to get a text message, hey, just buzzed. So you are getting notifications right now if you guys are not here, if you guys are here, welcome. Love to have you guys. You're part of the crazy ones. We love having you guys here. OK, today we have a special guest, and we're really excited to be able to introduce him to you and talk about it, because there's a bunch of free stuff you don't get, or that you do get for free. If you want it, you just may not know it exists. And so we want to talk through that, because there's a lot of cool stuff that's going on in the background. This is a super powerful resource that's available for you. You just have to be able to jump in and say, yes, I want it. So we want to be able to give that to you. But first, we want to make sure that we highlight a couple things from the past, including what happened all last week. For those of you who have FOMO, we've got you covered. And let's get started with a gift, shall we? Let's do trivia. All right. OK, this is going to give you actually a little bit of a hint at who our guest might be. So let's put that trivia. What we are doing is giving away the Funnel Hacker cookbook. Ben's got one right there in his hands. I've got like four or five of them on my shelf, as we're going to give one of them away. So if you can answer this question correctly, put it in the comments and you'll be in the running for winning a cookbook. So what types of services can I hire on the Funnel Builder marketplace? Is it A, Funnel Building, B, Graphic Designing, C, Copywriting, or D, all of the above? So put your answer down in the comments and you'll be one of the people that can win a Funnel Hacker cookbook. If you guys don't know what a Funnel Hacker cookbook is, I think you can only get that through a funnel now. Like actually, as part of, is it a MFK? I think it's part of the Your First Funnel, or the VIP on Your First Funnel Challenge. See, that's the only place you can get this, other than right now, right here, answering the trivia question, and maybe getting one for free. And it lays out all of the wireframes of funnels. It's like recipes for funnels. It's so cool. I reference it all the time when I'm putting stuff together for clients. Very awesome. Like, OK, how does this look? It's a heavy, amazing book. Yeah. So cool. You don't have to do it. All right. So put your answer down in the comments. Yeah. And we already got James commenting. James already knows. So James is ready. Tommy is ready. Yes. I've got one of those already, right? Yes. Hey, Jerry, how's it going? OK. So as life goes for everybody, I know we're all funnel hackers. All of our brains are just buzzing. It's like all the opportunities are present, but life still calls. All the madness is still there. And so every time we go live, we want to do like a funnel hacker moment. We just want to talk about the life, what it's like in the life of a funnel hacker. Susan, it's your turn this time. Here we go. OK. So this happens to be like one of the craziest, busiest days I've had in a really long time. I don't know. If you're a parent out there, like put it in the comments. If you're not and life's just busy anyway, put it in the comments. Like summer has started. Summer break. I got three kids. Today is Tuesday, second day of summer. There's like all kinds of activities happening. And I've been back to back with everything today of like running a kid here, getting back for this meeting, leaving that me, go get the other kid to that other thing. I'm here for like funnel hacker TV, and then I got to go drop somebody else off and then pick all the things, right? But there is like, I think I've been reflecting on this today. There's two points that I want to make. One, if you think you're too busy to run a business, like think again, check yourself. A little tough love here. Everyone's busy. Everyone's busy and people are still making it happen, right? The second thing is like funnel building, having your own business, being a funnel builder, or you are using funnels to create your business, gives us so much freedom to be able to go and do those things. Like if I was tied down to some other job, I wouldn't be able to run my kids everywhere that they want to be going to these different activities throughout the summer. So two points there. And I think that that's just like the magic of one entrepreneurship, but two, building your business in a way that can create that freedom. Sorry for you to make things that are important to you, priority. If you need to step away, you can go and do that. You have the means to do that. You're making money in the background while you have stepped away. That's what we're here for, I think. For me, anyway, that's what I want. I want to be able to do what I want. I don't necessarily need to be tied to stuff. So yeah, Ben, what about anything else to add to that? No, I absolutely agree with that. The hard part for me is a lot of us are not sure which thing to launch. Like, well, I could do this, or I could do that, or I could do that. Honestly, as long as you're building your audience, as long as you're going live all the time, for those of you who are on live, I see you guys. Comment down below. If you guys are here. But I do see you when you're going live. I see it all the time. I want you to know, like, when you're going live in the ClickFunnels community, Russell sees it. Russell scrolls through the community. He wants to know what it is that we're doing. You are seen, and when you are publishing, you start to create that momentum, or it doesn't really matter what you launch. I know people who launch little workshops here and there to try to figure out what they like, what they don't like. I know people who actually create a full-on product and do their dream launch, and they just run 100% towards their end goal. Really doesn't matter. The goal is to get started. There's no wrong way to get started, because you started and that's the way. So your job is to get momentum, get that movement. And when you do, you'll find that the ride is absolutely worth it, even in the mayhem. Because the mayhem still comes. It still exists. Can I add one more thing? Please. I'm going to plug a buck. Ben says, if you don't know what you should be launching or what you could be putting out there, I'm reading this book right now. Literally this morning, I've read it, and I have a bunch of pages. I don't know if you can see, they're dog-eared of the chapter, Finding Your Voice. It's like the first chapter, okay? Finding Your Voice. There's such an amazing framework that Russell's given us in that chapter of figuring it out. Just take the steps, move forward, figure it out, and in all the chaos, it'll become clear. You just gotta take action. Yep. Justin Benton is saying, live, I want another book. I want another book. So really quick, before we introduce the special guest, let's go ahead and toss trivia up one more time. Anybody can win the book. So if you guys want the book, make sure that you're commenting, why do we do this? Number one, we like giving you stuff. But number two, the one way to get this out and get more people to do this is for you guys to comment and react. When you do that, it helps to build the fire, so that we can get this to more people's eyes in the Funnel Hacker community. So make sure to answer the trivia question. If you hire on the Funnel Builder Marketplace, what types of services can be hired for A, Funnel Building, B, Graphic Design, C, Copywriting, and D, all of the above. You choose yours down below. Let us know what your vote is and we'll let you know at the end and the winner. We'll have the opportunity to be able to get a Funnel Hacker cookbook. Now, talking about the Marketplace, we're bringing on somebody very special today. So for those of you who don't know, if you go to funnelbuilder.com, you can register to become a Funnel Builder. You can go through the webinar or else it talks about what it is, how you're able to do it, how you get certified to do it, how you can walk across the stage at Funnel Hacking Live with the newest award that they're providing just for becoming certified. And so there's some really cool stuff there, but also for those of you who are trying to hire somebody and you don't know where to go, go to funnelbuilder.com and today, we're gonna be talking to the person who created the Funnel Builder Marketplace. So with that said, let's go ahead and welcome Lee Chapman. Lee, how are you today? Oh, where's the yacht? There we go. Oh my gosh, where's the video? Oh, please, having a little bit of technical difficulties, I think. Am I on? Am I on? Yes, there we go. Yes, we're here. I'm doing it. I literally just sent a message. As you were introducing me, I was like, oh, this is great. Perfect timing. Yeah, it goes here. Of course, absolutely. No, if there are any glitches or anything, we'll figure it out. One of the things that we like to do is we have a couple of topics we still wanna talk about. And so if Lee's having some connectivity issues, it's absolutely fine. Imagine that we're at ESPN or other, I keep using ESPN as an example, but there's gotta be other things like that where we're bringing on people who are able to talk through all the nerddom with us. So we've got you guys in the comments that are going crazy. We love you and appreciate you. We wanna bring people on every once in a while to be able to talk through those topics with us. And so because of that, what we're gonna be doing is bringing on guests every once in a while, and they're gonna talk through those with us. So let's go ahead and get started through that. Once Lee is back, we will bring him on. Let's go ahead and talk through a couple of topics. Really quick, there's some FOMO out there. I can feel it in the air. We wanna make sure that you're all good to go. So last Friday, if you missed it, Russell went live with a pulse. And let's see, Susan, do you wanna talk about that pulse really quick? Was there anything that stood out for you? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so this was the first pulse in a long time. The guys had a lot to cover. Of course, Ben was brought on, but they dropped a bunch of new funnel templates were there, they're in the account. So you spent a lot of time showing those off, really, really awesome. I feel like this was forever ago, but also like just a couple of days ago. I can't remember what was in it. So there was a deluge of different updates, and we went through them all with you guys. So if you guys didn't check out the pulse, go and make sure you catch up on what's going on with the pulse. But also at the same time, the main thing when we dropped is funnelsandtemplates.com. For $1, you can get 18 templates, plus two new templates every month. Those are new funnel, full templates, built, designed, curated for you. They're beautiful, absolutely spectacular, and they're yours. So we wanna make sure that you guys have access to it, but it's a whole dollar. And Russell was contractually required to provide something for it. And so my friends, you guys have it for a dollar. It's all yours, funnelsandtemplates.com. Go watch the pulse though, because it was a lot of fun. Russell had a lot of fun being able to give you guys it as a gift, because he bought the entire company. Just so you guys know, like he bought it so he could give you this to you and be able to give you stuff every single month. So if you guys are in that world. Not only that, but so the person who created the funnels and templates that he bought it from is still on retain, like correct me if I'm wrong, Ben, he's still on retainer. The Brussels paying him to put in like two new designs and templates every month. So not only do you get what's already in there, but you get all the new stuff moving forward. It's a dollar and it's all in like this really nice, easy to use area. And you can just find the thing you want, share it into your account and you're off. It's really, really cool. Oh, Lea is telling me he's restarting his router. All right. That's okay. We got more stuff to talk about. No problem. Okay. So the next thing that we talked about is what happened the day right before that. Did you guys miss the webinar? Because, oh my gosh, Russell unleashed secrets of success and told us all of the machinations and what it's all about. And if you guys missed it, like it's ridiculous. He showed his collection of books. You got to virtually see Napoleon Hill's typewriter. You got to see all the books that he's collected worth hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars on stage as he's holding them and flipping through the pages with you and giving you the vision for what it is that he is doing next and where he's taking us and how he's going to help support entrepreneurs to the next level with the Atlas Library, the Atlas Research Center. And this building that you're seeing is entirely CG. It does not exist. Russell like stood in a green screen. He revealed the entire video. Showed you how it worked. If you have missed it, oh, please go and check it out. If you guys watched it, let us know what was the biggest comment for you guys. I will count that comment for anything secrets of success as one of the answers for trivia. So comment, let us know what was the big insight for you guys. Let us know so that way we can help promote this because there's something really powerful about Russell's building. And we got to talk about that last time, but I wanted to make sure that you guys don't miss it. If this is your, the Funnel Hacker TV that you have been able to catch the past couple of weeks, do not miss last week's webinar because it was everything right. And it was absolutely awesome. Yeah. It was, it was last week and I'm still talking about it with people. It's a life changer. Like, okay. So the open house is the 23rd or the, the, uh, there, what is it? Groundbreaking. Groundbreaking. Thank you. So groundbreaking is on the 23rd. So if you guys wanted to get in on something like this and you want to be a part of the groundbreaking, he tells you how, um, we're going to both be there. Um, I'm trying to make all my travel plans right now because it's not utter madness at all. Um, and at the same time, like we've got a lot of cool stuff happening with Fennel Hacker TV, Funnel Hacking Live. So just pay attention, make sure that you're in for the updates. Um, a couple of other things really quick. We've been spawning some awesomeness out there in the community. And I want to highlight you guys because we appreciate you guys so much. Uh, let's go ahead and put up Ismail if we would. Ismail Mahab, you were spectacular. So back on May 11th, Israel said, look, I made 5K on my first day of my beta launch. It's just the beginning, but you all blew him up with congrats. You all supported him massively. So we want to celebrate the small win that he has made so far. And I would want an update, but at the same time, thank you guys. Like this is what the community is all about. It's all about this and it just keeps going and it's the madness. And it's what you provide. This is what makes funnel hacking a blast is being able to do this in community where people are so excited to be able to celebrate and give and support one another. Um, and so we wanted to celebrate, uh, Israel Mahoud as well, but we also want to celebrate you all. Thank you for giving. Thank you for presenting. Thank you for being there. And if you guys are not on the YouTube channel, we just recently celebrated James. Yeah. James, I know you're watching. We appreciate you, my friend. If you guys have not been used checking out the user spotlights. This is the, uh, this is not the brand new one. This dropped last week and we were in the middle of the madness. And so we did not highlight it, but, uh, James Curran comes on and he talks about what it's like to be the Lynch pin funnel guy. He's a funnel builder. He's a funnel hacker and he is going live all the time. He is doing all the things that Russell talks about in order to build the business. He is, uh, because of that, uh, click funnels tapped him. Click funnels tapped him in order to become an ambassador. And so he's an ambassador so you can see him going live every once in a while. Click funnels community, but we wanted to give you an opportunity to be able to hear his backstory, hear why he got into this, what he's doing, how he's moving forward. So if you guys on the YouTube channel, go and check out for click funnels official, all of the user spotlights. James is the second one there, but there are a whole bunch. I think the team said they just recorded their 25th. This is our 15th funnel hacker TV. We haven't gotten to 25 yet. So they are busting these out. Definitely recommend you guys check it out because they are beautiful and some of them are just, they touch you just right and keep that fire burning even more for you. So James, congratulations. We're so excited for you, my friend. So excited for all the recognition and everything. You're awesome, my friend. Uh, Randy, thanks for being on. Appreciate that. Uh, he's on the dang UK internet. But we've got him back. We're ready to bring him back in. Let us know in the comments if you guys are ready for Lee to join us back. It looks like his video is nice and smooth. So we should be able to bring him on and talk about funnel builder marketplace. Yeah, we're back. Here we go. I heard someone say it was a UK internet. It's the Nashville internet that would never happen in the UK. Nashville. I'm on my wife's hotspot. So, uh, glad to be here though. Two questions. One, can I enter that competition? Is that all right? I would love a cookbook. Oh, it wasn't another question. I was going to say James is fantastic. I love James. I literally just caught the end of that segment. Fantastic guy. He's on the marketplace as well. Right. But yeah, sorry. I've completely fluffed my lines on my big moment. Oh heck, absolutely fine. So number one, welcome from Nashville and up UK. Well, I grew up in Hartfordshire in the UK. I moved to Nashville, met a girl and settled down here. So, so I grew up in Idaho. My wife grew up in Georgia and when we met at college, she brought me home. So it's, I get the exact same idea. Like they find you and they bring you home. Yeah, I'm not allowed to leave. I get you. All right. So, um, let's go ahead and get started. Let's talk about the marketplace really quick. So Lee, can you give yourself, give us a little background about you and let's, let's roll some of the marketplace. So if you guys don't know what the marketplace is, we're going to talk about that real quick, but Lee, go ahead and let us know everybody, let everybody know who you are. So I am probably very similar to a lot of people on here now. Always wanted to start my business. I went to college, got a degree in software development. Really wanted to get into this whole analytics thing. Started out in an office and realized very, very quickly that I didn't like that world. So I did that because they kept giving me a paycheck, which was fantastic. But eventually I just stumbled across Russell's stuff. I can't really remember where it was, but know that it was, I mean, the education he gives you is fantastic, right? It's second to none. So join ClickFunnels, started building a little business of my own and it was very up and down. I'd have good weeks, I'd have bad weeks, good weeks, bad weeks. And my wife said, why don't you just look for something part-time just to make life easier? I said, yeah, that's probably a good idea. I could do that. Literally that same day, B.J., the owner of the funnel, Roller Dex, which he was brought in to now the marketplace, sent an email out saying, we need a community manager. We need you to chat with our buyers, chat with our sellers, do some events, all that stuff. And I said to myself, this sounds like something I'd really like to do. So joined at the marketplace part-time, within two weeks, it was way too busy. Had to go full-time and have a look back. So we're just growing. We're working heavily on building a community, showing people that there's a place to go to get funnel experts. I know when I was on my journey, you see all these people doing really, really well. And part of you wonders, am I going to do it? Am I doing the right thing? When we're on our own, when we're entrepreneurs, it's very, it can get lonely. It can get difficult. And that's where the marketplace can be a fantastic place to be. I like to describe it as fiver for clip funnels. Everyone knows what fiver is typically. We are fiver for clip funnels. So you come to us, you've got these experts. You've got people that know exactly what they're doing. They live in clip funnels. Half of them have been trained by Russell himself and certified by Russell. So they're truly experts. And yeah, that's how I got here. We've just started doing events, starting a newsletter. I'm now partially a funnel builder concierge. So if you need a funnel builder, I'm the guy that will help you. Yeah, do it. And now I'm on TV here, funnel hacker live. I can't believe it. Where does it go from here? I think I've peaked. This is the highest we can go. So. No, the thing is cool is you came on in order to support the Rolodex and these are people like, these aren't people that are fly by night service providers. This is a place where you find people who are vetted and like have results. Like I was looking at a post earlier today. And this just came through the community. Everybody was freaking out about it. This is a gal who's in the two CCX program. She's able to do all this. She has all the training in order to be able to make it all happen. But she reached out and got support from the actual community of funnel builders. And they all helped like the certified people jumped in and she's like, this is all working now. Like it was just a couple of tweaks that I needed and I didn't know where to go and they just made the magic happen. It's, this is the magic team. This is how it works. And so it's, this is where they're all housed. And these are the people that you're constantly taking care of. Didn't get that right. Yeah. I mean, the, you talk about James, James is a great example of the people we've got on the marketplace. They just, they just turn, they go above and beyond. And it's, it's funny to see because it, it sort of helps you go to the next level, the level of service they get. So when people come to me with a record, I ask you for a recommendation, they'll tell me about the business, what they're looking for. And I will send them one, two, three recommendations and the emails they get back are just incredible. You see these, the funnel builders just go all out and they're obviously not charging anything at that point. It's like, this is exactly what I would do. Let's have a strategy call. I can help you do this. And then, you know, the people just drive forward and the, everyone says they love the community. The funnel builder community, the click funnels community is just great group of people all in very similar, in a similar sort of boat, right? Trying to strive towards that dream. Don't really want to work the nine to five. Just trying to help each other and it's, it's incredible. We've got some really great people. I'm absolutely so lucky to have them and be able to send people there, right? It's so, my job is so easy because I know I'm just, I'm just the middle man. I hand them off. I'm like, they're going to be so happy with this person. It is brilliant. They come back to me and say, oh my God, thank you for recommending so and so. I just changed the game for me. I was lost before, but now, you know, things are flying. So yeah, if you want to get recommendations, send them my way. I've got plenty of people that are ready to help. So I was kind of a quick, like, qualifying question just in case someone's watching and they're like, oh, how do I become part of that? Are there any certain qualifications one would need to be listed in the funnel Miller marketplace? Do they have to be certified? Like, is there anything like that? Not at the moment. So they don't have to be certified at the moment. They ideally, because you're going to be, if you think about it, you're going to be dealing with customers. I try and put as many customers in front of you as possible. So we're getting people that, so I spoke to a guy yesterday. He's business is doing 20 million a year, wants to get to 100 million, needs to speak to a funnel, we order to sort things out. So you're going to be talking to people that are very new beginners entrepreneurs, you know, they might have read expert secrets and they're like, I'm like a few of these funnels. Can you build them? You're certainly talking to guys like that, like sales directors. So you need to have some experience in building funnels, right? You have to have some examples behind you. And it's, it's kind of like Amazon in a way where you'd go on Amazon and you typically buy things based on reviews. So like you said earlier, it's all about starting that fire. Right. If you turn up, if you come onto the marketplace and you just get yourself your first few reviews, you do the groundwork. There's a lot of people in the click funnels group that often asking for help. If you can help people get a few reviews, show people that you know what you're doing. You can just rock and roll. As soon as anyone can join, as soon as we see that you're hungry and you're willing to serve the audience and you know what you're doing and you're good at the job, we're, you know, we're right behind you. We'll pour as much gasoline onto that fire as we humanly can because ultimately our job is just to connect you with the people that need your help. Then we just get out of the way. Right. We let the magic happen between the two of you. So yeah, anyone can join. Anyone can join. One of the things that we see is so we're always looking to try to highlight people in the community. And so we go through the Facebook group and we say sort by engagement, show us what's getting engagement. And the two types of engagement that do well are people being spectacular and people wanting a funnel builder. And the funnel builder one just like the explode because everybody is hitting up saying, I can take care of you. I can take care of you. I can take care of you. The funnel builder marketplace is really that home. It's that place where they can find the people who are true, who are vetted, who can take care of all this people who are certified. They've got their badges over on the side. They can see the profile of all the past reviews, all the certification someone has, how many different jobs they've completed. You can see all of that before you get on a call with somebody. And so it's a perfect place if you're looking to hire somebody you're trying to figure out where to go. And once again, what kind of services can they get there? Is it just funnel building? Right. I don't I want to win this competition. So I'm not sure. Yeah. So people can get you can get funnel strategy. You know, if you're someone that's starting out and you want to build the funnels yourself, but the whole strategy side of it's not your forte, someone can sit down with you for an hour. They'll give you a strategy. Say they'll give you a blueprint, some of them how to get to sit to CCX. Right. And then it's off to you to put that in place. You have strategy sessions. Someone can build a funnel for you, obviously. You can also get graphic design done. You can get copyright in done. One other thing you can get programming assistance as well. So you need technical help, anything like that, right? Sometimes the funnels break. Sometimes it's difficult to get the integrations working. You need someone to set up Zappia integrations is probably a popular one that it's if you know how to build a funnel, but that's a different sort of art in itself, right? And we have people that do marketing as well. So if you want traffic, you want Facebook ads, Google ads, YouTube, TikTok, all of that stuff, we basically, if you see here or well, basically those two, you hear Russell talking about something and he recommends it. You read something in one of his books. We have the people that can help you implement that. We have people that will help you build your dream 100 if you want to help with that. You want to follow up sequence of emails. We can help you with that. Literally everything. And if we don't do it, it's typically my job to come find the person that can. I still like, I don't want to turn someone away. We haven't got that. I will go out. I'll reach out to our connections and find people who can fulfill that role. And on the homepage, like if you go to funnelbuilder.com, you say, I'm looking for somebody. There's two buttons. Go to the marketplace or get a recommendation. When they click get a recommendation, they fill out all those details. You're the person getting that. You're connecting. Yeah. Yeah. So it's lucky because what? What happens on the marketplace? We've got people who have been in business for 30 years, created big businesses, and then they just suddenly fell in love with this funnel building idea. They want to help people with their marketing, but they're new to us. I mean, they're very well experienced in the real world. So I get to meet these people. I speak to them, see their work. So I can recommend those people. And oftentimes you'll find people who turn up and they're like, right, I need to get these reviews. So normally I'd offer a thousand dollars, a charge, a thousand dollars for this service. I'm going to do it for 250 right now. And I know those people. So if someone comes to me and says, hey, you've got someone who can do X, Y, and Z, I can just recommend them any which way. And I think it just, it helps everyone. So the really good people get recognized. You're in the safety of, I'm the one recommending you to that person. So if it doesn't work out, that's on me. That's on my shoulders. So we make sure that everyone on there is top quality. Again, it's, there'll probably be people that sneak through the cracks at some point, but we're always, we've just got our eyes on it all the time. We have a number of metrics that we follow. So we know if, if something's not going well, we work with people. But yeah, it's just a great place to know that you're going to hire someone who one knows click funnels, right? They know the methodology. They know the platform. They know the software. And we are only going to recommend you to people that I know. They're going to do a fantastic job for you. They've done your industry, the funnel, everything. Well, and you know that one piece from the book that you read, you're like, I need to implement this, you go and talk to that person. They're like, this is how Russell is updated for, for today in order to make sure that you're as profitable as possible. And they go, Holy cow, that's a leap for that's a who, not the how opportunity. And that's, that's what this really is. Now we've been dropping, Susan, I have been dropping like the little details of events that are happening, but you just added it to the website. So can you talk to people about what kind of events it is that you're throwing, like what it is that you're doing? So the very next one, I'm actually doing an event tomorrow with one of our top guys guys been with us for years, fantastic funnel builder does everything. He's going to do a workshop on someone's funnel. So I've asked for a load of recommendations. People have sent me their funnels is going to pick one and you can say, right, this is what I would do to turn this into the most profitable thing you can, this is going to be absolutely fantastic. That's tomorrow. But then typically every Friday, what we're doing are, I like to call them speed dating sessions, but instead of going to meet random people, you meet expert funnel builders. So at these events, we've got guests one side, experts the other side, and the software just connects you one on one. So if you are struggling with anything, if your funnel is not working as well as it should, if you're not converting as well as you'd like, even if you, you know, you just want to hire a funnel builder and you don't know who to speak to, you can come to this event. We've got 10, 15, 20 experts waiting. You can have a five minute chat with them and just get to run past whole different group of funnel builders and you'll just know, you know, they'll each give you different ideas and different suggestions and people absolutely love them because it's again, it can be difficult. It takes time to vet people, right? And even sometimes with reviews, you think, oh, is this really for me? Do they know my industry? So on this session, you join for 30 minutes, have a group of calls and by the end of it, you just know where you're going, right? You know who you want to work with, you know where to go. You've met them and typically people have just follow up calls after that and then decide where they want to take that. So fantastic opportunity and people can register for that now if they want. If you are one of those people who's like, I want a funnel built, but I don't know how expensive this is going to be. I don't know this. You should know the people that we are putting in front of you are people who have been vetted. They're people who have been, who have, we have spent hours with them in order to make this work. So it's not just the personal relationship that Lee creates. If they're going through the certification, we have spent hours looking at their work, making sure it's on par with what they're getting certified for, that they understand strategies to build the software, the tactics. Like there has been a lot of work in the background put to make sure that these people are up to snuff before we ever present them to you. This is not a handbag, random grab of people that you would find on Fiverr or Upwork or otherwheres. This is, this is, this is the gold and they all love Russell stuff and they follow it. I don't know where else you would want to go. A post on Facebook is great, but you're going to get everybody. Like this is, this is to be his knees. I do get that from time to time as people, they will have just found someone on a different platform. And obviously if you put a call out there saying, Hey, does anyone under click funnels? I want to build a webinar funnel. Everyone's going to say yes, because you know, you fake it till you make it, right? Sometimes. And they just find out the execution isn't always there. And that's, that is a worry. But with us, as you say, firstly, a lot of people have gone through the certification. How many funnels they have to build to get those certificates is it's a lot, right? And they have to be checked. And they have to be tested to the M for degree to make sure they work before they get this batch. You know, all these people have built umpteen funnels. You've also got the reviews. So you can see who people have worked with the kind of reviews they got. And then on the top of that, the layer, third layer is I'll speak to them. I know them and I would only recommend people that I know are going to be good. So you're really, you're really safe just knowing that we're going to look after you basically. Yeah. So I really love the, the speed dating. You said every Friday, which is awesome. I know you guys have been kind of doing them every once in a while, but it's every Friday now, which is so cool. Um, so knowing like I'm putting myself in the shoes of someone who wants to hire a funnel builder, knowing that if I'm going to show up to this, this event and everyone that's going to be presented to me and then I'm going to be able to speak to has been vetted. They're probably all capable of doing what I need. Um, at this point, like I love the idea of having quick conversations with them because you can hire somebody that's fully capable and skillful at what you're asking, but you might just, you might not jive with them on something else. Right. Like they might have a different, um, way that they like to work or personality differences. And so what an awesome way to be able to talk to a bunch of people and find the ones that you're like, okay, I think that, that we will mesh really well together. I think I'm going to work with this person. Um, and so that's awesome. I think it, it, it comes down to that because if you want somebody, especially if you're looking for someone that you can go to ongoing over and over every time you need something, um, need them to help you with something that is really, really great to be able to have somebody that, that knows your business and you don't have to keep jumping from person to person. So I would encourage everyone to show up looking for someone that, that can be like your longterm ongoing person that you go to, because it's so much easier to go back to the same person and that already knows your business and there's already helped you then to have to go find somebody else because that person didn't stick around or you didn't get along. Um, yeah, that's, that's been my experience with it. That whole safety side of it is huge. Isn't it just knowing who they are. You've had a chat with them. You've got to know them and now they're, they're part of your team because your business is a big part of your life. You don't just want to let anyone in, right? You want to let people in that you get on with and you know, we're going to do a great job for them. They care about your business as much as you do. Uh, we had, we had a question from the community real quick. Uh, Dan asked, uh, can a team join the marketplace? So not just individual, but like a team. So that way does it all have to be individuals or can they, you know, can they all group together and create a cohort? No, they definitely can. We've got a few agencies on the marketplace. So they'll typically whoever's running it is the face of it. Um, they'll come to the events. They'll, you know, send me, uh, expert tips that I can put into, put into the newsletter, but they have, you know, a group of people behind them. I think it gets to a point where like you're saying, you have these long term relationships, you're building so many funnels over and over again. You literally need a team that you can organize and a lot of people typically do the, you know, that 20% that that's the, the key, the gold, right? They have a team that does the marketing and the funnel frameworks, maybe some emails and then they go over and just finesse it so that they can really drive. Yeah. If someone wants to join with the team, more than welcome. All right. So if somebody is looking for a funnel builder or they want to get signed up, where do they go, Lee? Marketplace.funnelbuilder.com. And you'll see it all. There's very, very easy, very, very easily laid out. Come by. Uh, you can drop me an email if you need any help. If things are slightly confusing, but it's all very, very straightforward. It's been well designed to make life easy for everyone. One other thing I would just add really quick is you're writing a weekly newsletter as well.

Go to marketplace.funnelbuilder.com and scroll down on the bottom. You'll see a piece for the newsletter every single month.
