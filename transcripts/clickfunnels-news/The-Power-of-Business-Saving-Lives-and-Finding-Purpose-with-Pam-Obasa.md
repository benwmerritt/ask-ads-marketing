Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm speaking with Pam Ovasa. Pam teaches business owners, entrepreneurs and educators how to create a lucrative sales system, launch their signature offer and get booked out, monetize their message and story so they can sell online with ease. Welcome Pam, thanks so much for being with me today. Thank you, I'm so excited to be here. Thank you, I look forward to having fun with you. It's going to be fun and doing that. Looking forward to getting to know you. So tell me a little bit about your background and why you started this business. Oh gosh, you want to take me way back. Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. My background here is actually as a actress. I wanted to, you know, I saw my name in nights and I went to drama school, I went to the brick school, went to drama school, came out with an agent, all of that good stuff started performing and doing film, theater, radio and my life was coming up and up and up and up. And then I had a bereavement. I got married, had my daughter and I lost her at birth. And instantly my entire life changed. I just didn't want to, I didn't want to be on stage. It was the last time I ever performed till today. I just didn't want to do it. My life changed. All I wanted after that was to be a mum. And then it took a while to actually achieve that dream then when I became a mum. I didn't have the bigger problem which is providing for my family and wanting to spend time with them. And you know, I then tried to go back into acting and I realized that it didn't give me the life that I wanted in terms of I wanted to have my kids and, you know, and spend time with them and do all of that good stuff. And I remember just sitting and just thinking, what am I going to do? These are my skills that this is what I have known all my life, what I have done, like what's next? What can I do as a mum with a newborn baby? One day, I mean, in the middle of the night, I was watching something and this thing came up on my phone. I was scrolling on Facebook and something came up on my phone called a webinar. What's this webinar situation about? And sorry, I was like, let's check this out. So I plugged into this webinar and I was amazed. And somebody running a webinar from, I put a very light on it, there were thousands of people watching and in my mind, I basically thought, oh my god, she's on stage, she's teaching something. She has an expertise, like this is a whole different way of, you know, having my dream. But then I thought, but Pam, what is your skill? What are you going to do? What is your experience? Like you have nothing, that was my initial thought. I was on and I went through the process of trying to figure out, okay, if I could potentially help people, what could I do? And that was when I started to just unravel my own skin set and everything that I could bring to the table and then started to put together my own confidence, really build back the confidence again to think, okay, you're not performing, you're not doing the things that you're trained to do, but you could possibly, you know, God probably has a different purpose for you and you shouldn't go in that direction. And that was how I started to really think about doing something online. Wow. And what led you to creating funnels to grow your business? Oh, my. So I first found out about funnels because I was running a webinar, so my very first business in this online space was a daycare and nursery. So when we lost our dudes, I literally had like two years of never leaving the house because back then I was a known face, but in the acting space, right? A lot of people knew me and so I didn't want to do anywhere. And my mom had this day nursery that she was running and she said, come and help me. Do the marketing. I said, no, I don't know marketing. She said, it doesn't matter. Just sit in the office and figure out the marketing. So I did that. I sat in the office, I didn't speak to anybody and I tried to figure out how do we get people through the door. Within six months of being at that business, I took it from 12 children to 60 children and making it a six-year business within six months. And that was when I thought, hold on a minute, maybe there's something in this marketing space. So I started going live and I would just go live and I would talk about, you know, marketing stuff for day nurseries and do these lives and people would turn up and all sorts of people. And one day my mom said to me, she said, Pam, your life's around, your life's changed, you're amazing. Just phase the lives. They're amazing. And she said, but the things you talk about, I really think they apply to other businesses beyond day care. I was like, well, I don't know what we're talking about. I'm talking nursery. I'm talking about, she said, but the other supplies that you give, Pam, they help so many other people. Some Chinese they are starting getting these DMs from people called coaches. I think you're a coach. Do you teach people football? Like, are you like some sort of football coach? What do you do? So I started trying to know these people and I realized there's a whole industry, what coaches, and they need help with their marketing. So I started to run webinars to help them with their marketing. And that was when I started to do funnels to bring people to these webinars. Wow. Okay. So going back a little bit, and I know that this is a little bit personal, but clearly a lot of your personal experience have shaped who you are and why you started your business. Can you tell us a little bit about how overcoming some of that stuff maybe made you want to pursue this? Oh, my God. Yeah, absolutely. I think for me, the way that I put it is that, and this is my truth, business saved me. Like literally doing what I do, safely. It's what got me out of depression time and time again. It's what gave me a purpose time and time again. It gave me a reason. It made me feel like, you know, like I had a purpose. And the moment I grasped that, I turned it away from before like why was, okay, I need to just, I need to be able to get out of the house. I need to be able to think better. And then my why was I need to do this for my children. And then my why massively changed to I need to do this for others. Now that it has saved me, I need to help others to realize what they have within them because so many people are so lost for various reasons. And oftentimes, the thing that is your thing, I find is right under your nose, right? It's a skill set. It's often the thing and all right that you have ignored. Well, then you have a nose. You know, if my mom hadn't had, I still remember standing outside the door with my sister knocking and I wouldn't let her in because I just didn't want to, I don't want to talk. I was, I was quite happy being the best and that sounds very, very sad, but I was, I got used to it. But if I hadn't had taken that step to then go in and, you know, try and fix this problem in this business, I've never have realized that holding a mid-pan, you do understand marketing, but it was always there. And the way that I was able to fix that is I focused on one thing, which was storytelling. And, you know, going back to my entire acting background, when I do the whole 360 and I come and I circle back, I just look at my entire journey and I just think, oh my God, like, this was always the plan. God had this planned all along and I just didn't know it. That's really, really powerful. And I can tell just by speaking with you in this interview that you have this sense of charisma and this vulnerability about you that's so willing to share a personal story. And I feel like that's so important. And sometimes people don't realize how important it is to feel like you can be approachable and connect with somebody to understand their story so that you are willing to learn from them. And I think that says a lot about your character. And I can sense so much of that for you just by speaking with you. Thank you. And people buy from people who they know like us, we all learn that. But the, what, why does it disconnect is that people don't realize that the way that people get to know you is because of how vulnerable you are, how human you are. Nobody wants to buy somebody who they have a, pardon me, buy from somebody or investing somebody who they have a disconnect with. They want to connect with you. They want to know that you are real. And a lot of the times, especially when it comes to storytelling, it's the things that we have been through, those fair and dark moments that actually when you look back, they are the very reason why you are and why you are. So the way that I look at it is even though they are painful, for me, you know, if I can use that pain to help somebody else, then I believe that that pain was, you know, it wasn't just a waste. That's the way that I see it. I love that. So you mentioned webinars and how you use those to teach now. Is that your main funnel? Have you used other funnels? Tell me a little bit about more, more about how you use webinars to grow your business. Webinars specifically isn't my main funnel, actually. We, so in terms of my business, we use several different funnels or self systems as we call them. And what we do, like the webinar funnel is we place it in the middle. So for example, we might have on the front end, we might have a five day challenge or a boot camp or some sort of workshop, but in the middle will always be this webinar component that then leads people to my middle ticket, which then leads people to my high ticket offer. So one thing I always say, and that's the biggest thing that I've learned through my journey, it's not one funnel that does it. It's actually a combination of funnels and the way that they are stacked together and the way that your messaging and that your story is congruent throughout each one. And as people just walk through, they get to know you better. They get to know you better and they go up and up and up and up that value that are because at every point there is a congruency, there is trust and, and you know, people get to know you more and they buy it more. Yeah, absolutely. So tell me a little bit, let's go into business a little bit. So when you started using funnels, how long did it take you from understanding that a funnel would actually help you in your business, not just for growing your list, but actually making revenue in your business? How long did you go from creating your first funnel to getting your first client? Oh man, okay, that's a big question. Let me think back. How long did it take me? My very first funnel was the webinar funnel, my very, very first one. And it failed massively. I'm not even gonna lie. I would have these webinars and honestly, people would turn up like this was back in the day when you were doing live stream and Facebook would push it everywhere, right? Not like we do now. So I do this live stream, people register for this webinar, they would all turn up and I wouldn't send. It was through that whole process that I learned that it's not just the funnels, you're gonna learn how to sell, right? Like a funnel is like having this water bottle, it doesn't get water inside. You're gonna be very thirsty, you know? And that was the biggest thing that I learned through that process. So that was my very first funnel. Then we started to get that converted, converting what really set my business, you know, what really helped us massively at the beginning stages was a self-liquidating funnel, which was the next one that I had built. So I built this self-liquidating funnel that had a series of offers in it and the very first offer was $17. And I cannot tell you how much I danced when I made one sale of $17. Why? Because I realized that if somebody can pay $17 for something, that it's only a matter of time before I can charge $1700 or $2700 or whatever the rest is. So these were my first two funnels and for the self-liquidating funnel, it took a good two years, I'm not even denying, to really understand the process and get it to work and get it to funnel people through. But once it did that, within the first month of launching, within 35 days, we made $65,000 in that one funnel. And that was when I knew that, okay Pam, you actually know what you're doing, you have a business. That was my, okay, let's go, let's do this, find it and we've gotten so lucky. Amazing. And what made you want to stick around, even after you said you failed miserably in your first one? Like what gave you the drive to keep going to see if you could make this work? I love a challenge. I, you know, I really love a challenge and, you know, I, throughout my entire journey, there's been nothing that has made me question whether this is where I'm supposed to be. And so because I've always had that back door closed, like there is no back door, like, and this is it, I still knew that it was either you succeed or you succeed kind of thing, you know, but there's no other option. I remember when I was dating my husband with a night for 12 years, but when I was dating him, I kind of know what the situation was, but he gave me a scenario, I was working on something. I don't remember what it is, but he gave me a scenario and he said, Pam, when you're struggling to get over a certain point and let's imagine I'm kicking at this thing, one of two things will happen. Either that door breaks down or your leg breaks, so make a decision, which one is it going to be? And I remember saying to him, well, every time I'm kicking, the goal is for that door to break down. And so for me, I've never had a back door to this. This is, I believe this is my purpose. This is what I've been called to do and called to help people. And so when I come across challenges, I just see it as, okay, brilliant. Well, there's a story in that panel one day when you ever come this, you're going to be able to help somebody else who is trying to have that firm point. Wow. And that has to really be able to carry you through, even in the future, knowing that you are doing exactly what you're meant to be doing. I think that's really cool. Absolutely. Love that. So I'm curious. You said that you have a background in acting. Has that at all helped you with coaching, teaching others? Like, how would you say that kind of impacts the way that you do things in your business? Oh, no, I really think it has been everything. I didn't see it before, but now when I look back or actually based on people's feedback, you know, massively helped me with my confidence, they helped me with, I still get very nervous. Like, you don't know this, but before I came here, I found myself like a million times that was like, come on, come down, drink some water, but you're going to play some. I'm still getting incredibly nervous. And but the thing about the having an acting background is that you learn very quickly to be on the ball. Like if I'm on camera, I'm not seeing just Laura. I in my mind, I'm talking to millions of people. That's just when my mindset is. And so that helps massively. The other thing that it helps me to do is we learn very quickly with improvisation that like this, you can, that will drop, right? So I know before I come on this interview that there is no question that I will be asked on any interview that I won't be able to answer. I just have that confidence because of Evertrol, you know, that whenever I feel that that bull is being dropped, somebody will pop into my brain like, oh, pattern, this is how you answer it. And the way that I built my business is that it's always based on truth. And so I've always thought to myself, well, if everything you do is always based on truth, Pam, then you're never going to struggle to answer a question because you know that we're never going to lie. So it's easy to always keep on top of things. So it's helped me. It's helping with confidence. It's helped me to hold the crowd. It's helped me with charisma, with, you know, with, hopefully, what people see person that in tonight. That's definitely. I heard it. It's helped me with all of those things. Yeah. Amazing. Okay. So two last questions. One is, what is the single most important piece of advice that you could tell other entrepreneurs that are maybe just getting started in a business like this? Oh my, okay. The single most important advice would be to drop 80% of what you are doing right now and focus on what is the most important. And for me, there are three key things that are most important. And that is what is your signature business model? What is your off bat? And what is your large process? Right? Those are the three most important things to begin with. When I first started, the reason why one of the reasons why it took me so long is because I focused on other things. I tried to learn how to build my own website and how to put it all together, how to learn what WordPress. I tried to become an expert in Canva. I tried to become an expert in YouTube. I had two YouTube channels. I had three Instagram handles. I was on LinkedIn. I had three Facebook groups. I was doing this so much. But when you're doing so much, it's like running around in circle. And you are still moving. But you are always going to be exhausted because you're chasing your routine. And so one of the things I do in my program, I'm intensive specifically, it's let's take all of these things and let's focus on what is important. And so that would be my biggest advice for people who are at the very end stages of their business. I think that's so helpful because so many entrepreneurs, even people in our community or people that are just getting familiar with ClickFunnels are trying to do so many different things to see what sticks. And I think that could be helpful in a way to understand where you should find your focus. But so many of them get so lost in doing the day to day, just stretching themselves thin that they're not focusing on the one thing that's actually going to really move them forward in their business. So I think that piece of advice is really important. And something that probably all of us should consider even in our personal and professional lives is like focus on the thing that matters most and they're actually moving the needle because the rest of the stuff doesn't necessarily make that much of a difference. No, it doesn't. And we won't miss it because it never made a difference. When I dropped all of these things, I realized that, wow, it's not, you know, I'm the biggest fear Laura, the biggest fear is if I stop doing these things, would I miss them? It's just like me ching in when you ask, you know, a new business seminar to me, Chim is, you know, the biggest fear is, but if I meet in with like news access to all of these other areas, the truth of the matter is that when you focus, you just become laser sharp. You have so much more clarity. You have such great direction because you're trying to go from point A to B, not going from A to Z, A to J and A to B. And out of all of these different points, it just helps you to get results faster. That's so helpful. Okay, last thing, where did people learn more about you and your business online? I would love for everybody who's watching this to come to my YouTube channel. I'm on YouTube and it's PowerBass so you can find me, you can find me on YouTube, come along and find it. I've been published three times a week. And if you liked what you saw here, great heart and, you know, but a bit more teaching and a bit more training, which is what I'm really about. And you're going to love our channel. So definitely, definitely come there. Can I share? What more thing can I show? Absolutely, please do. And like that. Brilliant. I'd also like to send everybody out of our case study, which is called the SEED method. And I think it's brilliant for this because it shows how we use one of our funnels to generate 120k in three day. And that is at theseedmethod.com. So please go ahead and check it out. Theseedmethod.com. All right, we'll include that also in the caption so everybody can see that. Thank you so much for offering that to our viewers today. And thank you so much, Pam. I loved getting to know you. Thank you for telling us about your background, sharing some really trivial things that have, you know, impacted and shaped who you are today and powerful, huge things that I can only imagine that they were difficult to go through and to share with people. So I appreciate your vulnerability and all of the things that have made you such an amazing person and so easy to connect with. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being on this today. And hopefully everybody goes and checks out your business and learns more about you. Yes. Go ahead and do that. Wonderful. Thank you so much for having me. I really enjoyed this interview. Thank you. Thank you, Pam.
