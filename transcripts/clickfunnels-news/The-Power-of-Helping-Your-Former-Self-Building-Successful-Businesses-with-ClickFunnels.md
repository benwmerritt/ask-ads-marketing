Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with FlickFunnels and today I'm joined by Brennan Schlagbaum. Brennan is a father, a husband, and a full-time business owner of BudgetDog.com. His goal is to create one million millionaires using his framework and experience in the financial industry. Thanks for joining me, Brennan. Thanks. Thanks for having me. Of course. Tell me a little bit about how you got started in this industry and what led you here today. It's very interesting. As you see back here, I was actually a CPA at Deloitte. Deloitte's a big CPA firm, big four. Honestly, it wasn't where I expected to go with BudgetDog.com. When I first started my brand, I really was looking for to help people that were similar to me and share my story. Somebody that came into the work world out of college with a lot of debt. Nothing crazy. House, car, student loans, a ring for the wife. Even the bed we slept. It was crazy. It was all over the place, but it wasn't abnormal per se. It really bugged me as a CPA because I'm looking at the balance sheet and I'm looking at all the debts and stuff. I'm like, we got to clean this up. So we did so. That naturally led me to helping other people do it locally because we were like gung-ho about it. We wanted to pay it off and I was helping friends and family. My wife was like, hey, why don't you create an Instagram account and talk about it? I was like, that would be cool. I was like, I don't really know much about social media. I wasn't a social media person. I had 10 posts on my private page and that was over a 10-year period, so about one a year. So I dove into it and it really took off. People started loving it. They're like, hey, how can you help me? How can you do this? How can you do that? I want to pay off debt. I want to invest and all this. It sounds like it's actually popular. People really wanted to do this. I didn't know people even did this online and I really quickly learned how many people out there needed this type of service. So I dove into it full force and that's kind of where I came across Russell and ClickFunnels and everything and how to keep people in my ecosystem and not just giving my time away for free, but actually creating a business out of it. And that's kind of where I'm at today. Really cool. So you started by just adding value. You were just delivering value to people, creating content and then you found the interest. It was all about you. Yeah. What led you to ClickFunnels and how did you use Funnels to grow your business? So I started diving into the actual money-making space of online and I saw a bunch of friends do it online, kind of the same similar financial pages and stuff and they were like, you've got to check out ClickFunnels. You've got to check out Russell. And I was like, all right, well, I'll give this guy a shot. And I came across this story and I was listening to this podcast almost every single day I got in my car, went to the gym, cut the grass. I mean, it was like a lot. And every time I would come in and inspire, talk to my wife and say, this, we have to do this. And so I dove full force into it and I never looked back to be honest. Really cool. And how are you using it today? We are actually using primarily a couple of Funnels, main top of the level Funnels. And for my Budget Dog Academy, which is my full six month program, we pretty much have a call booking funnel for people to book calls with my team. And that's primarily how we're generating most of our business. How much have you grown since launching your business? Since launching my business in a revenue standpoint, you mean? In your team, anything? Yeah. So the growth of my social accounts have grown. I mean, I've grown hundreds of thousands of extra people on Twitter and Instagram. From a revenue standpoint, we're well over into the million seven figure mark. And then from a team perspective, I think we have about 10 or 11 people on our team now. Amazing. Really. Starting with me posting from a picture of a dog on Instagram at one point. Yeah. So how did you kind of like, what was your journey to ClickFunnels? Like, did you get, I know you mentioned you were introduced to Russell and kind of his teaching methods. Did you jump into the community? Did you learn from fellow entrepreneurs? You started by just creating content. Like, how did you find the guidance to really scale your business? So Mova said it was honestly the podcast. Like, I would just listen and I would learn. And I showed up at some of the events, the virtual events that they had as well, and just listen and soaked it in. You know, I knew I was an expert, I still am not to this day. And I still have done a lot of cool stuff. So I can't imagine if I even enhanced my knowledge more of what we could possibly do here. So having, you know, other people in the business as well, kind of share their funnels, share how they're kind of like working on the back end and stuff like that really helped. But I'd say the podcast, which is literally free game for anybody, just turn it on, like just actually soak it in and you'll be amazed at what can come about this, especially if you're inspired to help others. Yeah. Amazing. I love that you what you took away was all the stuff that is, you know, free content for everybody. And I think more people need to take that advice too, because it doesn't necessarily start with just a high ticket offer, but like learning, understanding the content, watching the videos, listening to podcasts, and you start to go with it. And I think that that's really cool. I have so many questions about your own personal story and especially being somebody who is not a numbers person at all. What do you think it is about your background and about your personal story that really resonates with people when you are sharing those videos online? I think I'm pretty much like everybody else. Like that's I'm just every day guy that, you know, came out of school, had a decent upbringing and just had a lot of debt and wanted to build a lot of wealth and become financially free and maybe even build a business now that I'm on that side of things, you know, I think I can relate to a lot of people. A lot of people have debt. A lot of people want to build wealth and financial freedom. And that's what we're providing. And then they also see the business side, which is kind of this new me in the last couple of years through the help of ClickFunnels. And then people just want to do all this stuff, you know, I think the best businesses are built with your helping your former self. So I'm 31 now, but I was 23 at the time, 22 is sure whatever. And when I first started, I was just trying to help myself, to be honest, I was helping myself, my wife, my family, you know, all that stuff. And it turned into helping other people because I became the master of helping myself. And when I helped myself, I know I had the experience, I am fully confident in my ability to help that person. And so if you, if I, my target customer is my former self, to be honest, and I think that's why it's so successful. That's really insightful. I feel like a lot of the entrepreneurs that I've spoken with have a very similar story where even if it's a completely different industry, a lot of what brought them to where they are today is because they needed it, whether it was explaining or it was getting being a certified funnel builder, it was things that they wanted to do for themselves. And then realizing once they mastered that skill, that the best way to share it is to serve others and teach them the same process so that they can benefit from that as well, which I think is really cool. Absolutely. It's similar to Russell. I mean, this is what he did. He figured it out himself. Now he's teaching it. I mean, it's the same exact concept. I think people overcomplicate starting a business, to be honest, because by no means do I have some special skill or did my parents have multiple businesses and teaching this. My mom is a school teacher. My dad was in the mortgage industry. They didn't have this expertise. I learned it all on my own and I just did it myself. And I believe anybody can do this if they would want. Yeah. And that clearly it does create an impact because look at you. I mean, you went through it, you found financial freedom and now you want the best for others. So you're teaching that. What can people expect to learn with your services? Sure. So anybody that wants to do anything from a financial perspective and maximize their finances. That could be debt payoff. That could be trying to invest. That could be, I don't know where to start. Any of those things, that's where my special skill set is. If you want to build financial freedom and retire early, I got you covered. Now, within reason, I have a very practical approach to everything. So you can't just show up and just expect to become financially free in four days. It takes time, but it's a foundational approach, fundamental. I got the CPA background for a reason. So it's not the pie in the sky, get rich quick type of offer. It is a real foundational approach that will last forever. Yeah. Awesome. So do you typically work with people who work nine to fives that are entrepreneurs? Are they kind of all over? I see a mix. I would say, I would say if I were to divvy my population of customers up, I would say 80% of them or nine five everyday people. 20% might own a business. Cool. What would be your biggest piece of advice for somebody who is maybe in your shoes 10 years ago or 15 years ago, who is interested in potentially starting a business, maybe needs to learn a skill for themselves, but can see growing a business or scaling a business because they ultimately want to serve other people based on the things that they've learned. What would you tell them? I think ultimately lean into your skill set and become a master at what you do. And so when you become the master, you have ultimate confidence. You don't have to sell any crap online. You can sell your services because you are ultimately confident because you've helped yourself with that. Starting with that, leaning into that skill set and then sharing it with the world. I think social media is such a great thing. And I think the cool thing about social media is you can reach so many people. However, it stops there sometimes in social media platforms and algorithms are really weird. And that's where I came into a halt. I was hitting a lot of people with my content, but then they might see me for another three weeks because of the algorithm. So using a funnel service like Click Funnels really helped me keep those people in my ecosystem. Hit them with emails, remind them, send the reminders, send great content over and over and over, and they become a customer with time. And it's a good quality service that's going to help them. It's going to help us and it's going to help everybody. Yeah. Well, you mentioned creating a lot of things on Instagram organically. Did you at any point think, what made you decide to drive more traffic to your funnels? Did you eventually start doing paid ads? Did you follow any other methods? Everything was pretty much organic and free. We haven't done many paid ads. That's something we're leaning into right now. That's a big focal point. But leaning up to over the seven figure mark, we did not do any paid ads. So I can't imagine what we would do with an actual strategic paid ad system. That's where we're really lacking, if I'm being honest. And so everything was organic. Everything was posting quality content, things that can help other people. Thinking from their perspective versus mine, thinking back to my 23 year old self, what would I really want to know? What would be very helpful? We're running a challenge right now, a three day challenge in third days tonight. So that's been extremely helpful. Giving the free services, the free game to a lot of people, and letting them know, hey, this is all doable. This is possible for anyone out there. That's incredible. So I imagine you were pretty profitable early on without having to spend any money on paid ads. Margens are nice. That's a beautiful game of the online business. You don't have a lot of overhead. Most of my expenses, people at this point in time, just give people and then giving them outsourcing my everything I used to do myself. I mean, I used to do everything. So most of my expenses hiring, that's all it is. Really cool and powerful too to just prove that sharing value on social media really does work. And that has brought in all of the traffic that you've used to grow your business so far. All my acquisitions online. Amazing. Really cool. So where can people go to learn more about you and your business? Yeah, so you can go to budgetdog.com. That's my website. And you can also go to pretty much any social channel and search budget dog. I'm on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, pretty much anywhere. Awesome. All of them are on budget dog? Yes. Twitter and TikTok are budgetdog underscore. I have one account on all platforms. If you get hit up by somebody, it's not me. It's probably a f***ing out. So just a heads up. I'm not selling me a crypto day trading service or anything like that. That's always good to know. Thank you for preface. Will we see you at Funnel Hacking Live this year? Yes, I'm excited to go there. Awesome. Really cool. Well, thank you for joining me today, Brennan. It's been great to learn more about your story. I love that you're helping people achieve financial freedom, especially with your background in numbers. I'm sure that resonates with a lot of people because I know there's a lot of people out there just like me who don't want to think about numbers, don't want to think about budgets that need people like you to help them and plan out their future. So it's great to have people like you. And I look forward to chatting with you again soon. Absolutely. Thanks, Laura. Thanks, Brennan. Take care.
