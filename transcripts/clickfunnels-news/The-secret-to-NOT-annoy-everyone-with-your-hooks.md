grand scale What's up everybody how's it going? Oops me a better room How you all doing today? Today? I've got my friends meeting. I see who this bobblehead is This is mr. Dan Kennedy. We just got done with Dan Kennedy super conference for the last three days By the how many has read super conference? We were in Dallas, Texas for three days, which was insane We had Dan Kennedy there with us hanging out Dan was speaking dance. I'll go stage five times, which is crazy because He's kind of on there sometimes doesn't always want to speak on stage, but we got him to speak five times For those who there Dan was awesome. So here's bobblehead Dan We brought him home with us. Yes, good. I'll see him as we go. So anyway Before we started I got some cool stuff to share from you from mr. Dan Kennedy But if you are here to say let us know if you are here live lesson alive in the comments Let me know where you're from and yeah, I want to kick this off like finding out where all you guys are from Looks like Tim said the super conference was insane. Thank you for coming Anyway, yes when we do these kind of events It's funny because like we spend so much time and energy and effort marketing and buying ads and doing emails and campaigns and stuff And like I just I want if you guys trust me you trust me you trust me You should just come to these things like they are magical life-changing experiences the amount of energy we put in some like that And you know super conferences greatly about 500 people there in the room But what's cool about the fact there's only 500 people in the room is typically a funnel hiking live Like I love fun. I like FHL is my favorite event ever, right? But there's 5,000 people and so like I can't go in the hallways because I get sworn by people and we have to have bodyguards and stuff It's super conference only 500 of us will hung out like I was sitting in the in the like in there as an attendee I was learning I was taking notes from Dan we hung out we took pictures We did book signings like it's just a magical experience that like you can't get anywhere else except for there So those who are there I glad you were there those who weren't like in the future when we offer stuff like this do not miss it It's amazing. So with that said Dan Kennedy wanted to say thanks for hanging out. We appreciate you guys and Yeah, so that's the that's kind of game plan. So actually as we were preparing today is the live I was like, what could we share like, you know, there's so many cool things that happen this weekend Like I was like, I want to talk about a Dan can Kenny thing my face is all blurry My camera does weird thing will focus on like a weird thing in the background. There we go. I'm back. I'm not blurring anymore Anyway, so we're gonna talk about some Dan Kennedy stuff. I'm curious to meet you guys What is like your number one if you guys have followed Dan Kennedy? I can if you don't know who's my mentor when I first got in this game. He's the person I learned from Still this day the person I studied the most listen to the most and Anyway, I was a student and a fan for a star as a fan first Then became a student there was like the mastermind groups and then and then years later When his business came up for sell I had a chance to acquire it and divide it and now it's been fun to work with him Every single week or every month we have chance talking on the phone Every, you know, we're doing events and just like so fun to like I don't know to hang out with your mentor and learn directly from them Really cool, but those who who have studied Dan or heard me talk about what's your number? But number one favorite like Dan quote or analogy. I'm curious which one's your favorite for me I'll tell you my favorite because this is one literally the entire like the whole concept of funnels was built off of this one premise When I first got Dan Kennedy's world, I remember he told he kept saying this thing He's like whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins and when I first heard that I didn't make any sense to me I was like, what is he think? What is he talking about? This is old guy? I'm like, you know, maybe in direct mail last true, but I'm an internet guy doesn't really it doesn't relate and I didn't understand it And probably cuz back then when I first got started 20 whatever years ago like the game was different But you guys know my story about potato gonna do big I put the DVD up on for sale on I put up a website I'll go to Google buy Google ad you spend like five bucks and go ads make a $30 cell and I was it was like This is so simple. This is the easiest game in the world That's how it was when I was in when I was in college and then and I was like, you know, this is my future It's gonna be it's gonna be easy But then what happened is it it didn't last long it got harder every type of media as Dan Kenny talks about every type of media Over time it starts really cheap and then it's more people jump in gets more and more expensive It got a point where for me to sell it, you know, $30 DVD I just spent $100 and so how do you do that? Will you do that by doing what Dan Kennedy said whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins? That's where sells from escape from for upsells and down sells and the value ladder Everything I teach in all the books all came off of this one core concept I learned from Dan Kennedy and this is actually you guys want to hear a really cool story Dan told me So back in the day You know, you had there's only a couple TV channels, right? It's like CBS NBC I don't even ABC right those are the three TV channels eventually Fox came in so there's four That's all it was but I guess TV back in the day and this is back when when Dan Kennedy was a kid So I don't know not not in my lifetime, but back in the day They'd have TV in itself like 10 o'clock at night the news would end and then they just like TV went off the air Right because they assumed everyone's going to bed at night and so Dan and some of these great marketing geniuses back in the day We're like, hey, we should buy that the airtime and then went to the TV stations They're like no one watches TV at 10 o'clock night. They go to bed and like oh, we understand that but like can we buy the time anyway? So guys like sure for 35 bucks you can have from 10 at night till 6 in the morning for like 35 bucks They would buy that spot and then they would start just running the very first ever infomercials on spot and they were paying $35 for like whatever 12 hour block of TV time right and little the TV stations knows when the news ended most people who were sad or upset or depressed or whatever Not happy with the life they continued watching it and they started making insane amounts of money Just like when I happened when I was in college where it's like I spent five bucks on a Google ad to make $30 And it was like, you know the easiest thing in the world Same thing was happening back then but then guess what happened other people like wait, why are these guys going to commercials night? This is amazing. They started contacting station I want to buy commercial buy commercials and went from like $35 for all the airtime like $35 for an hour $35 for half an hour like $100 for half an hour to and then the prices went up to eventually now like that's like prime real estate Right the nighttime TV spots are some of the most expensive real estate you can get because those are the people who are trying to change their life I use the ones who are still live and late at night watching stuff, right? Which is why it's like prime infomercial territory But just interesting that's how media works over time and so funnels where it became essential because it was impossible to be to break Even to be profitable initially and so that's my favorite dang anything I've ever learned from him Anyway, there's so many there's so many other cool dang kenedesim so Here's one. I'm reading the angel is posted. There's three types of people who make things happen those who watch things happen Those who wonder what happened. Oh, sorry, there's three types people those make things happen Those who watch things happen and those who wonder what happened very very cool. Oh sweet, and then we popped up there. I love it Okay, so with that said it's kind of set up. I'm gonna jump into I'm gonna show you guys one little micro presentation from Dan. This is one that It's one of my favorite teaching points from Dan if you've studied him I've gone through everyone's courses every book everything's ever done I've gone through and he shares the story over and over again So after about the company at the very first funnel hacking live that Dan came to which was 2021 so right after it was the first event post pandemic that we did we brought Dan Kennedy out Nobody even most people thought he didn't even know he's he he survived like he almost died Most people that know he survived a lot people thought he was dead and so like we it was one of the coolest experiences We showed this Dan Kennedy video talking about him and then talked about how he died But then we talked about how he didn't die We told the whole story and then also like the screen comes up and like Dan Kennedy walks out with all the smoke around him And like and people went nuts like people were not even crying like I thought he was gone And he's here like it was like one of the most magical experiences ever And I had chance for like three hours to interview Dan from stage And so I knew like as I've asked some questions or stories I knew that like legendary Dan stories I wanted to hear the answer to and so I had asking questions to set him up and so This morning Ben moved went through the archives. I was like I want to tell this story. So we found this video clip It's not long. I think it's like I think it's like six or seven minutes long But this is one of my favorite Dan Kennedy stories And so I'm gonna we're watching this video together then we're gonna come back and I will tell you guys the story behind it because it's it's It's really powerful. Okay, it's all about well give you the title of it's how to go from being an annoying pest to a welcome guest So with that said Ben am I keeping this up? I think I am hold on there it is okay All right, that's that I'm a cute the video here in five four three two One of the stories I think you wrote about it. I don't originally the first time I read it was in the the ultimate sales letter I think he talked the story about The welcome guest versus annoying pest Would you really tell that story because I think it kind of ties into that and the marketing messages that people are yeah, so people show up as annoying pests Precisely because They don't get Message to market match Going in right so This is actually true I was living in Phoenix. I was home. I stayed home. I never went to the office and I didn't want to be there. They didn't want me to be there. You kind of know this gig, right? So I worked at home and it was a weekday middle of the day and We had big wood double doors and There's this monstrous banging on the wood double doors Bring in the doorbell and then bang it on the doors and This was a recession so the Avon ladies and the Jehovah Witnesses were carpooling and I Told that joke for 35 years. I've only ever got one complaint and it was not from the Jehovah Witness It was from an avon sales manager who I had just destroyed or sales force and self-esteem and they'll never work again You know just completely humorless Today you'd of course be banned from Facebook But But So Because I know no one invited is coming over I know this is an annoying past and I'm busy. I think I was on a phone so I ignore it Confident that if you ignore a pest generally it will go away Right, it will tire of Trying to get you to pay attention and move on to the next house So this goes on for a while, but I'm pretty stubborn so I can annoy I can ignore a lot and Next thing I know this Person has climbed over the back wall of My property which by the way has shards of glass on top of the to discourage this idea and they are There they've in the backyard they've capacity the pool and the hot tub and stuff and they are now banging on the sliding glass door Which they can see me through So now you're kind of a you know if you don't so okay So the message is all of the shrubbery in your front yard is on fire and the flames are licking at the At the stuff and of course not everybody was walking over the cell phone then so his message was You call the fire department now go back out there and work the hose Now at that second in time he went from being a Most annoying pest to a most welcome guest And and the only thing that changed was right message right time Right, that's it So You know in our world there's been a what I don't know a decade long Insanity of Email delivery drops open rates go down so marketer who was sending one a day since two then His open rates go down further so he sends four Then his open rates go down further so he sends eight until his open rate is zero and he's sending one every five minutes Right, you can't really amp up being an annoying pest and get results It's hard work a super salesman could do it You know like I've a friend do I always say you could give him a crate to stand on And put him in a bus station and he will walk out of there having sold $5,000 coaching programs to every vagrant who's in the place But he's a pretty rare fellow Right, most people are not you know, they don't have a combination of that skill I mean I say I could get a check out of Iraq. I'm not capable But I don't want to I want people to want to give me checks right and that's about this Dynamic change of always asking yourself is everything I'm doing here Organized To so that I'm showing up Has a welcome guest. It's why we use FedEx a lot instead of direct mail because Interest level automatically goes up because it's FedEx package. Yeah Very cool The next question I have for you and it's funny because I quoted you in all my books saying this and then I think three times in the Last two days I've quoted you this is like my the quote that the probably the biggest impact. We actually had a member who made What would Dan do bracelets, yeah, which I was really uncomfortable Handed out. I didn't stop them All right, there you go from welcome guest No from annoying pests to welcome guests or Mr. Dan can't even sell so question for you is that lesson that message How can you guys use that and what you guys are doing, right? Because all of us you think about marketers like we're not like people are like, yes, tell me something show me an ad get all excited How do you change the the environment where you move from being an annoying pest to welcome guests? And one thing to also think about is like it's not possible to always be a welcome guest There's gonna be people who are annoyed by you no matter what so first off like be okay with being annoying I guarantee there's some people right now listening to this who are like Russell so annoying he talks too fast Like I'm not gonna make I'm not gonna be welcome guests in the world no matter what yet They keep showing up which is just there's a lesson for another day, right? But understanding that like like how do you create an environment where it's like people look forward to hearing from you stuff like that? You know, I always think about this inside of our business like there's like the thing that you're selling, right? There's the the value is also like how do you entertain like who's it? Sunny D in our rap calls it edutainment like how do you wrap these things around where like you're entertaining people and you're educating like There's these two things together, right? It's not just just selling or whatever So how do you create these environments which were really fun? There's also like figuring out like how do we find somebody and get our message in front of them at the right time? Some people will go and they'll do a webinar once and like oh I got X amount people bop and no one else bought and they kind of and they don't realize like and this is why this comes back to the Theme from last week, which is like going consistently over and over and over and over You have no idea like when your person needs your message, right when they're ready for it essentially have a buddy that's in like the the dating like how to pick up chicks market and He emails his list. You guys guess how often not once a day not twice not three times nine times a day I was like you really just nine times a day first off How do you like have enough energy to write 90 emails a day number one? But I was like why do you do that? He's like you have to understand He's like most of the time the dudes are on my list. He's like they're they're in a relationship and they're happy So they follow me because they're there for the for the entertainment and the stories and stuff like that They like hearing them like we have a relationship, right? He's like but I know that there's gonna be this point in time where something's gonna happen where girls gonna break their heart They're gonna get dumped something's a frustrating He's like I want to make sure that I am the first email in the inbox when that hits so that I can take them I can serve him right then so for him He's just like there's like 2,000 emails a day coming in he's like every like 10th email is gonna be one from him Now I'm not saying you guys to do that. I don't do that But conceptually it's like best way to be consistent with our message and he come out of it over and over and over again Because eventually the people like it's gonna be the time when the right person hears it and they're able to come in step forward Right typically with most of you guys you'll be you'll get tired of your story way before the marketplace gets tired of your story, right? Like if I have to tell the potato gun story one more time I literally want to jab my eyes out with a fork or a spoon or something It's just like I don't want to tell a story anymore But like there's a whole new audience showing up every single day who wasn't there the day before It's like I keep telling the story and telling the story so that when they are ready There'll be a chance to hear it and then the bill coming to into our tribe into our fold and we can help them and serve them So Anyway, any other interest you got any other things you guys got from that from the Dan Kennedy? Yes, Justin said message to market match making sure that you've got the right message to market match 100% Yeah, we said nine is too many emails It is for your made for my market your market with some markets like you know, yeah, I think about this like I remember back in the Day there's always this big debate like how often should you marry your list people like oh once a month or like once a week or whatever And people like oh so hard and it's like the reality is like if you're putting out stuff people want to hear from like They'll listen to every single day like people watch TV every single day They watch the news every single day like if you are putting out stuff that's entertaining It's exciting this like something they care about the listen to every single day. So the more you do the better There's obviously always kind of a always kind of a fine line. So Anyway, oh see Donnie said what's the potato gun story? See Donnie's coming in doesn't know the potato gun story I've only told it 18 billion times. So maybe I should tell the game right now. I'm not gonna tell today But yeah, that's how I got my start and this whole business was through a potato gun DVD teach people how to make potato guns, right? And so like that's my origin story. I keep sharing keep sharing it so that What do they say like when the student is ready the the teacher will appear, right? I have no idea what it's gonna be and all sudden it's gonna happen It's funny because I meet people all the time like Russell you changed my life like I haven't fallen you since the very beginning I'm like, oh, yeah, what was that? They're like 2017 like that's when I bumped into you at the very beginning I was like, I've been I've been doing this game for 17 years prior to that you just found out about me right there That's your beginning. That's not my beginning, right? So everyone's like gonna bump into you different times and it's the beginning of their career their journey with you and they think like that's the Beginning of it all and they have no idea about everything you did in the past Which again, why its consistency is showing up and doing these things over and over and over again is so valuable It's so important. So there you go guys There is the thought for today is how to go from being an annoying pest to welcome guests a lot of cool ways You can do that in your business. Just think about that And that's kind of what I want to share with you guys today. So Russell rhymes with patience Sorry, I'm reading the comments right now. You guys are awesome.
