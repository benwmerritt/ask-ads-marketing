We moved here when I was 11, 11 years old. We moved here from South Africa and decided to move here. Better life, better opportunities. We sold everything. We opened our doors, put a foresail sign. People would come and buy our dishes and silverware and my Legos and my marbles and all that stuff. Packed the rest of the stuff into two suitcases. So I had to leave a lot of stuff that I couldn't bring, it was sad. And I didn't have any videos of myself growing up. You know, like I wish I did, you know, and it's tough. Like there was one family that had, they would always bring their camera and they have more photos and I'm like, God, I don't have enough photos of me here. Not having that photo makes a big difference. My name is Josh Pather with Photo Booth International. We manufacture photo boots and photo kiosks for the event rental and the retail industry. We help entrepreneurs start a photo booth rental business and create opportunities for them and help change lives. So my journey started, I was a wedding DJ for about three years and I had a business partner that went to a wedding and he saw a photo booth there. He called me up, he said, hey, I think I can do it better. We went to Home Depot, we got some screws, some nails, pieces of wood and just a couple hundred dollars and built a box with a photo booth. We used an inkjet printer and we made our first photo booth and so that's how we got started. Took it out, did our first event, was a big hit at the party. They were just all crowding around it, everybody was happy. There was a memorable time that it created for those people, you know. Here we have... Number one, booth one actually, that's what we used to call it. I still have the computer that used to go in here. So this is where it all started. We started growing, you know, added two photo boots, four photo boots. So we were growing rapidly every year and started getting bigger and bigger clients. They were requesting more crazy things like we had a ball pit photo booth, we had branded photo boots that we did for Facebook and Pizza Hut and at any given Saturday we had about 10 to 15 events going on at the same time. So eventually we ran into a scaling problem and we had more business that we can handle but we couldn't service everybody. So at that point, you know, we decided to show people how to do this and offer it as a business opportunity. So this is the sales office here and once they come into the funnel, then they come in here to our system, CRM system, and then one of the guys will call them and talk to them about the product, let them know what we offer, our training. But yeah, this is the first point of contact is over here. Yeah, so we had a lot of people asking us at every event like, hey, how can we get involved in this? We want to start this in our own city. And so we started taking those inquiries and we show them everything we've done here in Dallas and they're really interested and so we started selling the photo boots. Now we were able to build the product, pack it up, ship it to them and we just have to make sure that they can find us and we add a lot of value by telling them about all the stuff that we had to go through and training them and teaching them through YouTube and builds the trust. And then they come in and purchase and they feel comfortable and confident that they could buy this product and start their own business. So what you want to do is you want to go ahead and click on that. So over here we got some of our small photos from our customers, Photobooth International Family, hashtag. So that's solve our customers here and get to follow them and see the journey and get to remember like where we came from. So the challenge for us was, you know, we have a niche product and being able to present to them that they're not just buying a photo boot but they're buying an opportunity. And so we give them information up front so that they can see like this can be your dream business that you've always wanted. We have to do that, you know, in the right way and we do that through using, you know, our website and our funnels. With the ClickFunnels implemented, you know, we're able to get a lot more leads because we have a lot more front-end funnels, different offers, targeting different groups of people. And now we've implemented with ClickFunnels and now, you know, they provide the information, they get the free download, PDF or the book or different things that we offer to them. And on the back end, we can provide the training to them. We can even help them. We actually build funnels for them now and provide it to them so that they can start their business and, you know, get more leads for their business. Everybody wants to be part of a family, right? And you want that family that's going to support you and take care of you and help you. And so that's the kind of environment that we have for our customers and that we make them feel welcome and we make them feel accepted and that they're going to be taken care of. I know the struggle. I started from zero and we didn't have all the tools. So I want to make sure that if you come and buy from us, that you have everything you need to be successful. When we give you the tools, you build the empire and it's what I wish I had it whenever I started. It's crazy to think that, you know, these machines that just come from designs on pieces of paper, put some LED lights in it, a camera and printer and now it's like people buy them and it's changing their lives. I'm grateful for where we are today. It's been able to provide a lot of jobs. It's all the way down, you know, it's like different layers of the effect. The photos and the photo booth and all that is just having that memory in time. You know, when you think about memories, like when you go over to your family's house and you look through old photo albums, like those photos came from individual people, but now the photo booths, you know, they're capturing those moments and you can always go back and just have a warm feeling inside and have a good memory.
