## Transcript
I came here on February 14th, 2019. I've been here for many nine months. I worked in interior design for six years and my godmother, she helped raise me. She was an amazing business mentor and friend. She was my boss in interior design and we helped thousands of families put their homes together. If we were in New York or Chicago, it was easy to source New York and Chicago pictures if they wanted that on their wall. But if we were in Hickory, North Carolina or Annapolis, Maryland we didn't have that stock footage available so I would go out and shoot it for customers and they loved it. And as I got better and better, there was more and more demand for that. And then I would like, hang on, there's a niche here, people love this. My name is Craig Alexander and I'm a landscape photographer in Nashville. I think the biggest thing is caring about your customer more than anything else. I don't shoot pretty buildings or pretty mountains or pretty trees. I shoot landmarks, things that emotionally connect with people. I've talked to enough people and interviewed enough people to get what are the emotional triggers and what emotionally gravitates them. What symbol represents best their emotion for their city? I won't even turn on my camera until I find a view and I'm physically and emotionally moved by it and then I'll pull out and start shooting. I moved to Nashville in February and my godmother was in the last months of her life and the last thing she gave me before she died was a copy of Dotcom Secrets and she said, Russell Brunson has figured it out, follow him. It will give you the result that you're looking for in art and I remember pouring through those pages, I'm just reading that. This is the answer that I've been looking for, my entire entrepreneurial career to take it to the next level. What is your first impression of the art? ClickFunnels is the first thing that I could grab by the scruff of the neck and really create my own vision exactly as I want it. I've never been able to make a website by myself. It's really complex and there's so many buttons and I don't know what any of them do. But even more than the amazing functionality of this amazing software, I was inspired to make my first course because there are so many talented artists out there that never get a fair opportunity to show the world their work. And I've discovered knowledge and teachings that have brought me from being a failing artist to having made $125,000 in the last eight months purely selling my own art. So I'm going to break down the four steps of a sale. If you want to be successful as an artist in selling your work, you need to train as an entrepreneur. If you want to be a soccer player, you need to like, practice soccer for ten years. You can't build a bridge if you didn't go to school to learn how to build a bridge. The funnels is entrepreneur school. It teaches you the necessities of going out and killing it in business. Bringing art into the world, bringing beauty, bringing joy into the world through art is such a needed thing. The world needs more art. The world needs to hear unique voices that everybody has to offer. I never considered teaching courses or anything, but now I know that with webinars, I've met millions of people with one delivery and it's giving me the opportunity to present my unique insight that I have on selling art to the world. I believe that every artist deserves as much help as they can get because it's so easy to criticize an artist and it's so easy to minimize them or to not appreciate their work. And I feel they bring so much good to humanity that they deserve all the help they can get. And very often they're underappreciated or they're underserved or they're under help from a lot of resources. So in the same way that I wasn't successful until I got the tools, I want to be that provider specifically for artists in the same way that ClickFunnels has done for me.
