## Transcript
I'm a landscape photographer and I went from zero to seven figures without a social media following or an email list with the help of ClickFunnels. I wanted to create an online business and I wanted to be able to sell an information product, but I had no idea how to do it. I would say that I wasted some time. Hi, I'm Tim from TimsPhotos.com. I thought a good route for me to follow would be to try and build a following through YouTube. Just got off the helicopter. These long, curvy leading lines. Okay, this is looking really good. I was not considered to be an expert in any way. I was just a hobbyist, but I met Serge Remili. He's a very well-known landscape photographer. He said to me, you know, Tim, I looked at your portfolio. You take some awesome photos. You need to sell your knowledge online. And my recommendation for you is you need to read a book called Expert Secrets by Russell Brunson. Of course, there was that little voice whispering in my ear. No one's ever going to listen to you because you're not an expert. You don't have a following. You don't have awards and accolades. And I realized you don't need to be the expert of the experts to sell your knowledge online. You just need to be a few steps ahead of a beginner and be willing to put in the work. When I started, my first trip was going to cost me $11,000. So what I did, I put together a really quick funnel, and then I opened up this trip to be a photo workshop. Going to be really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And it paid for our entire trip, so we were able to go to the Camargue. And it was half a day's work to be able to put that together. And that's the power of ClickFunnels. It's quick. And if you have a business, you launch it, you try it, and you see if it works. And it's not something where I have to involve a tech guy. I can do this all myself. It's easy. That moment in time for me was kind of like that turning point from just a hobbyist where I didn't think I had any expertise that anyone would ever care about, to being able to help literally thousands and thousands and thousands of other photographers. Since I've found ClickFunnels, I can honestly tell you that it has changed the trajectory of my life and my entire family. Oh my goodness. It's beautiful. Wow. Tim Shields, Photography Academy 2020. It's gone from an interest to a hobby to a passion to a career. ClickFunnels has given me the freedom to live the life that I've always dreamed of living, where I'm traveling and I'm mobile. The business is making revenue for me on autopilot. And I have the life that I've always dreamed of. My name is Tim Shields. I'm a landscape photographer and I went from zero to seven figures without a social media following or an email list, all because of my hard work, my photography, and the help of ClickFunnels.
