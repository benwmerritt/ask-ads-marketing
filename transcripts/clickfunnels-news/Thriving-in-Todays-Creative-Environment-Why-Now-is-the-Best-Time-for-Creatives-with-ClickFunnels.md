Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm joined by Jamie Lewis. Jamie is the founder of BadassClass.com and has released several products including The Singing Guru, Beats 365, Sonic Producer, I'm With Jamie and many more. He's a two-coma club award winner and he's here today to tell us all about his entrepreneurial journey. Hey Jamie, thanks for being with me today. Thanks, it's great to be here. So tell me a little bit about your backstory. I know you've been doing this for quite a while. How did you get involved in entrepreneurship? 2004 when I was I think it was about like 28 years old or something like that. I got fired from a job. It was like a music production job and it's kind of a lower level but it was something that I always wanted to do right? And you know I'd been working jobs to make money or whatever until I was around that age but I had like this real experience and knowledge and how to treat music since I was like three years old and so that was my first endeavor was actual, it was an actual, I wouldn't call it like a SaaS project yet. I got into that later but it was it was like a download, like a music downloads where with all my music that I created and that was Beats 365. And then so because of the affiliate marketplace, it was like oh my god it's running on its own. I was like I'll just do that again and again and again and I just started, I started that way and at the same time I saw the affiliates were taking to it so it was like well I want to get commissions too. So at the same time as I was building these products I was like I want to learn how to affiliate marketing and then got into affiliate marketing and so I had these kind of two you know focus hits right? Being a vendor and being an affiliate and something really cool back then was I mean I don't know if it was, I don't know if it was a good thing or a bad thing but we had limited resources. Like so this is like 2005, 2006, 2007 and it was interesting there was only Google ads, you know Google AdWords and Craigslist and some SEO and that was it. Yeah, you know I mean then YouTube came out and I was like all right I'll play some music on a keyboard and see if anyone likes it you know and so I put up my first videos on YouTube making beats on a keyboard and everyone in the comments was like where can I get that keyboard? I was like oh my god sign up to Commission Junction and yeah I'll send sell some keyboards. So that was like the early days you know what I mean? Yeah it's interesting how when you see that people are interested in something or you're getting organic traffic and people want to buy the things that you're promoting like why should anyone not be earning commissions from something like that? It's such a basic concept but something so few people actually do. Yeah and that's something I teach to this day you know my students I got a lot of students and I teach them I say look at it that way if everyone in the comments is asking you for it or begging you for it you know and that wasn't even I wasn't even selling like I wasn't hard selling or anything like that so you know do you know demo it explain it or whatever and then a lot of the time you'll find that people would be begging you to buy it so yeah it was a really good early lesson so I had a lot of early lessons like that and I didn't back then I didn't know what a funnel was either I did really well you know by the time 2008 I was doing really well and I didn't have upsells I didn't know what upsells were and I didn't do email marketing either. Yeah but it sounds like you had a head start in the market at least from the business perspective. Yeah tell me a little bit about Badass Class what you do what you teach what it's all about. That has been like a project for like the last six seven eight months and we're launching it like on Wednesday and it's you know my my whole idea was like I wanted to create a you know like an online university for for internet marketing entrepreneurship and and sales and all sorts of stuff and so you know we put it together in a way where it is it is somewhat like a SaaS it's like a software as a service and there's quizzes and there's all this information but it's organized really well you know and it's it's kind of like a Montessori school like where you know it the system adapts to individuals yeah instead of like here's the method you have to do this if you don't take action and you know none of that it's like because everyone's different some some people think certain ways so that's what we put together and yeah that's an interesting analogy I like that what type of funnel are you using or what do you what have you been using that you find the most success with? I'm very very simple you know I use for instance I use click funnels because it it's awesome it's like super easy to use but also everyone else uses it and like my graphic designers are familiar you know so you know but we keep things very very simple and yeah our funnel our sales funnel is all all through you know all on click funnels and the bad ass glass funnel is pretty it's pretty involved and intricate and you know has a few different yeah I mean I got to see a little bit of it by just poking around in your funnels and seeing your like the VSL and the video which I think is such a great way for a program like that because you're able to introduce yourself and show your personality and talk about your background and I feel like that with a program like this you almost need to show your face and resonate with others and relate to them and I found it really approachable and I think that that's a really fascinating way to go about things or something of this magnitude of like hey you know I want you to learn from me from the things that I've done but let me share a little bit about my story first which I think is just really powerful yeah yeah I've got like three different VSLs because some you know this a sales contest to launch is like primarily pretty affiliate driven so I want to make sure I accommodate different different affiliates some affiliates like you know teaser type stuff and hype and all that and then some affiliates don't like that you know their people don't like that and they want like transparency like super super transparency like showing the inside you know under the hood and everything like that and so um yeah this one's a little more involved than other ones but yeah I've been teaching it since 2011 okay 2010 was like my first like internet marketing launch but there was a couple a couple of them that were like services yeah and then I got into like teaching it and ever since then ever since 2011 I've always been in videos like always been in the videos and everything and people they're always saying like you know they'll they'll get in or something and to one of my new ones and then they're like where'd you on the webinars I'll be on mute people on the webinars too a lot of people don't do that but like all right who wants to call in and then we mute everyone and use a couple dogs barking mute those back and then we're like sorry we'll get you in a second when you get calm your dogs down and then we're like so tell us about yourself and they're like well Jamie I first signed up with you in 2011 and etc you know and so yeah people know it's usually know it's me if you know they're they come across one of my projects because I'm in the videos and stuff cool well going into affiliate marketing because I know you mentioned you have both like you work as a vendor and then also as an affiliate and you know teaching those methods do you from your own perspective do you see the affiliate world getting oversaturated no never never I think um you know as we were talking about earlier with like back in the day where there weren't as many resources like I struggled to figure out which time was better because now we have all these really cool resources and social media and and there's so much more it's it's it's like you have a lot of power now and there's a couple other good things about nowadays you have a lot of power when it comes to affiliate marketing and the marketplace and the competitors etc but that might be the downside is you've got a lot of competition and costs are higher etc um but back then you know we didn't have a lot of you know we had limited resources but there wasn't as much competition so which time period do we favor right I think they think nowadays is is much more fun and and also here's another good thing about nowadays is like you can as a creative person um I thrive in this environment because like for instance Google rewards create creative people now back in the day they would reward anyone I mean someone could be like a hacker and just kind of cheat the system with all the stuff that I don't know how to do you know all this programming and all the stuff right and so that was kind of a bummer to get beaten but you know if I had a really good offer or really good um really good you know I I'm really quite um funny guy like when I do copywriting it's pretty hilarious and so I used to just kill it with ads and um sometimes I would get beaten by somebody who's smarter or technical and that does nowadays you're going to get rewarded in search results for for people you know human beings uh acknowledging that I'm a human being and and I'm talking to them and there's you know and so it's more human interaction experiences yeah yeah so I have a question about that and I don't know if you have an answer how like into this you get but how do you see AI impacting that it's so I'm actually like as a copywriter and everything um I watched I watched so many copywriters freak out yeah like they were freaking out and they're trying so hard to uh no offense to my my copywriting friends but um they're they were trying so hard to to all this sucks you know AI stinks you know and job security threat yeah but oh my god it's amazing yeah like yeah I just did this script I guess I'm gonna spill the beans it's it's I know this interview will come out later but I just did this ridiculous script and I and I um put it on a teleprompter and I filmed it like an hour ago in this really weird location a dangerous location and um you know with the drone and everything and and I use chat gpt for the entire script that I mean it was you know I kind of I was trained I trained it along the way and you know edited heavy editing and and then saying I don't like that part can you make me another part and stuff it's not like I like you use it and you're like hey write me a whole story you'd be like you know write me um a paragraph or write me a sentence or an opening headline or something like that giving it the right prompts so it's still you yeah and it does it does it wrong and then and then you'll say look why are you doing that you know I yell at it a lot I'm like I don't mean literally like you did that was the style do it in that style don't don't add in internal things that I'm talking about with you don't please don't spill the beans and put that and it's like all right I get it I'm sorry that's the greatest thing it's really you know so a lot of creative people are like you know with the job security thing right but for me like um oh my god that just it's a freak of nature I'm just like blown away by it yeah I'm asked to write I write a lot of my own stuff and sometimes it's like um you know like when I do my music and write my lyrics um 95% of that is me actually writing it but this last music video I put out I had one or two lines in there that chat gpt did but with chat gpt like when I do um when I ask it to write lyrics it's just really corny I mean I could probably better train it but why I don't know yeah and I think I think it exists to be a powerful tool when used the right way or I don't think it necessarily needs to take away an individual's creativity as much as it can enhance it or be more of like a collaborative tool of finding the problems that they need to come up with more creative things which I think is I think it's really cool for copywriters too yeah and I mean it's it's it's um it could do all sorts of things it could help you figure out a problem like some of the quizzes in badass class and help me create those quizzes yeah it's absolutely incredible really it's mind-boggling and at first I was kind of I didn't get it at first I was kind of like skeptical but then wow like yeah so I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty blown away but I think it's the same it's the same type of thing you still have to be pretty creative like with prompts and stuff so you know and understand the training aspect to it and and also have like a vision of the end result and everything so I don't think it's going to um I think it's the same you're gonna see a lot of people like just overlook it I think yeah you know what I mean and and that's something that we all need to do is look into the future and you know I saw it coming a bit I'm pretty good at looking into the future and not and saying well that's that trend is now don't work on that right that's going to be dead in six months and so yeah we need to look into the future what's going to happen next with AI and yeah interesting time for shirts I think it's a pivotal point for a lot of people in internet marketing like you you can do a lot with it um and I think as long as people are grasping it and embracing it uh they'll go far with it it's the people I think that are rejecting it that you know probably aren't looking at it the right way yeah looking at it the right way is a good point you know what I mean like the perception or whatever but um god it can help you with all sorts of different different stuff but again yeah for the copywriters who are afraid about it um afraid of it say you have nothing to worry about you know not a lot of people be you know you're and probably something that goes through their heads people who do copywriting for living probably something that goes through their heads is that it's like their competition is going to be using it and I mean maybe I don't know competition is going to be using it and then it's going to be harder to compete or something I don't know yeah I think it's an interesting time to see what's happening and how people are using it but certainly fun to play around with so yeah yeah going back into ClickFunnels and using them in your business uh can you tell me a little bit about your journey of like what led you to using a software like ClickFunnels was it for the ease of use was it because you were already familiar with Russell um I was I was in my own world during um you know I guess like 2016 I remember we did a launch for a for a uh a SAS program and a software that we did called Domain or Elite was actually really quite good and um and uh my partner who I he was I guess his role was the JV manager my partner he had ClickFunnels and that's he introduced me to it and we were using his account through that whole time like 2016 2017 or something like that and then yeah I got started late I think it's to end of 2017 or 2018 I got in I think so um that's been a while yeah yeah and then and then I just took off with it but lately I've gotten really I really enjoyed working with it lately actually um why would that be I don't know I got more hands on you know I was like I want to change the the look and uh do you use Classic or 2.0 I just use Classic I mean I might want to start so to get into 2.0 but just like with everything else like I used Final Cut Pro like one for something for video editing until like two years ago yeah so it was like 15 years late and then when I started using the new Final Cut Pro I was like oh my god yeah so sometimes I'm just like you know with that I was like oh there's no way I'm gonna relearn video editing and all I didn't have to relearn it it was pretty pretty quick so yeah it's Classic is so powerful and there's so much that you can do with it and I I mean I've used both I personally love them both what I find really cool about 2.0 is the lack of integrations you need like you can start to remove all of those additional softwares or things that you may not even be using so that you split test so that you can build your courses so that you can host video like all these different things that are a part of 2.0 which just makes your life so much easier it feels like you're not navigating through a bunch of tabs so much of what you need is inside that software which I think is really cool yeah just do do everything yeah I need to jump into it and see how much further I can you know kind of annihilate some of the the work that we do see how it can streamline our processes and yeah well and if you'd like to play with the design of your pages there's in our editor we now have style guides so when you apply it to your site you can apply it to every page every button every headline like everything has the same style which also saves so much time if you have multiple funnels and multiple pages and you want them to all have a similar look which is really cool yeah yeah yeah so so probably like if I ever get frustrated maybe 2.0 has optimized that and I yeah I definitely recommend at least playing around with it and seeing you know how you like it I was able to remove the email marketing software that I was using before and paying quite a bit for on an annual basis and remove that and import all of my contacts into 2.0 so that was cool because you can now create email workflows and follow-ups and auto responders and everything that you need directly in the software so it also saves money Gotcha so okay you had mentioned uh well in the introduction uh I told our viewers that you are a two comma club award winner can you tell us a little bit about the journey to winning that award and maybe what you have set in terms of goals for the future yeah I mean I um I started I was you know I see a lot of my friends winning the um you know the the 10x and everything and I was like oh there's no no way I can or the two comma like I was like there's no way I can um there's no way I can get that award because the um you know I'm I do so much stuff outside like a lot of like when we talk about sales or you know all that stuff there's a lot of stuff I'm doing outside of clickfunnels right but then I was like huh come to think a bit I was and I was also thinking like it's not just one funnel you know it's like so many different things and so I was thinking wait a second I did that on clickfunnel so that was the there is one that was like you know 1.5 million or something that was in one funnel you know what I'm saying but yeah I wish I could get that the 10x I wish I'd used clickfunnels for everything I'd done I'd have two or three of those silver things yeah you know what I'm saying like that's what you call it right yeah from from the one you call streams well I'm kind of like a clickfunnels newbie you know I was like Lee Blumenthaler got in like late and everything and then maybe you know because I'm using it more and more and I'm really enjoying it more but yeah admittedly I'm really kind of like a newbie I'm artistic very artistic and like creative and and uh well I think that's really inspirational for people out there who maybe feel like uh no I'm not an entrepreneur I'm a creative it's like you can be both it doesn't they're not you know mutually exclusive like you can be a creative who applies what you do into an online funnel and it works for you and what I like about what you've done is like you've made the funnel work for you as a creative and you also found a way to see the other side of that of being an affiliate so like you're working kind of both angles of it and you still get to do what you love and be a creative person I think so many people will be inspired by that yeah and I mean it must work the other way around too because I um I learned business like I learned how to use the mathematical side of the brain from doing all of this but before that I didn't know I was like not interested in math or anything right yeah you know how to do certain mathematical equations that I have to do now right so I think I think the other side is is someone you know a lot of people are they're not creative and so it it does it does help to build up your creativity your imagination and vision yeah you know imagination and vision are like really important um it's looking into the future right and there's a lot of reasons why you want to have an imagination and be creative and you know it's the creative side of the brain right and you look in the future so that's the one thing like for people who are creative you know get get it going because it can you can definitely learn it you know it could be learned and like I I learned that other side you know the the the math and like the critical thinking and all that stuff you know yeah it came along because you were interested because you were pursuing your creativity which I think is cool yeah yeah yeah I had like a real incentive you know there's there's the incentive there and the gold and your should be good you know yeah kind of pull you along you know yeah that's powerful so speaking of your business and the things that you can teach people if there was somebody let's say a very creative person who didn't think that they had a business bone in their body but they had some really great ideas and they've only pursued being creative what what kind of advice would you give them for maybe turning that into a business um if they were creative start with just brainstorming and writing down you know the architecture uh so some of the first steps would be your business model and the niche and then after you get through those stages then branding and then after branding then launch it yeah you know what I mean like well no all right so after branding then you know you got two different things you've got your sales and you've got your fulfillment so you know sales page thank you page yeah so I try to keep it simple with people now that's like the the vendor side like if someone's really creative and they're like I want to do my product that's that instruction for that as an affiliate it's it's like affiliate marketing is more of like it's not really like the business model it's like the method of monetization so your job if you want to be an affiliate you're basically an influencer or a leader and so branding cool but then you don't start writing a table of contents for like your book you know not not yet if you want to be an affiliate marketer make those click bank you know have those click bank bars like crazy numbers all you know then um build up your social media account and focus on on one like we've had many case studies where I was like really heavily involved in like building somebody up and you know working through them right and so like all right we got the brand let's open up a youtube facebook page tiktok and then the student or the subject of who you know who i'm working with they'd take like facebook is their thing like they had the we open up the youtube and the tiktok but facebook they just ran with it because that was just like their style you know like they saw the results there like for some reason that was just for them and then some people just go crazy on youtube and they got like they're really good at like doing tutorials and stuff yeah some people are really good at tiktok right yeah so that's like they'll kind of find their wheelhouse and what works for them and let that take off yeah yeah and i mean there's also i mean some sometimes people are really good writers and bloggers and they're gonna do really well with sdo it's a good combination of being creative and being able to write and then also the technical side of things like analytics and finding the keywords to to focus on right following the rules you know um so yeah that's the for anyone looking to get started like um you know you have to do it in those steps it's like when you go to study karate you know it's going to be boring the first you know lesson and or like i think of a here's a better example like it's gonna learn how to play violin right so if you learn how to play violin if you're going for your first violin lesson you know i want to learn how to play like that you know like josh will bell or something and you're like holding the butt like they're teaching how to hold the bow the entire hour it's boring like you're gonna be like i wanted to learn how to play so you know you have to make sure you could be a fast learner and you could be like i really want this i really want this i really want this and then your teacher's like wow you got a great bowl right you remember that right yeah remember that all right and then you can go into the next stage so you can actually go through these stages like really freaking quick you know like um i've done projects where i went through every stage like super freaking quick and you know that i was like in the shower or something i'm like business model selling to the niches the people right selling to those people and then like i'm gonna name it that let me go to go daddy and see if that domain is available boom it's like half an hour later i've got the business model and niche the brand name and then and then now start writing your you know what something i like to teach students is like write your chapters and you know the reason you you you start writing your chapters are like they're they're basically like in the form of like a ebook whether it's like clickbank kindle whatever it's going to be like your bullet points your modules um and the actual content like the actual what somebody is buying you know so it's kind of like your um or here's another metaphor whatever you call it if you have a cd like an artist like a musician and you buy the cd they're songs right so it's kind of like that architecture right there it's like if you have like your one product or your or your youtube that you're an affiliate you got youtube channel then you have videos inside there so that is the correct like um you know what i mean it's like yeah it's like the galaxy solar systems right like that so yeah it's pretty it's pretty it's it gets better if you look at it that way i know a lot of people are like scatterbrained especially young people like younger people are like really scatterbrained um like where they're like they don't know which business model to do and um and and then uh put that i think and i think they're nowadays everything is so mobile and we have such fast access to information that if you sign up for something you expect to just know exactly how to do it right away or you expect commissions to come in or whatever and i think there still needs to be that emphasis on like sharpening the axe before cutting down the tree it's like you're building the foundation but the rest will come in each day it's going to scale and get a little bit better as you're building your brand and your personality and your creating content or whatever channel you decide to to utilize whether that's on social or in a blog or whatever i think once people kind of hone in on that and find their wheelhouse that's probably where it really starts to escalate yeah i mean it's really difficult to teach people people don't want to learn how to become creative so i i saw a lot of done for you stuff like i do like i build things that are really freaking cool for people to save them time and they can get to it quicker right but um when you talk to someone who's having trouble and they're like i really want to do this a lot of the time it's that lack of creativity i'm really i'm i'm seeing it's it's so i'm so certain about this um for instance like you know i'll say to a student i'll say hey did you do your did you put do get it up on click bank yet did you get your idea up on click bank yet and they'll say um i i've been fumbling around with click bank all for the last two days and i can't log in and i'm so upset and all this stuff right and i'm like worry about that later write the book first do all that that what i told you to do first like the you know the niche brand table contents write the book write the sales page do all that first you see what i'm saying so yeah really it's it's um it's a rock and a hard place so i need a little bit of both i i i do try to teach creativity and like like make that process like they're gonna do it somebody's gonna do it on their own like make that process simpler but yeah yeah but you mentioned that for creatives is like do the tactical stuff like understand what like build your own framework and then you know you get to be creative just once you follow that framework which i think it's like it's in it's it's easy to do it's just whether or not people will actually sit down and do it yeah i mean so a lot of the time like with my help they do they do um people sit down and they they're able to use a combination of my templates and then also like stick to that you know don't bypass um you get your butt kick like just if you bypass like if you want to learn like um you know uh martial arts like if you skip those very very important stages then you're gonna get your butt kicks you know what i mean yeah so it's important and like boom boom boom with that framework and then build the architecture whatever it is you know yeah yeah cool well thank you for that advice and for sharing a little bit about you and your business where can people go to learn more about you and and what you're doing badassclass.com or you could do a search on um youtube for like jayme luis domains or something i do a lot of dominating so and that's what my youtube stuff is like dominating and then on facebook i've got my person you know my uh it's it's kind of like a b2b type of facebook which is interesting i'm always posting a lot of stuff there and it's jayme luis money on facebook it's pretty good but yeah and then i'm we want social media as well yeah i'm recently on
