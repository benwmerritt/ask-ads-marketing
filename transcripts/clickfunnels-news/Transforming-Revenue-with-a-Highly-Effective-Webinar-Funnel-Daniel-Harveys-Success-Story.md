Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm speaking with Dan Harby. Dan is the co-founder of Passion I.O., a platform that helps creators, coaches, and entrepreneurs easily create their own mobile apps. He started his journey as a touring musician who wasn't making very much money but he wanted to figure out a way for artists and creators to monetize their passion. He helped build over 10,000 passion businesses using Passion I.O.'s suite of tools and as a serial entrepreneur he's made his living inspiring others to live out and achieve their own dreams and we're going to learn more about that today. Welcome Dan, thanks for joining me. Thank you so much. Enjoying, uh, oh excited to be here. Great to have you. So let's start off by just giving our audience a little bit of background on what led you here today. Sure, I've been a musician my whole life and when I was 19 I decided I needed to drop out of university and pursue my career as a musician. I was studying maths and it just wasn't for me. I joined a band, we did quite well, in the UK we had an album in the charts we taught around the world but it was still very difficult to earn money and so at some point the money ran out and we could no longer play music which sucked because we enjoyed it but also we had fans all over the world who wanted us to make music and they wanted to come see us play and so after that experience decided I would make it my mission to help people earn more from their passion and now that was almost a decade ago. I'm older than I look and we've now helped like over 10,000 coaches, creators, entrepreneurs to launch their own mobile apps and to earn more from their passion and they've got between them like over a million end users so I'm really excited about the impact we've been able to have so far and it still feels like day one so we're still very excited on what's to come. That's incredible so did you have like an aha moment of there being a need in the industry for something like this that made you want to start a software that would help artists and creators? Yeah I'm very lucky that I have a co-founder who is technical and product minded and so my co-founder Matias was an instructor on Udemy which is like an online course platform and he was one of the bigger instructors they had close to 50,000 students but he really wasn't earning much money from that as well because they take a big percentage and they do heavy discounts on everything and so he decided he wanted to create his own platform. He tried out things like Kajabi and Thinkific and Teachable and he found that none of them were as they were all quite like static they weren't as dynamic as he wanted then the other thing he noticed was he was using his phone for everything but all these platforms were designed to be built and consumed on the web on desktop devices and so when he looked into what he could do in terms of building an app he realized it's extremely expensive it takes a long time and usually even after all that you're left with something that's not particularly beautiful not particularly high converting and decided that he would build his own and that's that's basically where we met so he had like the same vision for the change we wanted to see in the world but I was very lucky that he had the product vision. That's so cool so who is like the ideal customer or user of this platform? Coaches, creators, entrepreneurs, people who want to monetize content so education, people who want to monetize coaching, helping people to get from where they are to where they want to be and also people who want to monetize a community so the two main features that we focused on building out and really making work to a high level is courses and content so you can build things like a Netflix style library of content like your own Netflix if you like you can build courses with gamification and progress tracking things like that and then the second one is the community and with that we focused on building something a bit like a Slack or a Discord where you can create channels and you can create multiple communities you can have one-on-one conversations you can send images videos things like that and really the idea is like how can you as a creator entrepreneur coach instead of charging you know 10 bucks a month for an app which is what most people think about and they think about the price of an app how can you create a product in an app that's worth $500 a thousand dollars $5,000 because then you only need a handful of customers to make a really good living and that's kind of like that's that's the paradigm shift we're trying to help people realize is like you don't need thousands of customers to be successful you just need a high value product and then a handful of customers. It's interesting because it's a lot like what we do here at ClickFunnels with our web-based platform so I see the value in like membership sites and courses and all that so what do you think is the biggest value add for people to do this mobily? Yeah I mean I think it's the device we spend the majority of our time on if you look at social media Instagram Facebook ticked up all of them have been mobile first for a long time if you look at gaming it's very much mobile first if you think about where do you order food you're going to do that mobile first as well and the education system hasn't really moved mobile first because it's actually quite hard like what we're doing is quite a technical challenge so there's a reason why Kajabi and Thinkific and Teachable and others have focused on the web which is like it's much easier to create something that's highly functional so it's the device we're all using and of course if you want as an entrepreneur if you want to impact people if you want to make money from your skills if you want people to actually use your product and stick with it then being on the device that they use the most that they that you're one tap away is always going to drive a lot more engagement and enable you to grow a more sustainable business. I have to say we were a massive ClickFunnels fanless by the way we use ClickFunnels we were really proud we just hit the two comma clubs C the 25 million and beyond award and the symbiotic relationship I see there is like you really want to do your sales funnel on the web especially for high ticket products because you don't want to be paying like Apple and Google 30% commission for like the the revenue share that they take so it's great to use things like ClickFunnels for the actual funnel to get your customers in but then once you have your customer you can convert them into you give them access to your app a little bit like when you join Netflix you signed up on netflix.com you paid and then you log in on the app to actually consume the content so yeah like ClickFunnels on the front end passion on the back end is a really good is what a lot of our customers actually do. Yeah it's such a fascinating dynamic so with us serving very similar customers who are creators and entrepreneurs and coaches who want a way to get their voice out and create and find customers how does ClickFunnels actually help you being another SaaS company build your business and help it grow. Well the first thing ClickFunnels did which I have to just have to share this is that really ClickFunnels a ClickFunnels event funnel hacking live gave us the confidence to launch our business we started as an agency in the very beginning like where we were kind of doing it was a done for you thing and we did everything marketing operations customer support and then we always wanted to launch this software but we never had the confidence to do it and we we always thought it wasn't ready yet and we always thought that like it won't be successful and then we went to funnel hacking live in 2018 and we saw the people speaking on stage who were amazing inspiring people and we realized that that actually although they were amazing and they'd achieved amazing results they were also just like people like we were and and I think that seeing what people had achieved on the platform and being in the room with them made us realize okay like we can do this and we launched the software like two months later so the first thing that ClickFunnels did was the inspiration and the confidence to get started and then I had myself and the whole team read expert secrets about four times because the book is is incredible and and we knew that a core pillar for ourselves but also our customers on how to be successful is not just the tools it's also the education people need to know how to be successful with it and so the second piece ClickFunnels gave us was was the education with with expert secrets and then and then a bunch of other courses that we've done and then the third piece which is funny because it came the other two came first but the third piece that really then enabled us to scale was of course the software and some of the key features that we find great as a software company is like now and I think you call them OTOs or like add-ons like one time up upsells like I've heard Russell Brunson say that the the company who can pay the most to acquire a customer wins and so we have our software product and in order to acquire a lot of customers for that we want to make as much revenue upfront as possible so that we can afford to spend money on marketing and bring people in and so it's been really effective for us using one-time add-ons to increase the amount of money we make per customer up front on our fridge we also launched a webinar funnel which has been extremely successful for us we got our very first customer through a webinar and and we've now we're now on to our like I don't know 73rd iteration of our perfect webinar and it's it's generated you know millions and millions of dollars for us in revenue completely automated and so running a webinar funnel on the on the platform has been extremely valuable for us not only to acquire customers but also to educate them on how to be successful yeah so did that start out as a live webinar where you put a presentation together and then you eventually ever greened it yeah I learned again from Russell he said like most people make the mistake of trying to like evergreen immediately like you need to do it live and so I listened I started doing a webinar every week and what we found was like I live in Europe most of our customers are in the States what we found was like the best time to do a webinar was 1 a.m. till 3 a.m. European time right so I would stay up till 3 a.m. a couple of times a week for about three months and I would do this really energetic high energy webinar and then have this adrenaline rush and eventually crash but I I did that for months on end constantly evolving and iterating the presentation until the point where it was converting we got it to about 15% conversion rate from attendee to purchase on a $1,000 product so every attendee was was generating $150 on average and we thought okay that's good enough to to automate now and then I got some sleep after that which was which was nice it's a pretty incredible conversion rate do you feel like doing that consistently helped your performance skills helped you share your knowledge like would you recommend doing that as consistently as you did before turning it evergreen when someone is world class at something they make it look easy right the issue with that is we we mistakenly think it is easy and then we go out and we just try and replicate it and so for people who are watching like Russell Brunson do the perfect webinar it he makes it look easy but the issue is it's not and it takes a long time and people definitely make that mistake a webinar is an insanely powerful thing if it converts and it can also be a huge time sink because it's not easy that you know you're creating a one or two hour presentation that takes some time and especially if you want to get it right so it's a little bit like writing a book I've not earned my book yet I haven't written a book because I think I haven't yet earned it but if you listen to the people who've written the best selling like business books like Russell Brunson like Alex Halmosi they crafted it for years and did like 17 18 drafts and and boiled it down and re-edited it and then it creates an amazing simple book then there are a lot of other folks who use AI and don't even read their own book let alone write it and nothing wrong with AI in a way to to to create ideas and things but like of course people who do that are not going to create a successful book so it's the same with a webinar you have to put in the work you have to iterate you have to listen to why people bought you have to listen to why people didn't buy you evolve your presentation you change your wording you change the way you put you talk you change your energy you try things until it works and of course you start with a foundation of like learning from someone who's done it don't start for like figuring it out from zero yeah so there's definitely failures that have to happen in the process for you to improve and get better at what you're doing can you speak to that at all in where you've been versus where you are now like how failures have maybe helped you get to where you are yeah we've had multiple situations in the company where we've been close to running out of money we've we've had multiple funnels and things that we've lodged that have failed one that springs to mind is when we started the company we were an agency and we had a revenue share model and so we had a few customers that made the majority of our money and at this point we already had a team of like 10 people so you have like commitments you have to pay salaries and you have to make money every month um our biggest customer just like overnight decided that she didn't want to do content anymore and just stopped and and so like most of our revenue dried up overnight and we were losing money and we had basically 30 days money in the bank and so we had to figure out like how to make that work we found um the personal trainer who you know his name's Alcabad Lo he like saved our business we found him and said hey we want to launch something with you we'll do everything for you but we need to do it like today and we flew out to New York we filmed uh in a gym some content we were like editing it on the flight on the way home we launched it on click funnels the day we got back and um I think that launch generated like I don't know what it was back then 30k or 40k or something and it saved the business it like it meant that we could pay our employees and and uh and we didn't go to bankrupt wow though pivoting after feeling like you were about to run out of money and collaborating with your team and coming up with a way to save the company and doing something that was probably completely different for you guys is what brought you here today yeah that's that's definitely what I can also tell you my first webinar I was I was stood in in like this kind of like echoey white room with no furniture in it that was like our old office that we that we basically borrowed from a friend I had a cheap desk with like five cardboard boxes on top with my laptop on it and then I was like stood up I was doing my presentation um I think something like 12 people came to the webinar and they had all left by like 20 minutes in which I have not realized and so for the next two hours I was doing this like webinar presentation like performing trying to do my best and I genuinely thought that I'd be the one even though Russell Branson says everyone needs to do it 50 times first I'd be the one that like is an instant success they'd all left and like I after I hit end I like was completely exhausted I'd put months of work into this presentation I checked my phone to see like how much money had we made and of course zero because we had zero people on the call by the end so you know I was pretty much ready to give up at that point as well yeah I think one of the most interesting things that I've learned with having these interviews with users is everyone has shown the vulnerability of overcoming adversity of some kind and I think that there's a lot of that in your story too with being a musician who was passionate about what you're doing um but there's financial struggles and everybody has been through those financial struggles in order to get their two comic club award to grow their business to get new clients so tell me a little bit about your journey of like being an artist and how that drove you to be successful yeah when I was in in the band we we were able to earn about 600 pounds a month each which was like I don't know what that is like 800 dollars or something which is not a lot to live on and that was that was for everything right um and you know like we we had to find a way to make it work so we did I think like the thing that like we felt we were very lucky to earn any money doing you know doing what we love and we had people getting tattoos of our lyrics on their bodies we had people flying from the other side of the world to come to one of our gigs um we we launched an album and people bought it and it went into the charts like we were very we felt very lucky for all of that stuff um but it was at some point it was 600 a month then it was 500 400 and then it was zero and it's like you can't live on zero pounds and what's funny is I didn't know then what I know now but actually we had an incredible foundation to generate revenue because we had people who were really invested in what we were doing if we would have had a good offer if we would have had a good product if we would have had a vibrant community um we would have been able to earn really good money like but I didn't I didn't have the tools and the information back then and um and then I was able to learn it from people like Russell Brunson and others I was able to implement it and see some success for ourselves and also um the most rewarding thing is I've been able to pay that forward and see yeah thousands of people from every niche you can imagine be successful um and and thrive from doing what they love and it really comes down to we're on this planet once is at least what I believe and um we spend a great deal of our time working right if we're working on something that we don't love you're spending the majority of your time doing something you don't enjoy and it doesn't make any sense and doing what you love is not to earn money is also not selfish because when you do what you love you do brilliant things you create stuff from the heart that people enjoy we had fans of our band people liked our music people got tattoos and when we couldn't earn money doing that and we stopped doing that that means we stopped putting that value into the world so my worldview is if we're all able to do what we love the world will be a better place because we're putting love into what into what we do um and so we want to help all people do that no it's really powerful are you still pursuing music in any way um for fun yeah you know what's funny is like when people ask me that I have to I have to share that like what I do now actually suits me much better I've learned that um I actually love this even more than what I was doing because as a musician um it's very creative um but it's not like I need a lot of mental stimulation and so I need a lot of like hard work in the mind and I wasn't getting that from music in the way I do for business so I actually like really love what I'm doing here um but I have a drum kit I I play just for fun and to let out some steam yeah and now you can enjoy it without having to worry about it you know sustaining you financially right that's so cool so what would be your one piece of advice for somebody who maybe they are an artist or a creator um and they do have a passion but they're trying to figure out how to turn that into their living what would be your piece of advice for them figure out how to create a profitable business model figure out how to sell something that people want to buy and it might sound like the most obvious thing in the world but what I find from creators and entrepreneurs and coaches is like we all we're all designed this way because we want to solve a problem and we want to create something build something do something creative and and actually figuring out how to make money from that is kind of like a secondary thought but the issue is money is oxygen for your business and for your life and if you don't figure out how to make money from something you also won't be able to do that thing that you want to do over here that helping people or building something creating something and so rather like most people think like what can I create who can I help like they're thinking about the product I suggest my my number one advice is figure out how to make money from it first because once you have money and a way of consistently generating money you can create the most incredible thing I'm so proud of what we've built but it costs half a million dollars a month to continue building it where would I have got half a million dollars a month from as a musician earning 600 a month so I had to figure out how to make money in order to actually create the thing that I wanted the change I want to see in the world and most people get it backwards I think that's really great advice because I think so many people do especially in the creative industry kind of put the cart before the horse and it is essentially about pursuing what you love and how to serve others but in order to do that you need the financial means in order to keep it sustainable and you're only able to serve if you can maintain a business and I think that it's really important to actually talk about the financial stability in that and it's not selfish it's it's the best way for you to continue to serve in the long term and I that makes so much sense with what you're doing and especially the name of your business being passion IO is you can only serve your customers who are passionate about things or what you're passionate about yourself if you really do care about your business model and making money from it yeah that's powerful I love that so tell us where we can learn more about you and your business yeah you can go to our website ashen.io you can follow me on social media they call me passion
