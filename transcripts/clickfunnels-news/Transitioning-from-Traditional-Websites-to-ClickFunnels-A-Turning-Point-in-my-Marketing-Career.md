## Transcript
Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura Demetrius with ClickFunnels, and today I'm speaking with Danny Walsh. Danny is a marketing expert and a ClickFunnels evangelist. He's been using and believing in the software for a long time and has been selling physical and digital products with it. He's a business owner, a top affiliate, and a super ambassador in our ClickFunnels community. Welcome Danny, thanks so much for being my guest today. Hey, thanks for having me and thanks for the amazing introduction. Of course, so let's get started by just giving us a little bit of background and how you guys started in marketing. Marketing has always been something that I've had to do. And I'm 42 now. And back when I was 18, we decided to set up a music website. And this was before the days of YouTube and Facebook Live and me and a bunch of friends. We created this crazy website. But somebody had to build this thing, right? Because we didn't have any money. So even from way back then, which is a long time ago now, all the way up until present day, I've had to figure things out for myself on the computer. How do you do this video? How do you do this design? And over time, people would be like, hey, Danny, can you do that for me? So I would make posters for people or leaflets of flyers or maybe websites and things like that. So I've been doing this stuff for a long, long time. It's great to see how it's involved. I just wish we had some of this stuff back then. It's like, that's kind of looking that. So I've been doing this for a while. Great. And what was it that led you to ClickFunnels or learning about Russell Brunson? I think the big turning point, I always kind of knew about ClickFunnels, even when it was launching because I was active in the kind of JV internet marketing affiliate kind of spaces. And you'd see these launches appearing and then this dude appeared and he's like, hey, I'm giving away a car. And all the guys were jumping on this. And I thought, oh, this is amazing. But I used traditional websites. We were building these things in HTML, literally Coddy in this stuff, in Dreamweaver, and trying to make things in Flash and all of these crazy things. And I was always thinking, I wish I could just do that order form bump thing that Russell does. You know, with the little tick and he's like, oh, do I made that happen? And then you sort of see this a little bit more and then dot com secrets came out and all of that stuff. And I started to immerse myself in those things. But there was a big, like a big disaster. I had websites that I was building for clients. And all of a sudden the server, it's like, we get this email server problem, oh man, server problem. And then the form starts ringing. And I think we had 73 clients all with, like, they, I don't know, they were paying like 20 pounds, 20 bucks a month, right? For this website hosting and the whole thing fried. And the server company, even though we paid for backups, they said the backup's gone as well. So overnight, I have like 73 clients and then all of the websites were gone because of this crazy problem. All the data was gone. The data, and they said because of data protection, when they take the hard drive from the server, their protocol is to incinerate this thing. So not only did I lose the stuff, the backup didn't work, their process. So obviously nobody takes this home in the car or whatever, was to throw your years of- You could never get it back. Into the furnace. So I had probably, I don't know, 50 of these clients will I, you know, to hell with this, we're gonna go to somebody else and there was a disaster. But I still have people who needed a website because, you know, I have nightclubs. And like I said, from the music days, I had these nightclubs and promoters and people who were, you know, amicable, but also may have been seen as, you know, hey, these guys are in the music industry. You don't want to upset these people. I needed a quick way to get things back. And ClickFunnels was that way. And talk about how to move fast. But I think within like two weeks, I managed to get 10, 15, 20 of these guys back online. Thanks to ClickFunnels. And then I could do the both thing. And he was like, ha, now we're actually in a new way of working and saw the journey kind of begun. Wow, that leads to so many questions. Well, I know that you had mentioned that you've, you understand coding, that you use Dreamweaver, that you know HTML. So how was it not only creating websites by coding, but having to completely rebuild and design new websites with essentially drag and drop editors? I think one of the things that we was just kind of emerging just before the big disaster was drag and drop stuff in WordPress and these kind of things. And in the end, we kind of had it where you could click a button and it had created WordPress site. And then you had all these plugins and you'd kind of give that to your customer. But then you'd have to update the plugin. And then you'd have to update WordPress. And then this thing, that's not working with this thing. It wasn't the best even though the drag and drop was emerging. So it was really a breath of fresh air to be able to go into ClickFunnels and headline video. Because what more do you need on a page than what was actually available in the classic editor at the time? Yeah. You know, in order form, an email thing, whatever it was, it got rid of a lot of that plugins and stress and all the stuff associated. And it probably saved us, I don't know, thousands or more a month. And not only did it, it was easier and better and it actually saved us a big bunch of money as well. So I would say it was a godsend at the time. And as we've moved, it's just become better and better and better. Amazing. So were these clients, were they typically running like traditional websites or were they using Funnels? And it was just easier to create Funnels. Kind of how did you make that shift and what led you to building Funnels for them? So in the first instance, they were a lot of traditional websites. And some of the night clubs and entertainment guys that we were working with, these guys, they didn't really have a great deal in terms of menus. And it wasn't like, I don't know, an e-com store with lots and lots of different products. So it would be the about us, contact us, what's on that kind of simple menu. So it was really easy to recreate this stuff in ClickFunnels. I then discovered that you could actually use the ShareFunnel and get paid. So I'd be like, hey, I built you this thing. You press this and you sign up on your own account because if the disaster happens again, I've not playing that game. So you need to have this stuff in your own account and you need to pair these guys. And then if something goes wrong, you can telephone those guys or email those guys. So I kind of also realized that the affiliate program and the ShareLinks were very, very useful. So easier to build, save the bunch of money. We could recreate what we already had. We could port this out. And then of course, people start getting emails off Russell because they've signed up to ClickFunnels. And they're like, Danny, can you do this weird funnel thing that this crazy guy in America is talking about? Because in the UK in particular, where my clients were, not a lot of people understood the marketing like what you would see in the States. So there is sort of this sort of time lapse where the UK seems to be catching up all the time. And we've been now brought this cutting edge technology and marketing right to these guys. And they're met a big bunch of money. Yeah, which is great because it gives you a leg up, right? If you're kind of ahead of the curve over there. I actually just spoke to somebody from France who felt the same way where it feels like because he's so in tune with all the things that Russell's doing and what's happening in the States with marketing that he feels like there's a bit of an advantage. And even though there's a little bit of a language barrier with some of his clients, he does feel like he has that advantage. So it's really interesting that you say that in the UK. Absolutely, absolutely. And I think there's also a reluctance in the UK to actually use a credit or debit card. It was like, you go for a meal in the US and you just stick your card in the top of the thing and give it to people and they just go away and you sign things, right? In the UK, that doesn't happen. People want to use PayPal. Yeah. Over the course of the years, anything we've done in the UK market, we've literally had to train people in this sort of like mental training that they kind of didn't know they were getting to trust the landing page sales page kind of format. And over time, that's even still now, that's still evolving. But I think without ClickFunnels, I would have been dead in the water and wouldn't have been able to ever move away from that disaster. So that's, you know, eternally grateful. What I learned from that moment onwards was life changing, game changing. And it put me on a trajectory which I never would have thought would have been possible. Yeah, that's great. And I'm going back to what you said about ShareFunnels and how after the disaster that you had building everything from scratch for your clients to be able to do the heavy lifting of building their site, building their funnel, doing the things that they need you to do, but putting the responsibility back on them of saying, like, you know, I don't have to own your data. I don't have to, you know, I'm not responsible for the servers. Here is everything that you need, now you own it. Exactly. And that's true to the day, right? Because anybody building a business, you know, whoever's watching this or taking note of this, if you are building a business, all your stuff, get it as close to you as possible. And one of the things we used to find with, like, email auto responders, you build a big list of people. And I see that, but even if that was just like a mail chain, hey, sign up for my newsletter kind of thing, you build this massive list of people. And then you get an email saying, you're no longer complying with our policies and you didn't even know why. And they'd be like, this decision is final. And like, there goes your list. Yeah. Otherwise my list gone, I can't even log into this thing with what ClickFunnels have enabled is that won't happen because you would just change the provider, whether it's Sengrid or whatever it is, right? So you'd never lose your list again, again, change it. Yeah. It's enabled us to do a lot of things with a lot of people and everybody, even the nightclub owners, they would never imagine themselves even building a website. They'd ring me up and they'd like, hey, Danny, look what I've done. And this is hard, track down, they'd say, yes, that's amazing. So cool. That's exciting. So tell me a little bit about the types of funnels that you use, whether it's for yourself, for what you do as an affiliate, for your clients. What has been the most impactful? I think some of the funnels we've had the most fun with have been like the fishball funnel, right? Where you do a giveaway. And if folks don't know, the fishball is the traditional. You write an M on the piece of paper, you throw it into the gold fishball and then they pick one out, a random and you win. We've taken that to a different level. Whereas we, for example, would do a... We've got stummed stuff going on in the fishing niche. So we sell a big bunch of physical and cart fishing products, right? So specialist angling products. And the anglers, the fishermen, they only go fishing in the warmer months. And in the sort of September, October, all the way through to spring again, maybe the place is a frozen or just not warm enough for these guys. We needed a way to keep people excited. Halloween is a good one. Black Friday is a good one. So we would use a more developed fishball approach to say, hey, on Black Friday, we're opening the doors at 6am. Enter your name and email right now to get the discount code for our Shopify store or wherever we had all the products, right? You're going to be able to get a special mystery deal as soon as you sign up. But also everybody who signs up is going to be entered into this drawer. You see where I'm going with that, right? So people would sign up a lot with a lot less resistance knowing that on Black Friday or Halloween, something amazing was going to happen. And they had to put the name and email it to enable that. So we built insane lists super fast. We had retargeting data. And we have this crazy table rush on, for example, 6pm Halloween till midnight, I think we did like 24 grand in digital and physical product sales for a niche fishing business in the UK when the people weren't actually fishy. Yeah, which is a replicating that on Black Friday, 30 grand, 60 grand over the weekend. Now, some of these numbers might not seem a lot to the guys who come on and do a big digital launch and they can do a million in a weekend. But if you're selling physical products with an average order value of maybe 30, 40 pounds, that is a big achievement. And we could replicate that, but you wouldn't be possible without using that fishbowl funnel. Yeah. Well, especially for having your own business already, like say you're making revenue from your business. By using funnels, you're able to really expand on that and grow your list. So speaking of that, you said, this gives you the opportunity to grow your list exponentially. So what then after you run, let's say a fishbowl funnel, do you do with those leads? So the leads ultimately, we would always, whether it's a fishbowl funnel or it's just an opt-in funnel or, for example, hey, if you're a new customer, if you sign up, you'll get 10% off and a bunch of other stuff on the next page, whichever way you do that, once you've got that lead, you don't need to get them signed up again, right? So you can always send them your deals, give them early access. But one of the biggest things we did with all of that stuff is we nurtured Facebook communities. So bringing people off a Facebook ad or somewhere they've seen it on the internet and they've had to click, we've had to pay for some of that stuff. We've got them into our community where we then deliver a big bunch of amazing live content. And that could be anything from giveaways on the show, getting people going crazy with the likes of arts. We did a thing and every year for the last sort of five years in the fishing group called the 30 Days of Fishmas. There's no Christmas is Fishmas, right? So in December again, it's called, we literally had people falling over themselves to watch the live. And we had like 300 people on these lives, 400 people on these lives. It was me, they said me, clip on baubles for the beard. So I've got this crazy beard. We did an insane amount of lives. And what we realized is not only have we got the captive audience, if we make an offer at the end, we are then going to have a bunch of sales on every single show. And even every day in December, the same person was buying a different thing every day. So we dedicated each one to a different fishing product or a different brand. And we've replicated that in lots and lots of different ways across lots of different niches. And from that initial, hey, I want to win something to maybe buy in a mystery box and get it a saving. And joining the Facebook group, we've then been able to keep our members so close to the point where they actually send us gifts. And, you know, we got fishy with these guys, whatever it is, that will work in any industry. So we've really, really developed and hauled that if we give you a big bunch of stuff and we continue to give you a big bunch of stuff that these guys are going to continue to buy. Yeah, it says a lot about consistency and being able to create those raving fans that keep coming back because they know it to expand from you. There's something about doing a live, like even just in the normal year, maybe two or three lives a week, but in December doing a live every single day, even on Christmas day, right? So I kind of sneak away from the dinner table and the family would think I've gone crazy and you pull out the form. I think we did 12 grand in sales on Christmas day because all of the other fishing shops were closed. Right? But I don't know if there's many people who are going to pop up on Christmas day and do a live, right? Some people tried to imitate it. They couldn't really get the flow of this. But it is about that, that giving consistency is a big thing. But what we've learned from doing that, and look, that business has done about $3 million in physical product sales over the last few years. What we've learned and gleaned from that is so applicable to everything else we do in marketing that it's almost like we got back to college and learned so many cool things about funnels, about people, customer support, and all of that's just kind of come from a fishbowl funnel. Yeah. Yeah, that's wild and it's inspiring. It's really cool what just giving away something big or small can turn into for your business and create people who are advocates of your brand and what you do because you get to show your face and talk to them and have meaningful conversations. So that leads me to my next point of, I know that we talked a little bit before this interview started about your just genuine approach to giving things away and helping people and wanting to give people the education that you've received so that they can do something with that. So how do you see yourself making an impact in the community as an ambassador? I think as a large in the sort of click funnels group, I always try and help people in a genuine way and I love people who will always kind of help in the comments, right? You get like some guy goes, hey, come to my DMs. We don't need to be doing that stuff. It's like there's enough people in the click funnels community who are more than happy and willing to jump on and just help somebody, right? And it goes all the way back to when we used to take kids fishing or we used to teach them how to DJ or whatever. So I love music, I love fishing. I've created businesses out of these things and we've got a lot of entrepreneurs who do the same. So we used to take a kid fishing. We could change one thing on that kid's fishing rig and he would catch more fish. Yeah, I could change one thing in your approach to funnels and you will catch more fish. You will make more money. But you've got to realise whoever, you know, it's like, it's not about the money, it's about the people. You know, you don't turn up and you don't deliver and nobody's perfect, right? I've made mistakes, I've got things wrong, I've over promised and under delivered, everybody kind of goes through that stuff. You've got to make sure that you always do what you say you're gonna do. If you're live at four o'clock, you've got to be there at four o'clock. You know, if you're ill or something like that, you're still gonna make your excuses, right? But you should be doing that every week. And to be able to just take one little comment that somebody's left and they can't. I experienced that so many years ago and this is what I did. If you just give them that there and then, openly, freely, people message me and they're like, hey, Danny, this changed my life and my own. I just tried to help you. You can have such an impact in whatever community you're in. That's kind of what I do and how I get fulfilment from my time online, right? Some people play games or whatever. It's really important to me to be able to share this knowledge. You know, I use it. Well, don't selfish about it. Let's share it still. I love that so much. And I just have to say, I think you being in your industry, that was just the perfect analogy about teaching Amanda Fish. I love that. It is so true. You know, people would sit there all day and not catch a thing. And you could literally adjust a tiny, tiny adjustment. And all of a sudden, it's like, you've made their day. Yeah. Right? And you see, you know, look, before we got into the e-commerce stuff, we've done internet radio. We have thousands of people on YouTube doing internet radio stuff. I've worked for the council, writing policies. I've had this crazy career and I did spend a bunch of time as a ClickFunnels affiliate and helping people build funnels. I've gleaned so much knowledge from doing all of this stuff, you know, sporking in Jamaica. We were in a place with Les Brown for a week. That was amazing. And just met so many cool people. And, you know, to share this knowledge and give back to the community, that's really what is about to me. And I know there are a lot of other people out there that feel the same. And these are the guys who really do step up when it's needed and really do make a difference. And if I could be one of those people, then I'm happy. Yeah, that's so generous. And I think it's really powerful. And I'm hoping that more people can see that in the community. And I just see you helping so many people because of your ambition to share your knowledge. So with that, what is your greatest piece of advice that you could give a fellow business owner or entrepreneur or somebody who wants to start a business? I think just start is the first thing. And that is so important. It's actually just start doing something. But because now we have got TikTok and we've got Reels and we've got Shorts and we've got this crazy consumption of media that happens so fast, you know, you've now got the emergence of Chap, GPT and the AI and all of this crazy stuff, right, as well. And this is evolving on a massive scale. A massive pace. Any person who, as long as they have access to the internet and a device has got the ability to start a business. But I would say, test some things. So just start, just open up your phone and do a live to your Facebook group, to your Facebook friends, just people on your own profile, whatever it is, and just talk about your ideas because a big thing that stops anybody from doing anything is that external belief or that conversation that comes from the friend. Oh, just get a proper job. This will never work. Why don't you just stick to what you know? Ignore those people. And if you've got a burning desire to go out there and help somebody to make a difference, whether that's in social care or health or charity or community or e-commerce or whatever any of this other crazy stuff, affiliates, whatever it is, just start and have a conversation. And before you know it, people will be engaging with you. And the engagement will help to steer that shit. Right? Stee Lawson said the other day on an interview he was doing with the affiliate guys that he can't steer a parked car. And that's so true, right? So you've got to kind of get started and get some momentum. And if you make it about people, not money, you will soon find that people realize that and people are open to maybe the help you, maybe the investing you, maybe they think it's amazing, right? Marta Zuckerberg didn't start Facebook by switching in his house thinking, oh, maybe I should just try this. He got some dudes together. He said, this is the kind of the idea. I don't really know what to do, but let's try and now look where we are, right? I'm sure a similar conversation would have happened between Russell and Todd and the guys that started ClickFunnels. That's definitely happened for me, but unless you start, just start. Don't worry about technical stuff to begin with. Just have a conversation. That is what will propel you forward faster than, you know, staring at ClickFunnels screen or trying to figure out Facebook answer, whatever it is. Does that make sense? Yeah, that's amazing advice. I love that and thank you. I'm hoping that more people in our community will get to know you and the advice that you've shared and the knowledge that you're willing to share with them. I look forward to having more meaningful conversations with you so that they can get all of the information they want directly from you. I think you're gonna make an amazing super ambassador and I look forward to all the awesome stuff that we can do together. Do you have anything else that you wanted to share? Definitely. I think for me, once you start, it's important. There's the old saying, if you want the island, burn the boats and you've kind of got to avoid going back and it's very easy for that external force to pull you back or a bad day to pull you back. Sometimes it's important to kind of regroup and reanalyze and take a look at what you're doing. Kind of take stock, but don't go back. Don't be like, oh, maybe I should just go back. I can get that job or maybe I should just pack all this stuff up and close this laptop and never open it again. Don't go back no matter what. And if you can keep moving forward, even if it's a little bit every single day, you're gonna be more successful than you were in the beginning, right? That's truly investing in yourself, right? When you kind of burn all the stuff that's happening behind you and you can only move forward. Like there's no better way to invest in yourself than to know that you have to make it. You can't leave yourself an easy escape. Right, because naturally you'll always default to try and run away or escape. And people will say, oh, you know, I've been lucky enough to speak on stages and speaking from lots and lots of people and share some of this stuff over the years. And people say, well, I could never do that. I could never stand on a stage. How do you get the confidence? Sometimes it's not about that. It's about that belief and the desire. There's an element of faith in that as well. But unless you start and unless you've made sure there's nowhere to escape, you know, whether that curtain opens or that spotlight comes on, that scared route's gone. You sort of mean if you're ringing sick and you're like, oh, what's happened? This morning I've woke up and I've got this problem and now I can't make it. And really you're sitting down thinking, well, that's a relief. I don't need to do that thing. You're doing yourself an injustice, right? You need to get out there and live in that moment and understand that people, as long as the words coming out of your mouth are useful to them, they will listen. And they've got a choice. They can turn off or they can listen, right? That's not a difficult choice for people to make. If you focus on the people and you do this with the best intentions and with love and with generosity, then why would they turn off? Yeah. Well, I appreciate you sharing that. I can definitely sense that you have a giant heart and that you have genuine generosity that you wanna share. So hopefully everybody in our community will get a chance to meet you and learn from that. And I really appreciate you being on this interview today. Thanks for being our guests for These Are Spotlights. And I look forward to chatting with you soon, Danny. It's been a pleasure. Thank you.
