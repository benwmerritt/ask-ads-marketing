We're so excited to be able to present it to you and be able to have this discussion with you guys. So shall we get started and let's talk about what we're doing a little bit because we're doing something really, really cool. Some of us have already asked and it's because of the bling that she's putting on. So yeah, check this out. We got... Okay. What are these? That's the question. I was like, what is that?

So we have these lynch pins. Maybe hold it. Hold it. Yeah. So we have these lynch pins and we're giving them away to everyone who is here on location with us. Who is getting our text message notification. Yes. That's the way that you get it. Exactly. We have a certain keyword code for them to send. For people who are here. For people who are here. Yes. And there's so many other things we're giving. So first off, when you sign up for the text messages, we give you this. If you complete it all, what we're doing is we're doing a giveaway. We're going to get Russell to sign this set of books. You have the opportunity to win that. Mostly that's good enough for most people. We had some people that didn't realize Funnel Hacker TV was alive. So if you guys are loving this, please share it out. Yeah. Oh my gosh. We have one person who's come up to us and like Funnel Hacker TV, like the old version before we took over, is why I joined 2CCX. Like that was the thing that made him take action. We spent that for years. Yes. So we made everyone to know that this is a thing. It's here. It's here and it's changing the world. So we're giving stuff away for people who are here. We're giving away this. But we also have other stuff. So number one, come over to the booth and get one of these or find us because we're carrying these all over the place. We're pulling it out and we want to get you guys all of these linchpins as well as the opportunity to win all this stuff. So first off, we brought our swag. We had somebody who come and actually donated their old swag. We checked and make sure it's good. But check out things that you guys can get. So we have the Copywriting Secrets book from the man himself, Jim Edwards. We have this book. This, we have three of these. Actually, I think we have four. I didn't pull them all out. This is a super secret book that has never been shared publicly. There's no way to get this. The only thing you could have gotten it was at Funnel Hacking Live. We have at least four of them. We're giving those out. Don't you wish you were at Funnel Hacking Live? All right. We'll do more books. Okay. Yeah. We also have copies of the 30 days. You suddenly lose everything. What do you do? 30 days. What, how do you like filter business back in 30 days? What would you do? And it's like a compilation of so many amazing people giving their frameworks of what you would do over 30 days. We have several copies of that. They don't do the physical copy anymore unless you get the your first one of the challenge, right? Yes. So we have an extra copy of Traffic Secrets. If you have not gotten your copy yet, we have an inside the inner circle. This is cool. This you can only get this like on Amazon from what I've seen in the past. I'm like, this is, this is a really cool book. So we're going to give that away for free. And then we have a few copies of the Cook book. Awesome. Awesome resource. It's got viral bounding. You can open it with the funnel that you need. Let's be honest. Everybody gets a linchpin and everybody wants an inchpin. Okay. So and a couple other stuff. We just have stuff sitting all over the table that we're giving up. Backpack. Backpack. We got back. We have so much we're giving out to you guys. The question is, do you want it? And if you do and shirts, we got t-shirt. We're giving them all away. The question is, do you want it? If so, I feel like you need to find the boot. You need to find us, come and find us or just find us walking around and putting your information so that we get this and you get notified when we go live. Now, I got really excited about these suckers for one reason. Russell is teaching the linchpin. The linchpin as an idea is like, oh, yeah, that's the thing that you absolutely need. That's what everyone talks about. But why? If anybody knows how these work, okay? This is a tensioner. So you have tension between the ring and the rod itself and it clasps. It clasps shut. So it clasps shut is snaps really hard. And the way that this works is imagine that you have a wheel and you're trying to get it onto a rod or an axle and you want it to stay on. Sure, you have the wheel. You can run it along, but when it hits a bump, it's going to fall off. It's going to wobble. It's going to cause issues. How do you get it in there securely? Well, you put the wheel onto the rod and then in the rod, you drill a hole. You slide this through the hole and snap it shut thereby securing its place. So we want to give this to you because the whole idea of the linchpin is that yes, you can build a business. Yes, you can get all this started, but how do you actually secure the thing? You use a linchpin and that makes sure that no matter if you hit a bump, no matter if you hit in air and weather and whatever happens, your wheel stays on, your business is intact. This is why you don't have a business until you have a linchpin. So yeah, we're so excited. So awesome. So good. Come get your linchpin from us. Come and get it. Let it be the reminder of like, okay, this is what I'm building. This is what I'm doing. Yes, yes, yes. So that's what I'm doing to you. All right. A couple other things that are going down really quick. We want to get all this out to you. There's stuff happening on social that we do not want you to miss. So really quick. Why don't we go over to social? Let's go and check out Russell social here really quick. There are things going on on Russell social.

There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. If you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We're racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be in life. You were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it is beating. It's pulsing. I made for something more and then fear hits us a little voices in the back of our head. Not ready. I'm not worthy. Driven said, No, I'm going to do it. Driven, are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that's made me all of my money. The quite best selling framework. Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82% of customers trust in blue-hander. This better blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning to begin. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this one precious life? You wouldn't be able to tell but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey. Because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People build a sense of belonging here. It's like home. It's so encouraging because if they can do it, so can I. It's all I'm saying. Hey, next year we're going to get dead. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer of everything. You'll find exactly what your business is missing. It's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you you're right. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body's not right or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day they're telling people how they met you. I can live change my entire life. Because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family's going to be blessed. Your legacy's going to be blessed. Movements are about to be born. My story hopefully gave women permission. If you believe me, stand your distance. You do not have to be great to get started. But you have got to start if you ever want to be great.
