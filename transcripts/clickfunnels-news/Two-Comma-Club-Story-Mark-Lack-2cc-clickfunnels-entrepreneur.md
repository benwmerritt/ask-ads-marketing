Hi, I'm Mark Lack and this is my two comma club story. I'm the CEO and founder of Short in the Gap and we focus on helping entrepreneurs, professionals and really anybody who's interested in learning how to make money online leverage their personal brand to be able to really amplify their income impact and influence through content marketing and direct response advertising. Before ClickFunnels I was really not leveraging any software or technology. We tried a couple other things out and I'm not tech savvy so it just didn't really help my business. It actually slowed things down and then I kept hearing about how ClickFunnels was changing the game for people. We decided to switch over to the platform that everybody was raving about to see what the hype was. Ultimately the reason why ClickFunnels ended up being something that we went with was because I understood the benefits of being able to quickly and easily create pages, funnels and email delivery, the user interface being easy for almost anybody to understand even if you're not tech savvy. The ability to quickly log on and skin up a new funnel or a new page was very appealing to us. ClickFunnels really allowed me to get my time back and have some peace of mind around what it meant to be able to impact more people in a systematic approach. ClickFunnels is the reason that I was able to really productize and scale my business. I can be traveling the world doing anything that I want with my family, my wife. I know that my team and my systems are still running and ClickFunnels is one of the main things that helps give me peace of mind as a business owner knowing that my team knows how to use it. I know how to use it. When you can skin up and clone new pages and funnels within just a couple minutes or a couple hours, we can take something from idea and concept and actually build a whole thing out within a few hours and have traffic running to it and generating sales all within one day. It's been an absolute game changer for our business. It's given me the ability to actually retire my wife, which just means that she can now focus on doing what she loves and she can focus on her passions and she can focus on her hobbies. We can do more of what we love. We can focus more on giving back and contribution and passions and hobbies instead of just going for a paycheck. If you're watching this and you're on the fence for some reason about joining ClickFunnels or anything really that the ClickFunnels team or Russell Brunson has created, I guess the only thing that you should be questioning is are you committed and do you really know what you're trying to accomplish? Do you really have a big mission and purpose and vision for why you're going to fully play out? If ClickFunnels works, it's if you work. If you do the work, it's inevitable. It's like, does going to the gym work? Does eating healthy help? Of course, I can tell you right now that it almost doesn't matter what product service business you have or even if you don't have product service or business yet, but plan to. There's a really, really, really good chance the ClickFunnels is going to be the thing that's going to get you to the next level.
