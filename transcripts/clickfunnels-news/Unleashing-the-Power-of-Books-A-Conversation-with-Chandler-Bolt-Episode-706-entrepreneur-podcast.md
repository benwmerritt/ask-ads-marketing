## Transcript
I think it's cache and credibility. I mean, in our world, we kind of think everyone's written a book. So who cares? It's what the book opens up for you. It's kind of like this key that opens the door to Narnia. It's like this magical role that exists for published authors. We just had a, I think literally this morning, a 16 year old author sign up to our fiction program to write fiction. So it's just been really cool seeing the ripple effect. It's a little better inspiring kids to like be authors and use their imagination instead of being tick-tock stars or stupid things on YouTube for clicks. Your head, you're like, I don't know if there's a big market for, you know, witchcraft basket weaving, but OK, write the book. Welcome to ClickFunnels Radio, the podcast that brings you the latest strategies, insights and success stories from online marketers, just like you, who utilize funnels to grow their business. Our mission is simple to help you unleash the true potential of your online business by harnessing the power of funnels. Join us every week as we bring you exclusive interviews and thought provoking discussions that will revolutionize the way you approach online marketing. Here are your hosts, Chris Cameron and Ben Harris. Welcome back to ClickFunnels Radio. My name is Chris Cameron and joined with me is my co-host, Mr. Ben Harris. How are you, sir? I'm doing fantastic. The sun is shining. Couldn't be better. Oh, that's awesome. Well, it's not shining as bright as it is where our awesome guest is from down here, down there in Austin, Texas. We have the one and only Chandler Bolt. This guy is the founder of selfpublishing.com, formerly self-publishing school. These guys are amazing. I've known these guys for a long time. We've been able to kind of be at different events. Matter of fact, that's where Chandler and I met is like, you know, we were speaking at similar stages and stuff. And it was just really, really cool to get to see what their main purpose was. And they help people get their messages out by writing books, by publishing, without having to, you know, get a big publishing company and do all the legwork. These guys are pros at anybody who has a message that they want to get out to the world. They can teach them and show them how to publish their own book. So with that, welcome out, Chandler. Good to see you, man. Chris, Ben, great to be here. Thanks for having me. Yeah, you'd say it's 80 degrees there in Austin right now. People are wake surfing already. It's February, dude. What's up? Yes. It's exciting time, man. It's exciting time. It's getting warm. It's an understatement. Yeah. Well, hey, you guys talk to me kind of how, why, you know, you had this vision to help people write books, because I think there's an instant credibility. And we have a lot of entrepreneurs right that listen to us that are building funnels. They have maybe a signature talk or something like that, but they don't have a book. And I think having a book, you know, Russell's written three or four of these things. He's got the box set. He's got a bunch of them. How does that establish credibility? And why is that so important? Why did you start this? Yeah, I mean, I think the question I would ask listeners here, how'd you hear of Russell Brunson, how'd you hear of click funnels? Yeah. Enough said, right? Probably through, you know, if I pan my computer over here, probably through one of these books. I know a lot of people can't see this. A lot of people may be listening, but, you know, trafficsecrets.com secrets. Oh gosh, expert secrets. One of the books, right? And so books are the root word of authority as author for a lot of people. They first become an authority by becoming an author. And it's, it's the best people say book is a book is a new business card. It's better than a business card. Because if I were to give you a business card today, you'd probably throw it away within 24 hours. But if I give you a book, you keep it. And every time you, you see that book in your house and your office, you think of me, you think of my business. So it's, I look at a book is like kind of like a virtual handshake of virtual introduction to you, your methodology and your business. And I think so I was excited to do this show because we're just super aligned on that methodology. I mean, we go speak at events together and what are we doing? We're slinging books. Cause we know like you get into someone's backpack or bag or whatever on the way home. They're reading that book. And when all the other speakers have faded, all the other vendors have faded, all the other things like they are, they read that book on the airplane home or it's in there, it's in their life. And then they just, that is what helps take people to the next level with you and your company. So we practice what we preach and you guys do too. And by the way, a free plus shipping funnel still works. Hey, oh, right. One of the most profitable funnels like that. I love, I forget who the marketer was that said this was like, as a marketer, we get tired of our marketing way before our customers do. Yeah. And so we want to do something new just because it's new and neglect the thing that's been working. So I think it's very easy for a lot of people to say, Oh, free plus shipping book funnel, like there's no way that works because we've seen it for a long time, but it's still one of our best performing funnels. And I know for you guys, one of your best performing funnels, and it's, it's a tried and true funnel that is really good when you do it through click funnels. By the way, you guys make it really easy. Yeah. And a book is a funnel on its own. Like you want somebody to binge watch you. You know, there's a lot of different mediums out there, you know, YouTube, you know, short form, long form, all these different things with its Instagram, TikTok, you name it. But I love what you just said about authority. What is it about a book that is different than all those other mediums that get somebody to go, Oh my gosh, Chandler or Ben or whoever it is knows exactly where they're talking about. Maybe, maybe some people don't know what they're talking about, but all of a sudden it's on paper and you're reading like, Oh, yep, yep, yep. This guy knows this guy knows what they're talking about. What is it about that medium versus all the others that is so, so, you know. Yeah. I think it's cache and credibility. I mean, in our world, we kind of think everyone's written a book. So who cares? But I think to most people, I mean, you know, the New York Times, the study said that 81% of people want to write a book. We know that less than 1% of people actually do it. So when you actually publish, you become part of this 1% of people who have published and you are credible because you have published a book on that thing. And so just instantly, if I as a consumer, I'm comparing two people and one person has published a book on the thing that I'm hoping to get their help for. It's just a social proof signal. Right. And so I think that's, I think that's a big reason why it's a separator in the marketplace, but then beyond that, it's what the book opens up for you. So, you know, we always say, it's a book is kind of like this key that opens the door to Narnia. It's like this magical world that exists for published authors. And this is what happened for me when I published my first book. It was all these things that I didn't think would happen, but they just started happening, like getting, you know, getting to come on a podcast, like building an email list, open it, all these, get to speak at events, like all these things. And so I think it's, it's this kind of gateway into even local PR, TV, newspaper, all the things that then with it, it's like a, kind of like a credibility stack that just opens up a lot of things. That's massive. And as you probably know, just in the ClickFunnels community, we're also disciples of Dan Kennedy, right? A lot of originated direct response advertising mainly. And, you know, Dan's always been massive, right? The first step to becoming a subject matter expert is to write a book, right? And he's suggested for whether you're a business owner, even a sales rep too, right? From a prospecting tool and social proof, a lot of things you've hit on. I'm curious about what was that process like for you? Did you become author first, then business owner? Or I mean, obviously published and your other books that have came out. Yeah. Walk us through that journey. Yeah. Great question. I was looking back here on my, on my bookshelf. I got a Dan Kennedy book over here somewhere, which by the way, I, the disciples of Dan, that's right. That's a good hook. I don't know if you guys actively use that. Funny. Just slipped out. But so, I mean, I started running businesses and that's so in high school, I ran a business, a couple of businesses. And then college, I ran a house painting business through a company called Student Painters. And so in kind of the more traditional business world, I came business for businesses first. And then my first book was actually kind of bred out of things that I learned starting my first six figure company, painting houses that I wanted my friends to know who want, who I would call them entrepreneurs. Like they wanted to start a business, but they weren't really doing anything about it or didn't really know how to get started. So that's actually what sparked the first book. It was kind of lessons learned. But then the books became a business of their own kind of like back to that Narnia point where we just started to open up all these things. And so then I realized like, this is a building block. The first book that we published, it was called The Productive Person. It was about productivity for entrepreneurs. And we launched the book and then within two or three months, we had an email list of 4,000 people from the book. That's it. And we had nothing to sell them. So it's like the opposite problem that most people have is, hey, I've got a product and no email list. We had an email list and no product beyond the book. And so that started the whole kind of online exploration of maybe we need a funnel. Maybe we need a product. Do we do the value ladder? Do we do all these things? And then ultimately, as I kept publishing books and they kept doing pretty well, people started asking how to do it. And that led to self publishing school, which is now self publishing.com. And then that's where to your point published my newest book. It's that's generated millions of dollars in sales for self publishing.com. Because it's, it's the starting point. It's, we put that in everything that we do and it kind of starts the conversation. Yeah. A lot of times I think people go, okay, if I could just be an author, okay, we're not talking about most of the time, we're not talking about nonfiction stuff, right? You know, or are we are talking about nonfiction? Like we're not talking about fiction. We're not talking about Narnia. We want a lot of times people think, Oh, if I could just be an author, well, that doesn't millions of dollars don't come from just being an author. You said one key phrase here and we talk a lot about it here at ClickFunnels is value ladder. If you can get in a lot of times authors or people will use whether it's an e book or even better, a published book as a lead grab, they'll put this in because it's costing you money to make this free plus shipping. But obviously the book is not what's making the money. Maybe that's self liquidating. I don't know. It depends on what you're doing, what the numbers are. So what other things are you offering? Obviously with self publishing.com, you teach other people to do this, but maybe some of the other people that you've worked with, talk about their value ladders. Yeah, that's great. And so I mean, first is the free giveaway. So all different formats we use that we do. We do the free giveaway of a book in person when I speak at events. And that's a big part of how, you know, we can lead collect 30 to 60 percent of a room by giving away a free book in exchange for their contact info, which is huge. And that I mean, that book costs us four or five bucks. So if you just compare that to what we and other people are paying for leads online that are way less qualified, I think that's what people just don't compute the math. They're like, hold up, man, I'm going to spend like, you know, 1200 bucks to send all these books to this event. Why would I do that? It's like, because you're going to get hundreds of leads. You'll spend them on Facebook. You know, that's probably your daily limit and on a Facebook ad or on your Facebook ad account. Or maybe that's the limit where your card gets charged a thousand every thousand bucks you spend or something, right? So but people don't think twice when it's there, but they do think twice when they're spending money on on physical books. So there's the giveaway on the end person. Then there's the given away different formats digitally. So we give away the ebook all over the place. We give away the audio book all over the place. That just has inherent value. And we even like, I know a lot of people listen to this, so they won't be able to see this. But I'm showing on the screen here. It's the literal first page, I think in my book is there's an audio book right here. And then there's a link to get it for free, right? And then there's a video, which is this is my best converting webinar, right? And so right away. And so this is one of the ways that we, you know, if you've ever done the look inside feature on Amazon, preview the first 10 percent of the book. A lot of times people think, Taylor's an idiot. He doesn't know that I can just preview the book and get the audio book for free. Well, of course, I know that, right? That lead way more than the two bucks I'm going to make from that Kindle version or that print book, right? And so that's how we funnel hundreds, if not thousands of leads a month off of Amazon into our ecosystem to the book, right? And so that so giveaway audio, there's the ebook and then there's free plus shipping with a fiscal book. So we do we do that all over the place. And so that's just like the start of the funnel. But then to circle back to the value ladder for us, that free plus shipping, you know, you might have an order form bump. You might have for a lot of people that have a one time offer or something on the the follow up. What we do is actually just make it way simpler because we're not that good at the low ticket stuff and we're not that good at I feel like a lot of you you guys are really good at, which is like the upsell, the cross sell the the all those things. But what we're really good at is we got a great sales team. And so on our thank you page for the free push shipping funnel. And this is the place most almost all of our funnels kind of follows a similar structure is they get the free book and on the thank you page, it's like, Hey, this book's coming to you in the mail. It's going to be really helpful. What this book can't do is talk to you and customize a plan for you. Right. And that's what we can do. So if you're serious about this, if you want to go faster, further with your books, scroll below this video, book a call with the team, we'll put together a custom plan to see how we can help. Right. Only if you're serious overachiever, you know, we're kind of kind of trying to disqualify people. Yeah. But then that, so that's the simple funnel that we use, which is, okay, free book on the front end. And as you guys know, people who pay pay attention, right? So when, if it's a free plus shipping funnel, they're even now, right? Now we've got a list of customers, not just subscribers. So that's kind of the flow for us where we want to get them on a call as quick as possible so that we can then diagnose and see how we can help. And you do this live, you do this on a webinar. Like it doesn't matter. It's the same funnel. The choreography is just a little different. Like you'll do a webinar. We've done these together, right? You'll do a webinar and you push everybody to go to your sales team. If you're in an event, you'll speak for, you know, 60 minutes or 40 minutes or whatever they give you. Exactly. And then people are cruising back to your table to schedule like a strategy session. It's all pushing back to get them that customized plans. Genius. Exactly. And, and it's, we'll embed the, the, the book into our webinar and into a bunch of other stuff to, cause it increases our show up rate. Right. Yeah. So we're like, Hey, if you, if you register for this webinar and show up, you'll get a free copy of the book. So now there's inherent value. If they register for the webinar, there's, it also boosts your show up rate. And on that webinar at the top of the webinar, we'll say, Hey, if you stay to the end, that's how you get the book. And so it helps with your stick rate. But then to your point, when I'm speaking in an event, I'll typically split the room. That's how we do it at least. As I'll say, Hey, how many of you are, you're on the, maybe next year, maybe someday lists for writing a book and get people to raise their hand. Okay. Perfect. Well, we've, and a lot of times the team will have passed out these little cards, the contact cards, right? Um, which I'm doing a little pull up challenges, uh, uh, this, this month. So this is like just my tally of all this. What are you doing now? 95. It's a hundred a day. Um, but in, in set. So this is like my tally. So I got, I got 22 more to do today. Uh, there you go. Stay focused on after this interview. Uh, I would have done it before the interview, but I can't have to show it up out of breath. But so, so I'll give the card, right? And I'll say, Hey, perfect. Fill out the card on the way out, hand it to my team. We'll give you a copy of the book. And that's kind of my way to split the room. And then I'll, I'll say, all right, but how many of you, this is on the next six months, like this year list. Okay. If that's you, we want to sit down and talk with you while we're here. Uh, now you can also get a free copy of the book. That's fine too, but make sure that you sit down and talk with us and let's put together a plan. So kind of, cause the ultimate goal is, Hey, if people are serious about this, we want to sit down with them and create a plan together and show them how we can help. And then if they're in the consideration phase, we want to give them a book so that in the future they'll have the book and they can read the book and maybe that, that book will take them from the consideration phase to the, I'm ready to buy phase, or maybe it's just there when they're truly ready to get started. That's awesome. If you don't mind, I have to take like one step back. It's kind of a two-part question because my ADD has been going crazy. It's been in the back of my head. You mentioned with just passing, you wrote your first book about productivity for entrepreneurs and just, you know, sold 4,000 copies. Like it's no big deal. And that's an insane feat. Were you listing this on Amazon? How did you sell 4,000 copies with no audience? It was, gosh, it was on Amazon. Yes. And it started out as just a PDF. We just, you know, we just wanted to make a PDF for our friends, but then it evolved and then we said, Hey, let's just put this on Amazon. And so we put it on Amazon and we, just a lot of gorilla marketing. I mean, it's all the things like when I ran the painting company in college, I was number one in the country and number one in the company, my rookie year. And it was basically like a franchise kind of. So they've got a system and you just work your butt off. And if you do it, you'll be successful. And so I did it. And, but there's a lot of things that you learn. Like you're knocking on doors, asking people to paint their house. So it's just having gorilla marketing like, Hey, I couldn't help but notice that you have some wood rot on your socket. And, you know, we should, we should fix that and we can paint your house. You know, and so, I mean, you're putting flyers on mailboxes, like 500 to a thousand. For me, it was every Friday night from the hours of like eight PM to 11 PM or midnight. Right. And you're not going to work your social life. What's that? Super good for your social life. Friday nights, you know, oh yeah, it was fantastic. I didn't have a social life. I was in grind mode, but, but what that taught me is a, I mean, we, we applied all that to marketing the books. So it was just, okay, gorilla marketing, like let's reach out to people. Let's keep people to leave reviews. How does the Amazon algorithm work? Let's make sure that we're, we're feeding into that. Like what are the things, how can we reverse engineer this and then just. Outwork every other author to sell more copies. So there was that bucket, but then I think what that experience taught me too is the power of going from one to one to one to many and, and working smarter with your marketing, not just muscling it. And, and so I think that's the power of the book. Obviously you do this work once and then this book goes on to impact thousands, tens of thousands, maybe even millions of people. Right. We call this leveraged impact. And so it brings leverage to what you're trying to do, but it really dawned on me. When you're knocking on one door at a time and dropping one flyer at a time and all that stuff, you know, you can't help, but you know, you get the hundredth door slammed in your face and you get cursed out and someone like pull a gun on you to get off their property. You're like, all right, maybe there's a better way. And, and door to door marketing is very effective. You got to have a certain, you know, kind of demeanor and just, yeah, maybe borderline masochist, enjoy and be good at it. But, but what it taught, I mean, that's when I kind of the epiphany was, Hey, there's got to be a better way. Oh, what if I could get in every one of these mailboxes in the whole county? Oh, I can. That's called a newspaper. Okay. Well, how do I get in the newspaper? Well, let me reach out to every single person in the newspaper and have them do a story on me. And so that led to, I got a story in the newspaper. I got a story on TV, all this stuff. And so that's when it started, the wheel started to turn to, okay, there's mechanisms where I can do work once. And then that gets mass distributed to a bunch of people. And so there's PR and publicity, obviously there's partnership marketing, which I know you guys are both aligned on and big fans of. And then, and then there's a book to kind of fuel that. So I feel like that's kind of like a, a, a side road to answer your question of some things I learned from that and then how that relate to launching the first book. Super cool. And that gave you, you know, some, some hard earned sales experience, probably throughout that process. When you first launched self publishing school, they're now self publishing at the time, self publishing school. Were you the original, you know, mister, everything? Were you, you know, doing books? Were you making sales? Were you doing all the marketing? I mean, it was really a one stop. You're a one man band, right? For the most part. Yeah, kind of. Yeah. There was, so I launched the first version. We caught a best selling book system back in the day. And there was three of us. And then we had a partner who wasn't really pulling his weight. And, you know, as partnerships often happen, it was like, all right, well, this is not working. So then we, we just split and rebuilt it as self publishing school. And it was me and another partner. Uh, and then, uh, ultimately ended up buying him out of the business later. So it was, it was the two of us at the start and kind of he was more ops. I was more marketing and sales. And then we started scaling and then bought him out. And then, uh, you know, I think, I think we'd maybe hit a million in revenue by the time we hired our first employee, but then now we're 60, 70 employees, maybe more than that, but I'm in that team aspect. We'll go ahead, Ben. You go first. Just one more fall question with starting off. When you were getting your first couple of sales, did they start to roll in pretty quickly? What was that process like? Yeah, we did the launch model. So I mean, that's peaks and valleys. It's definitely got its pros, but then it's definitely got its cons. So it was a secret sake and a big inhale. It's like a lot of trauma in that, uh, in that, uh, in that big inhale, the body language said it all. Uh, but it, so it was, I mean, that meant that we got our first customers and it was like $86,000 or something and with the three partners. And then that was like the first six to nine months. So then by the time that was revenue, not profit, right? So that, that was the year that the IRS said, you know, there's like a threshold, but if you're below this, you don't even got a file. Like you're good. Don't even send us anything. I love it. The silver lining Chandler. You're below the poverty line. Uh, and we don't even want to deal with your taxes. So that was the, that was the first year. And then the next year we kind of did our big launch of self publishing school. And that's when it was an affiliate model. We did an app applications. All that. And so that's when it really started to pop up and we got our first, you know, few hundred thousand and customers. And then kind of just started doubling down from there. I'd be curious to know like what, what, what percentage, even if it's rough, uh, are you getting through partnerships versus like paid media versus like events? Well, partnerships are probably going to be events. Like how much of that is coming through affiliate or partnerships versus, you know, typical, you know, either your list or ad spend. Yeah. I would say. Hmm. Partnerships is probably about. Just under half of our revenue right now. That's great. It's our, it's our fastest growing channel. And so business development, I mean, shout out Pedro Matos. Uh, he's the man just killing it. I mean, he's everywhere. He's, he's built that channel from the ground up. And we did a little over five million last year in partnerships the year before that did two and a half. Uh, he did like his first year doing that was like a million, right? Something like that. Yeah, I think that's crazy. Uh, yeah, we started speaking back in 2018 and that wasn't even as, it wasn't even running business development yet, but we did a million in that year from speaking and that was the first year I ever spoke. Um, but that was through kind of the model we just talked about, but it's, yeah. And then we kind of got away from it. And then he's been building it back up and not even just back up, taking it to new heights has never even been before. So that's our fastest growing channel. And then got ads organic SEO, all the other stuff. That weird, weird question. What is the most fascinating person that you've helped like get their book and their message out like something off the wall, anything you can think of? Oh gosh, fascinating. Man. Like you're writing a book about this. Yeah. I mean, there's some ones that I won't say on here that are just absolutely absurd, but I mean, we, you know, we put the power in the hands of authors, right? And, and we've published about 7,000 books in the last decade or just under a decade. We published three today. Um, we've published whatever it is, 130 something so far this year. So we published roughly three to eight a day. Um, I think on Tuesday we published eight. And, uh, so, I mean, we just published a ton of books in every genre you could think of and, and, uh, we're not deciding what gets published. The author does. So there's been some crazy ones. I don't know if this falls in the crazy buck. Well, I know it doesn't fall in the crazy bucket, but just kind of just a fun story is one of our, um, one of our early authors, he wrote and published a couple books about physical therapy with us. His daughter saw him do it and she said, Hey, dad, I want to write a book. She was eight years old at the time. And she wrote, she ended up doing it and wrote a book called the fairies of Waterfall Island, eight years old. And, uh, incredible story. She was, did the book made thousands of dollars in the first month or a few months. She donated it all to autism awareness charity. Uh, she started doing speaking gigs. Like she spoke at her school, made 1200 bucks or something like that. Like they paid her like a $250 on a raryum and then she sold a ton of books. And now she gets a monthly, like quote unquote allowance. And it's her book royalty checks. Right. So that's certainly one of my favorite stories. I talk about that in my TEDx talk and we, I mean, we talk about that all the time, but that's one of my favorite stories cause she's inspired all these other kids to write books. We just had a, I think literally this morning, a 16 year old author sign up to our fiction program, uh, to write fiction. So it's just been really cool seeing the ripple effect of that. Uh, yeah, it's, it's been a little better inspiring kids to like be authors and use their imagination instead of being tick tock stars or stupid things on YouTube for clicks, like authors are cool. Um, has there been anything that's caught you by surprise of, you know, maybe this is the early days now, but going through onboarding an author in the back of your head, you're like, I don't know if there's a big market for, you know, witchcraft basket weaving, but okay, write the book. And then it sort of, you know, it kind of takes off a life of its own. Anything stick out to you? Oh man. Um, yeah, there was one that was, oh gosh, it was for, let me, let me, uh, let me look this up. It was, it was for notary agents, uh, and mobile notary. Okay. There it is. Bill Soroka, I knew the name, but I can remember the book. He's got a sign and thrive, uh, how to make six figures as a mobile notary. Uh, and a mobile notary and loan signing agent. I'm looking at this listing on Amazon right now, 1463 ratings interviews. The book has done incredible. And you might think, I'm like, what, what, what, what even is this? Like what mobile notary. And now, I mean, now I know, but, and so I think it's just a testament to, you know, we've all heard the saying, the riches are in the niches. Uh, and so it, for our authors, oftentimes they're worried that their market isn't big enough and, uh, and we encourage them to, to niche down, like get more specific with your audience and your book will likely do better. I think he's a great example of that. That's awesome. I want to shift gears a second here too. Like obviously we, we really covered a lot about why having a book is huge, how you can use it in your value ladder, how you can gain customers and all this. But you've now, Chandler, you've built a business, which is totally different than, you know, going out and even teaching people how to, to, you know, write books. Now you've built a team. Do you said, well, at 60, 70 people. Um, and Laura, who's been on the podcast a ton, a lot of you guys know Laura Demetrius actually used to work with you and she said, Hey, tell Chandler. I said, hi, but she also said a lot of the stuff that she uses, she's our director of communications over here at ClickFunnels now. Um, she says a lot of the process and everything she uses came and she still uses from you, like what have you learned? Like talk to us about some of the biggest lessons that you've learned in growing and scaling this business, not only in revenue, but in people. That's cool. That's fun. Uh, thanks for sharing that shout out Laura. She's amazing. Uh, it's funny, man. I hear that pretty often actually from people who used to work at the company. And when it's the only thing that you've known, it's like, well, I don't know. I've never really worked at another company. So I don't really know what we're doing. That's different. But I, it's funny. I actually created a, I've got a YouTube channel and a podcast on this. It's not even a big business. It's just kind of like a, a fine little thing that I did back in the day. It's called, um, the seven figure principles podcast and seven figure principles show. It's about all these things I learned, uh, scaling a business that my entrepreneur buddies would ask, ask me about, and it's just laid it out. Now it's also, I use it for internal training for my team. That was really one of the big pieces. How do you run a one-on-one? How do we run meetings? How do, again, going back to that point of leverage, if I have to explain something 10 times every time a new employee comes on board, well, what's the best way to do it is to create the ultimate video on that and then just have that video be part of their onboarding. So it's kind of like a good way to just kill a bunch of birds with one stone. But I think, man, what we've learned or what I've learned is systems, leverage, people, just a bunch of, a bunch of the non-sexy stuff that it takes to truly scale. And I think probably my superpowers, I'm really, really good at operations. I mean, really good at, yeah. It's just like I nerd out on that stuff. And so that's kind of maybe some of the secret sauce. A lot of entrepreneurs are not. Exactly. So for you to have both of that dual is huge. That's my creative, that channel. Because all my entrepreneur buddies knew that I was that guy. So they would hit me up, but hey, I'm about to run offsite. Like, I know you do this. How do you do it? And it's just, it's like, all right, cool. Here's the video. Let me know if you have questions. But I want to drop the mic and it's like 30 minutes long on all the things you need to do to run an offsite or whatever else. So I don't know, that's just. The off stuff is what I'm good at, which is very different from for most people. Are you just we'll just lip sync from Ben. As I muted anyone seeing the video, you can make fun of me. Comment below. As you guys continue to scale and grow through different avenues, do you see yourself maybe having to evolve to different principles or do you feel like it's sort of the keys to the kingdom and can grow with you? Yeah, that's a great question. I think a lot of the core things. A lot of the core things remain the same. But there's definitely a lot of aspects of what God is here won't get us there. So especially around communication and people. I mean, those things just start to break. And so you have to rebuild. And so maybe the way that you run the off site is different like the way that you structure the breakouts, the way that you do different things like that. But the core kind of mech in it, the purpose of it, the mech, the core mechanisms are the same. So it definitely evolves, but then there's just core things like our core values. Don't change. There's there's a bunch of stuff like that. It's like, all right, this is the way things, principles and bloom where you're playing it in best is the standard and stuff like that. It's like, all right, that's not going to change. But some of the operational mechanisms will just have to evolve. You you talk about off sites a few times. I hear you're mentioning that. Are most of your employees on site or I know Pedro's in Brazil. I mean, he's traveling all the time. But how many people are on site? And I'm assuming not all of them. And maybe that's why you're doing off sites. I'd be interested to hear culturally. Yeah, how things work with a remote team and is the onsite a big part of bringing them together and does that happen often? Walk us through all that. Yeah, it's funny. This is like the game of where in the world is Pedro Matos? That guy's all the advice. He's in Dallas at an event today. But yeah, the whole team's remote. And we've got a handful of people here in Austin. I've got a video on the channel and how we how we create a good remote culture. But we are exploring this week building out. It's not this week this year, building out like a micro office to test that out. And specifically for our SDR team. And so for sales development and some sales, I'm going to test that out because I just think there's a lot of advantages of it. Culturally and just just training, ramping, onboarding, like all the things. And so I'm exploring it. I think we'll see. Probably have a lot to learn from you guys. I know there's a big hub and the Boise office. And I think some of your people are remote, but yeah. A lot of remote. You know, it's funny you mentioned that about SDRs. It probably depends on the role, right? Is being in an office and collaborating. If you're an SDR and you got a sales floor, you know, a boiler room or whatever. And these people are talking. Man, when I used to do that years and years ago, I was selling financial stuff. When I heard somebody say something that I loved, I could start. And there's this, this vibe that happens. People start selling. Then everybody starts selling. So sales might be a really, really good place to have like local, like together in an office to collaborate, just fill the juice because man, trying to do sales calls from yourself behind a computer and like, well, I could go do that or I could go do something else. And it's like, yes. A lot of times it's really hard for someone that doesn't, that's not self motivated. Yes. Yeah, I agree. I mean, that's my hypothesis. I've never done it. Again, I think that's both the challenge and the opportunity of building a company when you've never really, I say never really worked at a company. Obviously I had, I worked at companies before this, but in this capacity and in this way, I've never worked in corporate. I've never went to an office. I've never worked at a company that was this big or doing this type of stuff. So we're figuring out how as we go. So the hypothesis is that what you're saying will be true. And then talk to me in six months and we'll see if it happens. We'll do it. So these off sites to kind of bring everybody together that is remote. How often are you doing that and talk us maybe a little bit about what you do and the purpose? Like it's okay to get everybody together, but I'm sure you have a purpose and it's orchestrated in a specific way. Yeah. It's twice a year in person currently and quarterly leadership team. And that's, I mean, that's something we're currently re-evaluating is what's the best cadence for that as we, as we grow. The purpose is solve some of the biggest challenges in the business, capitalize on some of the biggest opportunities in the business, build culture. Like culture and team is predominantly there. And so the way we'll do it is we'll fly on the team, typically on a Wednesday, we'll have kind of dream and vision. Then we'll go into more practice, you know, kind of like, we started at the 30,000 foot, then go to the 10,000 foot day two and then 1000 foot, uh, day three on that Friday. And so we're kind of remixing some of the ways that we're doing it, but we'll break out as teams and do some cross team jam sessions, all that stuff. And then we'll typically have a fun day on Saturday and, you know, maybe do a cookout or pull party or go to Disney or something like that. And then, uh, and then fly everybody back either Saturday night or first flight out Sunday morning. So that's kind of like, all right, this is our area to get together in person and, and, uh, build relationships, build the culture and then. Operationally solve a bunch of stuff, move a bunch of stuff forward. Yeah. That's very cool. Yeah. And I appreciate the insight too. Just from a business owners perspective, a lot of listeners that we have are trying to get to that level. So it's great to hear the insight and even mean my opinion's probably a little bit biased, but for people who are listening to this and you mentioned there was a study done, I think it was 81%. I could be off a little bit, but the people who are listening and there will be plenty who are considering writing a book, right? They have the idea. What would you tell them? Start. Stop. So stop talking about it, thinking about it. Uh, start doing it. I would take 15 minutes as soon as you're done listening to this podcast and, uh, mind map, everything you can think of on the topic of your book. So what are the stories that you have, the lessons that you've learned, the books that you've read, take 15 minutes, write out everything you can think of that M that mind map is the M and what I call the more writing method. It's an acronym, but start with the mind map, grab my book published. And it'll, it'll, it'll walk you through the process and then you'll be off to the races, but you got to start. There's never going to be a perfect time. You're never going to have time to do it. There's all these excuses that you'll make on why you can't do it. You got to start. Yeah, that's great. That's great. Um, okay. So if somebody wants to find you and they want to get started with you to shortcut this, where do they find you? How do they do it? I'll split the room. Uh, so, uh, you can go to, uh, yeah. So if it's only maybe someday, Liz, uh, you can go to published book.com forward slash free, get a free copy of the book. If you're serious about it, book a call with the team, uh, self publishing. Dot com forward slash apply. Um, so self publishing.com forward slash apply. That's where you can book a call with the team. We'll talk about your goals for your book, your challenges with your book. We'll put together a plan. Uh, we'll do the things you talked about earlier in this episode. Uh, and then hopefully we'll end up working with you on your book. Awesome. Well, we could talk forever, man. You are awesome. It's been fun getting to know you over the year and watch this growth, growth that you've had. So not gross, but growth. Um, all, listen, all the best to you guys. You guys are a rock star team and just awesome stuff. So congratulations. Hey, thank you guys for having me and thanks to both of you. I mean, you guys have done, uh, uh, just been a huge part of our growth. And you've, you've helped Pedro. You've got on the phone with Pedro. You've sent events our way that we ended up both speaking at like just love the partnership and collaboration and appreciate you guys. Well, we appreciate it back too. He's, he's been awesome too. We'll have to have him on a guest too, because Ben would be fun just to talk about that whole like partnership. Sure. The partnership marketing playbook. It's awesome. It's so cool. That's awesome. I have one more off the wall question Chandler. Who do you think's more famous? You or your brother? Oh, my brother's not even close. Uh, I've gotten stopped in airports or in the public. I could probably count it on one or two hands and I could, I'd run out of hands and feet for how many times I've gotten stopped while being with my brother. I know there's a story here, but why can't I remember this? Who's your brother? What's the deal? Uh, need to breathe. He's a bass player for need to breathe. Want to Grammy or sorry, not one of Grammy. They were nominated for a Grammy. Uh, that's awesome. Big asterisk there. Uh, but then also has a bolt farm tree houses. And so they've got like a mat. They were on Netflix world's most amazing vacation rentals. And the tree house Instagram is like, kind of blows up. It counts it. I know, right? Great parents. So cool. Love it. That's awesome. Okay, man. Well, thanks for, thanks for coming on. We'll talk to you later. Thank you guys.
