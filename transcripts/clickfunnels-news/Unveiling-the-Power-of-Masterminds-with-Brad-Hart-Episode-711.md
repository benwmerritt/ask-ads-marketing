Now you have replaceable parts for humans and could extend human lifespan 50 years. I don't even know where to begin. We're cruising. Like he's lying down these ice covered roads, this little tiny BMW like skid now and like, you know, just trying to scare the crap out of me. Basically it was working and I was too scared to like even think. So I just, you know, told my story and shared, you know, I was an options trader. We talked about that a little bit, Chris. You did that for many years. So Dan, unbeknownst to me had blasted me out to like tens of thousands of people. He had a really big following at the time. When you had this realization, right? And you were just getting started and stopped me at any point if I'm wrong, but you may have been starting right from no connections. Right? You didn't know anybody. You were just starting out. Everybody starts from zero. Yep. The reason I got a early on VIP license for life for quick files, which literally saved my ass to the, that's the golden egg. Nobody, nobody has that. Can't drive across the country in pitch black with no headlights, but you can illuminate a couple hundred feet in front of you at a time and get across the country, even if you're driving with no sunshine. Here are your hosts, Chris Cameron and Ben Harris. All right, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of ClickFunnels Radio. We've got an amazing guest that I know everybody is going to learn a ton from today, but a quick internal note before we introduce our guest is Chris. This is like the first episode we've done and I feel like 15 years. It's been like really two weeks, but, but they don't, they don't know that, right? I know that I just wanted to kick it off with a little internal note. I was like, because I'm happy to be back. I'm fired up. This is going to be a lot of fun. I love doing this. This is one of my favorite things to do. ClickFunnels Radio, man. Yeah. So how are you? I haven't seen you in forever. I'm doing great. You've been traveling all over the place. Kind of, yeah. Did a little, you know, it's my tour, right? It's my Taylor Swift era. So I'm kind of, you know, going on tour a little here, a little there. Happy to have you here, Ben, by the way. Oh, thank you, Brad. Oh, I spoiled the guest's name. So we'll go ahead and, and bring them on and introduce somebody who is, is an entrepreneur, an eight figure entrepreneur, an investor, philanthropist, and bestselling author of the eight minute mastermind. But please welcome Brad Hart to ClickFunnels Radio. Brad, how are you, man? Thank you so much, Ben and Chris. Thank you, everybody, listening to ClickFunnels Land, I guess. I don't know what you want to call it. We have our own planet. I don't know. It's pretty big, right? You know, really excited to see you guys and love everything that you're doing over there. I've been, I was actually kind of hinting at a story if you want me to just dive right into it of how we all got connected in the first place. So yeah, let's do it, man. Anyway, way back in the day, before ClickFunnels even existed, believe it or not, I had a brand called Market Your Course, which ended up on ClickFunnels Radio as well. And through that brand, I was promoted through some Tony Robbins stuff and I met a guy named Dan Martell. You guys know Dan. He's the author of I Back Your Time and he's great. And people who asked me if I want, if they wanted me to get Dan today, I'm like, it's great. You just go get in a time machine, meet him 10 years ago and he'll answer your texts. Get the DeLorean. Yeah, exactly. Same thing with Russell and anybody else. So I meet Dan at a Tony Robbins event and I kind of knew who he was, but he wasn't like the big deal he is today. So I were chatting with him and he's just like, hey, do you want to come to a mastermind at my house? I'm like, absolutely. Let's do that. And I was living in New York at the time and he's like, sure, I'll get your details right over. I'm going to invite like 10 people over, really fun. I'll introduce my wife and his boys, which are young, who are young at the time, Max and Noah. And I got to go meet their family in Monkton, New Brunswick, which is way the hell east, which is like three plane rides from New York City. Like I didn't realize how far this trip was going to be. I just had no idea. So I get on a plane, I go to fricking, I think it was Toronto, Ottawa and then out to Monkton. So I get there and there's amazing people there like Amir Rosik and Miguel and a bunch of really cool people. And Dan, one of the mornings we had been out late the night before, he picked me up at the hotel super early to come to his house and we're cruising like he's lying down these ice covered roads, this little tiny BMW like skid now and like, you know, just trying to scare the crap out of me. Basically it was working. He's like, hold up, we're going to stop in Tim Hortons and we grabbed a coffee and then while we're in the truck, he's like, I'm the, I'm going live on Facebook. We're going to talk all about your hedge fund and all the stuff I'd go on at the time. And I was like, cool. And I was too scared to like even think. So I just, you know, told my story and shared, you know, I was an options trader. We talked about that a little bit, Chris, you did that for many years and you're having success with our fund and all this good stuff. So Dan, unbeknownst to me had blasted me out to like tens of thousands of people. He had a really big following at the time and I just had no idea. I was just doing my thing. And one of the people who reached out to me was Dylan Jones. You guys know Dylan, I would imagine. He's one of the original partners and designed ClickFunnels, like the UI that you guys know and love, the drag and drop, all that interface was from Dylan. And he's a pretty quiet guy. He's not like super well known in the sphere, but that was the reason I was originally connected to the ClickFunnels world was because of Dan. So shout out to Dan. And also the reason I got a early on VIP license for life for ClickFunnels, which literally saved my ass because I was just starting out and I wouldn't have stuck with it if I had to like, you know, go and figure this all out on my own. So you guys and pulling me into your community and whatever, you know, God shot, whatever universe did for us there brought us in and made it really beautiful. And then we've collaborated multiple times over the years. I've gotten to work. That's the golden egg. Nobody has that. Nobody has that lifetime thing. You have like a handful of people. Yeah, there's like nobody out there that has it. So I was in super early. Then later I got to collaborate Russell, Antoni and Dean's big launch. We were both top affiliates. I got to, you know, do that NFT project you guys launched a while back. We did the smart contracts and code for that. Like, I just want to give a shout out to anybody listening like ClickFunnels, no matter how big they get, no matter how big a community is, like, and their values are always about working with people who share those values to bring them out to the world. Like they have a very grassroots mentality, even, you know, as they get to be a bigger company, and there's different corporate interests, and I'm sure people are pulling them in a million different directions. They're really amazing at staying on track with that. And this podcast and being on it, you know, this many years later is a testament to that. So if you're listening to this, you're in the right place, you're in the right community. I just want to share, like, this is at the heart of what I do. And masterminds are my tool to connect with all these wonderful people. And we'll get into more of that. But I've been talking at you for a while, so I want to give these guys an answer. I love that, Brad. And also to teach your own horn, not to toot your own horn, but I'll toot it for you. You're also a two comma club award winner. Like, I mean, you are in this big time, and we appreciate people like you because that's the reason, yeah, exactly. That's the reason this grows. And I think that kind of goes into what you do is, you know, Ben and I have worked in relationships for a really, really long time. And a lot of times you'll hear people in Russell say this, you know, as well, especially now that we're in 2024, there's a lot more competitors, funnel builders, etc. But people come for the community. People come for Russell, people come, you know, because the relationship they have, you know, if you go to funnel hacking live, like it's a family reunion. It is. And I think that's the first two is awesome. It's huge. It's like enormous and all over here. It's massive. And I think that's how you built your brand too, was on relationships. You had one quote, which I thought was awesome. And I think this kind of defines them your brand, it says, you don't need to know everything if you know everybody. I thought that was a cool quote. But talk to us about why these relationships are so important to you. How that started and why it's transitioned into why these masterminds are such a big part of what you do. Yeah. And it starts with like a bigger vision for your life. I really truly believe that the core of my skill set or gifts or talents or whatever it is, any way you want to slice my personality, I'm a visionary heart. I see things 10 years up. You know, I saw Bitcoin before Bitcoin was a thing. I was looking at them at five cents with buy them under $100, a theorem at $100, a buck's Tesla at $22. I see, I'm not always right, by the way, I've been wrong a lot too, but I see trends and I see amazing possibilities for what the world will bring apart. And I just want to be able to affect all this change. And I'm not Yilan Musk and I don't have it in me to build 10 companies. But what I can do is really create communities that can go after these big problems. And anytime I want to learn something, I don't think about going into a room and studying as much as I can. I do that, but that's not where the most leverage is for me. It's bringing the smartest people I can find into the room who have a collaborative mindset, right? My whole brand is about make more marbles, which is the idea of we don't want to be the hungry, hungry hippos and grab for all the marbles. We want to help everybody to make more. So, you know, if you're not a collaborator, if you're a competitor, that's cool. It's just just probably, you know, you're going to grade against my value. So I really want people are going to come in, share, they're going to give as much as they receive, if not more, and create something bigger than what we could have created on our own. And that's true of any world-changing thing. Like you love to law the Elon Musk or the Steve Jobs or the Russell Brunster, whoever, but you don't realize there's thousands, if not tens of thousands of people working behind the scenes, diligently dedicating their lives to that vision, that mission. And the only way you're going to accomplish it is if you have that ability to bring those people in. If you're great at business and making money happen too, that's huge. But if you don't have that vision to start with, you're going to burn out pretty quickly because the limit of your capacity is going to keep you stuck. Fascinating. And with, when you had this realization, right, and you were just getting started and stopped me at any point if I'm wrong, but you may have been starting right from no connections, right? You didn't know anybody, you were just starting out. Everybody starts from zero. So tell us about, you know, how you went about navigating like that canvas strategy, right? Like how did you give when you felt like you maybe had nothing to give? Yeah. And this is where masterminds come into my journey, right? I joined my first one after my dad passed away on 24. You know, I'd always seen the value of being in organizations that new things and could figure things out better than I could. And they just knew more answers because they tried more stuff, right? I've always been an experimenter, but I realized the value of knowledge and experience. But when you're moving into a new place, you realize like, oh, innovation and creativity are just as important, if not more important, because you're trying to do something that maybe nobody's ever done before or not in this way, right? So for me, it became this, okay, you know, I can join these groups of people who have already been there, done that, and have creative ideas and resources that can be leveraged to do more things and to create more things. So very specific example, when I joined my first masterminds, I didn't know my ass from my elbow. I really didn't know anybody, I didn't know anything. But I was pretty good at a few things and I was able to add value with those things. So, you know, for example, I had one person offered to allow me to manage some money. And, you know, I'd been trading options at the time, I'd written in Forbes about 3D printing, I had a big run up on those stocks, like 10x my money in 18 months or something like that. And this is all my money, right? So it didn't really matter anybody else. But somebody saw that, heard that, understood it and realized like, oh, that's something I want to leverage as well. So it was like, okay, cool. So then I had to learn like, how do you build a hedge fund? How do you get the right licensing? How do you figure out the legal loopholes and all the different things to launch a small fund without being like cripplingly expensive? Because, you know, unless you're raising tens of millions of dollars, it can be pretty crazy. And that came from the group as well. I asked around, I met this guy who was an options trader on the Phil X exchange in the Susquehanna Investment Group. And he was one of the smartest people I ever met to this day. He's just a brilliant guy. He was one of the last people trading on the floor. You'll appreciate this, Chris, like after computing over, he was one of three actual market makers still. We used to have to print tickets and stamp a man. That's how old I am. Yeah, he's, he was a wild man. So, you know, eventually he moved on to other things as computers took over, but, you know, he was one of the last to raw. Anyway, we learned how to do all these things. I didn't know how to pitch. I learned how to do that just by trial and error. Once the 200 people I knew that might give me money, 17 of them said, yes, thankfully, we launched my fund in 2012 and 2013, which are first full year, we did 106% return. So we doubled our unbelievable climb. And my mentor at that time who taught me how to read, tape and trade options, shout out to Anand, he made like 500% that year. He was a monster and he had made millions trading prior to that. So very, very good at it. He's still teaching to this day. So, you know, that wasn't ultimately the arc that I was going to stay on because I, when I was younger, I didn't have a lot of relationships and I definitely didn't have any money. I mean, my dad worked in a lumber truck and hurt himself and I was two. My mom worked in delis and had to leave to go support us. We were living off social security and disability checks and, you know, it really wasn't a great financial upbringing. I can remember being locked in my room at four years old and like having my mom and dad scream at each other about money. And I just decided as a young kid, hey, I'm going to make sure I make so much money that mommy and daddy never have to leave each other. That was the script running in the back of my head my whole life. So when I was 26 and all of a sudden we had a month where we made a million and $40,000 in our funds. And, you know, that's not all my money. I don't get to keep that. But like to see so much abundance coming so quickly and still feel that longing, that emptiness, that, you know, what's going on here. Like I had to really dig into that and understand like maybe the success element isn't going to be the thing. Maybe the fulfillment element is what I need to focus on next. So I went through a different arc and I found Tony Robbins and Personal Development Landmark and I'll save you a lot of the brain damage I went through at that time, you know, undoing my personality and realigning it with better values. You know, but that's where I ended up. And Masterminds became my tool that I came back to again and again and again whenever I wanted to learn something because it was an opportunity to get paid to learn from experts to, you know, enact a bigger vision than I could take on myself while people come in who are smarter than me, who ask better questions than me, who take better notes than me, who I can partner with and we can do really cool stuff. So case in point, I went to the Mastermind of Billions event in 2016 and it was run at the time by Joshua Hayward and Jay Fousette. Shout out to him. And I learned this model where anybody could put a group of people together and do a high-tech. JVology too, they run that. JVology and he was, you know, the big Canadian filling for Lifespring and Jay's been on stage for 30 plus years. He's done a million events. He's really great at that. So long story short, I go to this event and I learned this model and at the VIP dinner the night before, like the wine and cheese kind of, you know, networking thing, I need a guy named Michael Quinn and Michael had a really interesting business. He was like a basically import-export guy but for Amazon products. So he would take his family to like Bali for six months and work on, you know, this little Amazon business that was churning $100,000 a month at that time selling salt and pepper shakers and like cat tunnels. And if you don't know what a cat tunnel is, you don't have a cat, it's like this neoprene tunnel, the cat runs down and rings a bell, 100 grand a month. And I'm like, dude, how much do you work? He's like five hours a week. I'm like, show me your ways. Like this is really good, right? Yeah, yeah. A million dollars a year, taking care of your whole family. You got most of your time off. This is amazing. So he's like, sure, I'll coach you. I'm like, how much? He's like 30 grand. I'm like, cool, I could pay 30 grand. I've invested that much before. I would do it again. But let me ask you something. Do you have other people want to learn this? He says, yes. I said that they all have 30 grand. No. Oh, interesting. Even if they did, would you want to coach all of them individually? No, because I built this business not to have to work all the time. Like this is great. Why don't we do a mastermind? I'll fill it. I'll run it. You know, I'll do all the logistics. You just show up and teach people. You can go to the product fairs like you do every year. We'll bring a bunch of people with us to China and Hong Kong and all those places. And you teach them how to source products and get their Amazon store stood up. And we'll do it. So within three months, we had solds, I think 35 or 52 people ended up coming. I don't remember the exact numbers. I think we raised like 35 or $40,000. And then we had like 52 people come with us to Hong Kong and China. So we went to the product fairs, learned all about it. He trained them for six weeks leading up to that. So everybody would have a little bit of a basis and they would answer their questions. And like I said, it was just a way better model because I was seen as a leader. I all of a sudden had influence and authority in that space, even though I wasn't the expert, I was able to leverage and draft behind the expertise and the audience that he had already built because he was sharing about his success online with other people as he met them. I was able to give them a benefit because they wouldn't have all been able to get access to that information. And off the back of that, it literally $100 million came off the back of that with all these different companies that were started and really cool things, including my own company, which we ended up niching down to Amazon marketing. I met somebody who's really good at that. I met somebody who had a corporate background. We formed a little triumvirate there and within six months or so, we had built it to a 75K recurring revenue business with like five or six clients. So it was a really cool win. I ended up moving away from that business and selling my share in it, but the mastermind was what brought it in to be. So I'll fast forward quite a bit more. We ended up launching Build a Mastermind, our program. I wrote the book, The A Amen to Mastermind, which is theamenamastermind.com. You can get it. It's a free plus shipping offer, which is pretty cool. You can get that for free. You just pay for what it costs to get it to your house. And then I basically went back to Jay during COVID actually. We were at JVology, which you mentioned earlier, in Cabo. And we're by the beach. And I asked Jay, I'm like, whatever happened to Mastermind in millions of you? I had all these successes telling about all these different masterminds I'd launched. And we've been to China and Hong Kong and Bali and Italy and Greece and all these great places, all of the states in Canada. And he's like, oh, I just, I haven't done it. You know, Joshua went off the climb mountains and I, you know, I saw how opposed he is. Yeah, he wasn't doing as much. Yeah. Yeah. And I just realized like, oh man, this is really cool opportunity to bring this back. It was so beneficial for me. And I think it's a great program. Would you bring it back? He said, yeah, if you will do all the back end fulfillment and manage all the books and deal with all the money stuff, we'll do it. So we formed a, you know, 50-50 partnership. And now we are running Mastermind in millions. We've done it now three times. The fourth one is coming up, which will be our best one yet in May. It's May 30th to June 2nd, right here in Phoenix, where I live now. And Jay's going to come down. We're going to have some awesome people, great speakers, and we're going to teach you everything you need to learn to launch your Mastermind, to get it filled, to run it, to create the influence and authority you need, and ultimately scale it up to whatever level you want to be at. So it's a really special thing. So hold on. I'm going to dive into that real quick too. So this event that's coming up, if people want to go, where do they go to sign up or opt in? Thanks for asking. So yeah, you can go get tickets at Mastermind 2 millions. That's to.live. Mastermind 2 millions.live. And I recommend going VIP. It's only 300 bucks, 297. And that'll get you lunches as well as that VIP wine and cheese I talked about before, which is where I originally met Michael. So it's the same program, plus my stuff. We've updated most of the content just for the times. We've added some really cool speakers and guests and things like that. And it's not one of those events, like it's just a thinly veiled pitch for three days. We give you literally everything step by step, all the secrets, paint by numbers, and you just go and do it. So you can do it on your own. You can work with us, going forward, whatever you decide. But you're going to have everything you need to launch your Masterminds by the end of those three days. I love it. Let me back up for a second though too. All this happened because you were in the right place at the right time meeting the right people, getting this engagement, this opportunity. And I know Jay stopped because COVID, a lot of us stopped traveling and speaking and doing all this stuff. And we're now living in a post COVID world. And I think we're getting back to quote unquote normal. But in these Masterminds, is there some virtual component? I think there's so much value in the physical. We all understand that. But where do you lean? I mean, obviously, you're doing live here. Do you do some of these virtual? Which do you prefer? Is there ways to get these connections virtually versus live? Or do you just prefer all live? Yeah. And here's the funny thing is you would think that virtual would be easier, but people pay attention to what they pay for. That's important to understand. And people pay attention to what's right in front of them in physical space versus in digital space. So yeah, you might work a little harder and you might have to spend a little bit more to get people in a room. But there's no question that it has a bigger impact on them. And it's a better conversion. Because literally, when they're at home sitting in front of their TV or in front of the computer, they're four seconds away from a distraction at any time. When they're in the room, they can go through different ways of emotion. They can go through the boredom, the distraction, they can come back and get excited again and enrolled again during that period. But if you lost them once on virtual, they don't come back. Anything in the world can pull them away and you don't come back. So just from our experience, and other people who do virtual events really successfully, I found three times the impact that we've had. So you should give your real numbers. Like we've done one main event. I can't speak for Jay and Josh was a success prior to this. That wasn't there, except as a participant. But we've done one in-person event at a hotel. And we've done two virtual events. And we sold around the same number of tickets to each one. We got three times the revenue. So 76% of the revenue came from the live event versus two virtual events. We're only at 24%, which is pretty amazing. So in my mind, it's a clear winner. Just from that perspective, and it's hard to gauge other perspectives, but that you can't measure, right? You can measure money. But from an impact perspective, from how many clients enrolled perspective, from a connections made perspective that the virtual is good, but it's not great in those regards. Oh yeah. Also just the fact that their attention is fully present. Yeah. I mean, you wouldn't have those relationships with Jay and with all these other people. If you had proximity power, baby, that's what Tony talks about. It's very true. It's very true, man. Yeah, that's awesome. Sounds like an awesome event. Yeah, it's really cool. So I hope to see you all out there and come on down. If you can get out for a few days, it's well worth your while. And having a mastermind literally changed my life. I could share one more kind of personal story of that. Yeah, do it. It's valuable for people. So as I mentioned, the reason I wanted to come a club award is because not because I sold books, you don't make money on books, but the book is kind of a lead in to learn about what we're up to. And some people end up opting into our program, which is work with us for a year to get a mastermind. And it's a really cool program. We've had hundreds and hundreds of people go through it and it's one awards. And my wife actually was one of the participants originally. So she came on as a referral from another client who had a lot of success. She's like, you got to talk to Brad. He's the mastermind guy. They met through Tony Robbins. She comes in. She's like perfect for us because we share values. She's our client for a year. She gets amazing results. Like literally when she came in, she's already had two masterminds, wasn't making enough money, working way too hard. We got her down from 80 hour weeks to 30 hour weeks in three months, and we tripled her revenue at the same time. She was thrilled, right? So she buys all our other programs, becomes a super client. And then after a year, I had to fire her. Dun dun dun. Because hashtag integrity, I wanted to ask her out long story short. We had had a professional relationship. I needed to close that door in order to have a chance of opening a personal relationship. And in some ways, you could say we arranged our own marriage. This is like January of 2020. This happened. So you all know what happened next. She went home to Virginia. She went to London originally. She grew up in Virginia. I was living in Californians, beautiful house by the ocean. I was like, why don't you come for a couple of weeks and just hang out and we'll see if this is a real thing. You know, let's see if we can arrange our own marriage, right? I was just joking and she did. She came out and ended up becoming two months. We're doing that big KBB launch where we came in top 10 for Tony and Dean promoting that and the whole world was falling apart around us. But it wasn't really locked down yet. We weren't sure exactly what was going on and you didn't know how seriously to take it. You know, I feel like when you look back on that time, for people who hadn't been there, it's going to be like, it was weird. We did our best and you just had to be there, right? That's yeah, it was. But we decided to take a trip to Hawaii. We had already had that plans and while I'm in Hawaii, I get a call from my friend who was a Lieutenant Colonel at the time in the Army and now he's like a Brigadier General. He's doing really well. And I'm like, you know, what's going on, man? He's like, well, this is not like some hoax, right? This isn't just the news blowing this up. This is literally going to shut down the world. And I knew you're in Hawaii. I wanted to tell you to get the hell out and get back to the mainland. You know, could get really bad. I'm like, oh crap. Okay. I take your word for it. You know more than I do, right? So we got on literally the last two seats on the last plane out of there and we hunkered down in San Diego and we started our relationship. I called it immersion dating, 2.0. It was pretty intense. But now four years on, we just got married last month and we're talking about kids and a family and literally she's the best thing that's ever happened to me. And the point of the story is that because I created this community that shared values and because she was attracted to that, I met the love of my life. And maybe you're not out there looking for a wife, maybe or a husband, maybe you're out there looking for a business partner or even just more friends and more people that share life values and want to do life with you and want to create something bigger than what they've created before. That's what masterminds allow you to do and get paid for it. While you're traveling around the world, while you're doing cool stuff with cool people in cool places, and we teach you how to do them. And it's literally been the biggest gift in my life. And now you can say you've hired your wife. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, hashtag integrity might work out for you too. You know, I think if you give somebody the ultimate upsell, then that's a great thing. The ultimate upsell. Yeah. Kind of a little bit of a fanboy question because obviously this has been able to open doors that you never saw coming. And intro number one's got to be your wife. There's no question there. If you had to round up like a top three of like, I'm sitting next to so and so, what the heck is happening? 10 days in Africa with Tim Ferriss was the reason I launched. Oh, cool. You know, he actually suggested. So quick, quick backstory. I know we booked only so much time, but I got a million stories for you. So met Tim in 2009 on my lunch break at the gym, random, fully random. I was working real estate at the time. He's just another guy from Long Island who was mildly famous at that time for our workweek famous, but he wasn't like an 800 pound juggernaut that we know I love today. You know, so I was just chatting with 15 minutes and at the end of the conversation, he came and found me, he was like, hey, man, I was really good talking to you. I hope we stay in touch. It was like, great. That just felt good, right? A year and a half later, he launches for our body. And when he did that, he did this big promotion where you could buy a certain number of books and go on a trip. And it was like, I think you go to India, Argentina or Africa. And I was like, well, this is kind of interesting. Why don't I do this? So I reached out to Charlie Hone, shout out to him. He was his director of special projects at the time. I'm like, what's the deal with these trips, Charlie? So people are reaching out about him, but honestly, Tim doesn't want to spend 10 days in a foreign country with most of the people reaching out. They're just not his kind of people. They don't share values. I was like, oh, that's interesting. What would he consider doing it with me? He's like, well, where do you want to go? I'm like, well, you know, I got invited to Argentina for this cool wedding once. So that was cool. India is not really my cup of tea at that time. I was like, whatever. But I don't know when I'll ever go to Africa again. I think that would be a really cool trip. And if you want to do it, let's do it. So we scheduled it in July of 2011 or so. 20, I can't remember exactly when it was. We went out to Kenya in Tanzania for 10 days. We got to visit Samasource, which is a local NGO there that was helping people get out of poverty through giving them tech jobs. They would come in at a lower bid and like 100 people would work on a tech job that you'd normally pay. And a software engineer or somebody in Silicon Valley to do. So it was like pre-AI arbitrage, essentially. And they lifted 50,000 people out of poverty. And just a shout out to Lila, she's since passed away. So cool. Yeah, she did such an amazing work out there. And it inspired me because it was like, wow, this is a real person doing real things. She's given up her comfy social life and everything. They grew up in the United States. And she went there and really took ownership of the situation and helped so many people. And her impact has felt in many lives to this day. So rest in peace, Lila. But during that trip, cool thing happened. Tim sat me down at a hotel in Lamu Island, which is on the coast of Kenya. And he says to me, what do you want to do with your life? So I was telling him about the 3D printing and the trading and all the things I was up to at the time. And he says, do you want to go to North Korea? North Korea? What the? That's total non-secret. What are you talking about? He's like, yeah, I got this friend. He's running this thing called a mastermind group in North Korea. I'm like, why do I want to go to North Korea? He's like, yeah, he's like, that wouldn't even be allowed there. And like, I just couldn't understand the way his brain got there from what we were talking about. Like, yeah, you want to kick ass and take names and be successful in life. You should go to a third world dictatorship where you're at the whim of a crazy person. And I'm like, well, who's your friend? He's like, I can't tell you he's sensitive and private. I'm like, okay, I respect that. Are you going to North Korea? He's like, nope. I think I got to pass on this one, but sorry. I respect you. I love you. I appreciate you. I can't do it. So I go back to New York, where I was living at the time. A month later, I had malaria and a bunch of other stuff happened. I almost got trampled by donkeys on that trip. We got to play golf with the president in general of Kenyos. We're going to have to have another podcast episode. We need a part two, Brad. There's a part two. Yeah, part two. So I'm back in New York and I'm looking at my emails one day. I'll never forget this. I was right by NYU at this defunct coffee shop that was called Brad. So I never forgot the name. I'm in Brad's and I'm looking at my emails and I get the email from Neil Strauss, who's like, I just went to North Korea with my mastermind group and I was like, well, what are the odds of that? Right? So I reached out to them like, hey, this is really interesting. Tim told me about this. When's your next meetup? I'd like to check it out. I said, oh, come to LA. So I went to LA and I remember being on the plane and I'd never been to Los Angeles before and I'm flying in and I see these purple splotches on the ground as we're landing. Right? And I'm like, what the hell are those? I asked the guy next to me in the plane. He's like, oh, those are jack-o-rand-a trees. I'm like, Jack, what are those beautiful purple leaves that I'd never seen before? California has purple trees. It was like a Dr. Seuss book in real life. I couldn't believe it. I was hooked from the get, like being around Neil and his world and he was this kind of cool writer who'd done all these books. People don't realize this, but like Neil's written probably close to 20 New York Times bestsellers both for himself and for a variety of different celebrities like the New Kevin Hart book, the Regrubin book, the Marilyn Manson book, like the Dirt, which is about Motley Crue. All those books were by Neil, which is really cool. So it was an opportunity to be in his orbit, be in his mastermind and that's where I ultimately led to meeting all those people, forming that hedge fund and so on and so forth. So it's just funny how all these little kind of, I call them god shots, like little taps, little feathers, you know, in a junior direction, but you have to be open to it. You have to be willing to take big, make big moves one the time. Yeah, it's kind of like Divine rendezvous, right? He's playing chess, but are you going to do something when he puts you in that position? Exactly, 100% and that led me to so many amazing things. Like we got to go to, you know, I'm one of two people, one of them actually also passed away, come to think of it, who got to hike the Inca Trail with Neil Strauss for four days and the other guy didn't speak English. He was a French native. So it was like, I got to spend four days with one of my hero authors in one of the coolest places I've ever been to. We walked to Machu Picchu and we got to take a train back and have a really good time and like, I'll never forget that, like, really cool stuff. So I would say if you asked me like top three, Richard Branson, Tim Ferriss, Neil Strauss and since then it's been countless, like Tony and Dean and, you know, all these amazing people, Marie Forleo and like all these just people I look up to in such a huge way. But it's expanded my idea of what's possible by bringing the right people together. So like, if you think about business, that's one thing. Yeah, we launched a lot of businesses, made a lot of money, we've helped a lot of people. That's all cool. But like, how can we change the world? Like, really, what's going to make the biggest impact? And being early is the same as being wrong, right? So you got to pick something that you can do now. Like, yeah, it'd be cool to go mine asteroids. But are we there yet? Technologically, probably not for a while, right? But what something that I've always been really interested is 3D printing and 3D printing is really coming to its own and become a thing. And I think it's a foregone conclusion at this point. It's getting cheaper and better all the time. And 3D printing of organs specifically, I think is a really cool way to use that technology. So what does this mean exactly? I'm just going to blow people's minds. So my mom, God bless her, worked 30 years, got out of a job and immediately got very ill and threw a series of mistakes, essentially. Her kidneys are shot. She's on dialysis now. So really, really hard time she's having. And if you've never been on an organ transplant list, it's a giant. It disrupts your whole life. It's a full-time job. Just keep you alive. You're just praying and hoping that somebody's misfortune will be your saving grace, that you're going to be allowed a second chance at life. And you're just hoping that you can do it in an amount of time before you waste away to nothing. And it's a ticking clock, right? You can't live forever on dialysis, although people do well with it. A better scenario would be what if... And then when you get the organ, there's rejection, there's pills your whole life, people don't talk about what it's like to live with the donated kidney or whatever, right? So I'm thinking to myself, well, what if we could print a scaffold that's nutrients that teases pluripotent adult stem cells into a different type of organ, right? Where you don't have to use embryonic stem cells. There's no ethical issues. It's your own cells remade in the form of a kidney or a heart or liver or lung and then implant in your body. No chance of rejection to your own cells. And then you have a better quality of life. Now you have replaceable parts for humans and could extend human lifespan 50 years. I don't even know where to begin to create this. I know some companies are doing it. I've done some research. I have a biology background. I did a bachelor's in biology a long time ago. And I had no idea what it was going to be for. But now I'm starting to connect the dots. Like maybe this is one of the things that I should really look into and really pay attention to. And my first step is going to be to figure out who's who in the zoo and put them together in a mastermind group. Find the collaborators, find the people willing to share, find the people who are not just doing it for the money or to inflate their own sense of identity or ego, but they really want to change the world and build a mastermind of those people. Put them in a room and see what happens. See what shakes out because you cannot understand the moves looking forward. You have to take the first step into the dark and see what illuminates from that and the second step in the dark, right? You can't drive across the country in pitch black with no headlights, but you can illuminate a couple hundred feet in front of you at a time and get across the country even if you're driving with no sunshine. So I think that's a great way to think about this is like, this is a tool that, yes, you can bring people together and make money and it's a better way to impact clients in less time. All that's true. But this is a tool that could potentially change the world. The Declaration of Independence was signed by a mastermind group who put their lives on the line to say, no, no more, no more monarchy, no more bullshit. Let's give democracy a chance and it worked. Now they're the most powerful nation on earth. And if those men and women that all contributed to that did not take that chance, we wouldn't be here today talking about this today. With the freedom of religion we enjoy and the freedom of choice that we enjoy, there's plenty of places on earth that would rather take that away and just rule with an iron fist. And we're that one beacon of hope that allows that and a mastermind made that possible. Whether you call it a mastermind or not, that's what made it possible. So what else is possible through masterminds? This whole idea too, I remember I had, it was funny, I was talking to Russell years ago before I even came to work ClickFunnels. And we were talking about Napoleon Hill, we were talking about outweighing the devil. And he talks about this concept too, constantly in that book. Because he'd go into these rooms, you'd have these conversations, not real conversations, but whether it was Martin Luther or whoever, and he'd answer back how they would answer. And just this idea of having somebody else that you can bounce ideas off of and collectively come up with something greater than you, is that mastermind? I mean, it's amazing. Well, we could talk to you forever. And we're going to have to do a part two for sure. We are. Yeah. Would you want to again drop us the links? Yeah, would you drop us the links for the event and also for the Eight Minute Mastermind? Sure. So the Eight Minute Mastermind book is at eightminutemastermind.com, the number eight or spelled out eight works. You're going to get three free resources just for checking it out, whether you buy or pay for the shipping or not. That is going to be 50 hot seat recordings. So you can understand what a mastermind is like and how it works and just kind of see it in action. It's going to be a cheat sheet so you can get yours up and running very quickly. And then it's going to be 101 questions you can ask as a mastermind facilitator. So if you just want to try this out and see if this is right for you, you can do that for free 100%. You can get those resources either way. The book is, I think, $5.99 to ship anyone in the world. So I'm losing money on it, but I just want to get it in more people's hands. It's not like some crappy ebook I threw together in a weekend either. It's the fourth version. Either is the fourth version. We've written a bunch of new stuff into it. I never believe a book is done. It's always updating and I'm learning new stuff. So let me check that out at amenandmastermind.com. But the most immersive experience we provide is Mastermind to Millions. That's the event that really got me in the game and got me moving and met my first business partner and was off to the races. So if you want to check out Mastermind to Millions, it's May 30th to June 2nd at Phoenix, Arizona. We've got a beautiful resort in Spa, right 10 minutes in the airport, easy in, easy out. We've got a cool room rate worked out. You just go to mastermindtomillions.live and you can always reach out to us at support and makemoremarbles.com if you have any questions or any issues that arise. We can help you deal with logistical challenges or whatever you need. We're here to support you. We just want to make sure you get to the event. You provide your attention. It's not going to break the bank either way. You don't have to work with us. There's no hard pitch. But if you want to do this and learn this method, this could be the one tool for everything else you do in your life. And I really mean that. This is not some whatever. Yeah, I've taken some amazing courses. I've read some amazing books, but Masterminds consistently changed my life for the better in ways that are miraculous and unknown until I just dive right in. So that's one of the things I want to give back to the world is I've learned this model. I get it. It lowers the risk and increases the possibilities of what's possible, like exponentially. It's an unbelievable model and it's literally changed the world before and will change the world again, where I will die trying and others will as well. So I really feel like if you're leaving this on the sideline one day, one day, one day, make it a priority. Get there. I'll give you a big hug, teach you everything I know. So will Jay and we'll make it awesome for you. Love it. Thanks Brad. You're amazing. Great stuff. My pleasure guys. Thank you so much for having me. Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you to all the listeners out there and I look forward to meeting you in person. Awesome. Thank you.
