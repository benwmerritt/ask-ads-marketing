Ad costs are constantly rising, right? And people are struggling to get the same amount of visitors for the same amount of money that they were three, four, five years ago. My clients right now that are kind of most efficiently scaling, they're thinking outside of the box for any of the agency owners. Listening are people who are considering starting an agency. I will tell you this from experience. Always attract clients with big rent. You never want to be the biggest expense on the totem pole.

I am never been this excited for a guest that we've had on our show. Probably one of the best marketers living and breathing today is in terms of conversion rate optimization. If you are a nerd, you have to watch every and listen to every second of this episode and Paul's take notes, rewind, do whatever you got to do. Because if you like making money and like increasing your conversions in your sales, you are in the right spot. Chris, are you echoing this Testament? What's, what's your move right now? And you were, you were hyping me up too before we hit record. You're like, no, seriously, like I am more excited for this. And I know you man. And I know you were crazy excited. I am too. Like this is going to be fun. Yeah. Class is in session. Yeah. But it's our pleasure to introduce two nicknames, AKA Tinkerbell, AKA Barbie with brains Amanda Dobson. Welcome. How are you today? Hi guys. I'm amazing. Y'all know how to make a girl blush. You work when you have to. The weird thing is for those who aren't watching like Ben is blushing. Like, you know, I'm not, no, I'm not. He's fanboying like crazy right now. This is awesome. You guys just need to follow me around in my day to day life and just hype me up like this day to day. We can negotiate a fair rate. Yeah. I can carry my boombox and everything. Yeah. But thanks for hopping on. And for those, for those in this industry listening to our show, our listeners who might happen to live under a rock, can you give a quick intro on, you know, what you do and what, you know, brought you into the online marketing industry? Yeah. I mean, I've been doing this for about 10 years now. I've kind of built and operated and exited three conversion rate optimization agencies. So this is kind of my world. And for those of you listening in that, that aren't, you know, quite down the conversion rate optimization rabbit hole. My job is to come in and take something that you've created and make incremental changes based on what I see, what's working, what's not working to, you know, improve conversion rates across the board. And that could be anything from generating leads to making sales, to increasing your average order value, to increasing your stick rate, to improving your returning customer rate. You know, that's something that we look at, what the, what business metrics move the needle in your business. And then I look at the actual data points, which is really important to know. Cause there's a lot of vanity metrics out there that don't necessarily matter. And then there's the real needle moving metrics. So my job is to figure out what those needle moving metrics are and then figure out which levers to pull to move those needles in the right direction. So I've been doing this for about 10 years. I got my start in marketing, working in the natural health supplement space. I kind of, if you guys are familiar with Amber Spears, she kind of took me under her wing and taught me, I learned affiliate marketing under Amber, which was an amazing start. Love her to death. Then I kind of got into the director of marketing role. And then I was really lucky to be able to go and work with Perry Belcher and Ryan Dice and Roland Frazier running the e-commerce side of their business. And I did that for seven or eight years, learned a lot. The six figure education working there. We were able to run a lot of volume and on a lot of styles of different funnels. So I've seen everything from tripwire offers to lead generation to high ticket. In every space from gun survival, DIY to now therapy services and high ticket coaching. There isn't an offer that I haven't seen out there. So that's kind of been my wheelhouse for the last couple of years. Coming into the marketing space, I was actually a paralegal before this. That's what I went to school for. So compliance runs in my blood. I'm always looking at offers and making sure that everything that we're doing is compelling, but compliant, which is, I don't know if you guys are seeing this too, but this is just ever increasingly more important. Yeah, we've seen it like crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It's an act like Onyx and Gull is just doing an amazing job right now, teaching compliance and just bringing awareness to it. Because it's a anybody can craft it. Well, not anybody, but a lot of people out there can craft a compelling offer. But, you know, saying it without attracting a three letter government agency, you know, is a whole nother story. So I think I just think that that's something that like really needs to have a lot of attention called to it and the marketers out there that are really embracing compliance and following the rules and providing a good experience for their end user. All right, those are the guys they're going to win over the next little while. So that was a long like backstory on me, but that's my that's my history. Amanda, you know, it's crazy about that. Like we were at WebinarCon. I don't know how long ago that was been, but have the opportunity to speak there and spend a lot of time with Onyx. And I love that he's leaned into this. You know, a lot of times people say that your mess becomes your message and he's just owned this and he's become this warning cry, like a lighthouse for all these other, you know, entrepreneurs who it's been the Wild West. Like, I mean, you know, I think a lot of times people think that they cannot market, you know, and still be compliant. What would you say about that? Can you expound on that a little bit more? I think that's absolutely not true. There is there's two sides of the story. There's the volume and then there's the quality, right? So coming at this just for a little bit of backstory with some context. I was the director of acquisition out of Gora Financial for three years. And so you know, compliance for sure. And I was right in the middle of their FTC lawsuit. So they got sued by the FTC, like literally like three. I didn't know that right after I started. So it was like at my life revolved around FTC compliance. So when I'm looking at the compliance and, you know, whether you can craft a compelling offer and make sales while still following the rules. My answer to you is this. When you are making offers that are making claims that you can't support or don't like the FTC rules are designed to make sure that you can actually back up the claims that you're making. So if you're making an offer and it's really out there and you're making obnoxious claims that you necessarily can't necessarily substantiate, you're going to attract a customer that is looking for that kind of offer. If they don't get that result, you're looking at refunds, charge backs, you're looking at BBB complaints, you're looking at... It kind of creates your own monster. Yeah. So I mean, I would rather build a more sustainable business that is built on the bones of something that is going to live forever and is not going to have to worry about the government agencies coming. I want to be able to sleep at night. So I mean, if you're a business owner that's comfortable with taking those kinds of risks and having crazy customers that are a nightmare to deal with, go that route. If you want to do things the right way and you want to have customers that are going to know, like and love you through this process and continue to buy from you because they're getting the result that you promised, it means that your product delivers what it says it's going to. It does what it says on the tin. So from a business owner perspective and from an offer owner perspective, it's easier to run a business when you follow the rules. Getting to that point and figuring out how to still have offers that are powerful takes time. I'm not saying that it's easy, but once you develop that skill and you play within the rules, I think you're going to run overall a better business. You're going to have better customers. You're going to have better retention and better stick rate. But you're also going to be kind of ahead of the curve because there is going to be kind of a hand that comes down and slaps everybody into following the rules. So if you're playing outside of the sandbox right now and you don't figure that piece out, you're going to have to eventually, but the guys that want to do it right are already figuring it out. Onyx is already teaching this. He's already helping people get their ducks in a row. And that's where I want to be. I want to, I hate to make a Canadian reference, but I want to be where the puck is going to go. So if you're working on your first funnel now or you're working on offers now, and it doesn't really matter what space you're in, compliance kind of hits every industry, every offer. I really encourage you guys to do some research. And if your business supports it, and there are lots of great attorneys out there that specialize just in compliance, both from like regulation perspective and actually like e-commerce best practices, I know Onyx can recommend probably a few that he references, but definitely if you can manage that, then I wouldn't highly recommend it. You mentioned also, you know, dealing with customers you don't want to deal with. This is massive because a lot of times people will, for lack of a better term, get in bed with, you know, these customers that they can't stand. You know, Russell tells a story, he wakes up in the morning, he's like, I can't stand any of the customers. Like if you can figure out who you want to serve and do it in compliant ways, I think your back end fulfillment is much better. What do you have to say about that? Is that like a, like a, you know, two birds with one stone thing or talk to us a little bit about that? Yeah, I mean, I heard a saying once and I can't remember who said it, but it was crazy, attracts crazy. And that's something that's always kind of in the back of my mind. Like if your offer is a crazy offer, that's like, I see this a lot with tripwire offers, right? Like who you tend to, when you're running tripwire offers, if you're not doing it correctly and structuring things correctly, you're going to really have low dollar buyers over time. And if you know anything about running businesses, low dollar buyers are always the one that expect the most. They're the most demanding, the hardest to deal with. So that's also something to take into consideration, like when you're putting together your offers at the end of the day, who is it that you want to deal with? Are you making crazy outlandish offers where you're going to have tons of customer service issues, where your customers are going to be difficult to deal with? Like I think when you're creating your product and actually serving your market, figuring out who your market is first, like who is it that I want to serve and how can I best serve them? I think is the best way to kind of like map out who it is you want to be dealing with in the future. And for any of the agency owners listening or people who are considering starting an agency, I will tell you this from experience. And this was a lesson that I kind of learned from Perry actually when I was starting my first agency. He said, always attract clients with big rent. You never want to be the biggest expense on the totem pole. So when you're going with clients, like if you're going for the client and they're like, you know, for when I first started out, my, my retainer packages were like 3000, 5000 or 7000 a month. And I was, it was easy to sell the $3,000 a month package because it was low ticket, but I was selling it to clients who were stretching to get to that to be able to pay that. And I over delivered, like I was providing the same level of service to those people as I was to the people that were paying on my higher tier, because they were so demanding and they needed so much, because like to them $3,000 was a lot of money. So they were like, they had a lot of expectations whereas like my high end clients were like, where do I wire the money? Like they don't even ask the questions, you know, like I'm following them like, Hey, how do I like provide more to you? Like, how do I get you to work closer with me so I can get you better results? Like they don't care, because I'm, I'm a small fish to them. I'm not, I'm not a high expense on their totem pole. And if you're thinking about both business and agency life, like that is where you want to be. You don't want to be like the, the big expense that everybody's scared of. You want to make sure that you're at the end of the day, I sit back in my business and say like, how many times over have I paid for myself in this business? And that like lets me sleep better at night. Because I know at the end of the day, like I'm bringing back a multiple of what I call. So it's, you know, easy for me. But the same is true for whether you're selling, you know, physical products or info products, like really map out who it is you want to be dealing with and what type of offer you want to be putting into the market and really pay attention to your customers before you scale. You know, it's really easy to see with a small test, you know, how customers are responding. Talk to them, talk to your customer service team, find out what customer service issues they're having and get ahead of it before your offer starts to scale. I'm trying to figure out what direction I should go in, whether it's conversions or traffic. Because we've been, and I know you know the answer to both, let's start at traffic first, then we'll work our way down the line. Because you've mentioned, you know, going into tripwires and stuff like that. I've been hearing just around the industry how ad costs are constantly rising, right? And people are struggling to get the same amount of visitors for the same amount of money that they were three, four, five years ago. What trends are you seeing right now for listeners who are maybe struggling with rising meta ad costs? What, what, what are you seeing? For me, this is just, this is just a logic problem. And you know, the coming back to the definition of insanity, if you keep doing the same thing over and over again, you're going to get the same result. My clients right now that are kind of most efficiently scaling, they're thinking outside of the box. Like if you're running your business on meta, and you are competing for the same traffic as every single one of your competitors, if you're, you know, not refreshing your ad creatives, if you're not refreshing your offer, if you're not building audience pipelines, you are going to run into this offer like everybody else's. My clients, like right now, my advice to them is work with people who are running network traffic on Yahoo, on Croteo, on Dino, me on all of these networks that are not like most people have probably listening, haven't heard of most of these, there's so many networks out there. Yeah, there's so many traffic networks out there, Yahoo, Gemini is a massive platform for advertising. Jordan Swanson's an amazing contact who I work with all the time to kind of do a lot of retargeting, I find it really powerful for retargeting. But get off of Facebook and meta and Google, you know, those are not the two only players in the marketplace. Obviously, people are playing around with Snapchat and TikTok and but like the OGs, you know, Pinterest, Quora, Reddit, LinkedIn, there are so many other ad platforms and like your competitors are probably not thinking about all of these things. So if I were, you know, having an issue where I'm starting to find that I'm reaching max capacity and my CPMs are rising, you know, new offers, new creative, new audiences, this is a big one, vertical testing, you know, if you have a product that solves a problem for one audience, think to yourself, spend some time, what other audiences could a tweak in messaging have that same effect where that could solve that product or that service could solve the same problem for someone else, but maybe in a different context. And I'm going to give a horrible example here, but it's the first one that comes to mind, OZMPIC. OZMPIC is a diabetes medication, but it also helps with weight loss. So think about your product in the same way, a very small tweak in the messaging and looking at the overall impact of the product now serves took a ZMPIC from like having a one market to having a massive market, but it's not initially what it was created for. So looking at your business and figuring out who else can my product serve. And rather than if you're really comfortable on meta, and that's where you want to be, because maybe that's all your media buyer knows, that's realistic, that happens in businesses, it's not easy to find someone who can buy ads on all of these other platforms. But think about how else can you scale in different verticals rather than continuing to scale in the vertical that you're in. Sometimes it's just a new funnel, sometimes it's new messaging, sometimes it's just a little research. But there's just unlimited opportunity there. If you can think outside of the box and be a little creative. Fascinating. And are you seeing that same out of the box creative thinking when it comes to offer creation upsells, increasing average order value, and then I want to get into retention, but I'm just again, classes in session, but are you seeing that same creativity? I'm not seeing it. I would love to see it. I would love to see people spending a little bit more time. I can tell you earlier this year, I had a client who came to me and they 15 to $20 million a year business, they're spending a lot of money on meta, a really successful business, but they're saying like, we can't scale anymore, we're just not getting the return that we wanted to. And we did a little test. So I actually sat down with their head of customer service and said like, hey, when you're talking to our customers about this product, what are the things that like when you're talking to them, they get the most excited about. So they've got a customer service team and a sales team and I had this similar conversation with both. What are customers talking to you about that aren't the way that we pitch the product? So in this case, it ended up being, you know, they were buying this product or at least talking about this product, because they wanted more time freedom. They wanted to be able to work and learn remotely. And there was a few others, but I noticed like going through their sales materials, that wasn't even something that they mentioned, you know, they were so focused on the product itself and not including that piece that I like really push on is that so that piece. So your product and all of the features are one piece of it, but what's the benefit? And by forcing yourself to say so that you tie the benefit onto it. So, you know, they want, they can work and learn and do all of their training online and that's great. This is an online certification. That's the product and the feature so that they can work and learn remotely. They can continue that home lifestyle, you know, coming after the pandemic. And we were able to reduce their CPM costs on Meta by, I think by recall correctly, was about 29% by just talking and figuring out what that like real benefit was to their customer that they weren't even talking about. And it was like the biggest needle mover for them so far that we've seen this calendar year. And it was just a quick conversation. So it's not necessarily being create. I think more than being creative, it's being resourceful. And really like using the information. I have another client right now who are about to launch a SaaS product. And we did a survey before we even hired anyone to help us build at the SaaS to survey their customers and figure out like what their biggest challenges were. And keep in mind, they sell something completely different right now than SaaS. But the SaaS is going to be a value add to their customers. But we asked their customers like what are your biggest challenges that you're facing in the business right now? What's keeping you up at night? What's keeping you from having work life balance? And you know, you got into a business to provide the service and then realized after the fact that this also requires you to be an entrepreneur. What is the hardest part of that? And we asked them, I think it was like 11 or 12 questions. And they have a fairly decent size email list. But we got I think 190 some odd responses to the survey. And these were people like they obviously have a developed brand and an audience that was really like forthcoming with information. But we crafted the entire product like all of the SaaS offerings, all of the features that included all of the benefits of it. The entire sales letter is basically a regurgitation of what we got as feedback from the survey. So it hasn't launched yet. But I can already tell you that I know that that offer is going to be successful because it was crafted based on like the needs of the audience. So if you can really like don't be scared to ask those questions because at the end of the day, like you have a you have a an audience or an industry that has a problem, you owe it to them as a business owner to do your best to solve those problems. And if it takes a survey, who cares if you only get 20 responses, call those people have conversations with them, they're willing to share information with you and craft a product that is what they want, not what you want to sell. And you're going to eliminate all of the problems we've already talked about, you know, on this call so far, can be eliminated by just having those conversations. So rather than trying to force yourself to be creative, if you're not a creative person, be resourceful instead. You've got all this information at your fingertips if you know how to ask for it. Gosh, that's very true. I kind of want to drill into like examples. Chris, you have another question. Well, no, I was just going to say, do you find that that is like a common theme among entrepreneurs, especially as like, sometimes they may think they know better than their audience like, no, I know what you need, or I know what's going to work. Is that a common theme? Do you have any more examples of that? Or they become marketers and forget that they exist to serve, you know, at the end of the day, bingo. People are not, I posted about this recently on my Facebook, like, because I see a lot of times, and I know we were kind of talking about this prior to the call starting, I see funnels being copied, and I see people like adapting offers into their business and trying to force them to work and assume that they're going to work without actually knowing the reason behind the offer. They don't know where the idea came from. They don't know what the metrics of that offer look like. They're just like, oh, like, I see that offer. That looks cool. Like, I'm going to recreate that because so-and-so created it. So it must be a winner, which is not the case usually. So my, like advice in this kind of arena is to ignore what everybody else is doing, focus on testing, what works for your business, but put serving your audience absolutely first. Stop thinking you know better. This was the biggest mistake that I made when I first got into marketing, because my thought process was like, oh, like, I wouldn't buy that, or I wouldn't go through that process. And like, I tell myself an insane absurd amount of times, you are not your audience, Amanda. You are not the person, like, I'm a 34-year-old Canadian blonde girl. Like, I am selling tactical gear and guns and survival stuff. Like, I can't think like myself. I need to teach myself to think like the people I'm supposed to be talking to. So that's a skill set all on its own is figuring out how to do that, but more like, I get into that persona is like, what are, what is keeping these people up? What's troubling them? Like, where are the holes in their lives and how can I help fill them? But as business owners, it's really easy to forget that people are people. These people are problems. These people have, it's like, some of you aren't solving problems. Some of you are selling products that are an interest-based, you know, these are like hobbies or, you know, people, the things that give people joy as opposed to moving them away from pain. There's two sides to that coin. But it's really easy to get caught into like, what's the next thing? Like, what are the fires I need to put out? Like, how do I, you know, what's my P&L looking like? And not sitting down and thinking about, how does my customer feel about my product or service right now? Like, what's the conversation about my product or service in the marketplace right now that I'm not listening to? What am I ignoring? How am I not leveraging the information that they're giving to me? Am I talking to my team? Am I talking to my frontline workers? A very specific example, the best performing offer I have ever created in my entire career as far as performance goes came from me volunteering to cover customer service as the CMO while our team was having like a business lunch where like, it's like a customer or employee kind of appreciation day that we did. They were having a barbecue and I volunteered to watch over customer service. And the hook behind the offer came from messages that I was seeing on our Facebook Messenger inbox. So I just turned the messaging into an offer. And it's an offer that I believe is still running to this day, you know, five or six years later. And it's like, just listening to people, what they're asking you for, if you're paying attention, can be the difference between you trying to make something work that you think is the right answer versus walking out the door with a winner because you already know they've already told you that this is what you want. If you are listening, and I know I'm talking a lot, I'll give you guys a chance to ask some other questions, but this is what people came for. They didn't come to hear us. If you guys have resources in your business like Facebook groups or Messenger bot lists or, you know, outfits that are kind of like, you don't quite know what to do with them. Like I'll tell you, working with Perry, I hope he doesn't mind me sharing this. We used to build Facebook groups for his associations all the time. And one of the things that I'd love to do is actually ask in the association, like, what products are you guys looking for? What guys, what products are you guys in the market for? What are you guys seeing out there that's exciting? Like I'm actually asking them for information, because I know like I can provide the solution, or give them what it is that they're looking for, if I know what they're looking for. So getting over that initial fear, like because everyone thinks like, oh, I'm going to ask and they're going to think that I'm like a capitalist pig just trying to get more money out of them. But when you get into like just asking them, and if you're engaging in your groups really frequently, and you're, you know, you're approachable to your audience, it's you'll be surprised the amount of feedback that you get, that you can use to create an offer. And like I would outright ask like, hey, we're going to come up with like a new gear offer next month, like what would you guys rather see? And I'd give them a couple options and let them poll. So I'm not guessing myself, I'm going to ask them before I even try. It's like a the ultimate hack. That's genius. Yeah. I want to back up for a quick second though. You, you mentioned something about, you know, I'm just going to copy, you know, something, somebody's, you know, funnel because I think they're good, like without the stats, you really can't do that. But you kind of had the out of those cryptic, but but maybe a little bit of a controversy. We were talking about this before we hit record post yesterday on Facebook, they kind of dove into that, like different funnel builders, you know, that maybe aren't that great. Or, you know, can you kind of talk about maybe why you did that? And then some of the feedback that you've got, it sounds like you got a lot of DMs from, from just that topic. What was that all about? A lot of people thought that that post was because I did a Facebook post that was talking about like just blindly copying offers and funnels that you see because of what you hear, you know, you see a guru marketer on stage and they're talking about this amazing offer that they have that's like blowing up their business and the years of the stats and this is what it looks like. And those stats may very well be true. Sometimes they're not, sometimes they are. But marketing is not one size fits all. And marketers are humans too, you know, I will tell you like 90% of the time when I'm running testing, I'm wrong, you know, 10%, I get it right and we scale to the moon and it makes a big difference. But a lot of times I'm wrong, nobody gets it right 100% of the time. So what you may be seeing on stage may be through a different lens, you know, maybe that offer converted like that to their warm traffic, not to cold traffic, or maybe it had context that wasn't given in the presentation that you had, like this is an offer that's running anymore because it was, it stopped working for whatever reason, or it only worked during this like pre-election season or whatever it is. But they take this offer business owners all the time, and they take like, I heard so and so was doing this, and I don't understand why we don't do it in our business because, you know, this is what they said their numbers are. And it's not, it's not true most of the time. And I don't say that to be shady, you know, it's, I'm saying or to be controversial, it's just, I want marketers to our business owners to really be thinking about like, this is a funnel that that works and what pieces can I adapt to my business that would make sense, not just blindly copying it, but what pieces like use it as inspiration, not as like something I'm going to copy, because these guys are out there testing too. Even the best marketers are in the world have offers right now in the marketplace that are bombing because they're testing, you know, it's not always going to get it right out of the gate. So I, you know, I see this all the time, like funnel hacking culture is like, scroll through your news feed, click on every ad that you see, go through and funnel hack the funnel. Well, that funnel may be a brand new funnel that they're testing something on and you may be getting a variation that's a wrong variation, you know, unless you know these marketers and can reach out, like I am fairly well connected in the marketing industry and I can reach out to so and so and say, Hey, like I saw this funnel looks great, like what are the stats looking like? And I'm going to look at that and figure out how I can adapt that to a business where it makes sense. Like if I'm selling a product that a tripwire offer like doesn't really make sense for, I'm not going to really push a tripwire offer. And it kind of, that post actually, I know a lot of people are kind of assuming that that was like targeted at someone, but it actually came out of an experience I had at an event recently. I spoke on a stage a few years ago talking about tripwire offers and I had someone explain real quick, sorry, what a tripwire offer is just in case severely audience don't know. Yeah. So a tripwire offer is kind of what it is on the tin, you know, it's a, it's a low barrier to entry offer that's usually low ticket. You know, I like to keep tripwires fairly, you know, under $20, but it depends on what your business model is. A tripwire could be a higher ticket than what I would consider a tripwire if it's, you know, a lower value in proportion to what your big ticket offer is. But it's just the idea of a tripwire is to lower the barrier to entry into your business and to get an initial purchase without a big level of commitment. So it's just to get a credit card. It's just to get the momentum rolling in a funnel. So I was at an event recently and this girl approached me, well, actually I hunted her down because she was talking about her business model and I had an idea that would be really helpful to her and I was like, Hey, you may want to try this. Like I use, you, I heard you was talking about you had this problem in your business. Why don't you try doing this? Like I'm testing this for my clients right now and seeing a lot of success with it. If it makes sense, where I like, I heard the context of your business problem, I think it might work for you, like go ahead and try it. And she said to me like, Oh, like I saw you talking on stage a few years ago about a tripwire offer. So I tried it and it bombs. So why would this work? And I was like kind of thinking about it in the back of my head and it's like, if we had had a conversation one on one, I probably would have told you that a tripwire offer for what you were trying to accomplish wasn't the right tool for what you were trying to do. But you saw what I was teaching and you blanket applied it into your business, but it wasn't in the right context. And it wasn't in, it wasn't a fit for your business. You just saw that I was presenting a funnel that worked and you decided to copy it because it was working for me. That doesn't mean it's going to work for you. It doesn't mean it's going to work for your product or your audience. And it doesn't mean like an experienced marketer may have been able to put something together for you that worked, but you took a model, you copied it blindly, and then you were surprised when it didn't work. And I see a lot of that. And it's one thing if you've got huge budgets to spend on your business and testing. But if you're just getting started on a funnel, it's great to take inspiration and to learn from the templates that are working. And I know like ClickFunnels does a really great job of providing templates that work and ongoing training and stuff like that, that shows what is actually working or can be adapted to your business. But it's really dangerous to go out in the wild and just grab something and blindly copying it and not knowing the context or the, you know, any of the information around it. It's great for inspiration, but I think it's dangerous as a practice to just copy. You know, what's funny about that is, you know, Russell did the whole funnel hacks presentation for the first couple of years at ClickFunnels. He did one yesterday and it's so funny that we're talking about this. And he changed so much of the way he talks about modeling. Like go find three or four of these samples, and that's what you're going to use to go create your own to model it. But then he goes on to really talk about iterating quickly. Like it's change quickly, but split test and then see where the bottlenecks are or where I shouldn't say bottlenecks, but where they stop the conversion stops. Like if you only have a 3% conversion on the landing page, well, that's probably your problem, right? Versus, you know, 17% on your order bump or your upsell or your downsell. Like have you found maybe one specific thing that is common in a tripwire, any of these funnels, like as you work with agencies or different, I mean, as an agency, is there something that you're like, wait, there's one common thread that everybody's kind of doing wrong that they could tweak. They're looking at, they're not looking closely enough at congruency. I did post about this recently on my Facebook. So go check it out if you're listening in. Because I found a lot of times when clients would come to me and their ads were struggling. I was doing, I have a little hack on AI now. I'm using, and I'm just using chat GPT for this. I'm uploading the ad and I'm uploading a PDF of the landing page. And I'm asking chat GPT to analyze the congruency of like, the ad is calling it a problem. Is the landing page doing its job actually answering this and can you suggest ways to improve this? I actually shared my prompts on Facebook so you guys can copy that. I wouldn't even know how to like start that. I never thought of this is great. Yeah. So I'm using AI totally different than anybody else. I know, which is a whole another conversation. But congruency among offers, you know, we're thinking, and I've seen this, I know what the reality of like a marketing campaign looks like. And I know that there's a lot of marketers going out there being like, okay, here's the product library that I've got. I'm just going to plug and play the different pieces based on ticket. Because I know I need to have like a, let's say a $4.95 offer than a $19 offer than a $47 offer than a $197 offer. What products do I have that fit those categories, rather than continuing a conversation throughout the funnel? And I see that being like the number one problem causing drop offs. Like, are you introducing a new product that involves a new conversation or are you continuing a conversation you've already begun? So how I'm doing value ladder kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. So like, I'm all upload. I mentioned that I was using chat GPT for this from add to the landing page. But I'm also doing this through the upsell process. So if I'm noticing that I see a fall off rate, I'm going through, if I see like my, you know, my OTO number two is really falling off. And I like, I can't figure out in my head why that's happening. I will actually ask chat chat GPT to analyze each piece together and figure out where the drop offs in the conversation are happening, you know, where what's the disconnect between these two pages or what is there a difference in the tone difference in the voice is the is the USP between these two products difficult to distinguish. And that is a big one right now, because we teach a lot of times in the marketing space to sell speed and automation in the upsells, give them either more of what they've already bought, if you're in the supplement, supplement space, those offer them bundles or speed and automation. But what are you doing that actually differentiates the USP between each piece? So how are you explaining how that is getting either faster results without depreciating what you've already sold them, but continuing to make sure that you're increasing with urgency and importance and throughout the funnel. Those are probably the two biggest things is the differentiation between the offers like, do they feel like they're just reading the same thing over and over again, like it's just an information dump, buy more information, buy more information, buy more information, which means do more work, do more work, do more work versus like actually making sure you're using that so that benefit piece to make sure that there's actually a reason for them to consume more information throughout the process, but also make sure that you're still continuing to focus on that same, like they came to you and clicked on your ad because they had a problem, or something stood out to them and caught their attention in that moment. Your job throughout the funnel is to keep that attention by continuing that same conversation. So there's just a really easy ways to double check that, like using tools like AI that just, that's been a huge needle mover for me this year. That's fascinating. Yeah, we will definitely have to post a link to that post in the comments. I've got a question kind of switching gears a little bit. You have, you know, been in this industry for a decade, you have for sure put in your 10,000 hours. Shout out Malcolm Gladwell. You have to build your Mount Rushmore of marketers that you have learned from in your career. Who are you putting up there? How many people are I'm at Rushmore for? That's a dumb question. I just said that live. Okay, four. I'm Canadian, so I don't even know. I can't even make it. Oh, yeah. We're playing golf and you get to pay yourself with four people who you're picking in online marketing. Yes. Yeah. My number one all time mentor and very close friends, Clayton Makepeace. Before he passed, I was very lucky to be able to spend a great amount of time with Clayton and learn from him directly. So Clayton Makepeace is definitely one Richard Vigory. If you guys don't know who Richard Vigory is, absolutely look him up. He's a political advertiser, huge in the direct mail space, just an absolute gem of a human being. Love him to death. Gosh, there's so many. Obviously, Perry Vulture was very influential to me. I learned so much from him in the eight years that we worked together and that was great. And in the fourth spot, I'd probably be tied somewhere between Dan Kennedy, Russell, and Frank Kern probably in that fourth spot. So I've got a good mix of OG marketers in there and newer, not up and coming marketers. Those guys are all very established marketers, but just ones that are still kicking, still storm marketing. Very cool. Richard Vigory is probably the one that's still... I love when I talk about marketers that maybe aren't being glorified or like... I've never heard of him. Richard Vigory is like, God, he's just such a gem. He's looking up. I'm not even going to try and justify his brilliance, but he is mine. Riding down. Yeah, that's so cool. I've been really close with him for years and I usually in the summer, I'll go out and I'll take my kids with me and we'll go spend a week with him. He's in his late eighties now at his farm in Virginia and I sit there and I feel stupid. Not just dumb. I feel like... Kind of how I feel when you're talking. Yeah. I feel like a toddler when I'm around him. I'm actually sometimes scared to speak because I'm afraid I'm going to look like an idiot when I talk because he's just the vast knowledge and he's so sharp for his age. He's on September 2nd, 1969. I was having lunch with so-and-so and we were having this conversation. I'm like, I don't remember yesterday. He's just absolutely brilliant and the lessons that he has is it's interesting because he's the king of direct mail. If you've ever done direct mail or want to get a direct mail, I fully endorse it. But I think those marketing tools are coming back around right now. I think if we're having trouble on Meta and Google, we need to start looking at these other advertising methods. The first thing I do is look at who are the OGs in these different markets that made it work when it was impossible in the 60s, 70s, 80s. Those things are coming back around. Don't just look at digital marketers and e-commerce marketers because I can tell you that a lot of those e-commerce marketers are going back to basics and foundations and looking at these channels that were like, how did we market and how did we sell before the internet was around? How did we get people's attention? I'm like, we're having... The internet has now circled back on itself and now nobody has an attention span for the internet. Everybody is like TikTok, three second attention span is causing another problem. Now, how do we get people infiltrate in their daily lives again and actually start to build more sustainable businesses because we're not reliant on something that is so fickle right now? I love that you brought up some of the old school like Dan Kennedy. The things that he teaches are so evergreen. They can be applied to the yellow pages. They can be newspaper. They can be direct mail. They can be email. They can be video sales letters. Everything, those principles are all the same and it's fun. Now to get attention, like what we did for the 2.0 launch, we sent out these huge foam 2.0 logos that people just couldn't ignore and then what happened is people started sharing them in their reels and everything else, but direct mail, lumpy mail. It's cool. I love talking to Joe Paulish. I always have really great ideas that are outside of the box ideas. Dean Jackson also amazing. Those guys are doing stuff that we should be paying more attention to, absolutely for sure. Great. Google all of that. Amanda, for our listeners, as we can start to wrap up here, they want to learn more about you and they should. What's the best way to connect? Where should they go? How do they opt into everything that you have? I'm actually really excited. My new website is actually going to go live. It's the Cobbler's Children Never Have Shoes. My website is absolutely horrendous. I've got a new one launching a few weeks. It's Amanda K. Dobson, just like the sign. Amanda K. Dobson and then Amanda K. Dobson on socials wherever you consume your social media. I've actually not been active on social media for the last couple of years because I'm kind of an interesting personality in the market's place and I say this humbly because I've always kind of been behind the scenes. I'm working on these big campaigns that you guys are seeing in the wild, but you may not necessarily have heard my name, but I've kind of been working on those in the background. I've made a conscious effort this year to try and share more of what I know on social. I give away a lot on my Facebook. I give away a lot of amazing tools that I use in my day-to-day in my business to leverage AI and actually how I approach AI is very different. I'm teaching that indirectly on my social media. Don't be surprised if you don't see a huge social media following there. I've been so focused on creating for other people that I've only now just kind of like turned the attention towards building for myself and sharing what I know because I realize that there's a lot of things that I do that are kind of counterintuitive that other business owners like your users may not know, but it could really benefit them and I'm just not doing the service to people that I should by keeping that information to myself. I hope that you guys are open to seeing a lot more of me because I'd love to share what I know and what I see and help you guys all move your businesses forward. Amanda K. Dobson, wherever you consume your social media, amandakdobson.com, and I'm making the rounds to a lot of bigger marketing events this year. I'm hoping you guys will come and see me on some of those stages. Super excited for that. Love it. Very cool. We got smarter in the last 45 minutes or so. If you didn't, you weren't listening. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Amanda, thank you so much for your time. It's so valuable. We didn't take it for granted and thank you so much. Thanks for having me guys. I appreciate it. Thanks, Amanda.
