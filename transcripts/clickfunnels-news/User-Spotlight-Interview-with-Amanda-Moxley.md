## Transcript
Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels, and today I'm speaking with Amanda Moxley. She's a speaker, author, business coach, and a funnel hacker. Amanda, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us today. You, I'm so happy to be here. Awesome. Okay. Well, to get started, can you just tell us a little bit about your business, your background, how you got started? Yes. So I have been a coach for 18 years. I heard about coaching a long time ago while I was getting a master's in social work and I was like, freedom, internet. I can have a profitable, a portable and a playful business. So I dove in and throughout the years I started as a holistic health coach. And then since 2017, I niched into speaking and teaching people how to create live events as well as getting booked to speak. Awesome. And what types of clients do you usually work with? So generally they're different kind of coaches. They are maybe retired nurses that want to start a business. So they're entrepreneurs or coaches as well as creators, creators who want to create their own business and have it online. Awesome. Can you tell me how ClickFunnels helps you achieve your goals in your business? Oh, it's like literally the best thing ever because all of the, everything is done for you and you just have to go in there and change your colors, your fonts and the copy. And it's so easy. When I first started, I had to use, I had to hire an expensive virtual assistant or a tech VA to do all my tech work. So they had to build it out in HTML. They had to use, and then lead pages came along and then everything was like integrated and we had all these different pieces. And now everything is in one. So it's the, I've gotten speed. I've got implementation quicker. And like from idea to action, we can turn it around in less than 12 hours. Yeah. It's huge. Cool. If you don't mind telling us what type of funnel has been like the most effective for you in your business? Well, I would say two. I've had, so the first funnel I've had is a webinar funnel, a webinar funnel to a sales call. And that has, where we did Facebook ad to a webinar to a sales call. And that has been the most effective because that Facebook ad to that funnel where the webinar is, is able, I'm able to communicate my message and my ideal clients are able to hear me and spend that time with me in that 50 minute presentation and then book a call with me. So that in itself, of itself, I think we've had over 200 clients from that one program. Wow. That was huge. And then I started that one in 2017. And then in 2019, I started a book funnel and the book funnel is we've sold about 3000 books and these are PDF books. And then there's different, you know, do you want fries with that? Do you want to supersize it? So we've been able to bring, that's more of a longer term strategy where people can come in and be on the list and get to know me. And sometimes they become a client six months a year later. Awesome. Okay. And you mentioned your book. Tell us a little bit more about that and why you think it's so important to book stages as an expert in the industry. Oh, for sure. So the book is called Six Figure Speaker. And I think that when you, first of all, when you have a book, it positions you as an expert and an authority because you've actually taken the time to write a book, but I actually didn't write the book. I, I, little tip, I actually was sitting down to write the book and I said to myself, I've said all this stuff a million times on my YouTube channel. So I transcribed it and I had an editor actually put it into the book and made it. So we got it done in two weeks. I'm all about speed. But having, being able to be booked on stages positions you as an expert and it collapses the no like and trust factor. Not only that, it also can skyrocket your business overnight. One of my clients, for example, she just did her very first event. She is an IV nurse. So she helps people get vitamins through IV and she made $750,000 from her first event. It was massive. So that's just like the power of positioning and having your own stage. Amazing. So are you using that book funnel just to generate leads to pitch your other services? Exactly. Yes. Amazing. Wow. So it's just like a lead generation. It's just constantly getting leads and name recognition. Amazing to be seeing that much success. That's awesome. What would be your best piece of advice for anyone who's an entrepreneur, business owner, anything who's just getting started and maybe doesn't know a whole lot about funnels yet? Well, you don't really need to know a lot about it. I would just say buy it and best in it because it'll work for you. And my best advice is take action before you're ready. My motto is actually JFDI just deafing do it. And so the whole idea of just taking action and a lot of times I've done things where they've completely flopped, but then I learned from it and then I got feedback that feedback is not failure. And then I can tweak what's already done and do it again because I'm a real experiential learner. And I don't do well just study, study, study and then perform. A lot of people wait for perfection and those are really excuse makers. So take the action and funnels, click funnels has just made it all possible for us. Like you just have to actually push play. Amazing. So even you would say, even if you're not technically savvy, it would, it would still work for you. Yeah, I am not technically savvy whatsoever. And they, I mean, if you can send an email, if you can work your iPhone, you can do a click funnel. It honestly, all everything is there. You just, you change the copy you with your own words. And then if you have the funnel scripts, they would now write the copy for you in funnel scripts, which I've used as well. So honestly, it's just about you taking the action and doing it. Yeah. That's what I'd suggest. So for anyone who's interested in getting involved in coaching or speaking or doing a big events, what would you say if they were like, do I need just a traditional website? And why would you recommend that I do something like click funnels if I already have a website somewhere else? So I would have them just look at the facts. Is anyone even looking at your website? Probably no one's looking at your website because there's, at least for me, no one's looking at my website. And a lot of people get stuck on their website and they're thinking if they have their website, then they're going to be successful. But the truth is nobody cares about your website. No offense. And that's just a time waster working on your website. So instead work on your click funnel, which could literally happen overnight and then get into action and get the results to serve the people and help the people faster than wasting hours and days. And spending like my first website, I invested 5,000 for it. And I was very proud of it. And I still have it just so I can look at it once in a while and admire it. But the days, the days of the website are definitely gone. Back to when you first got started using online funnels. Do you remember how soon from the creation of that funnel, regardless of which one it was to like making your first sale? Like, do you remember how long it took for you? Yeah, it was. So for me, I put together a talk called how to, what was it called? Speaker way to success, how to attract your first three to five clients of every talk you deliver. And we put it on a click funnel. We send it out to my email community. I made the offer on the, on the, I guess the webinar and two people booked a call the next day and bought and I didn't even have the program at all. So I'm a big fan of building the plane while you fly it. And I think that's a very important skill of every entrepreneur. So I would say as soon as you do it, people love that energy and, and inspiration, especially when you're excited about things. Yeah. So it happened quick. Yeah. I feel like I talk to entrepreneurs all the time that kind of bring up that whole like done is better than perfect or, you know, craft, craft your offer, craft your product to like pre-sell. Like you can still sell it without it being finished and having that kind of pressure of you already have people interested, really helps you build it and develop it and make it better as you go, which I think is really cool. It does. I remember saying to my virtual assistant, I guess I have a job now. And, and I had a bullet point. I knew what I wanted to teach him. It just hadn't been developed. So you don't, I mean, have a, have a, like a bullet point list, but anyway, yes. Okay. And if you're willing to share, would you mind telling us how much you've possibly made using online funnels in your business? Yes. So I've used two different merchant accounts. So in Stripe, it's 400 and I don't remember exactly 436 or 456,002 or something. And then I used another one as well. I can't remember if it was, it was through Intuit QuickBooks because of my old software. Anyway, so that has also generated over 450. So between the two, it's about 850,000. Incredible. Congratulations. Thank you. And now my next goal is to collapse the timeline and to get a two comma club award at the next FHL. Yes. Stand up there with Russell. We're going to see you off the stage. Oh, can't wait. I'll be like, yes, it's already done. It's already in my mind and I already have it. So thank you. I'm so excited. Thank you very much. Awesome. Okay. Well, one last thing, Amanda, tell us where we can learn more about you and your business. So the best way to get in touch with me is I have a masterclass called Speak and Grow Rich Masterclass.
