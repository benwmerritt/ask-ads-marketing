He's now focusing on teaching the Spanish community to learn all about affiliate marketing and all about ClickFunnels. Welcome, André. Thanks for joining me today. Hi, Laura. Thank you so much for having me on the show today. Of course. I'm really looking forward to getting to know more about you. So can you just give me a little bit of a background on who you are, how you got started in this business, and what you're doing now? Yeah, so my name is André Yermiches. I am from Lima, Peru. So I immigrated with my family to the United States when I was 14 years old. You know, not knowing that language, not even speaking a little bit of English. It was tough, you know. So after high school, I just decided to go straight to getting a job, you know, because I wanted to work. I wanted some money. So then I started working in the food industry. So that's basically my background. My background is food industry, restaurant management. So I moved my way up through the ranks, as you can say, in the restaurant. So from there, you know, if anybody over there is working at a food industry, they know how many long hours you have to work and being away from family, just to basically make it, right? Just to get a good check, I guess you can say. But you know, that's not enough. If we were working at a restaurant, you know, getting paid that much. So then that's where I started looking online to see, like, what else can I do, you know, to get more income, you know, get a, instead of getting a second job out there, I decided to just look online. I said, how can I make money online? And that's when I found this great opportunity, which is called affiliate marketing. And then from there, I decided to go all in with affiliate marketing. It actually took me six months to quit my restaurant manager job after I found this online business. So I just take a system those six months. And then after six months, I was like, okay, I'm done with my regular job by regular nine to five. And I went all in with my online business. And since then, I haven't looked back. Wow. So you went from having to be labor-intensive, all of the money that you made on your paycheck was for physical labor, running around restaurants, working in the service industry, which I personally know that it can be very intense, very long hours. Your feet are usually throbbing at the end of the day. To building a successful business where your job, your, your business is working for you. You don't have to be physically labor-intensive the whole time. You created that, that work. Exactly. Yeah. And then the, and the thing about it is I was getting home at two in the morning, you know, and I will at two in the morning from the restaurant, and I would just go on my laptop and start learning how to do funnels, how to send an email to my email campaign. And it was just, that was the only time that I had to work on my business, to work on myself. And I just had to do it at that time because I didn't have any other time. Like I would take a nap, sleep for three hours, and then do the same thing the next day. So tell me a little bit about how you used funnels to start and grow your business as an affiliate marketer. Yeah. So the first thing that I learned about the business was you have to grow your email list. You know, that's the best, the first thing you have to do because once you grow your email list, you can promote anything that you want to promote to your list. Right? So the first thing that I learned about funnels was you need to capture their data. You need to capture that email, email, email address. So that's the first thing I learned to do. I learned to do an Optin funnel with a simple thank you page and a brief space video and literally that's all I did. And I kept the simple throughout my whole business. So even till this day, I used a simple Optin funnel just to catch that email address from the people. So what do you use for your lead magnet? For the lead magnet, I do different things. For example, I can do a ebook before I used to send people to my YouTube channel because I used to have so much information. Now don't look at me on YouTube channel anymore. That channel go destroys. I don't have it anymore. But before I will offer a lot of free trainings through that way. So I will just offer a free training for an email list, you know, your name, your email list. That's all I wanted. And from there, I started growing my email list to like 20,000 people, 50,000 people, 70,000 people. And this is all in English, right? Now, recently, I started teaching people in Spanish all about click funnels, all about how to make an email campaign or everything in Spanish. Do you find more success teaching it in the Spanish language because it's maybe a little less saturated? No, no, it's a little difficult to teach in Spanish right now because they're almost like they're 10 years behind. So for them, it's just so brand new. You know, all of these online businesses, it's really new for them. So right now, I define a gap in the market. So that's why I'm trying to fill it. But at the same time, I'm trying to also educate them at the same time. So it's a little challenging. But I'm here for the challenge, right? Like that's why I started this from the first place. Well, it's probably a good problem to have that they're so new to it. But you are probably going to be positioned as the expert of teaching that in the Spanish market, which I think is really cool. So it's awesome that you have the leg up there. How do you, how else do you use funnels in your business? Is it specifically for lead generation just to build your list or are you using other funnels now that you have a pretty lengthy list? Yeah, it's mostly it's to lead generation to get the email list. But I also done webinars too. So I can also refunnel them through a webinar funnel. And I have a challenge right now as well that I'm doing. It's a five day challenge. So you have to play around with what kind of funnel will work for the offer that you want to accomplish in the, in the, what you're doing it, you know, there. Yeah, my main goal is get those email list, the emails, the email addresses. That's my main goal. Great. And I see that obviously you've won a two comma club award. Can you tell me a little bit about your journey to winning that award? Yeah, so I started a field of marketing in December of 2020, right? So I, it hasn't even been three years. And I just promoted multiple affiliate offers out there. And I was thankful enough to use click funnels for the beginning, right? So that was a platform that I used from the beginning. And since then, I really haven't looked for other platforms or I never had an excuse to look for something else, you know, click funnels provided everything that I needed at that moment. And it works, you know, as soon as your funnel is ready, you can literally make money from it. And then just staying consistent those three years, almost three years. Yep, I was able to win, you know, different awards from different companies. Really cool. Do you have any other goals set for the next five, 10 years for your business? Yeah, so my goal is literally to teach everybody affiliate marketing in Spanish, you know, that's my main goal, you know, because I've done this in English, I've been really successful in English, but I needed a different challenge. So now my new challenge is to probably get a two comma club award with my Spanish business, you know, that would be like my main goal for now at least. Awesome. I'm really inspired by the fact that not only did you was English your second language, you learned affiliate marketing, you did it sounds like it was, you know, the peak of COVID. So there was a pandemic, everything was shut down. That was the time that a lot of people were forced to figure out what they were going to do or they were losing jobs or they were now working remotely. And you took advantage of the situation and you worked extra hours and you put an extra time to create this business for yourself so that you could have the financial freedom that you have today. I think that's really inspiring and that will resonate with a lot of people. I find it fascinating that many of the affiliate marketers that I've spoken with also started at that time and it feels like when you're faced with adversity is when you really start to make really big business decisions on what you want your future to look like. Exactly. I mean, it was a pandemic, right? Like, I was looking for another job during the pandemic, you get me. And at that moment, nobody wanted to work. So there were jobs out there. But my main thing was I didn't want to be away from my family that much, that I was already. So little by little, everything worked out. It happened fast. Six months I quit my job. About my seven months, I made my first six figures online. So things can happen quick, but you have to be willing to learn. Yeah, exactly. What's the biggest piece of advice you'd give to somebody who maybe understands what affiliate marketing is, but they don't know how to get started? Yeah, so the biggest piece of advice is there's many programs out there, you know, just look for whoever the mentor is of those programs and receive that you resonate with that person. Right? Because if you don't resonate with the person that is the face of a program, then that's probably not going to be a good match, a good fit. But if you see somebody that has maybe the same experience that you do, maybe somebody has been working in construction and they created a program, and maybe you are a construction worker, you know, it might resonate a little better to work with that guy than to work with somebody that works in the food industry. You got me? So you have to resonate a little bit with the mentor that you want to join, because every program out there I believe that works. You know, all you have to do is just apply yourself. Yeah, for sure. Do you find that having personal relationships with people or meeting them in person is easier for you to sell your training? Or do you get a lot of that just from your lead gen and some follow-up sequences? Like how do people get to know more about you? Yeah, the best thing about this business is that you don't actually have to know anybody. You can literally sell anything to anybody online, especially if you're creating content. You're using social media, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok. So that's one of the biggest fears that people have, right? Oh, do I have to sell to my friends, to my family? And the answer is no. You know, you can literally create content and reach millions of people in one night. And all those people just become leads. And then you talk to them, you have a conversation through DMs, or you want to do calls with them, you can also do that. And literally you can sell to somebody that you don't even know. Yeah, well, I'm sure that inspires and motivates and encourages a lot of people to look into this business a little bit more so that they can set up something, even if it's just a side hustle or something that just gives them a little bit of extra passive income on the side of what they're doing. I think that's really cool that you're able to teach these things and you are living proof that, you know, putting in the extra hours really does make an impact.
