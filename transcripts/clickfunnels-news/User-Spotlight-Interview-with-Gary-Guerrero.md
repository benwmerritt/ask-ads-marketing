He boasts 1.4 million readers, 200,000 plus product sales in multiple seven and eight figure businesses earning the prestigious awards like the 2, Club X, Entrepreneur of the Year as a golf industry influencer and paid media marketing expert. His strategies achieve remarkable success and I'm so excited to have this conversation with him today. So thanks so much for joining me, Gary. Thank you so much. I appreciate being here. Yeah. So I know just doing my research and learning about the things that you spoke about when you got your Bootstrapped Award. I know that there's a lot of things in your life going on and you achieved so much success using ClickFunnels in such a short amount of time. Can you give us like a little bit of your backstory and what brought you here today? Absolutely. I just want to show you this trophy real quick. This thing is so heavy. Look at this thing. It's so nice. Hard work and dedication. That is what it takes. Massive effort. I'm going to set this over here now. Yeah, it does look very heavy. I mean, my story is very similar to a lot of marketers. I started building my own sales funnels in the early 2010, 11, 12 era before ClickFunnels was getting started. And I remember we would, I mean, it's, I, it's, it, I'm sorry. It's the exact story that Russell talks about in his own experience. We were building sales pages and we had web developers and graphic designers and coders and you had to have copywriters and graphic designers and a huge team. And it would literally take months to get anything off the floor. And, you know, we ran with funnels like that for a good part of five years. And I tried ClickFunnels early on and honestly, it wasn't as advanced for our business. We couldn't customize things early on, but I kept watching it. And after a few years, I believe in 2018 is when we got our first account with ClickFunnels. And that year, we won the 2, a club award with scratch golf. And we've won awards every single year. But what ClickFunnels has really enabled us to do is streamline the process from conception to market within days. Literally, I can put one day into a campaign and, you know, I've been doing this a long time. So I can get in and I can build funnels and lead pages. And with the help of AI, are you kidding me? Now I got a copywriter writing for me. I have a literal robot that does so much work for me. And it's been super easy in the tools now like ClickFunnels and, you know, other tools. These are what we need to streamline and make the things in our business flow better and go faster. And when we're able to do that, we're able to move faster and scale harder. And that brings in more income. Very cool. You talked about all of the tech stuff and the developers and all that went into that. What was it like when you finally realized that ClickFunnels was going to work well for your business? Like, did it save you just so many resources as well as time? Yeah, it took us about two months to hand build all of our past funnels that we were running on HTML web servers. I think at that time I was still using AWwebber and we had to have all these things tied together. And when I first signed up and I got in and realized that the interface was very customizable, we could literally design our sales funnels on Photoshop. The whole design on Photoshop that's how we did it for years. We still do it that way. We would give that over to the web coder. He would cut it all out, you know, and turn it into a web page. Well, now it's the way the editor was. I could go in and, you know, I'm not a developer. I'm a marketer, but I'm smart enough to be able to get in and understand how a simple system like ClickFunnels works. And when you understand it and it doesn't take very long to figure it out, it was a little intimidating when you first get in, like anything. But within a few hours, I was understanding how to build elements and modules and pages. And I've built today 900 pages inside ClickFunnels. Wow. 100 funnels, probably, you know, 100 to 150 different funnels. I mean, lead funnels, sales funnels, application funnels, you name it. ClickFunnels is the backbone of my business. And it has been the number one thing to help my business scaling grow. And everyone around me, I introduce this to as many people as I can. I help, you know, people understand how easy it is to add it to their business because even brick and mortar companies can use ClickFunnels for lead gen at the very least. Yeah. A company, anybody can use ClickFunnels to generate more leads and sales to your business. Exactly. Build a following, build a rapport with an audience locally or nationally or internationally. ClickFunnels makes this all possible. And it's easy to do. That's what I love. That's incredible. Such a big statement. I love that. And I think it's funny, you mentioned, I'm not a developer, I'm a marketer, which is probably so relatable to so many people who are using the software. I mean, the reason so many people sign up is because it's pretty easy to get started with your business and start lead gen or just create that first capture page or whatever it is. ClickFunnels exists solely because Russell Brunson needed the solution to the problem he was having, which was how can I easily do all of this stuff without having the developers, which is, it makes it such a great tool for people like you who are just really incredible experienced marketers that need this tool to accelerate their business. Absolutely. And just to piggyback off what you said, for the newcomer or the person that may be intimidated with software or tools like this, ClickFunnels makes it easy because they have all those templates. You don't literally have to do any designing. You go in and you pick a design and you kind of start mapping it together. You push a button and then, literally minute, you have a webpage that you can start making money from or creating leads from. So it's amazing. Love it. It's fun too. Okay. So I want to ask some more questions about Legshot. I know that you're wearing the hat. I got to learn a little bit about it with the Bootstrapped Award. So can you tell me a little bit about what you're doing in that business and the success that you've seen from using ClickFunnels and its e-commerce so maybe people aren't as familiar how you can use ClickFunnels for something like Legshot. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, absolutely. So we use ClickFunnels and Shopify in our e-commerce business. I use ClickFunnels on my top of funnel or my front end for every single person, definitely that we advertise to. Any advertising scent, we always send people to ClickFunnels first and the reason is Longform still is the best form of converting a cold visitor into a warm, hot buyer. And they do that through the journey down the Longform sales page. So whenever we're advertising for a Legshot, we may offer free courses or free trainings on how to stop slicing or stop incorrect hits of the ball. And that ends up driving them to a Longform, either an email opt-in form and then we would follow up through the traditional email marketing methods or we'll send them directly to our Longform sales letter. The one that won us the $10 million award, we still use that. And the reason why is, as they go down the page, they're able to build more value. In their mind, they see things and they're building value and you just can't get that with the traditional Shopify type shopping experience stores. Most people, they land on the homepage and if there's a shop button, that's the first thing they click. They see what the prices are and they make a judgment call right then if they want that product or not without really investigating if this thing is going to benefit them. And so what ClickFunnels allows us to do is we don't allow them to see a shopping page or an order form until they read our content. We've tested putting buttons at the top under videos or at the bottom and with this particular e-commerce product, we really have to educate our audience. It's not just a quick purchase. It's a $120 commitment and most golfers look at that and they need to kind of research it and think about it. And so having the ClickFunnels as my front end, they're able to build the value as they go down the story. So we have a story and we have a persona and we talk about a golfer that has problems and we have the person that's reading identify with that and if they do, then they continue down the page and it builds value. By the time they get to the bottom, they realize it's $120. We've put $1,000 worth of value in their head and it makes it an easy sell. And then from there, we have an amazing upsell process. The lag shot funnel is four steps. That's it. Sales page, order form, upsell, one, and a confirmation page. That's it. And we've done about $13 million through those four steps at ClickFunnels. And the reason why is the copy converts. It works well. It paints the right story with the right person. And our upsell process is amazing. We offer a whole club for free just for trying our drivers. So you get two clubs for the price of one. When I was constructing this offer, I wanted to create the most out of this world offer, mind-blowing offer that people wouldn't believe. And so I decided to give them a whole golf club. We give $120 wedge. It's a real golf club for free just for trying the driver. That page converts it 25%. This has allowed us to have an average order value of $160. My closest competitor doesn't have an upsell back in. The most he can make is, say, $120. The most he can spend to double his money is $60. We can spend $80. I'll always win. He who can spend the most in ads will always win. And that's why lag shot has been such a dominating factor. Now, actually, our average order value is all the way up to $190. $191. We just checked it the other day. We're continuously adding new things, new products, new upsells, new add-ons, new bells and whistles. And it's amazing. But ClickFunnels gives the viewer the opportunity to really identify themselves with the story. And that is the easiest way to convert somebody to a buyer. I also love that you didn't just turn your shoulder to ClickFunnels because ClickFunnels doesn't service exactly what your needs are for e-commerce. But you made it work by utilizing that at the top of your funnel and integrated everything else with Shopify and anything else that you needed to still make it successful, make it convert, and help your business grow. And I think that that's maybe one thing that a lot of users or customers or even people who aren't as familiar with don't necessarily know yet is that there are multiple different ways to still use ClickFunnels, even if you're running a different type of business, but you can use it for the top of the funnel. And I think that that's so effective. And you've proven in multiple businesses and very quickly just how effective that is. And congratulations on all of the awards, by the way. It's just very impressive. Thank you. If you don't mind, I'd like to stay there just for one more minute because I think this can really help people that are in e-commerce. The traditional e-commerce marketer doesn't realize that we can use ClickFunnels to our benefit. The average e-commerce marketer is caught up in the shopping cart type websites and they have good sales, they may have great sales, but they're never really testing other options. They just continue to optimize that Shopify website and they may get their numbers to a certain point. Now that's just a bit of information. Now I want to backtrack a little bit. After we won the award in August, we launched Shopify. And what happened literally almost destroyed my e-commerce business overnight. When I moved from ClickFunnels to Shopify, my conversion rate was hovering around a lifetime rate of around 2% at ClickFunnels. That's amazing. That's great. We've spent $3-4 million on advertising in a year, made $10 million. I mean, it was amazing. The conversion rate was great. So I thought once we move over to Shopify, we were going to have similar experience, right? Absolutely not. At that time, we were doing a million dollars in sales a month and I was spending anywhere from $400,000 to $500,000 to sustain that kind of volume. Really, when we moved over to Shopify, our conversion rates dropped from 2% to 0.75. Now think of this. I was still having the bills coming in at $400,000, but we went from a million to $300,000 for two months and the bills piled up and I freaked out. I really didn't know what to do. We had committed so much time and effort in development in the move into Shopify so that we could have multiple filmet centers around the world tied into each Shopify store that we were well invested. We had to figure out how to make this work. Being a data-driven marketer, thankfully, I looked at the data. I said, what is the difference between what we were doing for a year, crushed it, got awards for it, so now we're not even converting it at 1%. It's the same page. It's the same product. It wasn't the same page. It was the same copy, the same stuff. We had brought over some elements to build the Shopify store, but what the key element was, and this is the biggest caveat to this whole thing, why every e-commerce marketer should use ClickFunnels. When I looked at the data for the past year, I noticed that one minute and 51 seconds was spent on, like, ClickFunnels long-form sales page to sell the lag shot. I looked at how we had been doing. We did several hundred thousands of sales. I had a lot of volume to look at, but the key metric I saw was 50 seconds of time spent on the home page, and it clicked. I said, aha, I had an aha moment, tears, everything running down. I just do in laps. We were using whiteboard, and I said, guys, this is it. ClickFunnels allows the prospect to spend more time on the page to learn about your product, to become more knowledgeable about your product, to really learn what you have to offer instead of just clicking and seeing what the price is and leaving. Now they're actually sucked into the copy, to the emotion, to the storytelling, and then by the time they get down, it converted it 2%. Not only that, Laura, this is even bigger for e-commerce marketers. When somebody spends a minute and 51 seconds on a home page or on their initial offer, and this is why in the beginning I said I always send paid media to ClickFunnels. It's because I want them to spend more time understanding and learning my product, so that guess what? When I remarket to them on Facebook the next time they're on, I send them, guess where? Not to ClickFunnels. They've already learned about it. Most people that come back for a second time, they don't want to keep scrolling. They want to get to the buying experience. So our retargeting is with the standard e-commerce shoppifying setting. We still use ClickFunnels in middle and sometimes even bottom, but if you've never googled Lad Shot and you go to Lad Shot, you click on it, it's a ClickFunnels page. If you go and click on it again, do the same search, you're going to land on the Shopify store. That strategically was done so that we can educate our prospects on the front end with ClickFunnels, hopefully make sales. Then when we remarket to them, they go, oh yeah, I remember that thing. I learned about it. I saw that testimonial or I learned about whatever that was on the ClickFunnels page. This is how you're going to close more sales on the back end of e-commerce. Then you can use ClickFunnels type funnel structures inside of Shopify, which I've taken to the next level. I've built ClickFunnels inside Shopify. So cool. What a great lesson in top of the funnel and that it applies really across the board of all types of businesses. Anybody can use that strategy in their business, even if they're working with other platforms or integrating different software, that this framework that you use can be duplicated and really just used anywhere. It's very cool. Not only my framework, but the framework that ClickFunnels gives you is so powerful that anybody can just literally plug in and use the lead forms and start collecting leads in a matter of 30 minutes. It's great. Super cool. Okay. I got a couple other things I want to ask you before we wrap this. One of them is you mentioned a challenge. Can you talk a little bit about what you have coming up? Absolutely. I have been working for a year and a half to figure out how an influencer can really monetize social media. At LagShot, we have almost 1200 ambassadors. I've never seen affiliate marketing from that side of the business. I've always known that people catch the shiny object syndrome. They have lives going on and a small percentage of a brand ambassador team actually makes the sales. When we launched LagShot, I followed the exact strategies that Russell lays out, so eloquently in the Traffic Strategies book, the Dream 100. What we did is we went out and I found every single ambassador in Gaul, whether they were a professional or a high-end coach or an influencer, I invited them to the team. When we launched, we had around 200 ambassadors and 75 of them made sales. What happened is it slowly declined and we had to keep bringing in more ambassadors. Over the past year, I've learned, or I'm sorry, this was last year when I was really building that, I learned looking at the data, why can't more people make sales? When they came in, they were super excited about the opportunity. I went out and I built marketing programs, I built business cards, QR codes, I built strategies and marketing strategies and things that they can use in the green grass level, like at the professional golfer level to grow their LagShot affiliate business. What we learned is not too many people were making sales. This last year, I sought out and I went on TikTok and I created an account. I thought it was for kids. This was last February. Within 30 days, I had 10,000 followers and I had went viral multiple times. Being a traditional paid media marketer, never really been interested in social media because I always felt it's like watching paint dry. It just takes too long to do the organic stuff. Now with the platforms, the way they are with the real, it allows us to grow extremely fast. I started getting traction fast. In five months, I gained 50,000 followers on TikTok. Then I started moving over to Facebook. I've done over 100 million views on Facebook, made a lot of money on all these platforms. The biggest one is Instagram. I'm verified on Instagram. We have over 220,000 followers now. I have a huge following of eager people that are just super excited. I help all these people grow their own social media. What I've been doing over the past four months is writing a course out, literally a blueprint from start to finish on how anybody in any niche can pick a niche and also learn how to monetize on all the social media platforms. I'm teaching them video marketing strategies, how to video, what cameras to use, what settings to use on your camera, how to collaborate, how to network, what affiliate offers to use, how to pick them. Literally every single thing that an influencer would want from the very beginning to the very end. I sat down and I mapped it out. I framed it out. Her Russell's instructions, I've read all the books, went through all his courses, and I mapped it out perfectly, I think. Next week, I don't know when this is going to air, but August 9th, we're launching the 14-day influencer challenge. This is going to be a life changer for so many people. I'm super excited. We have a private coaching group that we're going to have. We have additional upgrades that they can add. We have a 70-minute YouTube blueprint foundational course. Again, I've acquired 500,000 subscribers on YouTube and we've done well over $10 million in sales through our various businesses from that 500,000 subscriber channel. I'm going to be teaching them that and content scheduling. Literally, I'm taking you by the hand and I'm going to show you everything that you're going to need from start to finish on how to be an influencer and monetize your following. I'm going to show you how to earn your first sale or double whatever they're currently doing in 14 days or less. That's my guarantee. Wow. That's exciting. I think you just sold me. Very cool. Awesome. I'll make sure that we also include that link in the description below for anybody who's interested because I think there's going to be a lot of value in that. Really exciting that as an experienced marketer in all of the things that you've learned and the knowledge that you've gained along the way with your business and the success you've seen, that you're now taking this framework that's worked so well for you personally so that other people can do it as well. It's very cool. You know what's really cool about the challenge? I'm integrating click funnels into the opportunity for everybody that takes the challenge. Obviously, I'm a click funnels guy and my goal is to show people how they can use click funnels in their business to grow their influencer business and also their affiliate business. So that's exciting. If you're going to talk the talk, you're walking the walk too. That's great. You're practicing what you preach and I think that sets a great example and a precedent for anybody who is learning from you that you are applying all of those things to everything that you're doing as well. So this has been so exciting and Gary, I'm going to want to chat a lot more and hopefully we'll have a follow-up one or maybe we'll have you out on the click funnels radio podcast, which I think would be really exciting. Where can people go to learn more about you and your business? Please follow me on Instagram, the golf entrepreneur, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Gary Guerrero Jr. Please follow me. If you need any help, any advice, I'm here to help. Thanks. Awesome. Thanks Gary. And anything else you want to say before we wrap? Click funnels has changed my life and it will definitely change yours. Don't get intimidated by software. It's the easiest piece of software you'll ever use and it will definitely change your business overnight like it has ours. Wow. Thanks so much Gary. It was great to get to know more about you and I hope to see you at Funnel Hacking Live in a couple of months. I'll be there. I wouldn't miss it. Awesome. Thanks so much. Cheers.
