## Transcript
Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels and today I'm joined by James Perrin. James is a certified funnel builder, owner of Coda Web Solutions, and he's known as the Lynchpin Funnel Guy. Welcome James, thanks so much for being my guest today. Thank you so much for having me. I'm super honored to be here. I'm excited to learn more about you. So can you start off by telling us a little bit about your background and what brought you to the ClickFunnels community? Absolutely. So my background is actually in software development on the website. So I've done full stack development for a long time over 20 years. And basically, so my wife, she's a world-class coach. She coached for Tony Robbins for a number of years, coaching his platinum clients. And when she decided to go off on her own, I was like, okay, well, I'm the web guy. Let me build a U.S. site. And so I built her a WordPress site because that's what I thought she was supposed to do. And learning about marketing, learning about what you actually need to do to build trust with your audience, the whole no-liking trust loop, learning about all that stuff. I just fell into two dot com secrets in Russell Brunson's world. And from there, it just kind of like spiled. I bought the first book, then I bought the second book, then I bought the third book, and I realized I should have bought the trilogy so I could have that first book, but I never got that. And then we saw the virtual event last year about a year ago, and I was like, oh, I think these are my people. And I didn't want to spend the money on it, but my wife, Al, and she's like, just do it, do it, we'll go all in. So we went all in with 2CCX. And was doing that for a while. So I was helping, I was building up her funnels, learning about the full suite of things that we needed to do, getting awesome coaching from everyone, from Vince and the crew there. And then at FHL last year, which was my first FHL, because again, I'm new to the community, I was, you know, everyone was rocking and rolling. And then we got to the 2.0 talk. And there was like amazing stuff happening and like so many cool features. But I was like noticing the people that are around me, they're kind of like, and I was like, are you not getting this? Or are you nervous? I was thinking like, I think people don't, don't really understand how valuable this stuff is, but B might be a little bit nervous about getting this stuff to the new platform. So I was like, okay, I think this is my opportunity. Funnel Builders is now in 2CCX. I'm going to take advantage of that, right? All these people are like attractive character type people that are like doing their thing and selling stuff and helping people out. Whereas I am like, you know, I've run entire software development departments before and support departments. And, you know, my last job was director of creative, creative technology. So I've been helping people with technology, especially on the internet for a long time. So I was like, okay, all the pieces are lining, even though this isn't what I thought I was going to be doing. I'm going to go full time as a funnel builder and help all these people, you know, navigate technology and make their lives easier. So that's what I've been doing since last year, late last year. Amazing. Yeah. And there's certainly a lot of people in our community and in our ecosystem that are high eyes on the disc and I'm high C 100%. Actually, my disc reported right there. So that's funny. I was going to ask you because a lot of these people are attractive characters. They have their own businesses or they want to start their own internet marketing business and they need people like you. Like, there's more of them probably than there are people like you who are an expert funnel builder who they need to do all of the backend stuff. Like they can be the face and they can talk about this stuff all day, but they don't want to do the technical stuff. Absolutely. And they can change the copy on the page, but getting that page there to have all the right structure and make sure it looks good on mobile and make sure it loads quickly and make sure it links to all the different integration points, you know, to all that stuff, make sure that the Google analytics is on there and the pixels and all that stuff. Like that to me, like that's just like what I do, especially as a high C. So I'm like a high C, high D. And that allows me to, you know, know what it takes to get the job done, get it done. But also I say another strength to just being able to talk to people about this stuff. Like, you know, one of my my first jobs was doing tech for a call center. And I would like go fix people's computers basically, but I'd have a conversation with them too at the same time. I've always loved that like ability to talk to people and speak not in like geek terms, but in like regular human terms. That's things that I bring to this world. That's amazing. So how long have you been working as a funnel builder and taking clients of your own? Literally since October of last year, I was in the FHL group, and then the whole your first funnel challenge group, and people were like, Hey, who's good at this? I'm like me, I'm good at this, I'm doing this. And, you know, I do pick up things fast, but everyone was new to 2.0. So it was a, you know, quick, quick out the gate to learn as much as I could, but had been serving clients ever, ever since. And I think one of the coolest experiences that I had was there was a speaker at the FHL last year who just randomly went into the ClickFunnels group and said like, I need someone who's an expert in 2.0. And I'm like, no one's an expert in 2.0, except for Todd, but I'll help you out, dude. And that worked out really well. Awesome. So what if you have one, would you say is your favorite type of funnel to build? Oh, man. I have challenge funnels I've done the most, and they're kind of, there's like, it's like a 20 legged spider. There's so many things to keep track of and everything, but I don't know, then so many of those, I have to say that's probably my favorite. That and like, just lead squeeze funnels, because everyone needs a lead funnel, and they are pretty quick to get up and running. And it's often my first entry point when I'm talking to someone and working with someone, it's like, okay, let's build a lead funnel. So you get to know how I work, I get to know how you work, and then usually we'll build a rest of them after that. So there's something special about that one for sure. Yeah, I think anybody can use a lead funnel, even if they don't even realize they have a business idea yet, like just to start generating leads from a simple lead magnet is like so cool when you think about giving and generating ideas for other people who maybe don't know their full business idea yet, but being able to get the leads and kind of building it as they go. And I think that that's the power in lead funnels. I really think anybody can have one. For sure. Like literally, I just recorded a summit interview yesterday for, it's a company who is somehow manages influencers and has a whole like collection of influencers. And I gave a talk on lead funnels to sort of like talk about the value of a bridge page of these influencers are big into the affiliate world. So instead of just sending someone to that affiliate link, send them to your page, capture their information, build your list, segment it so that you have, when you have future offers coming up, you'll be able to send email to that list that you own instead of worrying about if Instagram is going to shut you down or not. Yeah, totally. So how would you say working in software before this has kind of helped you as like, maybe it's an extra tool in your toolbox or it's your superpower? What would you say is like the greatest thing about having history as a software developer with using click funnels and building funnels for others? There's a couple of things. So I've used this metaphor before where like, when you're writing code, it's kind of like intricate like scalpel, like precise work, but working in a WYSIWYG editor, it's like, it's like, instead of programming with Legos, you're programming with Duplo Box, right? It's like you have these bigger pieces that you're moving and that's not a knock on it. It means you can go faster, right? So being able to do everything on at the low level and understanding HTML really, really well, understanding HTTP really, really well. I really appreciate the ability to have so much of that stuff done for you. So you don't have to write everything from scratch every single time. But I say like the programming background enables me to, when I do need to make a tweak to go in there and just figure that out, there's a couple of things, you know, there's just things that aren't built in elements in click funnels classic or 2.0. It's like, okay, I want a photo slider or I want this, you know, and to be able to meet the client's demands, you got to know how to bring that to the funnel. So the ability to generate that stuff is really cool. I did one the other day for another 2CCX member for his membership site where he does stuff with diving safety. And he's so it's really important that people like read the content, take this quiz and it's we needed to gate the content so you couldn't go to the next module of his membership until you pass this quiz. I was able to find some code and tweak it and make it so it programmatically click the button. You know, just customizing things like that so it really helps the users get what they want. Yeah, that's fascinating and helpful, I'm sure to our users, especially because a lot of them come to click funnels because, you know, drag and drop editor and it's easier to use, but to have those into more intricate things that they need to be doing to have somebody who has a background like you, I'm sure is amazing. So you've been working in exclusively in 2.0, right? It's a mixture of both. I work with clients that have a whole history of stuff and some of my work has been pointing it over to 2.0. Some of my work has been new 2.0 stuff and some of it's been new classic stuff. So I'm really in both worlds simultaneously. So if you could compare the two, what would you say is the most powerful feature available in 2.0 for you right now? I get asked this question a bunch and it's always the style guide. The ability, it's like so ridiculous to be able to be like every headline, I mean the headlines, the body text, the colors, the buttons, the shadows, the borders, the corners, define all that stuff once and have it be ubiquitously just deployed everywhere that uses that style. It's just ridiculous. And then to tweak it on the fly, I'd be like, oh, actually I want the line height to be a little bit more here and then poof, it's everywhere. Yeah. That's like hours of the week saved compared to classic for sure. Really, yeah, I have a lot of fun just playing around with it and I don't even necessarily set anything live, but the style guide, there's just so many different things you can play with. It's fun. I have a lot of fun doing it. It is and it's the kind of thing where when I take a new client on board, it's like the thing that brings their vision to life because they usually have like a brand book or a style guide that they made in Canberra or something. You know, so to be able to take that and then apply it to the 2.0 style guide and then just see even like a default template, but just in their font and colors, it's kind of magical. Yeah. So do you have clients of all kinds, all different industries? Are most of them in the expert coaching industry? Do you have any e-commerce? Tell us a little bit about the variety of clients you've worked with. Okay. Yeah. A lot of coaches for sure. One of my first clients was this pair of sisters who are just amazing people who are in the women's health space. And because they did a great job with a pressure launch, we were able to get like 30k in two weeks with like a $47 e-book. So that was pretty amazing. But yeah, coaches for sure. I have a lot of clients that are in the Two Comic Club X coaching program. A couple of them are doctors. One's a pharmacist. It's really a wide range of stuff. It's some gym owners. And you know, it's anyone. The commonality that we have is we want to be online, connecting with people across the internet, adding value and helping them get from here to here. So that's the common thread. Yeah. So would you say you have a specialty in terms of what types of clients you serve? Or would you say your specialty now is creating the Ledgepin funnel? Well, Ledgepin funnel is definitely my focus. This is my first time being an entrepreneur. I've always worked job inspired of this. So when I first got into this school, I was like, anyone, anyone, I'll take anyone. But I've passed a point now where I'm very, very busy, solidly booked, which is a blessing. So now it's like, I hear from people like Stephanie Dough Blake, where it's like, focus on a specific niche and just serve people there. And nothing really jumped out at me. I was going to do just coaches, but even that's so wide ranging. So seeing where Russell is taking the entire community towards Ledgepin and Ledgepin is the way and we all have it tattooed on our body somewhere and like, we all drink the Kool-Aid. I was like, okay, that's the opportunity because then it's only like a handful of funnels, right? It's like a video sell letter funnel webinar challenge. You need lead funnel for everything for sure. And then, I mean, that's pretty much it application. If you're going to be doing some high ticket stuff and then building membership sites, you know, so it's like, I don't have to worry about product launch summits. Like all there's like all the other ones, right? So this was a way for me to narrow it down, but still be broad enough and also be on that wave that is, I still think is still still rising. I think at FHL this year, it's going to be a huge like, Ledgepin. Totally. So you are in 2CCX, your inner circle, you're drinking the Kool-Aid, your big part of our community. You know more about Ledgepin funnels than most people do in the ClickFunnels ecosystem right now. So what was it like for you when Russell taught about the Ledgepin model and give us a little bit of a preview of like what it means for your business and helping build funnels? Well, initially, it like, again, I heard about it at FHL. Well, there was a little 2CCX thing just before I paid Shell, but I heard about it and I wasn't really my own business owner. Like Alma and I had a business, but I was mainly like her behind the scenes guy. So I didn't really get it until about a month ago and I was thinking about my own, like I'm always getting, you know, every month I start from zero, right? And in Ledgepin, that's the remedy to that problem because, you know, Russell heard from someone else that if you don't have continuity, you don't have a business. So with Ledgepin, the whole thing is you are delivering value every single month and you're getting that revenue every single month and that changes your mindset. And we heard from so many people at Mastermind and Paradise like Pedro Adeo and others where they're like, dude, it changes the game because you're more strategic. You're not on your heels. You're not like reactive. You're just having, you're thinking about how to serve your audience at a higher level and I love that so much. So that's going to be my thing for that sort of made an end of this year is providing an ability for people to build their own Ledgepin funnels the way that I do them through a training course that I'm going to be providing to everyone. Wow, that's really cool. Exciting stuff. So tell us where we can learn more about you and your business and for anyone out there who is looking for somebody to help them with their funnel, where can they get ahold of you or learn more about you? Well, I'm in the funnel builder marketplace. You can always go to ledgepinfunnels.com. If you aren't particularly into Ledgepin funnels and want to work with me anyway, go to websolutions.com is where you can find me. But I'd say come hang out with me in the ClickFunnels official group on Facebook because I'm in there every day, giving love, high fives, helping people out, joking around, causing a scene. That's really where I love to be to have fun with the community for sure. Awesome. And we really appreciate you adding the value in there. It's great to see recognizable names that are helping our customers and our community just as much as our ClickFunnels employees are. So we appreciate that. If you could give one piece of advice for somebody who is maybe just learning about ClickFunnels or our coaching programs or Russell Brunson in general and his methods. What would you say if they're just like you before this becoming an entrepreneur, want to make the leap of working for themselves? What would you tell them? Do what Russell says. Love it. Hashtag do what Russell says. I mean, it's super cliche. But I trust that dude. And I feel like everyone who, it's more belief than coming from a programmer's background. I'm like, you know, very data analytical, kind of skeptical at times. And so it took me a while to get to that point. But now I'm just like, faith over fear, 100%. Let's go. I'll figure out a way. Here's where I'm going. I'm freaking out. Oh, that's okay. We're going to get there anyway. And then just going ahead and actually doing it. I think the biggest thing that helped me though was truly like burning all my bridges to like all the consulting stuff that I was doing for previous companies. I was like, okay, I'm done handing this off, done handing this off. And that unlocked a new set of resources for me to achieve my goals, especially in the initial months. So that's my that's my advice. That's great advice. I've heard a few people now talk about burning bridges in order for them to not look back and go all in. And I think that says a lot about anyone who's in this program and who's doing two comic club coaching is there is such a strong belief and there is so much faith over fear because you're investing so much in yourself because you're truly believed that you're going to make a difference and you are and you're going to be impacting so many other people and helping their businesses grow. And I'm really excited to see how your business grows. And I look forward to seeing you at Funnel Hacking Live this year. Totally. Yeah, it'll be great to meet in person. Great. Thanks so much, James, for being with me today. And I look forward to seeing you soon. Cool. Bye. Thanks.
