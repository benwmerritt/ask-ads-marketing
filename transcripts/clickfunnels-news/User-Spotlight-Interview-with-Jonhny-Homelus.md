Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels. And today I'm joined by Johnny Pomulus. Johnny is a business coach and his goal is to build a large community of people who will win the coveted ClickFunnels 2, comma award as a result of their positive impact in other people's lives. Such a great story. And I know Johnny, I saw your entry for the funnel hacking live ticket giveaway and I was blown away by your compassion and what you were willing to share with us. So I'm excited to have you on today. Thanks for joining me. Yes, it's a pleasure. Thanks for connecting with me. And I was also very excited to be at Funnel Hacking Live and I've met you. So really excited for this interview. Yes, love that. So tell me a little bit about your background and how you got started in business. Yeah, in business it's a long story, but let me make it short. I remember I was 16. I was living in Haiti. And my parents at the time, they used to take me to church. And then I remember I had my first job at 16. On this first job, my boss actually at the time take me to a meeting. It was a network marketing meeting, but it was very bizarre for me because when I went into this meeting, I was looking at people clapping for other people talking. And then I was not used to this environment. And from this experience, I went into a network marketing trainings and into other activities for business. So it's really amazing. This is how I started. And then this take me to a lot of other experience as opening my business and then made a lot of good and bad experiences. And it was really amazing. And to this day, I'm really, I still continue to live really great experience in business. So this is how I started in business. And how did you get to know Russell in the ClickFunnels community? What brought you here? Okay, that's a great question. So it was in 2017. And I was into a lot of personal problems like death in my family. I was into dig voice. And I was in that situation. It's a prime minister of England who said, if you're going to hell, keep moving. Okay? I started connecting with more information. I started getting more into self-development like going to trainings. I was into network marketing, but I went zipper. I remember to this day, I was looking at the interview with Russell and Grant Cardone. And then I discovered Russell. It was really amazing. And two years after I went and I take the one funnel away. Okay? And it was amazing because at this time, one year before I started doing interviews following Russell advices about taking your message to the world. So I started doing interviews. I made over 165 interviews. And after doing all those interviews live on Facebook with people, I went to a place where a lot of people was telling me, why don't you be a radio? Why don't you start doing a big show? Ask for money, take sponsorship. And I was telling myself, listen, I'm going to share with people how they can go their business. So I was not comfortable to take other people money. So like just giving me money as sponsorship. So I wanted to build a business and make money from that business. So I can share with people and tell them, this is how I did. And so you can do it the same way. And then I remember Russell sharing a message, very, very important message. And this message is also in Express Secrets book. And you was telling, if you have a message, you need to share it. And I remember the ClickFunnels item, we said, what Russell said, we are fun and hackers. We don't take money from other people. So we build businesses and we make money, we make profit. So- Yeah, we bootstrap without- Yeah, bootstrap. But you're capitalists. Exactly, exactly. So in 2019, I started my coaching business. So it was really amazing to connect with Russell and to get inspired. Fast forward, I made a lot of experiences. I started wanting to coach everybody in the world, okay, everybody at the time I was in 80. It was a great experience. And to this day, I discovered a lot of keywords that I was doing. And it's by connecting with ClickFunnels community that I discovered how to stop doing those mistakes. And today, I'm into helping other coaches and people doing trainings, or they can make their offers, they can build their heights, get offered, their premium value offers. So it's really amazing that I have the opportunity to connect with Russell and with the ClickFunnels community. It was really, really amazing. Very cool. And obviously with all of these videos, you're kind of a content creator by nature. Like you- Yes. Putting out content. And your question kind of became, how can I monetize this? How can I turn this into a business while serving others? So can you tell me a little bit about what your, when you joined the One Funnel Away Challenge, what that looked like for you, what your funnel was and how you served your community? Yes, my funnel was actually, it was the way that I start with ClickFunnels, it's not common. Okay. I was doing interviews and had to close, all these interviews had to do an event. And I remember when I connect with Russell, he was telling about funnels. So a funnel, it's a kind of website. So when the person gets into that website, you cannot go here or there. So it's a very simple steps that he or she has to follow. And now I remember after those interviews, I went and I create my ClickFunnels account. And then I start with ClickFunnels, then I stopped because I was telling myself, nice seminar, it's a lot. So I didn't understand how can I build a business and find clients and work that business and make money. After taking that ClickFunnels account, I made a funnel, okay, a kind of event funnel for my interviews, all the people that was in the interview with me. So they can be invited. So I would invite them to come to the event. I was doing a physical event. So that was my first funnel. It was an event funnel. So after doing the event in 2018, so I went on 2019 and I take the one funnel away challenge. So I discovered a lot of things, a lot of mistakes that I was doing. And then I remember to this day, the one funnel away was like my best $100 investment. Okay, so it was amazing. And I connect with a lot of people. So I connect much more with Wastl and ClickFunnels community. So it was amazing. It was really, really amazing. Very cool. And how would you say ClickFunnels specifically as a software has helped you with your business? There's a lot of things I've discovered with ClickFunnels. I would start with training side of the software, like ClickFunnels, there's a lot of software outside, there are a lot of companies outside. But in ClickFunnels community, it's like you have not only the software, but you have the trainings. And also you have the community. So you have the software, which is amazing. You have the trainings, who's taking you step by step, or you can do that, or you can do that, in very smart way. So the way that Wastl and other people in ClickFunnels community, they do trainings. And I was very inspired by that also. And also you have the community. You see, maybe you're trying to do something and there's other people who has already done it. So you connect with those people. So with ClickFunnels, it's a package. It's really amazing. You find all those things in one company, one community. So it's really amazing. That's cool. We get a lot of people that say, the software is great because it's simplified and there's all in one. There's so many features that you can use with it. But most of the people say, the software is what gets them here, but it's the community and the education that gets them to stay, which I think is kind of unparalleled. In this industry, I do feel like ClickFunnels really has it all when it comes to the support, the education, and what far outweighs all of that is the community of people who are willing to rally and help one another and provide value inside of our groups. It's really cool to see. Definitely. Definitely. The value that it's amazing. It's really, really amazing. Very cool. And I would love to know, because it sounds like you've kind of dabbled in a little bit of everything and you're very community focused. What would you say is like your most successful funnel or what is the most effective for you? Or what kind of path are you going down right now in terms of funnels? Okay, in terms of funnel, actually my most successful funnel, it's a challenge funnel. And I remember when I started doing challenges, I was inspired by the one funnel away challenge. And one month after taking the challenge, I start my own challenge in 2019. And I made a lot of mistakes, but I stay connected with the community and I discovered all I can take my message to the people who are really looking for me. So my most successful funnel, it's a challenge funnel. Actually, I help other coaches, consultant, or professional who want to take their knowledge and help other people with what they already know. So when I go into a challenge with them, it's really amazing for them to discover how they can use what they already know to help people and take them to a higher level with their knowledge. So it's really amazing. I also do masterclass and webinars. So those three challenges, registration for masterclass and webinars, they are really, really amazing. They work for me. And I think anyone who want to help other people, they can use those funnel to share their message, to connect with a lot of people. It's really amazing. I love that too. I feel like so many people have said the same thing in response to either, whether it was the one funnel away challenge or the year first funnel challenge that we ran, that they gained so much knowledge from that, that they decided to pursue building their own challenges. And they saw a lot of success from that, which is really cool. And how amazing that you turned to growing online business and following these different avenues of funnel building before the pandemic hit, right? You mentioned doing this in like 2019, like what a pivotal time to start focusing on online business because it feels like the whole world shifted, a year later. So to have that knowledge of building an online business must have been crucial for you. Yes, yes, definitely, definitely. I was into a lot of transition also in my life, like new family, I was living also some bad experience in my life, like definitely my family divorce. So to get into this community and all the transition, like COVID and all those things, and connect also with other people, there's a lot of lessons that I've learned. So I think it's, I've made this transition very well. The Cliffordis community has helped me to make this transition and I found also a lot of inspiration. So it's really, really amazing. Oh, I love that. Well, speaking of that, what kind of advice would you give to fellow entrepreneurs who are considering starting a business online? Yes, starting a business online, it's the first thing that I'll tell you, it's something very noble. Whenever you have that idea, because this idea, it's an idea that you have to help other people. Some people, they are just seeing the money. The money will come, don't care for that. It's important, I'm not gonna say you don't need to care for that. It's really important that you make the money, but you need to start focusing on helping other people. Now, if I had to give three advice, okay, for someone who wanna start online business, it's first, say to yourself, who do you want to help? Okay, who are those people looking for you? Okay, and those people, they're not gonna find you if you don't take your message out there. So start with the who, okay? Not how, not all of those technical stuff. I know technical stuff, there can be really amazing, cool, there's a lot of tricks that you can do. You start learning them, but start with the who. Who do you want to help? And then the second thing is your message, okay? How can you attract those people? Or can you make a system that, when that person finds you over the internet, he or she feels that he or she was looking for you. Not you were the one looking for customer advice. Okay, so that's my second advice. And then my third advice, always say to yourself, you are solving a problem. Now, this problem, any time you start solving this problem for a group of people, it's gonna come with another problem. And how can you not only solve one problem, but you can solve other problems, okay, for people. So you can go with those people at a higher level and serve them at a higher level. So this is all my three advices. And I think definitely anyone who really wants to help people can try that and connect and learn from Tifa's community and other people sharing those type of messages. So it's really amazing. And it's a great experience. I've been into it, I'm still in it. And it's really cool, it's really cool. I really enjoyed it. Well, it's great to have you as a part of our community. And it feels like you've really taken that message that Russell talks about to heart, you're calling to serve others and how it's really like when you have that sort of gift, it is your personal responsibility to share that with the world. And that's what you're doing and it's great to see. And I love that you're part of our community in sharing that story with us. So where can people go to learn more about you, Johnny? Okay, I can connect with people. Actually, I have a free training and they can go at cashfromyourknowledge.com. I'll be more than happy to share with them the three steps they can take to use their existing knowledge and make money with that and help a lot of people at the same time. So they can plan a system they can share with the people that they are called to serve a system in using what they know and help those people. Amazing. So actually taking what they already have, the gifts that they have and finding a way to monetize it in a way that serves others. That's why we're all here. That's the beauty of entrepreneurship and I love that you're doing that. Thanks for being a part of it. We'll include that URL in the description as well as anything else that people will want to know about you or where to follow you. So thanks again, Johnny, so much. It was a pleasure to have you today and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Same for me, same for me. It was a pleasure and I'll be more than happy to inspire other people to connect with Clifford's community.

You're gonna find some amazing stories and maybe you are that person who is actually on a problem and there's already someone in Clifford's community that was already in this situation that can help you definitely.
