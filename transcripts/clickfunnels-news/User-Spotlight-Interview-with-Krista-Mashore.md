## Transcript
Hello and welcome to User Spotlights. I'm Laura with ClickFunnels, and today I'm speaking with Krista Maysure. She's an expert digital marketer and funnel builder. She's an author, speaker, a coach, and a recipient of 11 two-comma club awards, two two-comma club X awards, and one two-comma club C awards for $25 million plus in online sales. Wow. She's been in the top 1 percent of realtors and coaches nationwide for 20 years and was named Yahoo Finance's number one digital marketer to watch in 2021. She's had million-dollar months, 25 months in a row. If you want to win in marketing, listen up, folks. Krista, welcome. Thanks for being with me today. Thanks, Laura. I'm excited to be here. I appreciate it. Awesome. To get started, can you just tell us a little bit about your business and your background? Yeah. I have been using ClickFunnels for exactly five years. I left the real estate industry five years ago, went straight into coaching after reading Russell Brunson's expert secrets and dot-com secrets books, and then I joined his inner circle. Now I'm a part of his Atlas group. He's like, I'm a lifer with him. Awesome. How was it being a part of those groups? You love it? Oh, it's great. Yeah. In real estate, it took me 14 years to get to a million dollars a year. Russell, with using his strategies and ClickFunnels, I got to a million dollars in 11 months. Once I joined Category King, he helped me get to a million dollars a month now. It's completely collapsed time frames by being a part of his organization. Awesome. I've known a little bit about you just from being a part of the ClickFunnels family and in the community and stuff, and I've always loved your energy. One of the things that I've noticed about you is you talk about attracting clients rather than chasing them down, which I think is really cool. Can you tell us a little bit about that and what you think are some really great strategies or tips for people? Yeah. Funnels are amazing. The funnel is only as good as the marketing behind the funnel. What I've done is adapt a different philosophy, is where I like to date my audience before I ask them to hop in the sack, if that makes sense. Basically, what I do in my marketing is, before I bring drive traffic to our funnels, I really warm them up through video content, retargeting ads, really getting them to know me and to trust me, position myself as the authority, break down their barriers. That way, when they get to the funnel, they are much more likely to convert. As you see, our funnels convert pretty well, and we've utilized that strategy for all of our marketing in the coaching industry. I adapted that from what I did in real estate, and so we just took that same philosophy in the marketing world, and it's worked fabulously. We like it. Awesome. Clearly, you've seen success and that's great. Yes. Speaking of that, can you give us a little information on what you think, in terms of funnels for your industry or coaches or people who are interested in creating funnels online, what do you think is a great funnel to start with, or have you seen the most success with? Yes. That's a great question. I would recommend we have ran challenges for about four and a half years. Basically, our business model has been challenged, the first couple of years was challenged to book a call. We had a book funnel that was our second highest converting funnel. A free-flesh shipping funnel, and then we had a challenge funnel. We would drive traffic to a five-day free challenge, and then from that challenge, we would offer them our coaching program. Our coaching programs are anywhere from $12,000 to $24,000, but for the past about four months, we've actually changed that a little bit. Let me go back a little bit. For the past 25 months, we have been driving traffic to a virtual event. We are experts right now on virtual events. We have done anywhere from $1 million to $4 million months based upon the virtual event and event model. Originally, for about 20 months, we were driving traffic from a free challenge directly to an event. The event was virtual, it's three days. We have ranged the prices anywhere from $19 to $97. We have all the data and metrics to track as far as which converts more and which doesn't. But for the past four months, instead of doing a five-day challenge, now we are doing something called what's working now in marketing. We basically, in real estate, we drive traffic from an hour and a half training directly to a three-day event, which and the conversions are not much different. All there's about a 1% difference in conversions from that. But instead of doing a five-day challenge and spending five days, I spend an hour and a half and then we drive that traffic. I give them my best stuff ever. We drive traffic to a three-day virtual event and then we sell them a $24,000 coaching program. It's been amazing and we have completely perfected this model. We are at a point now where we know, if we can get this many people there, we're going to do this many conversions. For a long time, we don't have huge sales teams. I've never had more than three sales people over the past 25 months working for me. Because the event is completely, it's done in a way that converts. I've spent the past five years just going to every seminar you can imagine, every training you can imagine, both online and in-person, and studying sales and conversion tactics. The event is built to convert. From the second somebody gets there to the end of the training, everything is done in a way to get people to want to say yes to mine. Amazing. What would you say to somebody who is maybe getting started in the space as an entrepreneur or a coach or in real estate or really anything that maybe has the list or they have leads and they're wanting to create a funnel, but they don't really have a high-end offer or continuity program? Where should they start? First of all, you don't need a big list. When I started five years ago, I had no list, nobody knew me outside of my direct little city. Russell said to write a book, so I wrote a book and you don't need a book, you just need a really great lead magnet. Just something that's really going to help people. I think that it's getting harder and harder to get attention because it's so easy to get attention. You have to make sure that whatever it is that you're giving, that's why the strategy of getting video content out there, high value content, you're literally just paying money to get people to see you, so you can break down their barriers to get them to want to opt into your lead magnet. Many people start from the top, they're like, download my free lead magnet, join my class, give me your information, give me your name, your phone number, whatever it might be, and people are getting less and less likely to want to do that because they're so much spamming, they're afraid. When you do it backwards and you actually ask people, you get them to know you first and really feel comfortable to click. My idea is you watch first and then you give them the option as you retarget to download without giving you their information or again, they can just watch. And then the third step is, okay, now give me your information, I'm going to give you this super juicy stuff. But they're more likely to want to say yes to giving you their information because of all the value that you gave them beforehand. I really, really highly suggest that. So start by getting video content out there, spend a little bit of money driving traffic without asking people for anything. Just figure out what are the pain points of your customer. So I know that we always talk about your client avatar and knowing who they are, really, really getting to know them. I can't tell you the importance of going through that activity. And if I'm allowed to, I've got a seven page client avatar worksheet where you really, I mean, you dive into the fears, the pain points, the desires, the wants of your client avatar. And then you also spend time looking at your competition, right? What is your competition doing in that field? Where are areas of weakness that you can see? Where are areas of opportunity? What are things that they're doing that you could possibly do better, right? Study, you know, Russell says to funnel hack funnels. Also funnel hack your competition, not just their funnels, funnel hack what they're doing, what they're not doing. And then the more that you, you know, research shows that the more that your message speaks directly to somebody, the more likely they will convert, right? So the more that you understand who you are going after, who you're targeting, the more likely they're going to say yes. And you want them to swipe right, right? You don't not want to swipe left. You want them to stop, to scroll. And the more that you really understand who they are and speak directly to them, the more that you will convert. And we are like, we're obsessed with it. I mean, before we launch any campaign or any ad, we really spend like a significant amount of time a day or two really analyzing who our people are. And exactly like, what is the outcome you want them to have from this specific funnel? Like, what are they going to get? And that whole funnel, everything prior to the funnel speaks directly to that. And they trust and they feel confident to, you know, to click and to give us their information. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, one of the things that I noticed right off the bat when learning more about you and your business was, you know, finding one of those funnels and seeing the video of you first, like right off the bat is I'm watching it and I'm already feeling engaged and connected with who you are and what you're doing without even really caring about the industry. It was more of like, I feel like you're making this connection. And then it's, you know, kind of holding your hand and walking you through everything else. And when you talk about attracting people versus chasing them down, I think that that's such a good testament for what you're doing because I saw your video pop up and before I even wanted to read anything or take action or do anything, I wanted to listen to you. And I think that says a lot. Now I'm going to be targeting you and stalking you since you click. All right. So going back a little bit when you first started with online funnels, can you tell us a little bit about, when you first got started and you created a funnel, how long it took from creation of that funnel to making your first dollar? Yes. So it took us 11 months to hit a million. Okay. But what I tell people the truth, but no one ever talks about this, right? Sometimes it takes like a million to make a million, right? So I was like constantly putting money back into the business. And I think we did, oh gosh, I need to, I actually just asked my team, we need to get the metrics to see where we're at, you know? But I think we actually did pretty good, believe it or not. We made $20,000, $30,000 within the first couple of months of launching. It was just me and one other person. And we honestly just read expert secrets, and we did everything expert secrets said. Like I'm not kidding. I remember watching Russell on a webinar and I'm a buyer, right? So I make decisions fast. I believe that action takers are money makers. You've got to be decisive in nature. And I've just always been that way. And yes, I make a lot of mistakes, but because I'm willing to make mistakes and take risks, I, you know, I'll do 10 things and fail at nine, but I'll do one thing right, whereas most people are still thinking about it, making it perfect and trying to like, just, you know, have all the answers. So when I saw him, I, I just like, okay, I'm doing this. I, I booked, I watched a webinar and it said, um, hey, if you want to call right now, call this number. I called the number and next thing you know, I'm flying to Boise and I'm doing the fat event and I'm going through my perfect webinar. Now I never really did the perfect webinar the way the perfect webinar was done. And so I took the perfect webinar format and I put it into a five day challenge because, um, I wanted just more time with people because I, I really believe that the more that you can connect with people and the more they can trust you, the more likely you're going to convert with them. So I took the perfect webinar framework that I learned at the fat event, which was 15 grand and, and then I turned that into, you know, like 20, 30,000 that first, that first launch. Um, so it was, it was, it was pretty quick, believe it or not, but I did, I spent money, I spent money to make money, but you don't, you know, I do think you need to invest in yourself. It's kind of like any business, right? Like it's like people will, um, you know, they want to make money, but they don't want to do the thing that makes them the money. And we are entrepreneurs. We're business owners. You, you know, I don't care if you have to get a loan, take money out of your house. You know, I haven't, I haven't, I don't know if you know much about my background, but I haven't lived at home since I was 13. Um, I ended up getting some, uh, there was some physical abuse happening in my house. So I started running away and then I ended up in, um, juvenile hall, uh, went to a group home for a year and then I was in a foster home. So I haven't lived at home since I was 13 years old. So I had to like be very resourceful. And when I turned 18, after I graduated, my foster parents were amazing to me, but they weren't getting many anymore and they couldn't afford to support me. They were like, Hey, we love you, but you gotta leave. So I had it, I don't leave, right? And I ended up, um, getting student loans, um, working full time during the day, going to school at night. I was just very resourceful because I knew that nobody was coming to save me. And I had to like, I have this saying, it's like, you are the only one responsible for creating the life that you deserve and you deserve it. And I always say, do not let your circumstance dictate your finance. You have to create it. So I had to get very resourceful, um, you know, at a very young age. And when I wanted to, to, to leave my career and mind you, when I left my career, I mean, I was a very successful real estate agent. I was doing about $1.8 million in gross commissions, taking home about $1.5 million and everybody thought it was crazy. Like my family was like, Christa, 40 people at 47 that are doing a million plus dollars a year, do not leave their career to start a new one. Like we love you and you're amazing. And my husband's like, are you sure? And I was like, I'm doing it. And so I just went for it. Right. But I mean, it was hard. I mean, I remember sitting in the kitchen like bawling to my husband going, what the heck did I, what did I do this? I mean, it's so, it's hard. Like, so it is hard. You have to, you have to, like, you're going to go through ups and downs, right? But I had to get through the hard to get, to make it to where I'm at now. And I'm so glad I didn't listen to everyone that thought they were trying to help me because it took me 14 years to hit a million dollars in real estate. And it took me 11 months to hit a million dollars with Russell and ClickFunnels, right? Creating funnels. And now after continuing to stick to my craft, and we've had ups and downs, like if you look at the funnels, we have like, we did like within, I think like 15 months, I did three million dollar funnels. So it took me 11 months to hit one, then like two months later, we had another million, then like two months later. So we did like three million dollars in funnels in around 15 months. But then we went dry for a year. Also, we went dry. I was like, what's going on? So we had to tweak and change because the market was different. And then when COVID hit, we completely transformed our business model. I was at a six week burn rate. I was about ready to go under with my coaching company. And I was like, in Russell's inner circle, they talked about challenges and I was already doing them. But I called somebody in my inner circle and said, how can I make this challenge better? So we tweaked it and adapted. And I'm not kidding. So last year in 2022, we did around 17 million dollars. So from fruition, we've done 43 million dollars in five years with ClickFunnels. But in the past year, 12 months, we did 17 million. So it's like, in four years, we did what? You know what I'm saying? So it's like, when you're doing something like this, all of a sudden, from the trial and the error, the mistakes, the learning, the tweaking, the changing, the listening to other people, associating with all these people that are doing bigger things from you, taking the advice, making the adjustments, not giving up, keeping going. All of a sudden, in year five, we just like, we did almost not quite half, but almost half of what took us four years to do. Does that make sense? Yeah, that exponential growth. Yeah, that's been the road. That's so powerful. And you're living proof of the idea of momentum building as an entrepreneur and how you got through all those hardships and you learn from them and you tweak and you pivot and you do things that continually make you grow as a business person. And you're seeing growth happen quicker now because you got through those hardships. That's really powerful. Everything that you've been through and the things that you've learned in the triumphs and it's very inspirational. Well, I always say anybody can do. I think people look at people sometimes and they think like they assume that they maybe came from great backgrounds or they're just like naturally, you know, athletic or they're just super smart. I mean, I, that's definitely not me, right? I mean, I couldn't read until I was in fifth grade. I wet the bedside was 10 from the abuse. It's like all these things and I mentally had some issues because that I had to really work on my self worth, feeling like I'm good enough and really being, you know, dedicated to working on my mindset. And I believe that mindset is more important than skill set. I know that I could give anybody the blueprint on how to do this, but if they don't have their head right, it would never work, right? So I've been really vigilant about working on my mindset and just mastering my craft. Like I'm obsessed, obsessed with the sales journey. I'm obsessed with the customer experience. I'm literally obsessed. I'm like a psychopath on the weekends. I love, you know, my husband goes to work and I'm like taking trainings and, you know, learning stuff and trying to get better and it pays off. You know, so now, I know, it's a good life. Well, personally, I'm so grateful and appreciative that you are, you've, you've shared so much about this because you make it feel attainable. You make this whole process seem approachable and that you can do it and you don't have to have all of the means and all of the things. You just need the hunger and the drive to make it happen. And I love that you've shared so much about yourself personally and how you made that happen. So thank you. I think that people's biggest problem is that they stop too soon, right? Consistency and perseverance. If people can just be consistent and persevere, they'll make it. Like, and you have to remember that, you know, don't say things like, it's not working now or, you know, there's this book called The Gap and the Gain from Dan Sullivan and Benjamin Hardy. And they talk about like recognizing the gain, right? You've got these ideals. You want to make a million dollars, you want to make your first funnel. Like if you would have told me I would have done this and I just wanted to make one funnel, right? I was like, oh my God, I want to make one funnel. I was so excited. And then five years later, we've got all these words, right? But it's like you have to realize and I said to check myself along the way, you have to realize the things that you're doing right and understand is if you keep on going and you're doing the thing, eventually it will click. But what I find is that most people, number one, they don't ask who, right? You've got to ask who. Who can help me? Who's done the thing? Who can I hire to collapse time frames to get there more quickly, to not make the mistakes that they made, to do the things they did right? Ask who, right? Russell always says ask who not how. And then how can I make sure that I keep on going? I'm, I'm, I persevere and I'm consistent as possible, consistent. That is the biggest mistake that I see. Cause I train, you know, thousands of people and I'm going to, we've made millionaires, you know, multiple millionaires and the ones that do well are the ones that just do not give up. So number one, if you're watching this, but you are, cause you're still here, understand that anybody can do it. If there's nothing special about people other than they just find the who, they do not stop and there is consistent as possible and they have the belief, like you have to have the belief and the faith, you know, faith is like, that's the unwavering belief that it's going to happen no matter what. You just got to know what's going to happen and just, and just keep on going because it will and everything that you're doing along the way is it's working. It's not going to work. It's working because you're finding out like how things, how you can change things, how you can modify, how you can adapt. I mean, we have modified our, we have something called the million dollar a month model where we're now, we're teaching people how to do million dollar months, right? And we give them our whole process, our whole system. And we've like perfected this model, but we have had to like tweak and change in one month. We lost over $900,000 because we, we changed one thing. So each month we change one little thing and see how it's going to move the needle. Some months it moves the needle the wrong way, right? Like the $900,000 a month and my team was like, aren't you mad? I'm like, no, we know what not to do again, right? So it's like you're constantly just trying to do these little, these little things. And you know, I've been very fortunate to be around some amazing people in the ClickFunnels community by, you know, joining Inner Circle, joining category King, joining Atlas, and, you know, just all of their bright, brilliant minds, all of us working in conjunction with each other has just helped it, you know, has just, small things just moved big doors. That's so cool. So you've already given so many awesome pieces of advice, but if you were to give just one piece of advice to somebody who is maybe just getting started or is just getting familiar with ClickFunnels or learning more about it and they know that they have a business in their heart that they really want to start or they're an entrepreneur and they're just ready to get started, like what would be your biggest piece of advice for somebody? I would tell you to read expert secrets, literally pick up the book, go through it, work through it, like as you're going through it, work through the book and just launch the funnel. Don't wait for it to be perfect. Don't wait, like just launch it, right? And then start testing things one at a time. Test your titles, test your headlines, test your pictures, test one thing at a time and see how it converts and then go through each page of that funnel and again, just continue to test it, right? But don't wait. I mean, I'm 51 years old. Like when I start, I'm not given technology. I'm old from most of these people watching. I'm like, you know, I go to these events and I'm like the old lady in the group, right? If I can do it, you can. There's nothing special. I just read the book. I implemented exactly what Russell said to do. I launched my first funnel. 11 months later, we hit a million. So if I can do it at 51 and completely left my career, didn't have a list. Nobody knew who I was. I started from absolute scratch. I was a complete beginner and, you know, five years later, we've done $43 million, all from QuickFunnels. Yeah, you are the dream realized just because you took action. I think that speaks volumes. I love that. Well, our money makers were through. All right, Krista, tell us where we can learn more about you and your business. So look for us. We're going to start running ads. If you're a student, find me, Krista Meshir on all social channels. We're going to be launching the million dollar month model. Pretty soon here we teach entrepreneurs within any industry how to basically do what we've done and giving them everything they need from the funnels to the ads to everything to have their own million dollar month. So that's our new endeavor. We're super excited about it. And just look us up on socials. We're here to help. Awesome. Thank you so much for sitting and chatting with me today. It's so inspiring. I love seeing all those plaques behind you because, again, you are living proof that, you know, after everything that you've overcome and the things that you've learned by taking action, like you can make big things happen. So we love having you in the ClickFunnels community. Thank you for being a part of ClickFunnels in general and for chatting with us and telling us a little bit more about you today. Thank you, Laura. Thank you, ClickFunnels. Thank you, Russell. I just, I cannot tell you how blessed I feel. And it's like it's amazing because I used to work like an insane psychopath. And now I have like my life back and it's all because of ClickFunnels. So thank you all. Thank you.
