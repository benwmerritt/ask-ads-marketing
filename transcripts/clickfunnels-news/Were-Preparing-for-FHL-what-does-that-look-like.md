We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. What's up everybody? Welcome Funnel Hacker TV. I'm Susan Lennardsen. This over here is... Ben Moot. Nice to have you. We have a fun episode today. So I can't wait for all of this to start.

Yeah, we're going to talk a lot of FHL stuff today. So we've got FHL news coming up. We have a special guest who we will intro in just a moment. And we have another thing to show you too. We've got another surprise. And then we have water cooler moments coming up. This is where we're going to get into a lot of fun stuff with our guest because this particular person gets to literally be at the water cooler. And then are we doing a Funnel Hacking with Ben today? We're going to do a Funnel Hacking with Ben today, whether he knows it or not, since he put me on the spot last time. Okay, so Ben, do you want to introduce our guest? Oh, wait, no. Hold on, hold on. I screwed up. We're going to back up. You guys, you've got to make sure that you are subscribed to our notifications so that you know when we have fun episodes like this.

So I don't know how many, how many of you guys, when you guys are here, let us know in the chat that you're here, but also let us know like, how long have you guys been following ClickFunnels? Because I remember when this person came on, onto ClickFunnels and like, he just brought this ball of energy he was always on, he was always running. He was always having an absolute blast and everything that he did. And when I got, when I was able to become like kind of behind the scenes and kind of see how everything was working about a year ago, like he would walk into room like, no, and he would be exact same way. Same energy, same everything. He used to run, used to be a part of the affiliate program. And then he moved over and now he runs events. And so we thought, how cool would it be? If we were able to like talk about how Funnel Hacking Live is actually being put together piece by piece with the man who's in charge of doing it. So you guys, if you guys are cool, if you guys have not guessed it yet, let's bring them onto the stage. Welcome everybody to Funnel Hacker TV, Miles Cliff. Hey, what's up man? What's going on everybody? I mean, appreciate the hype. I don't know if I'm gonna live up to that on this, on this live stream, but excited to be here and talk all things Funnel Hacking Live because it's only 20 days away, which I can't believe. I feel like every year we get home like, man, we got 365 days till the next one. And then all of a sudden it's here again. We're like, it's time to do this again. And we love it. It's the best. It's my favorite week of the year. It's my favorite, my least favorite at the same time. It's just, it's so much fun. And also crazy at the same time. It's utter madness. It's organized madness. And it's organized madness because Miles steps in and makes it makes it that way, but it is, it is crazy. Well, I appreciate that. I'm excited for this episode. And let's jump into this. All right, so we are going to get into a ton of FHL stuff, FHL information. We're gonna ask Miles a bunch of questions. But first we gotta let you know that there's a few things happening. There's one thing happening tomorrow. Yeah, let's get into our funnel forecast. And so how many of you know who Steve Larson is? Let us know in the comments. Do shout out Steve. But he's actually gonna be doing a special class, special, yeah, class. I don't know what the official, yeah, master class. There it is. Telling his story. I mean, I think a lot of us know his story, but a lot of you never heard this story before, but he actually couldn't afford to go to FHL the first year that he went, but he still found a way. So this is called the how can I afford this master class? And Steve is gonna share his story about what he did. So that he could make sure he was there, make sure he was at the event in the building. And he's gonna share his story and he's going to share how you could do the same. Basically, here's what I did. And if you wanna go and do this, if you got the motivation and the passion to do it, you can do it too. So that's tomorrow at I think 4 p.m. mountain time, 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific. Pacific, yeah. We're going ahead and say 5 p.m. central. We've now had all the time zones in the States. So make sure you go register for that. You have the link for that, Ben, that you're dropping in. Yes, I do. I'm gonna go drop it in here real quick. Yeah, it's Christopher, exactly. All right, so if you guys are on the Facebook page, I'm dropping it over here for you guys. If you're in the group, let me know if you guys don't see it. That is the, it goes to funnelhackinglive.com slash how can I afford this? And so if you guys go over there, you're gonna be able to watch. And this is cool. So, like, 2018, I think was the last time that Steve did this. He went and just kind of hung out on the stage, if I remember right, Miles. He went and sat on the stage. He went live at the time for like three and a half hours talking through all of this. And it was just utter craziness. And so Russell was like, you know, it'd be cool if we could have Steve do this again. Maybe a little less time than three and a half hours. Like, we can dense this for chance. So Steve is coming back and it's really, really cool. And it's cool like how he's wanting to do it. Like, Miles, we were talking about how he wants to do it. And you're ready to like get him up on stage and all that stuff. Yeah, I mean, if he wants to, he can, but I think he's actually doing just kind of similar to the same thing. A little more intimate talking right into the camera. I remember when he did it, like you said, 2018. Just, man, so cool. And we saw a lot of people take what he taught and apply it and get themselves a funnelhackinglive, which was super cool to see. And I mean, funnelhackinglive is amazing. We've seen people's lives, businesses, partnerships, relationships change because of what they've heard and done at funnelhackinglive. So that's what we're trying to do is help as many people get there as possible. Yep, absolutely. And the thing is like, the goal of this is a lot of us sit there and say, well, I can't, well, I can't, well, I can't, we let those excuses stop us. We're gonna have more discussion today about excuses because there's some cool stuff that's dropped. Who here saw the excuses campaign? If you guys saw it, let us know. Because I freaked out, I thought it was absolutely hilarious. Actually, I have a family member that's in it. So it was, it was just, it was just cool. But we'll go ahead and showcase that here in a little bit. Let us know if you guys saw it. If you didn't, let us know you didn't see it. We'll show it to you. And so there's some cool stuff there. But tomorrow, make sure that you guys get registered. Link is in the comments. You do not wanna miss that one. That's gonna be really, really cool. It's the last time this happened was five years ago. So might, might be valuable today. I wanna jump on. Cool. One other thing that's on the forecast. If I can jump in here real quick. Have any of you guys like been listening to Russell's podcast like religiously? I don't know about you guys, but like every time the podcast comes out, I'm like, oh, drop it all, gotta listen. This next, this last podcast from last week is about getting it done. It's the hacks that he's doing in order to be able to make it work. So if you guys haven't listened to this podcast yet, he actually talks about everything we're trying to fit in pre-funnel hacking live, including how he's brainstorming for his presentations. And so if you wanna hint on what the presentations are about, if you wanna be able to see how we're, how we have so many balls in the air right now, and we're making sure that they're all caught and taken care of, definitely go in and listen to this podcast. It is absolutely spectacular. And in tomorrow's podcast, I may have been able to listen, you definitely wanna stay tuned because he's gonna start leaning into a couple of things that you guys are gonna be seeing, including talking about the strategy behind what's happening tomorrow with Steve. So guys, if you want to be able to understand how this all works, how all the pieces work, definitely go listen to the podcast today, listen in tomorrow, there's some really good stuff there. It is, it's all gold. Cool. Amazing. Okay. All right, now we're gonna get into some FHL news. News! We have, like Miles said at the beginning, we have 20 days, 20 days until Funnel Hacking Live. And I know that you guys are going nuts behind the scenes, getting everything ready to go. But we have something that we wanna show you. So we last Funnel Hacker TV, we had a trailer that we showed you guys, it was fun. It's just fun to see these. They're like, they're like reminders for those of us that have been, I'm like, I totally remember that moment. Oh, I know that person. But also if you haven't been, these little trailers give you like a little bit of a glimpse of what it's like to be there. And we're not just trying to sell you stuff. We want you to experience this. We want you to be there with us and have these epiphanies and these amazing conversations. So we have another trailer we're gonna show. Let's go ahead and do that now. Yeah. Funnel Hacking Live is life-changing. It's the Super Bowl of marketing events. It's wild, epic. Transformation. Transformation. Transformation. Re-campaign. Absolutely transformational. I'm gonna show you the magic trick that made me all of my money. Freedom. Crash Breakthrough. Literally the greatest event ever. It's gonna allow you to predict the future. Your chance to live your best life as soon as possible. Oh, I love those. Oh my God. We have... Yeah, go for it Susan. No, sorry, I was gonna say we have Jason in the comments. He's like, I got my tickets. Guys, if you have your tickets, let us know. Or if you're like, I still need to get my ticket. Let us know in the comments. Yeah, we've got our booth set up. Like we're gonna have a booth set up. So we're gonna be looking for you guys as you guys are coming in. We're really excited to be able to see you. We're able to celebrate with you. Be able to chat with you guys. We're gonna be going around and like recording little things. So if you wanna be featured on Funnel Hacker TV, watch out for us. If you don't, feel free to say hello all the same. Like we're not there only to throw you onto Funnel Hacker TV. We'd love to chat. So a couple of other things. Like, do you guys don't recognize how little 20 days are? Like 20 days is ridiculously small. There's so much that's happening on the team and on the backend. Tim Pitt's got a ticket. Yes. Like there's so much that's happening in this small window. And so here's the big thing. If you have not gotten your ticket yet, these next 20 days are a very small hinge on which big doors can open. And so my suggestion is go and grab your tickets. If you have not, go to funnelhackinlife.com. Grab those tickets because there's some good stuff. With all that said, let's talk about like what happens behind the scenes right now preparing for Funnel Hacking Live. Shall we talk about the water cooler for a minute? I don't know if you guys are able to see this, but back behind Miles, there is a real water cooler. We have a quick water cooler right there. So let's talk about water cooler moment. In the water cooler, we get to be able to chat how it's going, what's up. And seeing as Miles is literally right next to it. Dude, what is going on right now in preparation for Funnel Hacking Live? Like what falls do you have in the air that you're trying to catch and organize? So there's a lot. Obviously, one of the things right now is we're kind of fine-tuning the schedule. And I don't think people realize how much the schedule shifts and changes. For the most part, we have everything dialed and I say it's like 90, 95%. And then those last 20, 25 days is where things start to shift. And have you guys announced the newest speaker, Perry? No. Okay, well, I just spilled the beans. So I mean, if you go to the FunnelHackingLive.com funnel, he's on there. So Russell, last minute was like, you know what? What Perry's doing is absolutely incredible. I hope I didn't ruin your next episode, by the way. No, no, no, no, you're good. I did, I look at that, I already ruined it. Russell's like, look, everything he's doing is absolutely amazing. Let's add him to the lineup. And so with that last minute change, just shifting the schedule around, making sure everything still works, because a lot of those things we've submitted to the hotel, like when things are taking place and with the AV team, some of those things have to shift. And so a lot of that's just been really fine-tuning that schedule and making sure you guys are gonna get literally the greatest experience day in, day out, all three and a half days. So there he is right there, Perry Belcher. He came out to one of Russell's events at Pirates Code and just blew everybody away. And Russell's like, I need him at Funnel Hacking Live. And so that's been some of it. I mean, we can get into all the other things right now. We're packing up the pallets, getting ready to ship them down. I don't think people realize how many pallets we sent. Last year was 30, I think 32 pallets. So it was a full truck of just our stuff. And that's just stuff we get away like swag and things like that. This year is a little less, which, you know, thank heavens, but it's still a full truck. I mean, it's 20 some odd pallets going down. And so there's that making sure everything's on there, making sure everything looks good. You know, just, yeah, there's so much that goes into it. Russell swags you guys out while you're there. I mean, they have an event that gives you that many t-shirts. Like if you've never been to Funnel Hacking Live, we highly recommend bringing in an extra bag that has a little extra space because you're gonna need that for all the free stuff you get while you're there. Gonna want, you're gonna want, like this was last year's? I don't know, it's like one of those concerts. So anyone who bought a ticket to this year's Funnel Hacking Live got that shirt at last year's event. That's right. I had to. I think Russell finds every opportunity just to give a shirt away. He's like, you know what? We give a shirt away here, we give a shirt away here, we give a shirt away there. Yeah, we'll refill your whole wardrobe with t-shirts. Oh yeah. I gotta be honest, when you just said like, oh, this year there's a little bit less when you're talking about the pallets. And I'm like, no, don't be less. I want it all, give me all the swag. So hopefully it's not a swag. That's cause we packaged things differently and some of the stuff that we shipped down last year, we left it there cause we knew we were coming back to the same place Orlando World Center. So that's the only reason for that. In fact, I think you guys get more swag this year than you did last year. There might even be socks. I'm not thinking of clobbering. Maybe if they're shadowing something, you might even get a pair of socks at this year's. We wanna dress you from head to toe. Oh, and there may be a hat. I don't know, I don't know. Maybe I'm sharing too much. I don't know. Oh my gosh. We haven't given our hats at Funnel Hacking Live ever and I know that because I've gotten every swag every single time I've been there. Cause that's like requisite. I have like one pitch of something that I want as a swag option and I'm gonna send you the link afterwards. I'm like, yeah, just add one more thing over to Miles. I think it's probably not gonna make the palette, but tell me anyway. No, but it's so cool. So like, yeah, I'll tell you afterwards cause it's cool. But yeah, it's, it'd be so cool. I like my wife was over here sitting around like, honey, what do you think about these? Like I'm wondering if I just buy it and like give it out to everybody who's like, everyone who's just like staff, but she's like, oh honey. So it's gonna be fun. Like guys, there's so much that's happening in preparation for Funnel Hacking Live. Is my video choppy? Just making sure that- Just a little bit, but you're back to normal. Okay, all right then. So we got all these different things that we have throwing up in the air. I'm gonna talk a little about the stuff that's being prepared on the ClickFunnels software side at the very end. Because there's some really cool stuff that we're organizing here for you. But like, of all the speakers that we have lined up now, cause we just introduced that we have Perry coming. Yeah, what speakers are you really most excited for? Cause I mean, you have, you do the speaker outreach. You make sure that everything is working out. Where contracts are needed. You do the contracts, you work with the teams, you do all that. Andy Grammer, you had that full on discussion. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you're asking me to pick my favorite child. Like here's pictures of my kids made me. You're literally asking me to pick my favorite child. You know, I know Russell puts a lot of thought, time and effort into curating this event and the speakers. And so, I mean, honestly, we could go through every single speaker and say what we're excited about for them. I think one unique thing is usually every year, Russell is the only presenter, Russell and Todd are the only presenters that actually have multiple presentations from stage. But this year, there's Russell, there's Todd, Garrett J. White is presenting twice. And so is Nehemiah Davis. And so super excited about that. We have Satema just bringing the fire with Eric Thomas. We have Jocco. I mean, those are just like, you know, some pretty big names that I'm super excited for. You know, we have Kaelin and McCall Jones and Kevin Anson during our attractive character power hour. Like it's going to be amazing. Then Andy Grammer, like a private concert in like just for you guys. And you know, he's going to be doing some other cool things, interjecting some, you know, motivational stuff. But I'll tell you what, Andy Grammer, you know, it's a full on concert. Because I don't know, if you guys have been to Final Hacking Live, you've seen the AV that we have there. Like I've never seen another marketing event have that kind of set up. We had to up it even more this year just to accommodate what Andy Grammer wanted to do for us. So I mean, it's a full fledged concert. It's going to rock. Are they going to let us like pull out like full on fireballs coming out of the stage? Is that a thing? Well, I mean, we run into fire marshal issues there. So that's, you know, but I mean, it's the sound systems been upgraded, the lasers, the lights, the, you know, hazing, everything's been taken to that next level, which I always thought was pretty high to begin with. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. It's going to be fun. So like, I have to ask the name of the DJ. Like we get the same DJ every single year. And I like go try to find like Spotify, like what his playlist is. Like, because I just want to keep this stuff. It's just gold. Well, we can find that and give that to you. He's the man. In fact, he literally, he knows, he gets us on his calendar right off the bat. Soon as we wrap up and he's, he's amazing. He just sends us a PayPal invoice and I can't tell you how many people just like, Hey, what's this playlist? I'm like, I don't know. All I know is I liked it. And so he's the best DJ. It's some good stuff. Um, Oh, Ben froze. Oh, he did freeze. Good catch. Okay. So Ben Hardy. Yeah. I was going to say Ben Hardy is one of our speakers. He was there last, this last year, right? Or am I mixing up a bit? So he went to He did a presentation there that I think blew everyone's mind. And I think between Atlas category Kings, Inner Circle, two CCX, all we heard people talking about was that presentation for the next couple months. And so obviously like he had to be on the funnel hacking live stage is going to do a presentation very similar to that. Um, and he's got a special gift for everybody that's in attendance. Um, Ben Hardy and his team are amazing to work with. And just the way he delivers content information is just, Oh, he's one of the best. Yeah, I was in Mastermind of Paradise and, uh, did they give up, do you give a book or do I can't, I, there's been so many things that I've been doing this year. I can't remember if we got a book there or if I went and ordered it like immediately, but I've been consuming the 10X is greater than two X book and it's so good. Um, I think that was the time. So he, it was the very first printing that was possible. Like he went and got that printing out for everybody. And like he had to work some magic in order to get it to everybody's hands and get it across borders and get it in Mexico. Yeah. So he did deliver it to us in Mexico. Yeah. It was very hard to get it to the venue. It was, it took a lot of, a lot of different people doing a lot of different things to get it to the venue to get it out to everybody, but it was fun story looking back on it. Okay. Um, let's talk, are we ready to talk schedule then? I see you. Yeah. Yeah. I see you. Yeah. So in my experience, the FHL schedule is like from a participant, not from a employee from a participant. It's, uh, cause I mean, you get a lot of these questions that are even pop, they're popping up in the community right now of like, oh, what's the schedule going to be? And there really isn't, there's like a show up time and we generally know that the days are long. Um, there isn't really a schedule that gets published ahead of time. Am I mistaken on that? You want to just talk about that for a minute miles of why that is and what people can expect. Yeah. So I mean, they're going to get a high level overview schedule. So if you go to funnelhackinlive.com, you can see who's speaking on each day. Uh, like you said, we don't really tell you when and, and how long they're speaking for. Um, and you know, one of the reasons for that is people tend to say, I want to hear him, but I don't want to hear her. I want to hear her and I don't want to hear him. And you know, you never know which presentation is going to change your life. Uh, you don't know what presentation is going to hit, you know, strike a coordinate and all of a sudden you're changing your business to 10 exit. Um, so we kind of take, I'm not going to say we take away your ability to choose which presentation you're going to, but we want you in that room to experience like, right? Russell and Todd put so much time into curating this and making this the best event, you know, for, for all of our attendees. And so we want you to experience that from beginning to end. And that's, that's kind of the reasoning behind it. Like, he's taking the best of the entire year, like everything that he's learning and putting together and consolidating it and organizing it in a way that's going to be best for you guys. And I can't tell you how many times, like it's so cool, like being in the office every once in a while, cause Russell will sit you down. Like you'll come out, you'll be like, I want to talk funnelhackinlive.com. And he's like, all right, let's sit down, sit down at the table. And he's like, and it's just full on how do we give you the best experience guys? This is all about you. Um, it's all about, well, who would actually fit this? Is this person actually the best person for it? And like everything is rethought through reorganized. Like it's all about you. It's all about getting that right fit. And so, uh, get in the room, amen, Justin. Like it's so powerful to be there and to be present. Um, so what's the best way for people to prepare for funnelhackinlive? Like what have you suggested in the past? Cause I know you've dropped a couple of videos in the past, like this is how you prepare funnelhackinlive. What do you recommend? Well, so those videos are coming out over the next, uh, you know, starting next week. Um, so you will be getting those. They'll be posted in the funnelhackinlive, uh, Facebook group as well. But, um, you know, one of the things is, is just first make sure you have your ticket. That's number one, you know, we will sell out and we don't want you missing out cause you waited too long. So go to funnelhackinlive.com, grab your ticket. Second is book your room. So once you buy your ticket, you'll get an email that gets you access to the Facebook group also gives you the room block link. So we have a discounted room block at the Orlando world center. That too is about to sell out. Like that room block is almost full. I'm surprised. We have to go back to the hotel a couple of different times and get more rooms. Um, so it, we've already asked for extra room. So it's, we're very close to running out. And then I think just making sure, like if you're going. Take care of the things at home. If you have pets, find a pet city, you have babies, kids, find kids sitters. If you have, you know, a job, take PTO, like do the things you need to. To get to funnelhackinlive and take care of some of those affairs at home and get them in order. So that way you don't have to worry about them or, you know, we want you focused while you're here, like not just focus on what's happening in the room, but also focusing on networking and building relationships, new JV partnerships, potential new business partnerships, new friendships. Like we want you taking full advantage of these three and a half days in Orlando, Florida and not worrying about the stuff at home. What do we do if someone has an excuse, Miles? Well, if someone, well, if someone needs an excuse, maybe that's what you're asking someone needs an excuse. I think, well, what can they do, Ben? I think they could watch a small ad that Russell prepared for them this week. Are we watching that today? I think we should watch it. I think we should watch it. Cue it up. Cue it up. Here we go. You want to go to funnelhackinlive. To get inspired by some of the world's greatest marketers and meet thousands of like-minded people. But you're not sure what's going to come up during the dates between September 27th and the 30th, or maybe you already committed to something really stupid, like camping. But don't fear because here at ClickFunnels, we came up with our greatest hack yet, introducing the ClickFunnels official get out of obligation service. So here's how it works. All you got to do is buy a ticket to funnelhackinlive anywhere between these days. Then email your conflict to fhlexcuses at gmail.com. And then me and my team of excuse experts here.

Get your tickets to funnel hacking live. See you next time. There are so many people walking around who don't know that they can change the world. You were born to do something great with your life. As an entrepreneur, you're going to have painful experiences, but all pain is temporary. And if you can survive it, you will meet another version of yourself. I was just numb. We were racking up credit cards. We stopped paying for our house. We literally were selling furniture out of our home. I felt trapped and exhausted by my life. And I couldn't see a way out. I felt like a shell of who I was made to be. In life, you were most capable of helping the person you used to be. If you used to be broke, you can help broke people. If you used to be broken, you can help broken people. It starts with you. You hear the call. You feel it as beating, as pulsing. I made for something more. And then fear hits us. The little voices in the back of our head. I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. The driven say, no, I'm going to do it. The driven are you guys here today? More people are finding their breaking point and waking up. I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. There's a soul here at ClickFunnels. I felt like I have gone through the wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia. And I was just like, what is this magical place that makes billionaires? I'm going to show you the magic trick that's made me all of my money. My best selling framework. Start out closing if you're going to end up closing. 82 percent of customers trust in Blue and Third. Better blow your mind and allow you to predict the future. People need aliveness and meaning to begin. Who do you want to become? What do you want to felt and experience in this one precious life? You wouldn't be able to tell, but I ran the New York Marathon when I was 19. Life happened and my mom passed away. One of my daughters had a traumatic brain injury. Wasn't expected to live. When you meet somebody that continues to push through adversity, that is the definition of an entrepreneur. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to sponsor you through this journey because everybody deserves an opportunity. What you do with it is up to you. People build a sense of belonging here. It feels like home. I'm still encouraging because if they can do it, so can I. They thought, let's say, hey, next year we're going to get dead. Russell has a way of teaching that makes success faster. In my opinion, he's the best marketer ever. You find exactly what your business is missing. It's going to amplify every campaign you do. If you've been thinking there has to be a better way to do this than what you're being told, I'm here to tell you your life. People might say you're too young or you're too old or your body is not right or you didn't go to the right school. Then one day they're telling people how they met you. I can live change my entire life. Because now I know what I'm going to do next. Your family is going to be black. Your legacy is going to be black. Movements are about to be black. My story hopefully gave women permission. If you believe it, stand your ground. You do not have to be great to get started, but you have got to start if you ever want to be great.
