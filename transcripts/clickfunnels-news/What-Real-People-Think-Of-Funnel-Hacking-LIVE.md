Nobody's having a good time. My ex showed up with my uncle. I got stuck talking about NFTs for hours. One guy was like, hey, have you seen my teeth? He pulled a pickle out of his pocket. Like he was missing his teeth. There was a nickel-back cover band. I spilled my Clam Chatter suit. I was held hostage and beaten. I hate pickles. If I hear one more time that people think I'm Peng Joon, I'm gonna punch someone in the face. And that's why I'll never, ever, ever, ever attend. Another shotgun wedding in Vegas. One of my nieces continued us. My father-in-law's birthday party. Flat Earth Convention. Not doing it. Oh, well, how was funnel hacking live? Oh my gosh, like transformative. It was awesome. Oh, that changed my life. It was the opposite. It was the best event ever. I now have the tools and the system that I need to scale my business. You sit in there and you feel immersed. You lose track of time. All of these talks and presentations that really just let me out. There was no Flat Earthers. Maybe one.
