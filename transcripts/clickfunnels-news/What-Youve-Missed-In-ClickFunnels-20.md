## Transcript
We are part of an underground group of entrepreneurs that you've probably never even heard of before. We are Funnel Hackers and these are our stories. Music Hello everybody, welcome to Funnel Hacker TV. How is it going? Alright, so really quick, my name is Ben Moot and this... Susan Lennardson. And we are here to be your host today and just talk to you about what's going on in the Funnel Hacker world. What's new? If you joined us last week, you kind of have an idea of what it is that we're doing. Last week we were able to be at the Inner Circle and we did our first official episode and it was a lot of fun. We got to sit in person, but now I've flown halfway across, all the way across the country, not even halfway. Susan, Sillin Boise. And we are... yeah, and so we're going to be doing this virtually back and forth, but hopefully we'll keep the same tempo. Everything will be great. So guys, let us know in the comments, what is it that you're looking for? If you're just like, hey, this is cool. Love to see you guys. Let us know. Hashtag live, hashtag replay, all that jazz. So excited to have you all here. Alright, a couple things really quick. First off, looking through, we've created the show notes. We've got all the fancy stuff. We're getting everything organized. It's going to be so much fun. Funnel Hacker TV once upon a time used to be this fancy show. It used to have a show. So if you guys are ever on the YouTube channel, we've got endless amounts of videos. Russell, once did the Funnel Hacker TV feature films where we talked about different funnel channels and what they were doing to build out their funnels. Then they took that to the next step and they started doing episodes and there's over 120 different episodes. There's a massive amount of spectacular episodes. And this one, Russell was publishing like crazy and he was publishing his face off. And we're looking for a way to be able to change the game a little bit, how we make this a little bit different for today. And so in order to keep you in the loop with everything that's going on in the Funnel Hacker world, but at the same time be able to give you a personal feel on everything we're here. So the goal is to kind of go through a couple of topics. So really quick, a couple of topics that we have. And you guys can see all the replays of everything we're doing here. We've also put all the old ones on the page for you if you go to funnelhacker.tv. And if you ever want to be able to get the updates before we go live, just text FHTV to 208-231-3797. And we're going to be able to, yeah, right down here, follow those instructions. They'll take care of you. Okay. So things we're talking about today. We have got, we got a couple of people in the community that we want to highlight. Want to say thank you so much for watching, be able to like, for posting, for being part of the community. So we're going to talk about you. We're going to highlight you. So let me just know if you guys wanted that highlight. We'll talk to you about how you can be able to get into that. We're going to be talking about things about QuickFunnels 2.0. There are updates that you don't know about. There's an official pulse that Russell does. And then there's a whole bunch of other things that are wins, but they're not like super big, like Russell should get on and like scream to the world. Oh my gosh. The end, you know, this is the hallelujah moment. There are some really cool wins that are still inside of QuickFunnels 2.0 that we have not discussed. And so we want to discuss those. And then let's see here really quick. Hey friends, what's up Turner? Let's see. The other thing that we have got to talk about is, I want to talk about some, we're going to do some water cooler talk. So what's going on in the office. We're going to be able to come to us with the QuickFunnels office, sit by the water cooler and just kind of talk about all things funnel hacking. What's going on in the office? We want to kind of give you that feel. So got a couple things we're going to go through. So excited. Susan, did I miss anything? I think you covered it. Let's get into it. I'm excited. Let's get into it. Okay. Really quick. So today I'm going to be doing a little introduction about myself. And then on Thursday, when we go live, same time. So Thursday at 1pm Eastern 11 mountain, that's 10am Pacific. We're going to be going live. And then we're going to be a, and Susan is going to be talking about her story and her background. Really quick. I joined funnel hackers when I was originally buying this book. Back in 2013, Russell, I just come out with it, maybe 2014. I don't even know. This was, it's been so long. I've been to all, I have gotten a ticket to every single funnel hacking live. I've been to everyone except for the first one. And I've just been a funnel hacker through and through. I went and built funnels myself. I built funnels for myself, built funnels for other people. I ended up doing a whole bunch of publishing on following what Russell talks about, where you just need to get your face out there. Right. And so I started doing a bunch of publishing on funnel hacking. I went and found funnels that worked and showed everybody what was working. We would do a daily or not daily weekly videos on that. And then I started doing a podcast and YouTube channel and started doing all that. And Russell reached out and said, Hey, I think about a project that might be interesting for you. So for the last year, I've been able to be on the inside. Like this is like every funnel hacker's dream. I get to see what's going on in Russell's brain is the gears turn. But a lot of us don't see all the moments that we're fighting. And I just want to recognize like it's not easy. A lot of the time there, the time between this when I first got this book and today, there were so many dips. There were times when we lost. And I. Forgive Ben's connection. He'll be back with us in just a second. Hopefully. But oh, so while we're waiting for Ben to come back. So the 108 proven strategies, I actually pulled that out yesterday because I had to go and confirm something that somebody said, I was like, Oh, I have that book. Okay, Ben's back. Keep going. So part of the thing of what I'm doing here is I'm testing Starlink. I've just set up Starlink. And so if it pops in and pops out, like we're testing it, this is the hot rod trial. And so if it does not work, I'm going to be cutting down some trees possibly. So all of us have highs and lows. Just recognize that we see you in the lows and we appreciate you and we want to highlight you. And that's part of the what we're doing for the show. So guys, thank you for being here. Let's go ahead and get started really quick. So first thing in news. What happened yesterday, Susan? What was the big thing that happened? I believe there was a pulse episode, right? With you and Russell. Yeah. Oh, so cool. It's funny. Russell was doing the pulse and he was doing them all the time. And I don't know if anybody knows I was trying to prepare like things for him so that we could come in and he could do it. And he was loving it. But the, he was like, Ben, you just want to, you know, this, this pulse much better than me. So I was like, I'm going to stop on and let's just go. He's like, you've done all the prep work, all this stuff. I only have like five minutes before and I'd rather like eat something. You okay if you just jump on? I'm like, sure. So that was the first time I jumped on the pulse. And now it's become a thing. He's like, all right, let's go, Ben. So yesterday on the pulse, we talked about a lot of cool things. There was a lot of cool information that drops. Contacts, your ability to be import contacts is officially live. You're able to get that up. And then you can get your own account. It's time to step, step into there and start moving. So we walked through the how to step by step. We also talked about share funnels and a couple of other things. It was a really, really cool pulse. If you guys haven't caught it, it's here in the YouTube channel. You should definitely be checking that out or on the YouTube. Click from this group. So, so used to YouTube on the Facebook group. So any, any other thoughts that you saw there, anything that you saw inside of the pulse that you really liked or. Yeah, I know it was a really good one. There was a couple of things that you guys were talking about that I was like, oh, I've been waiting for this. It was really awesome. Definitely go check it out. If you guys didn't catch that one yesterday, I think you can go to click funnels.com slash pulse to to get to it. Yep. And if you stay till the end, there is a free gift. We do give you something at the end that we might talk about a little bit later. But if you missed it there, I'll show you how to get it here. Okay. Really, really, really cool stuff. Susan, what are you seeing in the community? Okay, so this is like the coolest thing that we are going to start doing here on funnel hacker TV. We want to give some shout outs to people that we see coming into the click funnels community, the click funnels official group where you're watching this right now. And just like highlight people that are doing amazing things. So, who are going to highlight right now and forgive me if I say your name wrong, but it is Nathan Marchand or Nathan Marchand. And he put a really awesome post in about a month or so ago, just telling his story of like how he started. I think the top here, I have it pulled up on my screen. It starts with a hook, right? You got to have a hook when you're telling a story in the Facebook group. He says how I went from being an alcoholic waiter to making over 335 K with my marketing agency and winning a two comma club award. How awesome is that? So, we just want to say congrats and kudos to you, Nathan. We're glad you're in the community and sharing your story. And there's also some really awesome pieces of advice and value that he puts in the in the post as well, which you should definitely go check out. Yeah, it was, it's so cool to be able to see like I love it when people post their wins inside of the Facebook group. But I like it when they post their wins in a way that helps everybody else out. And what we're seeing is as we're going through because we're going through and seeing what posts are being shared the most and we're getting the most engagement. We're highlighting those. What we're seeing is it's always those that build. It's always those that are constantly giving. And so we wanted to give back to those of you who are constantly posting. We appreciate you guys. Yes. All right. We had something cool we got to do Friday. Yeah, nobody really well, I guess I shouldn't say nobody because it was posted. I know some people know about it. But yeah, so okay. Last week, Ben and I were in inner circle. We got to do meetings. That was our first two episodes of Final Hacker TV. And then Thursday afternoon evening, we get this message from Russell that's like, Hey, will you guys come in tomorrow and I want to interview you on the podcast and we were like, Okay, sure, we'll make that happen. So on Friday, we got to go. Hang out with Russell for about an hour. And we talked about kind of the week. And we got to ask Russell some questions about his perspective of how the event went and his thoughts on some of the things that were shared. And it was really, really awesome. And, you know, Ben, you can say some things about that too, but I just wanted to say that that podcast episode I believe is coming out next week. Yeah, it'll be next week. So marketing secrets podcast. Yeah, so we'll give you like a sneak peek a little closer next week. So believe it'll be next Thursday, we'll be able to show you a little snippet of it. They just sent it over to me and said, Hey, we got the audio ready. We're getting the video ready. So it's gonna be really, really cool. The cool thing was like Russell did something different at the this last inner circle where he did a Q&A session afterwards. He's like, I'm really concerned. I don't know if I feel comfortable with it. And it turned out to be really, really good. And so this podcast was almost like an internal extension of that and what can we do that makes, you know, the content creation easier on Russell, but at the same time we get lots of Russell. And we got to ask some questions about inner circle about like how do you prepare? What are the things you take away? What's the process and how do you choose funnel hacking live speakers? There was, it was so cool. And not very often do we get to like hear people asking Russell like just not pre prepped questions. Like he didn't know what we were coming in to ask him. He was just like, okay, just pick some questions come and ask me. And yeah, like we're not very often do we get to hear conversations like that with Russell? No, and it was, it was so cool because often you're like, when you meet Russell, you're like, oh my gosh, you're exactly like you are everywhere else. Like you are just Russell. And so it was really cool to be able to see that be able to hang out with him and then you taps to you like you were like, like documenting the journey the entire way and I'm like, where's my phone I totally forgot. And so if you guys want to see pictures of it, I believe suits on Susan's profile. Yeah, it was on my store. I don't know if it's on there anymore. I will definitely share share it behind the scenes pictures though. It was really leading up to the release of the episode. All right. One person I want to talk about really quick from the community. There was a post. A lot of us when we when you get to the point where you went to comic club or there's two ways you can do it, you're like, oh my gosh, I had this great breakthrough and then you have the other one where it's like this is the ugly story. But it's the beauty in the story and I wanted to highlight this one because it's cool. You don't have to be too comic with winter for us to highlight. It just happens to be what really performed this last month. And so we wanted to highlight it. But this comes to us from Jesse. Jesse did a post where she talked about the process and she shared video that she and her family have made about them opening up their two comic book award with a process was of them doing it the highs and the lows. And for somebody who's like, as you're getting started, this as you're starting to create this belief, like, I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to get there. Like, I don't know if this is going to work. Like, do I need to follow this? Do I follow that? Like, being able to see their success stories and shared raw and honestly and it, it lets you know that there's still a path for you. I know people who've gone to funnel hacking live and they continue to go to funnel hacking live and they're still building out their businesses. They are not at that pinnacle, but they're building it out there like someday and what keeps them going forward are posts like these are honest shares like these and you continuing to drive forward and being willing to document your journey as you do it. And so this is from Jenny or Jesse, sorry, Jesse Penner. This is from Jesse Penner and it was absolutely just a beautiful post if you have not seen it, look forward to the community like it. Say thank you it is an absolutely beautiful tribute to their journey and to the journey that we all go on as funnel hackers. It's, it's a journey to two comic love it's not just an instant. Hey, I made my million. They're ups and downs the entire way is it's a, it's an experience, it's a ride, and it does not stop. The train is usually going much faster and far beyond by the time you reach that point. Really, really cool stuff and I appreciate that Jesse. Thank you for sharing. Yeah, very, very well done to that. That's her video she posted is awesome. Beautiful. Really quick. We want to talk about some news that we don't talk about a lot with ClickFunnels 2.0. So clickfunnels 2.0 we got the pulse. And then we have other things that are popping up. We want to just highlight a couple of things in this episode of what's going on in the next weeks like there's a mastermind going on so we get to go back to an event. There is a challenge going on in a couple of weeks that you may or may not know about. There's some cool stuff that's happening and leaking slowly. And so we want to be able to pay attention and kind of show you these things. But today, we kind of want to talk really quick about ClickFunnels 2.0 because there's a lot of things that have been released that you might not know about. Susan, do you have those ready? I do. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see. Okay, so first one that I have ready here. You can talk about it though, Ben. We have some new themes. Yes. Yeah. So there's two new themes. So when you're building out your funnel hub and you're trying to get this right, there's two new themes that have been added inside of the builder. And you can find those really quick. There's the real estate one. And there's the Neo, I always say this wrong, Neo Brutalism. Brutalism. Yeah. And that one's like just harsh colors and it's a really cool font. It's a totally different feel versus the real estate is the fancy good looking like golds and blacks and kind of a feel. But at the same time, powerful things with 2.0, you can adjust your style guide. It will adjust all of this. That's the power of the themes that we're creating is we want to make it 100% dynamic to whatever your theme needs to be. So you come in here, you choose out this theme, you update your style guide and everything becomes yours. And so we have two new themes in there for you. Just wanted to make that a call out because they're really cool. Yeah. Really, really pretty. Okay. And then the next one, are there some more third party integrations? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And the new ones are, let's see, there's get response. There's convert kit, which you can see right there. There's convert kit, get response. We've got, what are the other ones? I've got the list. Webinar fuel. If you guys are using webinar fuel, which is a really cool software in order to run your webinars, absolutely love it. And then pipe dry. So that way you can handle more CRM management for sales and help get your sales through the door and be able to take them from one phase to another. So all of those are now live. Those are being released more and more often. So make sure that you're paying attention because there's some really, really cool stuff dropping there. Yeah. I like to see the list growing. It is really cool. One other thing that they updated, but you may have missed. Yeah, Susan, let's go over to the next tab. If you're looking at a certain customer's activity, you can add notes now. And so you go ahead. I was just going to say, so I'm in contacts just for reference of where I'm at in the account. I haven't zoomed in pretty far contacts. All contacts. I added myself as a contact to this workspace. And then usually we're looking at overview when we're looking at someone's profile and then activity is where you're going to find this new thing. Yeah. And so you'd be able to type in like if they purchased offline, if you had a one-on-one conversation and you can say how well it went or what your, everything was, what the process was, how you're feeling. And so that way anyone in the account has that visibility. So you were unlocking slowly the CRM features. You're able to post that and be able to save that forever inside of their timeline. So really cool stuff that's coming. Pretty awesome. Okay. Yep. Couple of other things. Yeah. So there's a couple other things I'm just going to rush really quick. Actually, can you open up, can you go back and open up the funnel hacker, not funnel hacker, the post page? Yes. Thank you. Pull it up. Yeah. So if we go to the post page, what you're going to see is when we click on the updates, there are lots and lots and lots of updates that are constantly happening inside of here. So if we click on real-time updates, you're going to be able to see everything that's dropped inside of here. These are dropped every single week almost. And a couple of things that you may have missed. And we are now on your order forms. We're validating phone numbers. So we're making sure that the phone number is actually a valid number. It's not just a bunch of strings where they didn't, if they, you know, are too few numbers or too much, it matches phone number format. So we're checking that for you. We're also, we also built the ability for you to start sending invoices from ClickFunnels 2.0. Who you could do that. You don't know how to do that. Documentation is here. It shows you how to do that, as well as being able to create a split test from your existing in your workflow for your funnel. You can create a split test now of a funnel by clicking a button and it just pops it over. So you're not trying to add a page and figure out where it's from. You can click one button and boom, it's done. So there are simplifications. There are pieces that are making the software better constantly. And just because there's not a pulse out on it, doesn't mean there's not a lot happening. So I think you're checking this out because there's so much that's just happening behind the scenes and we don't want you to miss it. So awesome. There's so many things in here that you haven't even mentioned too. No, there's no, I like that was just that was just a highlight in and of itself. This list is so big. You're like, holy cow. And you got little gifts that show you. Do you call them gifts or gifs? I call them gifts. I know it's not the right way. Gifts or gifs? Comment down below. Tell us which is which. All right, really quick. I wanted to do a highlight. Susan, you said you really liked the part of the inner circle last week. And I wanted to be able to give you that. What did you like? Okay, so we're on the water cooler moment, yeah. Yeah, water cooler. That's right. Bad transition. No, you're good. I'm just making sure that I'm on the same page with you. Okay, so last week, one of the things that Russell did was he brought up a video that he actually posted quite a while ago on his Instagram account, but I had missed it. And so this is the first time that I had seen it and I thought it was so cool. It's it's just, he's like, oh, you know those those tick tocks where where it's the same person that's being all the characters. He's like, I wanted to try one. So he went and made one for himself. But the this is showing how he paid $10,000 for a book. And he showed it out in her circle last week as kind of a when he was talking about the School of Success and what he's doing with all the books he's been buying and so it's really fun. So this is actually on his Instagram account. And if you want it's pinned, it's I don't know how I missed it because it's pinned it's the very first one that you see. So you can go and watch it in its entirety and get the audio and everything but it's kind of shows like it's the story between him and like another character of like, why would you go pay 10k for a book. And he like is teaching the other character like why right, why he would do that. Well done. That was awesome. It was beautiful. And the thing is like, I don't know if you guys know he's like leading up to something really, really big and really, really cool. The inner circle has had a chance to see it people who are at mastermind and paradise got a chance to see it. There's some really cool stuff going he's invested so much into this idea and this process that it's going to be really, really, really cool. And I believe he's going to be talking about it at funnel heck of a line. So it's going to be it's going to be all sorts of good on that note. Water cooler talk. I got a message from somebody at the office today and they're like, so we're talking about funnel hacking live. Really. So you guys may have if you watch the birthday bash. Russell talked about the Russell talked about very first speaker that he announced which is jocco, which is ridiculously cool. And did my video have an issue. You're good. We can hear you. You're good. Starlink. And so what we did is he introduced jocco. And since then, we just signed on our first speaker for funnel hacking live and it's starting to happen now like we're starting it. So if you guys, there is a way to become a speaker at funnel hacking live and you're wondering what that is. There's a specific process you do. You can't get outside of that. And so the process is what we talked about in the podcast. Open loop. We actually, yeah, we we talked about it pretty, pretty extensively on the podcast interview. So yeah, if you want to know how to become an FHL speaker, listen to that episode. That's the process. So funnel hacking live, like there's magic going on in the background. Russell comes out while we're at the inner circle is like, I got it figured out. I'm like, where did you get figured out? I'll tell you later. He is the king of open loops. He is it kills me. He's always dropping up. I have a great idea about X, not Y, but he just, oh, that's great. Talk to you tomorrow. He never talks. So it's like, open loop. It is crazy. So my suggestions for you guys, if you haven't gotten your tickets for funnel hacking live, get it because this year is going to knock your socks off. It's going to be so good. I'm freaking out. And there's, I may or may not have knowledge of a couple of speakers. So everybody's got inside information. So if you're a cooler talk, there's some cool stuff going down. So yeah, definitely if you haven't gotten your tickets, get your tickets. It's going to be awesome. Yeah. Anything else I think, I think the only thing we have left to do is to tell everybody the gift from the polls. Yeah, yeah, I think everyone needs a good reminder of that. Yes. Okay. So here's the deal. If you guys didn't watch the polls, we gave away a free template. And so you're able to download that template into your account and start using it. It's a one of the very first share funnels that we're providing out. We've got a library that are being built out for you. And we are just getting the, all the pieces together. So that way it's ready and it's all super professional. Once again, it falls all the style guide. So you use your style guide and updates the entire funnel. We're doing all of this for you guys. So share funnels are coming. But there is a share funnel. If you guys want, you go to click funnels.com slash pulse. And you guys go into the recap. And if you go there, you will be able to see that actually it is right there. There we go. So you scroll down. It's the very first one. And we've got a link for you there. So you guys can get the $1 funnel. It is right there. It's a great trip wire funnel. It's designed very specifically to what's worked in the past. And it's a beautiful design and it's got some CSS and some stuff. So feel free to check it out. Have a great time. And hopefully it gives you that shortcuts that way you can jump forward. The only question that I would have last as we're ending this is what you guys want to see. One of the things that you want to see on funnel hacker TV as we keep this going, the goals to do this two times a week. So we're doing it today. We're going to do it again on Thursday at 1pm Eastern and that's 10am Pacific. So we're going to be yep. Do the math for good. Yep. Gears are turning. We're great. And so make sure that you are inside the ClickFunnels group that you're watching. If you want to get notifications, go to funnelhacker.tv and put in your email for recaps or text FHTV to 208-231-3797. It's all down below. Anything you want to leave with Susan? We good. I think that's that was good. We dropped so much stuff in this. So if you jumped on in the middle or towards the end, we had segment after segment after segment and we're going to keep improving upon, you know, helping you guys to follow what we're talking about as well. But yeah, I think that's it. We covered it all. Let us know what you want to see on Thursday and future ones. Absolutely. And we will give you guys some really cool insights. There's some masterminds and things going on. So stay tuned. We'll see you guys next time on funnelhacker.tv. We have to do things smarter. We don't have financial safety nets because every test we take is with our own money. We have to be profitable from day number one. So how do we do that? How is that even possible? If you ask the MBAs or look at your college textbooks, they will tell you what we are doing is impossible to get us happy every single day. And it's happened through an art and a science that we call funnel hacking. It's not really something that I can explain to you. It's something I have to show you. These stories are a glimpse of entrepreneurs just like you who have a dream and a vision you want to change the world in their own middle way. I use the funnel hacking process to help make their dreams become a reality. Yes, we are funnel hackers and these are our stories.
