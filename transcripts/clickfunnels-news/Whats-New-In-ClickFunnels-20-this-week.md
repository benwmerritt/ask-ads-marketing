Guess what, you can now split test emails and we're also going to talk about two new features that were added, things to your feature requests. Heather, funnel hackers, Tim Pitts and Bargay here with ClickFunnels. And first of all, thank you so much for your feature requests, as they're always extremely helpful to let us know how we could improve things on our end. Now, the first thing I'm going to be talking about is the ability to bulk on subscribe contacts. But wait, Tim, are we supposed to be subscribing people to our list in order to grow it? Well, yeah, of course, but unfortunately, sometimes as we're growing our list, we're going to notice a lot of emails start to bounce. And that's due to sometimes there's a misspelling in an email address, or sometimes even when we're testing, we may enter a fake email address. And unfortunately, sending emails to fake email addresses can truly affect our email sending reputation. So by adding the ability to bulk on subscribe contacts, now you could go in and clean your list and keep that reputation going. Another feature that was highly requested was the ability to add custom code to the header and a footer of a page. And why would you want to do that? Well, a lot of tracking applications require and request that you add their custom code to the header and to the footer of a page. So we wanted to make sure you have the ability to do so. Now this next one is huge. You can actually split test your email subject lines and also your email pre headers. Split testing is like going into this alternate universe where you can show people different pages, or in this case, different subject lines and let them tell you which one performs better. But no, don't worry, you do not have to go through a wormhole to get to this alternate universe to actually see this in action. ClickFunnels 2.0 will actually allow you to go ahead and test two different subject lines and two different pre headers and let the people and the stats let you know which one performs the best. And there you have it, funnel hackers. Go ahead, test out these new features and let me know in the comments what you think of them. See you next time.
