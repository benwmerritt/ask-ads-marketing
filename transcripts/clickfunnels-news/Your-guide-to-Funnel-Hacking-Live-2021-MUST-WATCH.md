So you haven't got your tickets to Funnel Hacking Live yet, and I don't understand. What was the line there? So you're thinking about coming out to Funnel Hacking Live, the greatest entrepreneurial and marketing event in the entire world. But maybe you have some questions and concerns that are holding you back from making that decision to attend Funnel Hacking Live. Maybe you forgot how to interact with humans because you've been stuck behind a computer for the last 18 months only doing Zoom meetings. Maybe you've forgotten how to travel or you may not be able to. And don't worry, we have the virtual event for those who can't. Maybe you haven't gotten a haircut in the last 18 months and honestly, it doesn't matter, neither have I. So that's the reason I'm making this video is I want to answer the top 10 questions that are holding you back from deciding to come to Funnel Hacking Live, the greatest event for marketers and entrepreneurs. So question number one, what is Funnel Hacking Live? Funnel Hacking Live is a four day rock concert for entrepreneurs and marketers. It's where ClickFunnels announced some of the big updates coming out, all the new features that will be rolling out to you as ClickFunnels users. And it's the best place to network with some of the top entrepreneurs and marketers just like you. Question number two, when is Funnel Hacking Live? Funnel Hacking Live is September 22nd through the 25th. Those are the dates. Question number three, where is Funnel Hacking Live? Funnel Hacking Live is taking place right outside of Orlando at the Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center. And we have a room block for you with a discount rate of $159 with a $30 resort fee. You know what? They got some pretty cool stuff there. They got like a wave pool, they got water slides, they got good food and best of all, Funnel Hacking Live is there. So make sure you're there. Kiss Me Florida Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center. Question number four, how much does it cost to attend Funnel Hacking Live? Well, we have two options this year. Live in person where you're with us or you can attend virtually. Each of those options are $997. Pretty good deal. What's question number five? Question number five, what safety precautions is ClickFunnels taking along with the Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center? Well, I can tell you that what we'll be doing is we'll be taking into account the state, cities and hotels regulations at the time of the event. For example, we have multiple events planned based on which regulations are in place. If all regulations and bans are lifted, all 3,500 Funnel Hackers are going to be in one room where masks and hand sanitizer will be readily available. And we'll ask those who are not feeling well to not come to the event in person. And if the regulations are different or we have to do social distancing, we have plans in place where we have other rooms where we'll rotate through the satellite rooms and the main event space itself where social distancing will be possible. Question number six, who's speaking at Funnel Hacking Live? That's a fantastic question. Well, besides the man, the myth, the legend himself, Russell Brunson, we have people like Lisa Billiou, Garrett J. White, Daniel K. White, Tony Robbins. We have breakouts with Myron Golden, Jim Edwards, Katherine Jones and Rachel Miller. And we're still working on getting the two-pot hologram. Although, I think if we had him in person, he'd be better himself because he's still alive. Many of you may be wondering, Miles, how come you're not speaking on stage? I don't really like the spotlight and I can't really show up Russell Brunson at his own event. Question number seven, what are the presentations going to be about? Glad you asked. One of the things I'm most excited about is all the incredible changes and updates we're making here at ClickFones and with the software, such as... And also, we're going to have some of the best people on stage talking about personal development and what they've done. They're different funnels that they've used in their business and their industries to grow. Podcasting, blogging, traffic and marketing, everything that you need to build a successful business is going to be covered on stage at Funnel Hacking Live. Question number eight, what is the schedule? Well, we don't really post a in-depth schedule, but I can tell you what each day is going to be. So, day zero. Now, this is technically a term that the events team uses, but for you, all you need to know is this is the day that you're going to arrive to the hotel, check into your beautiful room, come find me, lavish me with gifts and all that, and then also register. This is kind of where you can meet new people and start networking with like-minded individuals in the lobby as you are registering, getting your swag and getting hyped up for day one of the event. Day one, foundation. This is literally us. It's just like building a home. It's that foundation that you need to build a strong, sturdy house on. This is the hacks and the information you need to build that strong foundation for your business. Day two, funnels. How can you come to Funnel Hacking Live and not have a day solely focused on funnels? Well, that's what day two is. I mean, we're going to be talking about summit funnels. When I say we, I mean speakers who are knowing exactly what they're talking about and have built super successful businesses, doing summit funnels, e-commerce funnels, coaching funnels, webinar funnels, all those things. Day two, day three, traffic. The foundation for a beautiful funnel is worthless if you're not getting traffic to those things. So day three is all focused on traffic and getting people to your funnel. And day four is all about impact and legacy, right? It's so cool to make money and to buy things that we want. You know, there's that cool saying that money doesn't buy happiness, but broke doesn't buy anything. But it's really about making an impact and changing the world for the better. As our good friend Barry Bumgarner says, when you do well, you can do good. And that's what day four is all about. Question number nine, if I attend Funnel Hacking Live virtually, will I have the opportunity to network with other entrepreneurs and marketers? The answer is yes. There will be opportunities for you to go into different breakout rooms with other individuals in your same vertical industry and niche where you can network with them and build connections you need to continue to grow your business. Question number 10, how can I best prepare for this event? Now, obviously that's going to differ whether you're attending virtually or in person. If you're attending virtually, we highly recommend blocking out those four days. Try to eliminate as many distractions that can come up as possible because pretend like you are attending in person in life. You're saying goodbye to your family or your friends or your dog and you are locking yourself in this room full of entrepreneurs to learn as much as possible. Do whatever is going to make this event the most impactful for you. Now, if you're attending live, what are some things that you can do? We highly recommend taking care of your body. These are four long days full of tons of information, tons of networking, tons of just insane emotions and adrenaline. So we ask that you take care of yourself the best you can. Make sure you're hydrating. Make sure you're eating the right types of food. Make sure you're getting enough sleep. And also come prepared to learn. Come in with an open mind and ready to take the things that Russell and other speakers are teaching and implement those into your business. There's so many different examples of attendees that have taken the concepts they learned at Funnel Hacking Live and escalated or blown up their businesses in the next 12 months. And so we want you to be able to do those same things. Question number 11, which somehow made it on the list is, can I go to Disney World? The answer is yes. You can go to Disney World, but just don't do it during the event times. We want you at Funnel Hacking Live. We want you blowing up your business. We want you doing well so you can do good and have an impact on the world and leave your legacy behind. But, again, I'll see you at Disney World on Sunday. So those are the top questions about Funnel Hacking Live. If you guys have any other questions about the event, please drop them down below. Make sure you like the video if you found this helpful. We'll see you guys in September. Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center. Don't be late. Hydrate. Take care of yourself. See you then, everybody.
