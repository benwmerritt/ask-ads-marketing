So I got some really fun stuff today hanging out with you guys to share with before we get started too quick I just wanted to kind of say what's up? Let me know in the comments where you guys are calling in from right now We are streaming I think to Facebook to YouTube to LinkedIn to Instagram. We are all over the place So wherever you guys calling in from let me know so I see in the comments here. I can watch we guys calling in from it's always fun to see and also I've enjoyed I don't know. I guess I'm good time going live. I've been really enjoying this It was weird last week I went live the first three days and then we're at the Nankini event and we're gonna try to go live But it was hard because there's so much chaos and I missed hanging out with you guys for a couple days So I'll pump you be back. We actually have the thinking grow exchange happening starting tomorrow So I may be maybe we'll just stream parts of that I don't even know what's gonna happen. So I may or may not be live live They're like directly hanging out the other guys like this the rest of the week But we'll definitely be giving you guys some really cool stuff So maybe we'll stream something grow rich challenge for you guys. You don't miss it You should not miss anyway, you should go to thinking grow rich challenge calm and sign up It'll be a lot of fun. But anyway, that's besides the point in fact today. We want to do something different You know, I've been sharing you guys ideas and talking about publishing and showing different funnels and different like concepts But I had an idea this week We're talking about this like what can we share that be just different unique And so I thought what'd it be cool to like show you guys the ads we make and how we make them Why we make him and how many guys would be interested in like seeing that part of it? So I'm guessing a lot of you guys like figuring out the funnel thing you're figuring out publishing But like how do you actually go and create the ads? And so what I thought would be fun is thinking gross challenge starts tomorrow Which by the way shameless plug you should go register thinking rich challenge calm But I'm like after we got the funnel done the next step for me is the creator as the attractive character Whatever you want to call it was to go and create a whole bunch of ads And so I want to show you guys the process of like how I created the ads what we did where I was thinking about as I was doing it And then on top of that I'm gonna show you guys which one is the number one highest converting ad right now It's bringing in trials of like a buck fifty or so bringing like opt-in sprague under buck fifty It's bringing in people to join the continuity program for under a hundred dollars like It's it's crushing right now. So how many of us want to see that and see what's winning right now? Okay, that's gonna that's gonna be the game plan. So this one what you think about So when you're creating a funnel right you go through the whole process you create the funnel And like while you're in the process of creating the funnels the best time to start creating the ads now This one unfortunately I didn't create any like my favorite ads like as you were creating the funnel to capture things like if you saw the Dan Kennedy Event we did like while we were building the funnel I was like capturing things and those became ads So like a lot of times as I'm writing my webinar slides all like feel me like I'm writing slides right now It's gonna be so cool my slides 63 you're gonna love this one like those kind of ads do really well But this one I didn't have that Because the challenge was happening plus I was you know running the magnetic market how much this stuff was happening But I was about to leave town and like we need some ads Russell And so I spent about an hour and I filmed these ads and it was the whole thing so it took me an hour From that we created. I don't even know probably 20 30 different ads from those 20 30 ads We've had a bunch of winners. So I'm gonna show you guys I'm actually gonna show you guys the ads and then talk through how we did is that cool? Yes, that'd be fun for you today All right, that's the game plan. It's gonna be it's gonna be awesome And not that my goal is for you to watch the ads and go register for the free challenge But if you happen to do that, I'll be pumped about that as well. Okay, couple couple things. They're really cool number one This is my new favorite gadget. You don't have to have this gadget You can do it like you can do the same thing with your phone like all the stuff I'm sure you can do with your phone and it'd be just as good But I found this cool little gadget. Have you seen these yet? These are DJI's DJI's like the big company does the drones that Want to fly over make the cool videos? But this is like their new personal vlogging camera and it is shockingly good So I should be getting paid for this, but I'm not so you open it up This what looks like and what's cool is you flip the screen over and it turns on and you can see the thing right there Right and it's got a camera that'll focus on me so far here And like it follows me around anywhere I go and you can see it, right? How to make this not blurry so there there's a screen But it's cool as you can do the horizontal or you can flip it this way and if you want and then it's all it's vertical Right and so you can film the videos that way and if I click on this it'll flip it around So now it's got my face You can see it's got my face and it's got this insane facial tracking so no matter where I go like it follows me So I'm like, oh what's happening and it follows me everywhere. I'm gonna go right back right now It's freaking out because I've moved my head too fast, right? There's vertical for Instagram There's horizontal for for YouTube or Facebook whatever it is and then like in a suit capture your face It'll just follow you everywhere you go and the mic is shocking to get on it as well Which is really cool So we actually filmed all these ads on this little this little D this called the Osmo on the Osmo So there's the product pitch for product. I get no commissions on but it's like my favorite little tool now And so it's really cool. So that's how we film all these ads on this right here But again, you can do the same things with your phone So don't be like I don't have a get an Osmo rustle. I can't film things you still can't but this one Anyway, it's just really cool. And then this little thing you like set up as a stand you can do all sorts of cool things But anyway, it's really fun. So there's there's tip number one is the Osmo. That's how we film these Now some of these I was actually holding the camera some of them Ben moot was in the office that week So some of them he was like holding and like I'm walking Adam He's like walking backwards trying not to knock over desk and stuff But again, we busted all these ads in about an hour and it was a lot of fun. So That's kind of how how what we did how it all started. So do you guys want to see some of these ads? All right, so we got basically four different types of ads. I'm gonna show you guys I'm talking about and we'll show you some might be one or two ads you watch I'm gonna come back to explain next ones We'll show in those explain next ones go back and forth and what's all said and done then I'm gonna show you the number one highest converting ad from this batch of ads we created and and then Hopefully you guys will see this and then this is I did you can use to model for all of your funnels So funnels done next step is creating the ads. Okay, so the very first set of ads we did It's basically called the walk and talk in the office. So this is where basically I was like And you notice an ads if you're if you're stagnant ad like hello, welcome to my to my ad You should click on a link like those do well But what typically does better is like motion ads where you are walking around the office You are moving you were taking something from one location to another location Like there's something happening and you're taking them on this journey Those types of ads in my experience to do the best and so these first few notes are walking talks We were literally walking on the office and I'm talking about the thing girl rich book talking about the challenge I'm like like trying to people pumped about why they need to be part of this thing I tried to have my energy at like level 10 as much as possible because that's what Russell does And so that's kind of game plan. So with that said, I'm gonna show you as the very first the first three ads I'm gonna show you are called walk called walking talks These are all ads me walking around the office talking and and then pitching Pitching so you notice a couple of core things if you've read my if you read my books before there's always a hook There's a story and an offer so see if you can see these all in the thing You're gonna see a hook a story and offer and from hooks I'm looking at all sorts of hooks can be a headline it could be like the first thing I say could be a visual hook You can be walking through an office next to bookshelves can be a visual hook something that as someone's on their phone Streaming that's gonna like grab their attention right so I was looking for these hooks verbal audio Background video different, but you'll notice I'm in different locations I'm filming these because I don't want every single one of my ads looking like this is the backdrop You know I mean so that's kind of the setup so right now I'm gonna watch three of these in a row these are the first three walking talk ads We filmed here in the office and we come back and I'll walk you through the next set of ads here right after that So that said let's keep the walking talk ads in three two one.

That's why just a few months after I graduated I decided to end my very first seminar on how to start a business online It was at the seminar one of the very first speakers asked the question who here's ever read the book thinking grow rich I quietly sat there and watched the majority of the room quickly raised their hands as their hands started to slowly go back down The speaker told the story about Napoleon Hill meeting with Andrew Carnegie and the commission he was given to spend 20 years interviewing the most successful people in the world and from that work Napoleon Hill put together the first philosophy on personal achievement the world ever seen the speaker told us it was originally written in an Eight volume series titled the laws of success But a few years later Napoleon wrote a book that was a condensed version of his philosophy and written specifically for entrepreneurs And for business owners that book was thinking grow rich. I still remember hearing those words think and grow rich What did that mean? I knew I wanted to grow rich by good, but I didn't know how by thinking thinking about what? Probably same questions.

I have my thoughts, but I'm curious yours are so as you're watching it comment like oh It was because of this right all this is the reason why this is the reason why it was the winner of all the ads And let me know okay, so that said yes ready and he's some drumroll drumroll, please Here we go the number one winning ad from the thinking of a risk challenge campaign going live to you in three two one Hey, what's up?

All right, so drop in the comments right now. Why do you think that one was the winner? I'm curious. I want to see what you guys are thinking why you're thinking it I can tell you my thoughts. I think that human beings they just love like I know the curiosity like what's happening I think me going to say from pulling the thing out and showing it's like it brings people into into the process, right? I remember years ago hearing Frank Kern talk about the fact that and he wasn't talking about ads He's talking about video sales letters He said that if you take somebody on a on a journey not just like a verbal journey But like a physical journey where you you start one spot and you're leaving like they're gonna come with you on the journey And then they feel more bought into it So like a lot of his ads back in the day a lot of nuts ads but the video sales are frankly did really powerful for me It's like he beat his house and he'd be like, you know, he's like the hero in the ordinary world He was going on this adventure with the with the person with the viewers. He beat his house And he's like grab and he's keys. Hey guys, what's going on drops a hook I want to get with me you walk out jump in his car and he drives somewhere and sweet like in the drive I talked about where they're going they get the spot and then he finished the video so there in different location, right? And like that concept of taking your customer on this on this journey I think that last ad was really cool because it's like taking you on a journey and seeing inside the safe and I'm opening it There's curiosity and all these different things That gets you sucked in long enough to hear what the offer actually is right hook story offers all about that It's like hooking so grabbing someone's attention long enough that you can tell them a story Then having the story gonna have to build up the perceived value of the thing you're trying to offer and then making the offer The biggest mistake most people make they just thought offers offer offer offer say no, no, no You got a hook them first Right to grab their attention Tell them a story to increase the perceived value of the thing you're gonna offer and then make the offer Right, that's the that's the magic for me. I think that ad nailed it Which is maybe I'm wrong But that's kind of my my thoughts and made me think more like what else could I do? What else can I show them out of the safe to get people excited to like go and see the next thing? So anyway, that was that was fun. I hope you guys enjoyed that hope that wasn't it's weird like hey Don't watch ads with me, but hopefully it was powerful Ben and I were talking in the future We thought it'd be fun to go back through and show you guys like because even like like the expert secrets But doc comes to you like all these different things like we create so many ads like I've created ads where I'm hanging from the ceiling Ones where I'm the devil versus the angel like on my own shoulder like also like we have so many fun ads somewhere good Some were bad somewhere embarrassing and so cringy that like I'm embarrassing show But how many as I'm just curious how many has enjoyed it was a valuable for you guys to see the ads and think through how we did And why we did it because I think it'd be fun to do more of these maybe once a week or something We pull an ad campaign and show you all this stuff And maybe selfishly it gets you to actually go and sign up for the thing we're trying to offer anyway I don't know. Maybe that's maybe that's my evil motivation. I don't know Speaking of if you haven't signed up for think or a challenge yet You should go to think and grow rich challenge calm and sign up. We start tomorrow. It's gonna be awesome Three days where as you saw from the as we're be streaming a whole bunch of stuff in a point hill, which will be cool So that's kind of the game plan and yeah starts tomorrow again I probably won't go live tomorrow because I've been going live there, but if we can we'll try to stream it I don't know if that's gonna work. I have no idea So if I'm not able to stream it just go register that way you don't miss it and I'll be going live for three days With me and whole bunch of other really cool speakers will be sharing some really cool things from the point hill You have a chance to see what a three-day challenge looks like what we make an offer Yeah, if not, then I'm not Russell Brunson and I'm not practicing what I preach So yeah, so be an offer made you go watch it watch how I do it watch the offer the perfect webinar the stack the close like go Take notes like I always tell people if you're gonna buy something from me buy slowly like You know as much as like as much as like the thing that I'm selling at the end is great like the process of how I'm doing things That's the worth the price of mission by itself, right? And most of I'm selling is like me explaining how I did what we just did right? And so it's like here's what Russell just did like you can actually experience that live and it may bomb I don't even know it may be awesome We have like we have no idea until we get into it, but I'm excited to find out he is excited to find out So come watch me live come see and see how it all turns out. So I don't know it's gonna be fun Anyway, I appreciate you guys hanging out. I love doing these love hanging out with you guys And I hope you got some value from this one and I would say go out there if you got an Osmo Go bust up, you know 15 ads are in next hour if you don't grab your phone bust out 15 ads same kind of thing No, she's to go out there and just do it and and just do that consistently, right? Every time I create a new funnel, that's the first step when we're like funnels done or mostly done or it's just busting out a whole bunch of Different ads fear different hooks and different angles And then we find out the ones that that work well, then you double down like I know going through all those how many 15 ads We showed you we've had on the winner Like if this was not if when this becomes an evergreen funnel I will go back to the winner and then we'll go make probably 20 variations of that winner modeling As close as we can to different hooks and angles, but like you find the winners like make more of that They do more of that one. I remember Dean Graciosi tell me when We talked about this last week I think when I showed you the his presentation from funnel hacking live But that's how it was with his book like he's his book He capped out selling 100,000 copies and he got stuck and kept trying different hooks and finally figured out the hook that worked Then books are selling and then now it's if you got that hook Then he went and made like 200 ads based on that hook and that's what took it from 100,000 books to 500,000 books Right, so it's just like you never know You're just throwing stuff in the marketplace throwing hooks out there trying to figure out what the fish the fish are gonna bite on And then we figure out like oh these fish are biting on power bait or the biting on worms or whatever it is It's like cool throw out more worms like as many as you can right? That's the game and it's it's a fun part of the process I like it because it's like I know it's just you just riff and just have fun and just I don't just try stuff and see what works And you saw how like not professional of videos were there's a bus walking down the street I'm just gonna get by a car like reading something from the book right pulling something from the content or pulling something out That's interesting right telling stories visual cues I gotta make all this book hoarding, you know, I gotta make my money back for me So I gotta show books in the videos. That's how you know, that's I can justify me spending money on all the books and all that kind of stuff So anyway without saying yes, I appreciate you Last couple things as always is make sure you're on the texting list as you guys know We text before I go live every single day. So make sure you're texting this I'm sure we'll send out a text tomorrow notifying you guys the thinker or its challenge I'll probably send it out an hour before it's big Don't forget to get on challenge but make sure texting list. We also finally got a separate international So if you go to What's that you log in what's up and you text the number it will work there. I heard from Somebody saying that like if you add me as a contact first and then text it works better through what's up? I don't know. I'm not a what's up or I'm a boxer guy So, you know, I don't know how what's up works But apparently if you add me as a contact first and then text it then it'll communicate with you and it works better that way So that's that's rumor on the streets from all my what's up. It's what's up, right? Not many chat I get what's up any chat mixed up every time. So I nailed I said it right. What's up? Let's go. So anyway, we're gonna cue the video It's like two minutes long It's gonna explain how to text to get on texting list and tell you about the prize as soon as we get to 50,000 people on texting Let's we're doing a five-day console.
