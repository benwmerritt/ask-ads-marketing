I have a calling. Yesterday I realized I have to do this. Well today, today is the day that you change the world. ClickFunnels was built to remove the barriers to entrepreneurship so that dreamers can become doers. So that those of us who are crazy enough to believe that we can change the world, we actually can. And as that world changes, so do we. With over $10 billion generated by our users, we are so proud of what we built and we're excited to reintroduce ourselves. Hi, we're ClickFunnels. And when someone says, what's a funnel? We say, what is it? Everything is. It's how you make decisions on a daily basis. You're constantly funneling all of your activities through a journey to achieve the desired result. So in that sense, funnels are actually a mindset that lets you see every tangible opportunity for growth and continuous revenue. A funnel in the digital space is something that grabs your customers' hands and leads them directly to the products that they actually need and want. ClickFunnels is the only platform that empowers you to do this at scale. When you see it, you are going to love it. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just getting started, ClickFunnels is easier to use and more powerful than ever before. This is going to be a game changer. My first funnel made what my business would normally do for half a year. I was stunned. Starting my own business really was a liberating experience. Absolutely life-changing. It feels like a movement, to be honest. It's a whole new way to look at funnels. You don't have to go through it alone. It's not just the tool. You've got a whole community coming with it. You don't have to worry about the technology. We'll handle that for you. Don't worry about becoming a great marketer. With our education and strategies, you'll unlock that. We've been completely reimagining how we serve you, our users. You'll notice the difference right away. And the way the platform looks, how it feels, and how intuitive it is. I can create from beginning to end my product, the funnel, now with frameworks and copy-paste that same framework and offer it to your audience. The resources you have access to, that's what makes it different. This is ClickFunnels for the next generation. And we're excited to see how you'll use it to change the world in your own way. We have an incredible lineup of new features to roll out. Features that you've asked for. In corporate America, you're just a number. So to have a development team that literally will sit down with you and have conversations about what can I do to make your life easier is massive. You don't find that in any other company. I'm blown away by the loyalty they have to their customer base. The rebrand of our software isn't just about the looks. It's about you, the funnel hackers. So you can take your marketing to new heights. Where software, education, and community can all be found in one place. It's hitting at the mission of making millions of entrepreneurs. I just can't imagine a better life. My plans are to go show my son the world. I love ClickFunnels because it's all my people. I'm so grateful to be a part of this family. It's pretty amazing. I want to invite you to see it for yourself. Explore the new features. Build your first or your next funnel. And remember, you're only one funnel away. Thank you.
