If I had to predict where I would be one year from the day I signed up to join Russell's mastermind, I could never have predicted the growth. It has been a life changing experience. Funnel Hacking Live is an event that is put on by Russell Brunson, where he shares with internet entrepreneurs exactly how to accelerate their success by using a software that he created called ClickFunnels to create websites that actually make sales in a very easy way for people who are looking to succeed online. ClickFunnels came out of nowhere. They took the marketplace by storm just like Apple did when they first launched the iPhone. It was not a linear move anymore. It was a quantum move, an improvement that opened up a gap to allow people just like you and me who are not technically savvy. We weren't born in the matrix and we didn't have a chip implanted in our heads. We were not engineers or computer science majors. An opportunity to cut and decrease the time of stress and anxiety and suffering behind a keyboard. Trust me. You can talk bad about my mama, but you cannot talk bad about ClickFunnels because what ClickFunnels has done for my business, I can't even begin to tell you. Russell just make it so simple for anybody to just instantly get it. So authentic. One of the most genuinely nice individuals and human beings you will ever meet. Breaks it down really easy. He's just a risk taker. He's a mover and a shaker. The first time I spoke with him, you know, immediately I knew I was playing small. We took these guys to exotic car racing place. What's better than getting an exotic car? It's called dream racing, right? Like all it is is a dream in some people's mind. Being able to go to the dream racing track, the exotic track and get into a Lamborghini and get into an Aston Martin. And what it sees is you tell it either it's going to be a dream or it's going to be a reality and it's really up to you. Russell was running a contest. It was going to give his Ferrari F430. All's I did was tell the world about this awesome book and I got this Ferrari, which is absolutely ridiculous. It instills in you that necessity to really give to other people. I think we're over $25,000 right now for world teacher aid. Every single funnel that gets created, a dollar gets donated to world teacher aid. I think Russell was able to raise money for two schools and that's huge. They were all excited to be there and excited to be in that room. Being an entrepreneur, I would say it's like the loneliest job in the world because it's kind of you and your thoughts and you see other people and you kind of connect. We're not like in a real way with them. I like bringing people together. It just gives you the ability to be around other people who are like you, who think like you and who believe like you. And for me, every time I get around good entrepreneurs, my vision gets bigger. You literally sit next to people who are doing a million dollars, other people who are just brand new. Everyone who's here, they want to share and they want to see everyone else succeed. I come to a live event where Russell can guide me, where people next to me are smarter than me. And they share information that's absolutely priceless. I wanted real ClickFunnels members to come in and to speak. This funnel type of stuff is what I did, how I did it, how I'm making 100 grand a month. And all of a sudden it becomes real. You get to hear more stories and more action plans, more principles to business. In the trenches, what's working now, information. You want results faster? Here's a faster hack. Go this way. Here's the concept and then boom, here's it. Here's it working for someone just like you. And that was my favorite part. It will accelerate your success like nothing else out there.
