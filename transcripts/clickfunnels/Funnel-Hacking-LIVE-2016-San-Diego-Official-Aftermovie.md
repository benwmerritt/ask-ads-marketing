There's just been so many tools out there. ClickFunnels is an amazing software that allows you to sell a product online quicker and faster than anything you've ever seen in your life. This is a simple way of making pages that convert, you know, I mean they're like business-oriented templates that already start beautiful, but that you can very easily customize. It also takes an hour or two, it takes three hours and I have a whole funnel belt and then I just go. You know in one day you can get that idea, you can be live. You can take that idea out of your head and you can actually make it real. Author, speakers, high-end coaching. We do marketing products for real estate agents. T-shirts. Every kind of person is here and it's awesome. Whenever we think about hacks, tips and tricks, right, it's like the fast way to do it. It's about taking best practices from people who have already proven what works. Funnel hacking isn't about stealing, it's about modeling and creating your own spin on something that's already working. I think entrepreneurship is being hacked here. It's people who are doing stuff. Every single session that I've been in has pretty much been a standing ovation. The caliber of speakers, Marcus Lamones, Sean Stevenson, Russell has those people here at the event. Russell Bronson he genuinely wants to make a difference in the lives of many, many, many, many people. He gets more excited about the success of others than he does about his own success. He really cares about the bigger picture in terms of where this is all going. He's helping tens of thousands of people grow businesses. The event is where you get clarity and courage to get confidence to do what I know I need to do. I was from Christchurch, New Zealand, no one knew me and now I have a global audience. Literally been the impetus between my business not even being at a multi-six figure level in six months. Couldn't have done that with the yellow pages. I see opportunity, I see all of the open potential and horizons that are at my fingertips. It's just way more than the platform itself. You can fast track your way to success.
