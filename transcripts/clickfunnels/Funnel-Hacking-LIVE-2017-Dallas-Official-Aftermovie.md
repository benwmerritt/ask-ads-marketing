I'd like to thank you for joining us on this trip when we were looking forward to seeing you on the... All it takes is one great idea, one big thing that's implemented and everybody's just one funnel away from having the life they've always wanted. You're just one funnel away from becoming a weight loss coach, becoming a best seller, becoming a company with a foundation. A funnel is what builds your business now. I don't think there's a business alive that this would not be transformed by. As soon as you walk into the hotel, you just feel this overwhelming energy. One thing I can say about funnel hacking live, I know this is going to be one of those hub spots where leaders in our industry come together, where the gurus all come together. All of these people are hustlers, everybody is working on something. So there's this camaraderie that you can't find anywhere else. But all going after the exact same mission, which is impact and income. The people in our industry doing so many different sorts of things, crushing it, your beliefs are built up as far as possible. The go-getters, the people getting it done, the people that you feel like, man, I can never connect with them. You know, they're here. You're not only getting people who all consume and play off the same playbook, they're showing you specific examples of it in action, and it's not theoretical. Everything actually works. He brings in the best of the best. You get these people that are worth millions of dollars, and they're just sharing with you their tips and their strategies, and you just grow exponentially. It's electrifying. You got to be around people that are killing it so that you can continue to kill it, and you can grow and do even greater things. This two-comma club, that basically means that I've sold over a million dollars online. So imagine you're getting this platinum plaque if you were a Grammy award-winning artist who sold a million copies, but instead you sold a million dollars to click funnels. In this room alone, there's literally over a hundred millionaires, and if that doesn't speak to why everyone should be here, I don't know what will. Russell gives you the education with his product. He'll take complex things, and he'll make them very easy to understand and most important, implement. He legitimately is here to help entrepreneurs create amazing lives. He has the biggest heart. If you want to make money and you want to make a difference, this is the perfect event for you. We are funnel hackers.
