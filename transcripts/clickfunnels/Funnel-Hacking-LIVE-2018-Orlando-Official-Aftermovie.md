## Transcript
When we're growing up, we learn a lot of things about life from life that are just not true. Six days a week, one day off a week, one week off every six months. And I wish I had someone to educate me that college was going to bring me food stamps. Now I know some of you are feeling that indecision, that uncertainty. Well today, today is the day that you change the world. It starts small by admitting that there's something that you want to do and you don't know how to do it. Some of you are not willing to be bad at something long enough to get good at it. After all the money invested, after all the time, after all the hope, I'm in the same place. But here's what's interesting, when you make a decision and when you become something else, it's much easier the next time. Because we are crazy, agreed? That's what we do. That's entrepreneurs. We explore. It is easy to assume that it's talent. I don't believe in talent. I believe in good habits. If you know that your thing can truly help people, it's your duty to make sure as many people get it as possible. It reminds them of their journey and where they're at and that they can keep moving forward. And they're counting on you. And that's why we get up every morning and create a new reality, come back to the present and insist it becomes real. You don't have to be me, but there is one game that you cannot lose in. Like me, little old me, a stay-at-home mom, history major from college, didn't know anything about fitness. One year ago, I was sitting in your seat at the last Funnel Hacker in life. And the lesson is like, this is your family and your new home. It started with the people. You have to take that identity as a Funnel Hacker and you have to say, magnitude of the pain will equal the magnitude of the reward. It has to be that way. My funnels work because I work. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. We're the ones that are crazy if you go out there and try to change things. Like a good Funnel Hacker, I said, I can, I will end of story. That's what we're here to do today. I meant what I said about you up there. I don't say things lightly. I have such respect for your restaurant. And what I love that you're doing now is you're teaching them to be givers and seeing the value of that and getting hooked on that to me. That's what's important to me. So congratulations to them. Thank you.
