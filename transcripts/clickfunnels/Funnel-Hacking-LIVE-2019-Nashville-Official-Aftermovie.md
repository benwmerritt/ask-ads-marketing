I went through probably 12 business tries and they were all complete failures. I kept getting the questions from relatives, is this the one that you're going to be successful with? And I spent many years growing a few businesses and just struggling, feeling completely alone, isolated, you know, my head down to the grindstone, hoping to figure out the way. I came to Click Funnels like a little boy finding a flashlight in the woods, lost at night. It's been a flashlight for us. It's brought us home. Being in the same room with the software company and the teaching and the coaching that freed me from the bonds of debt, it was really, really emotional. It was intense. I felt a little internal nudge. I couldn't explain it. I knew if I got in the room for hacking live, things would change. I didn't know what to expect. I was really excited to just see what this whole world is about. I am a college student. The only reason I'm here is because I begged my parents to buy me the ticket for Christmas. Getting here the first day and I came like, this is an internet marketing conference. It was thousands of people. From the moment you walk in the door, there's heart, there's family, there's community. It is like walking into your own ecosystem. And I see all these individuals from different walks of lives and they're just like, how are you? What's your name? What do you do? Even though we're all coming from different businesses doing different things, you've never met somebody but you have this commonality. So much personality, so much expression and people tie their hair different colors and wearing crazy suits. People are dancing on stage when you come in early in the morning. So I have a marketing degree and I have no idea what I learned in it. No marketing skills, no business skills of any kind. Yeah, I got my whole money's worth off the first speech of the first day. And I called my dad and I said, no, like this was worth more than the entire five years I spent. Somebody asked me yesterday, who was your favorite speaker? And I said in regards to what? Being able to get around six, seven, eight, nine figure earner, you can't put a price on that. Russell's not just someone who's passionate about sharing. What he's done is just revolutionize the industry and he's just on a mission to allow people to go faster. What's the new thing? How does it work? How do we integrate it? How do we deploy it? How do we explain it to people? It's not a possibility anymore. It's a reality. When they describe ClickFunnels as a family, it doesn't make sense till you have been here. It's people who are just as crazy and obsessed as me. There's 4,500 people here today that want to make a difference. It's mission and money and you need them both. That's what ClickFunnels really stands for. The truth is, is amazing things happen when you're willing to do it. You see possibilities that you never could have seen. You can excel that business. God, it's like pinch me. Is this real? Life just changed. It's just fun. It's a phenomenon. It's an oasis, man. It feels like family. It feels like home. It's blessed to be a part of it. And the gift of that, the gift of that, that's everything.
