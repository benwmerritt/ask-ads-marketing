Anyone can fly a plane when the weather is nice. But when it gets real cloudy and foggy, if you don't know how to read the instruments, you're going to die. You're in the greatest economy in history. Winter is coming. I was 21 years old, and I had suddenly become a single mom. I actually slept half in a closet on an air mattress that deflated every night. This is with a degree. This is what Brian looks like. Dream house, dream car, but I wasn't truly free. You know, I was not proud of what I was doing, and honestly I was not very proud of who I was. I don't know what to do next. I don't know where to go. And it really starts to become real that I have all these big dreams, but I don't actually know how to make them come true. And so this is the truth that we were stuck in day after day after day. And we knew something would have to change. But I'm going to tell you something. It's hard if you fail and it's hard if you succeed. Success is hard on the front end and easy on the back end. Failure is easy on the front end and hard on the back end. You can't pick whether or not it's hard. Just pick which hard you want. Oh my God! I want to invite you to realize it takes time. Maybe your first shot, maybe your first business isn't going to work. Maybe it's about taking multiple shots. There was a process of putting myself out there. There was a grind and everyone was looking at me like I was completely crazy. When you realize something is possible, it unlocks. Something inside of you that allows you to give the effort to actually make it happen. There's a power that can transform anyone's life. The very few people who even know about it, much less use it. It's the power of self-education. Alright number two, I want to talk about market selection. I'm going to teach you how to create six months of content in three days. I'm going to tell you exactly how to go viral. This is a tip that got me from the million likes to the 10 million likes. The 6th step science of design hacking. So this is my freedom formula. How do you get those types of results? How do you become a superhero? There's always another chapter. There's always redemption. Sometimes we're forced into our calling. Even though it wasn't ready, what did I still say? And because I said yes today, I am in front of you. Make some noise! Make some noise! All the people that come to funnel hacking live, they're entrepreneurs, right? You guys were born as entrepreneurs, but you're here today because of a choice you made. A lot of people hear the entrepreneurial call, but a lot of people don't listen to that. They ignore it and they forget about it. The fact that you guys are here in this room means you heard the call and then you made a choice. You said, look, I'm going to do something about it. I'm going to start a business. I'm going to take this idea. I'm going to take this thing. I'm going to create it. I'm going to do something different. So while you're an entrepreneur at birth, you are a funnel hacker by choice.
