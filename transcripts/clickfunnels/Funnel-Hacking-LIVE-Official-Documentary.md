And I just made a look as close to his as possible because he was the dude who was making a munch of money I was watching right. And because I had followed his process it started making money.

We do hands on stuff, we teach you usable things that you can do right now with our software and products to grow and progress your business. But we also come in with the motivation, excitement and the culture and the community around you. Repeat after me, say it, hey rustling Todd!We're ready for you to show us what's new with click funnels. Ladies and gentlemen Russell Brunson and Todd Jefferson.My name is Melanie Neuven.I am Russell's executive assistant and I plan all of our events. I don't have a title for that, but I pretend it's director of events. Because they took some small school earned They took big chours. It's a student business. Jade Themask and whoして she's friend would also like you feeling they could bring some sign in or through literature I am sure he's been a European man Now they love from this little for a look and obey Ms.구요 distaste Andrew a few years ago when he told me he was mor perspectives. from san diego on to where are we in Nashville. This is the hardest part for sure getting the concepts out, when I was like brute force of like giving into a thing. So like mentally I would say I'm probably 90% done physically or probably like 20% done physically. It works out all the time though. Russell getting his presentations done is the most stressful for me because I like to make sure he has that time blocked out but he usually works on them a week or two before the event. So it's fresh in his mind and I understand that like the first y-ye I did this event I died in. We're out of Whiteboard or Whiteboard Whiteboard Whiteboard these are allフレッシュ out.лек up.

You have to go thru. Make sure the hotel has the right check-in dates... check-out dates, names and the type of room. So I just want to go through a few last-minute things for funnel hiking live. His says the 18. We need to update that so it shows the 17th. Okay. Because I think their meeting is... Let's make a note where your quip. Send me who's bringing with him because I don't know if it's like a wife and kid. You know what I mean? So I'm waiting to hear back that's the only outstanding one I have right now. It's all going way worked out, got away. It does. I'm just getting a little nervous. Yeah. Just let me know what I can do to help. Unless you can sew shirts and make b zatena box. Last minute. My name is Miles Clifford and I am the events manager at ClickFunnels. So after last year Funnel Hacking Live I took over the events team. So it's taking you know Russell's idea and his concepts and Dave. And the other partners what their vision is for Funnel Hacking Live and executing on that vision. �� zĺba Eso d Financial's cheese to the hotel rooms to the staging, the lighting, the experiences that people have at the hotel during the event off the event that's what the event team does. So The fastest way is come out here. We're going to turn left and then we turn right. What really helped with this event was going and seeing the site. Isn't it cool here? So our staff did. Melanie and a couple of other team members came down here. Did a site visit when you don't do that. You're going in blind and you never want to go into an event blind.

Well we're brought in another speaker, we're brought in a big famous speaker in, and like, we don't have the budget to bring you in now, and I'm thinking, like, how is that my problem? And I said. Well, dude, listen. I don't speak that off anymore. That's my fee. I would love to be there for you, maybe next year. And that was it. was it? Remember that, it was very clear. And, I get a text message a few hours later from this adorable clean cuck Mormon, right? And he just writes me, screw it! I'll pay out of my own pocket, let's do this. And I'm like that's awesome. That's awesome because what I saw from Russell in that moment was devotion, not commitment but devotion.

Math. nde of all the things we do, nde fun-lacking live nde is probably the most important, most valuable thing we produce, we put on. nde the problem is that it's also of everything we sell, by far the hardest thing to sell. You think about software information products, nde it's like an impulse buy, right? nde this is not an impulse buy nde it's not an impulse buy because someone's got to go nde they have to get work off nde they've convinced their spouse  finances maybe should just for kids and got a flight two hotels and there's ー so many more decisions ー that are made ー not just one ー and so for us it's ー like a constant grind ー to sell tickets. ー Every year how ー are you going to ー sell ー 4500 tickets ー how are you going to ー sell 600 tickets ー how ー we going to sell ー you know ー 2000 tickets ー and it's just ー always an ー impossible ー task that ー ends up happening. ー I'm John Parks ー and I'm theー ー VP of Traffic at ClickFunnels ー and what that means is that ー ー ー I run ー all the advertising in ー the social media ー nd that whole department to make sure that there's always lots of excited people coming in the doors. nd there's data retargeting, there's a website retargeting. nd this is that they watch a portion of the video. nd once they opt in or become your data. nd we did some really fun things. One thing we did was a telephone where we set up a table full of nd we actually had a full telephone system going and broadcasted this streaming live since we don't have a TV station. nd we did it live into our Facebook channels and into our YouTube and it was Russell teaching just fantastic content and the whole time was like if you like what we're teaching here you'll definitely like fun like you live because that's even more of the same value. nd so that connection was really strong and then we're just giving away tons of prizes. nd this is one of those things that could be like the most brilliant marketing idea in the history of marketing as we know it or it could be the biggest thing we know. nd we're live. nd we're live. What's up everybody. nd we're welcome to our first ever and maybe last ever we'll find out afterwards. nd we're live on the telephone. nd that was really fun and not only did we sell a good block of tickets during the telethon. nd we're able to reuse that recorded video of the telethon over time to sell a bunch of tickets. nd as we know there's very few people who will just buy a $1000 ticket in the drop of a hat. nd so we knew retargeting was going to be our biggest strategy so coming back in front of them and giving them more reasons or more understanding or more emotion to get them to actually buy that ticket. nd so we went for 10 days and then we just stopped. nd logic, emotion, scarcity, urgency. nd we were hitting the spectrums so it was really fun. nd my gosh anytime you can sell tickets and have fun doing it and get the whole the cool thing is just from a it's your culture standpoint. nd people are like what the heck are you guys doing? nd blowing up like the ones who invent new marketing. nd he's interesting to bring it out and everyone's like Jim Edwards is just like that was awesome. nd I feel like we're at the top of our game right now and everything we do is like unique and innovative and people seem like whoa. nd you'll see dice doing this. nd you'll see traffic inversion. nd there's a discounting ticket. nd we increase the value of the price so that's the difference. nd our first event that I did I think cost us maybe half a million dollars if that to where now you know just the food bill is half a million dollars. nd enjoy the food because it's not cheap. nd I am Clint Adams. nd I am the director of accounting and finance officially on the org chart though my title changes depending on what I need to do and who I'm talking to. nd we went from registering 600 people my first year to 4000 or more this last year and we've gone from essentially half a million dollars to over 2 million as we've grown the event. nd we've probably quadrupled our costs mostly the hotel. nd San Diego was selected before I came into the role but I know that there was a lot of internet marketers down in San Diego and it's an easy flight for us the location was perfect. nd it was a beautiful hotel right on the marina there. nd the hotel size was perfect like we just took over pretty much the whole hotel in event space it was a fun first event to put on. nd we went to Dallas and Dallas was a location we wanted to try just because it is kind of like in the middle a little bit more and the space was a little bit more. nd the space to fit 2500 people too and we had dinners that we did onsite and so we just needed to make sure we were able to take over plenty of that hotel. nd then from Dallas we went to Orlando and the reason why we went to Orlando is because we were growing quite a bit bigger. nd our concern was we were going to have to go to a convention center and that's not the look I love like when I do an event I want everyone to feel there somewhere special. nd if I went to a convention center I'm putting another $200,000 into an event that needs to be made pretty. nd when you get it right off the bed at the hotel. nd typically our hotels maybe a little over a million dollars we went from being the small town event trying to find people to please help us throw this event to now we have the audio video crew they went from you know 50 60 to now they're several hundred thousand dollars. nd we've got probably 40 45 guys in here right now on and off throughout the day we've got about 1000 feet of trust close to 200 moving lights. nd about 80 non moving static lights 65 foot wide by 18 foot tall video wall a concert PA coverage is going to be a hell of a show man. nd it's going to help create an environment right it's going to be creating an environment for all the attendees who are coming here to learn and pick up knowledge over the next few days it'll be good. nd listen it creates an atmosphere it creates an energy. nd sure you could disseminate a message with just screens and projectors are over the cases but you're trying to create a movement. nd how you can do it with a webinar if that's if you want to go basic enough right but you're trying to create a movement get 4000 people motivated behind one one concept and that's what you're going to be able to do with this room so. nd you name it we got a lot of movement parks in here. nd amazing how you doing. nd you have pop it all up. nd yeah yeah we are. nd 15 minutes we're taking all out hotel really kind of things you have to hold me real it's all the stuff. nd hotel does the trust in the motors everything else we trucked in earlier today they were like 653 foot trailers out of the. nd what is happening just for context purposes our very first event I don't think we had any rigging at all. nd I think it was with 600 people we didn't there was no rigging we had the definitely wasn't too set to screen we had. nd we had a Ferrari and a Corvette there. nd we had tape to the crowd. nd it's bigger but hopefully still feel super intimate because everything's going to be. nd it's like seven and a half times what we had the first time huge. nd we want to have been able to scale to a 4000 person or more event without Sage and so that's been the one big cost the amount of pressure stress on us knowing that we have the Sage crew there to support and help us help us immensely. nd my goal with you today is just to give you some really macro level overviews on what we're going to do together this week and give you some context of what's happening behind the scenes because I think it makes your job so much easier. nd I'm very bomb gardener and I am the founder and executive producer at Sage event management. nd we're the event production company behind funnel hacking live. nd almost always for our clients money is almost secondary they really care about impact. nd I think about live events and how we're designing them the clients we work with we're always starting with what kind of impact we want to make how are we going to design the coaching program to deliver that and then how are we going to reverse engineer the live event to deliver the coaching program. nd one of the things that I really liked about how this event worked is even though we were at this massive property when you came into this event you started to recognize little touches like wait a second. nd when you walked in and you start talking to the people that you're interacting with at the front desk they're wearing click funnels hats the TVs behind the front desk are showing a loop of previous click funnels events as you start to walk to your room there's signage all over the place that's click funnels branding from our perspective community building is one of the most important things you do at a live event everywhere they went we wanted them to feel like yes we're funnel hackers one of them to be really super psyched to be part of this tribe. nd that was a big thing that we did this year there was a lot invested by Russell and the team in branding and in print. nd we've never done anything to that skill which is amazing that I want to say was 30 40 thousand dollars to get all that done maybe a little more. nd it's all of a sudden like you're no longer at a gay lord property you're actually at the click funnels hotel. nd if you want to create a culture and you want to create a community branding isn't just your logo whatever you're selling whether it's your info product or your actual physical product if you want people to expect a high perceived value of what you do you can send that message by giving them high quality apparel and promotional products up front. nd my name is Brandon Pugmeyer and I am the owner of a company called imprint city actually have been working with the Russell team before click funnels began of course back then the orders weren't quite as big. nd we did t-shirts begin with and then we started doing long sleeve t-shirts people wanted some hoodies water bottles you know hats that was pretty cool and then the backpacks we sold out of them in the first day and a half. nd one thing I've learned from Russell when he was coming to me and asking for options he originally is like hey we want the most expensive t-shirts available and I was showing him other options like no I want the best quality. nd the other thing I think that that click funnels is done at first they they had some messages on their shirts that was really about click funnels the messages have morphed to where the message on the click funnel shirts is the message that the client or the customer the user of the t-shirts. nd click funnels it's their message too and when you can connect the message of your client in your message it's a home run. nd a lot of companies put their logo on the shirt and they give it out but when you give out a shirt that's actually hey this is a shirt I want to wear because this is my message this is who I am like funnel hacker I'm a funnel hacker. nd a lot of the shirts Russell does he'll put a manifesto on it that that kind of has a philosophy behind it that the person wearing it's like that is cool. nd click funnels it's a shared message with the user and so when you can combine the company message with the user message and you put them into one it's perfect. nd surround yourself with the dreamers the doers the believers and the thinkers most of all surround yourself with those who see greatness within you even when you don't see yourself which is what families all about so this is what the community is about is you know yourself surround yourself with amazing people believe in you. nd one of the things that you guys are best at we saw this last year is just extraordinary customer care like you care deeply you're really committed to the brand and the changing lives and when you come into an event feeling that way the attendees feel it and it makes a huge difference. nd what's happening today that's really critical is registration and this is one of your first touch point moments the person who you're seeing at registration left behind a family or a dog or kids or clients. nd they had to get on a plane or get in a car they had to pack the bag there's been some sacrifice for them to get here they may have also incurred delays at the airport delays with the pickup delays and checking into their room by the time they get to you. nd I promise you whatever has stood in their way has started to build up and be like I sure hope this is worth it I knew I know this was a mistake. nd I shouldn't have even have come this is going to be a whole challenging week and we have to remind them at registration that they made the right choice. nd I really see registration as right choice moment like that kind of energy is welcome to the family we're so happy you're here how did you get here where did you come from what made you decide to come for those of you who are floating during registration having those conversations can be the difference between standing in a dull line and having an inliving conversation that reminded you of why this is the right choice. nd we have 50 people in mind we haven't even started. nd oh my goodness look at all those look at all those people Dan. nd should we get a big. nd early bird. nd we're going to like that we like a big early bird who rock over here. nd look at Dan. nd I'm going to. nd I'm going to. nd when attendees are coming in Robbie's on the front lines if you don't know Robbie summer seat is the loudest person I've ever met. nd I don't know where he gets it from it is Wednesday fun hacking live we're ready to rock our employees feed off of that and then the attendees feed off those employees and they feed off of Robbie so rule number one get a hype man or one. nd I did. nd so once they get past Robbie like then it's our the rest of our staff like our job is to have that smiling face to keep that excitement up. nd yes. nd I am. nd I'm going to be in the two college club next year baby two college club. nd I'm sorry I'm sorry excitement is contagious. nd we got to be like hey you're here for fun hacking live that's so amazing like registration is right down there after that you're going to go get your amazing swag bag check out this shirt this is sure you guys are getting this year. nd I'm excited because they've gone through a lot of stuff to get to that event so you've got to get that energy up the second they walk in the register. nd you know our whole goal and mission while we're at that event is to make it the best experience for every single attendee and if we're not keeping that energy up if we're not excited if we're not pumped if we're not loving what we're doing they sense that and their energy falls. nd so once you register these people come in they have their name badge they have their swag bag they now have their shirt like they're ready to go they're sitting there they're hanging out the excitement keeps building and building and building. nd all of a sudden our registration that's supposed to be a boring process this tiny process just to get them to the event is now like one of the coolest things they've seen in that day zero like we haven't even started the event or just jack to be there and just keeps growing and growing and growing. nd all of a sudden our doors are getting backed up and backed up and backed up we got people yelling louder and louder and louder to communicate with everybody telling them hey we're going to be open to the door soon and then finally get that call this time hey knock on the doors from the inside we open it up people free can just rush in like crazy everybody's losing the mind their staff losing the mind. nd the attendees are losing their mind music blasting it's even louder than it was before. nd literally all that starts from registration so boring simple process for what it's supposed to be is not that way of fun or hacking life. nd we start midday here on day one so you've got more registration and then we get to our opening. nd the opening is where Russell will really kick it off and set the tone for the event with the help of Devon who's going to take the stage first and get that crowd going. nd this is not about reading cue cards if you want to get Bob from accounting to come on stage and read a cue card because he's good at the Christmas parties hey you have at it your events probably going to suck I don't mean to sound mean but that's not what this is about. nd get on your feet and welcome to the stage or MC for the event. nd my job is to be the through line through the entire event from start to finish so I'm the very first person your audience sees and I'm probably the very last person they see. nd before every speaker after every speaker before every break I'm giving them instructions and so if I can't build rapport with them then I might as well not even try. nd the letters MC normally stand for master of ceremonies I would say that my real role is more like an M.E. which is the master of energy. nd I want you to think of me kind of like your event coach it's to be the through line from speaker to speaker to speaker to speaker to speaker to speaker to speaker. nd it's to tell the audience is what you need to do here's where you need to be etc etc etc it's to say here's how what this speaker is speaking about here's how this is important to the entire event. nd give yourself a round of applause for being sexy. nd you didn't tell Bob to do all that all you told Bob was to do is introduce speakers so Bob is going to go up and read the cue cards reading cue cards is not room management. nd reading cue cards is not feeling the room feeling what's going on being able to engage in have fun with the crowd. nd reading the cue cards is giving up for the last speaker our next speaker is Mary and she wrote three books and she's really great give it up for Mary. nd how was that it was what you told Bob to do so you can't get mad at Bob for that. nd yeah that's what I would say about Bob from accounting. nd when you hire people who have the experience then what you're really paying for are all of the things that you don't know that you don't know. nd they're hiring for that very first consultation that says stop right there your schedule is off from the jump because you said 9 10 11 12 and schedules don't work like that. nd you're hiring somebody to go out there read the energy in the room realize that the last speaker was a snooze and that's OK because he or she was talking about something very technical cool not mad at that. nd throw the cue card out the window find out the essence of what the speakers going to speak about and communicate that in such a way that wakes the audience to hell back up that's what you're paying for. nd those are the intangibles those are the oh my gosh I didn't even know that I needed that yes yes yes yes yes so like you get what you pay for. nd the most important time for the event MC 60% of my work is done in the first 15 minutes on day number one the very first time I go on stage that first 15 minutes sets the tone for everything. nd I will do an exercise with the audience where I'm going to say welcome to the stage and what you're going to do is you have to stand up and you have to go crazy and you have to respond the way as if I'm bringing you to the stage and showing me how you would want the crowd to react when you're on stage. nd so we'll do that exercise and that starts me training them so now the expectation is set before the event kicks off that this is how we introduce the speakers so it's trained. nd so it's trained so much that even if I get to a speaker later on in the day and I forget to tell them to stand up they've already been trained to stand up. nd I don't believe in talent I believe in good habits and all of us can choose good habits stop waiting to be happy start generating happy decide I'm going to do this or I'm going to die working on it stop letting yourself off the hook and be willing to go down so you can go up spend $50 make 500 that's the funnel guys know we got more we got more but. nd the day that we have the idea for click funnels we sat in a room for about a week white boarding out the whole vision of it and on the way taking him back to the airport he's flying back home where he lives in Atlanta. nd one thing before we got out of the car he said hey really quick though if we're going to do this whole click funnel thing I don't want to be like an employee I want to be your partner. nd I remember being so scared like I don't know if I like I'm entrepreneur I control everything all the time I was so scared and in that moment I made the second greatest decision in my life outside of marrying my wife. nd I told him yes. nd that man is Todd Dickerson who's my co founder and partner in click funnels. nd get taught a huge round of applause stand up come on out. nd what's up. nd man wow what's up final hackers. nd so my role going into funnel hacking live is still very much behind the scenes other than one presentation that Russell and I do just about every year and we actually talk about things that have happened over the past year and things that we're planning to do going forward in the next year. nd click funnels event we always do a presentation we call the click funnel stay the union address. nd I think that most software companies events are literally only focused on kind of the state of the union aspect. nd they get up there and that's all they talk about they're like okay we got these features we got this product got this thing we're doing and then it's like have a good day see you guys that's what Apple does right like Apple gets up on stage here's the things we're releasing here's the timelines that you're going to see them coming out see you guys later everybody's excited is cool. nd we focus more on actually like the whole experience. nd we say like oh so this is a problem and like here's the solution but instead it's like you asked the problem. nd I because I'm like here's a problem we saw like and that's how I was praising it first and I'm like but that's just a sound it sounds dumb. nd let's do like I'll play like dumb like oh well guess what we're doing guess what we're working on that. nd that's cool I like that that helped me because I was a little concerned about this because I'll be going for like 120 slides like if you look at each one of these features. nd I'm like I'll be going for like 120 slides like if you look at each one of these features. nd these are whole companies it's all built in to work together and as fast as we expanded we expanded in the number of users that rely on this software we're running 77000 companies not one. nd yeah no pressure right this is the thing I need your help with you talk about some new features and new things stuff they're creating stuff they're thinking about stuff that's already live but I need your guys's feedback to know like what you want the most. nd that's what we need and the louder the screams the more likely we are to create that first cheer as loud as you possibly can for the features you want next and then we'll prioritize based on the loudness of the room that sound fair it's a good way to do a roadmap right. nd the sub users project has to be live at funnel hacking live no questions asked like we promised it last year if there's anything that's going to block us from actually making this in progress turned to completed in the next. nd few weeks like we've got to make that happen so see if there's any other ones like that that's basically what we've got to go through here and find now. nd I always want to focus on making sure users know that we're listening to him so we always we take feature request all year long listen to customer support request it's connected everything's done that's all you got to do that simple. nd the event gives us a chance to actually tell people that we're listening and show them that we're listening and we may think that we have the best idea in the world but that's not always the case sometimes we just need to listen to the customers and hear what they're saying. night by mistake day 2 is more of the same an typical stage event is 3 days so I also look at this, ass like kind of a bonus day of content connection and community like our average host doesn't have the stamina for 4 days. nd really truly and I think Russell is a force of nature. All right so we've got stage at play 2 Nope I'm feeling a little sick Supersor and my friends told me that the best thing to do when you're on stage every day is do an chamukng live. on j Officer videos I'll be right there. I'll be right there. I'll psychologically move into it and completely surrender. And like, sort of gently scan your body and just let all attention go. Yes. The biohacker bridge delivery service. And it's like you'll be in this very stressful situation for other people. But you're training your mind and your body and your nervous system to remain calm. And then you'll feel the benefit afterwards. You'll have this uplift in energy and mood. But it also translates to real life. Things roll off your shoulders more easily. Stay more cool, calm and collected because you've trained it. We're going for 45 degrees. Are you gonna go next? Maybe. It really does. It's two minutes that pays dividends for a day. Perfect. I'd say that's about 38 degrees right now. Yeah. You're getting a breeze. You got it. Go ahead and get it. Take deep breath. Four of the targets. Four of the targets. Oh my gosh. There you go. Good. Find your breath. Ah, there's a bad part. You got it. Oh my gosh. Good job. Good. Take deep breath and slow it down. Mind over mass. Slow it down. There you go. Ouch. Relax your face. Good. You're doing great. You're doing great. You're a warrior. Wait. I'm going. There we go. One, two, three. Oh my gosh. You got this. Don't think about it. You got it. You got it. You're a man. Nice. Good job. Push it out. Big one in belly expands. Hold. Push it out. Ahhhh. Wooo. That was great. Think of your husband. I think he's crazy. But biohacking seems to work. So might as well do what you have to do when you're on stage for all those hours of driving. What we're doing here to me is a bonus day of extra content connection and community. Because we're doing that same thing here. And then what we do at the end of day two is super important. It's called round tables. And round tables, much like Rolodex, are all about connection and community. Because what happens there is you have your students, your speakers, your trusted advisors in a room, at a table. And any person can go sit down and ask these superstars anything they want to. But it started off first year. We called it a hackathon back then. It was people coming in with their computer getting together, working on their funnels. And having support people there to help launch that right then in real time. My name is Brent Kopeters. And I'm VP of coaching and events at ClickFunnels. Year two we started round tables. And what it is, we literally have round tables in a room. And we invite some funnel hackers that have had success to sit at a round table. And it allows for our members to build, come in and sit down and ask questions to these experts. And these are all people who have had success using our software. And we thought, you know, what a better way to have people build, to ask questions and model what they were doing. It's a refreshing build to rub shoulders with people who've been there. They've gone through what you're going through and they can empathize. Just a really interactive experience. So a really cool thing that we added more recently from Funnel Hack and Live was our funnel Rolodex. My mouth is hope you're doing good. I've got really cool ideas I want to run by you. Let me know you get a chance and come in and communicate about it. People that we partner up, people who sell services or help build funnels for folks come in and they can be able to kind of explain what they do and essentially offer their services to the members of our community. So if you're looking for someone who does video work, you're looking for someone who can build funnels, you're looking for someone who can be a potential accountant or someone who can keep your books, you can find that at the Rolodex event. It just helps people get clarity and they're finally able to build their funnels. You know, it's really cool from Hack and Live, you know, you're in the general session room for most of the days. But we always typically have after hours or late night type of activities. And all the funnels are inside with some beverages and food and people. We are the champions and have thegebob некоторates. And we have arrived. All the funnels are inside with some beverages and food and people. Ḁ្្ក្កំ ះ្្្ក្ក្កំ ៀ្ក្្ក្ក្ក្ក្ � ndaibol time that you have with your members in your community nd you need to take every advantage you have with that nd it really will make a way better experience for them nd it's proving that way for us. nd the other day, looking at feedback from post events nd networking is so huge, that's what people want. nd they want a cool environment built network with cool people. nd something to take pictures of, just social proof again. nd live music just warms up space. nd it does man, live music is the best nd even if they suck at singing it's still like this is cool. nd it was this one more again one more touch nd that people knew that we cared nd we thought about just something different. nd doing it again this year with more live music nd more lounges more everything so it's going to be pumped. nd wow what do you got there? nd I don't know it's something from ClickFunnels. nd wow what did ClickFunnels send us? nd let's see. nd you have to help your audience break their form in a mile. nd now 1954 Roger Bannister nd he did it. nd then what happened after he did it? nd people saw it was possible nd they're like dang, he did it. nd I can do it. nd for me I had a similar experience. nd I wrote the date down this morning so I wouldn't forget. nd August 17th 2004 was the day that the four-minute mile was broken for me. nd I would just got into this business nd I was happy. nd my goal when I got started was a thousand dollars in my five minutes. nd I was happy. nd I was happy. nd my goal when I got started was a thousand dollars in my five minutes. nd I was happy. nd I was happy. nd I was happy. nd I was happy. nd I was happy. nd I was happy. nd I was happy. nd I was happy. nd people got in with this number of views but they didn't even put into it. nd a thousand dollars in my five minutes. nd I took a lucky dinner nd I was happy because nd I tweeted nd a taxi to continuation mabled x epit bacA punches wx na ed Whitney squared Rock ificación,생� lockdown markets har the par was John broke the four-minute mile for me. We wanted to use for- inside of Click Informationen I was like, what's the equivalent for us of a four-minute mile? Like what can we give people to give them a goal to shootetz, after? And I thought well, if you have a funnel it makes a million dollars, like that's prety cool. And I was like I wonder inside of Click Funnels how many have made have made over million dollars. And so I had Dave and Tracee and some the guide go through all the stats and pull everything out. I was expecting we had maybe a dozen people that made a million dollars in the funnel. Anyway Dave got the report back and message me is like, dudes e we've had over fifty people – ɨndʷñi dɔrr si o kar. 41ʲ ˋee ʷku�話 bwnз çaytinej? 25ʲep jім– 28ʶ Kar breathing 40ʲp j nouns ʰли gʷj ng nge 14ʰ ʷqʸ aa Desde ta owners ɨndʷma 18ʸ F Personi Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! This is a dream come true, man. I visualize this over and over again. So many years to get to this. Wow. So this is not the only one. There we go. Now the coolest thing though is like, we brought these all here. And I would say probably two thirds of those people that got that are here today. In fact, we're going to bring them on stage and we're going to give these to them. Because I want all of you guys who aren't here yet to see that and realize it's not just a couple people. Almost a hundred of your peers have already done it. So this is the one that we're sending to everyone. We're getting many ones made of everyone and like our hallways will be wrapped in these things. When people come to our offices, like, dang, everyone makes a million bucks in ClickFunnels. I need you too. We're only one, two, three, four, five, six plaques away from filming this whole entire video. Check this thing out. This is absolutely insane. How many we have now? The four-minute mile has been broken. I want every single way you guys that this is your goal is at least one of these to keep going on. Because every time you get a funnel, break some million dollars and send you another one. That's my goal for you guys. Okay, so for you guys, you got to think back into your business, like, what's that result that your people want? That they're dreaming about and desire, like, if I can have that, that'd be the greatest thing in the world. And then create something that gives them the ability to aspire to go towards that. Okay, it's helped them break the four-minute mile. And as we bring attention to these action takers, to these people who stopped talking about it and started being about it, who took what Russell said and actually put it into motion, as we do that, I want you to imagine the entire time you being on this stage. I want you to imagine that it's your turn next. Can you do that? Yeah? Yeah. If you're going to be on this stage, walking across next year, raise your hand high, say I am. I believe it. So this is a really important night. Then they have the OUR premiere, OUR triple take, which is the new premiere for Operation Underground. So we want them coming back from this into this, really, really important. If you can put 4,300 people in a room and every one of them gives a dollar, $10, $100, $1,000, and you're able to give in something you really profoundly believe in and you know you're helping to make a change in the world, you feel better about yourself. You feel better about this community and you feel like you're part of the community. So while it is about connection and it is about donations, it is also very much about community. And what we're here to do is build a community. The first day of Funnel Like a Life is all about belief. We're going to believe in two things. Number one, that this business model that we love, that we preach, that we talk about with funnels, is going to work. And then number two, that they can actually do it. And then we try to give them something bigger than just the money to look towards. Because when money is the motivator, it's really hard to stay motivated. And so we always introduce the charity on day number one and we show like, well, this is what money can do. And having that shift in their belief and their understanding, they're way more likely to actually be successful in business. Did you know that every time you create a funnel with click funnels, you are actually helping a child in Africa? Did you know that? I remember when I first got into business, I always thought like, that'd be cool to do a charity thing. And I was always heading in my head like, well, when we're successful, then we'll do a charity. Or when we make more money. Like, it was always this when thing. When click funnels launched, we kind of weaved it into the DNA initially. It was like, hey, whenever your funnel is built, let's donate a dollar. It started from the very, very beginning. And it's crazy because when people understand the mission, it bonds them to you at a different level than if you don't. You know, the companies like Tom Shue, who went and every single shoe that was sold, they bought a shoe and gave it to some third world country. Someone who needed a shoe. And like, that social mission was huge. And I think people want to work with companies and brands and people who aren't just about money, just about themselves. Like, there's more of a soul to the company than just a money thing. And so, not only does it give your customers a vision of what's possible for themselves, it also helps them to connect with you, to trust you, to like you, because you're not just in it for the money. And one of the charities is Village Impact. I got involved with this because I love Stu and I love Amy, I love them. And I was grateful enough that they took me there and let me experience it. But I love for you to just kind of talk for a few minutes just about where this thing came from and why you guys, why you're doing it. I'm talking to the chairman of this African community. We're talking about building a school and then I said, how much does it cost to fund the full-time salary of a teacher? And he said, it'll be about $100 a month. At the time, we were selling a software product for $100. And I made this connection. If I sell one more product a month, that could fund the full-time salary of a teacher. And then I just kind of like expanded on that. The more money I make, the more impact I could have. And that really started to pump me up. The kickoff like the giving process, we wanted to do something really fun. We got a huge check made up for world teacher aid. We're going to fund the next classroom for $12,000. So there you go, Stu. You guys are amazing. Thanks to you guys and your creation of funnels, we were able to raise $46,000 for world teacher aid. So, give you guys a check. In the last 12 months, she has done 78,460 funnels. Last year, you guys have built 133,737 funnels that have gone live inside of Cremfunk. We want to give you guys hopefully the biggest check physically you've ever got before. Next year. Wow! That is crazy. You guys. Wow. We're just so grateful because every year we get invited to come back and it's not something that we take for granted. The work that we do is in what's called IDP camps. These people were removed from their everyday life because of the violence that was happening and just moved to this rural area in the middle of nowhere. And to see their progress that's happening year over year, little by little, it's incredible. And it's having a huge ripple effect. The fact that this is woven into the business model of click funnels is humbling. And I'm so grateful to Todd and Russell and the whole ClickFunnels team. Huge credit to you guys. Thank you so much for being part of this community. And thank you for contributing whether you realize it or not. And thank you to the whole ClickFunnels team. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We've had a chance now to bring a whole group of funnel hackers to Kenya with us. And let them experience it and be changed by it as well. We love you! Confusion soft! Confusion soft! We are... We are... ClickFunnels! ClickFunnels! Yay! We told our community all about all of you. And we told them how special you are. And our community wanted to help with the vision. Now there are tens of thousands of entrepreneurs who everyday are working to raise money for you. We are... We said there's a group called the Underground. Underground Railroad? Is it sex? Yes! What the... They said they're meeting and they said for some reason they mentioned your name and thought you had some technology and skills that could help us with this mission. He said they think your big piece in this can help save these kids from this thing. Wow. My name is Tim Ballard. I'm the founder and CEO of Operation Underground Railroad. Which is a private organization dedicated to eradicating the world of child sex slavery. So I spent 12 years as a special agent as an undercover operator for the US government doing anti-trafficking work. After 12 years of working these kind of cases, I decided to break away and start a private organization. An organization that wouldn't be prohibited by jurisdictional limitations and bureaucracy. We're in 20 countries, 22 states in the United States. And we sit down with law enforcement in these countries and in these states and we say what do you need so that you can be empowered to rescue more children. Oftentimes in foreign countries one of the first things on their list is we need you to go undercover. Because it's the Americans who are the demand. It's the Americans who are the clientele that are abusing our children. So you guys can infiltrate quicker. Unfortunately we are the demand in this country. We're the highest consumer, highest producer of child pornography. Which means countries like Columbia or Haiti or Thailand, they can use us, sign us up as undercover operators and we can infiltrate those black markets because we can connect with those dirtbag pedophiles who are hurting kids all around the world. We can find them and infiltrate them. So that's what we do and that's why we created Operation Underground Railroad. Probably the biggest challenge is making people aware that it's a problem. It's hard to fight something when the majority of people you're talking to don't know what you're talking about. The other reason is as a private organization we can provide a vehicle for you. For the public to get involved. This is a problem that's not going to go away by sitting back and saying the governments are going to handle this. It's way too big. It's hard for decent people and I still think most of the people in the world are decent people. It's hard for them to wrap their heads around. But if they don't accept it, and it's one thing by the way to accept it and a whole other thing to stay in it. Early that year I'd been made aware of the organization and what they do and we decided to help fund a documentary to get the message out about these children and how we can save them. And a lot of people in that situation walk away. Russell says I'm going to dive deeper. I'll go as far as I can go with you. If you're a dark place there's a whole bunch of cockroaches. If you shine a light in the middle then all the cockroaches have to scatter. So we looked at this documentary as like us shining a light to try to end this problem and try to solve it. So we spent a whole bunch of time up to the event creating it, preparing it and then we actually showed it at the first FUNA Hockey Live. It was one of the most emotional days, weeks of my entire life. Special hunt. I got a call probably six months ago from someone who asked if I would be involved. I didn't even know what it was and that night I started googling and trying to figure out and... I think it's about just the FUNA Hockey TV set but I made a video that night and I said I'm pretty sure that my life is going to change forever after this. I don't know what happened, a phone call out of the blue. I didn't even believe it. Like hey we want to just follow you around and do something and then I just saw this. I mean I'm totally blown away. Thank you. Thank you so much. This couldn't have happened without ClickFunnels. It could not have happened. This whole thing, I'm blown away. Thank you guys so much. There's these two charities that they're so near and dear to my heart and they're so different but they're the spirit, the feelings the same. On one side we're trying to educate these children on the other side, we're trying to educate the young children on the other side. I'm trying to encourage them to to support me in what they're doing and to teach me what's going on with my life, what's happening with my life. I don't know if they're going to be able to support me or not.venge and we educate them on how to grow these companies. And as I was looking at those two things, I was za astう, as I was looking at those two things, I was za astう, as I was looking at those two things, I was za astう, as I was looking at those two things, I was like, that is what the mission of those click funnels, that is what the mission of those click funnels, is to liberate and educate as well as kids, both entrepreneurs o entrepreneurs and these children who can't do it by themselves. When you have a community who have been inspired and their goals are bigger than just themselves, like, it is not my try to figure how to pay my rent today, but how do I solve this problem? How do I help these children? We are thinking bigger than ourselves.

The last thing I want to mention is to put on an event like this, it takes an army of amazing people. It takes a ton of support from the families of everyone involved, but there's over 100 people here that have killed themselves to put on this event for you guys. So I just wanted to give a second to give my entire team a huge round of applause for all the work that they put into this whole event. And there are six people that without their love and support and sacrifice would not make any of this possible. The ClickFunnels spouses, the survivors, the women who have made all this possible. I think the definition of ClickFunnels is like sacrifice because there's so many nights where we didn't have our husbands because they were fighting for you. To see all of you guys here and to see how much you guys are just obsessed with this company is really like pouring back not only into our hearts but back into our marriage and back into our families. You know, it's one of my favorite parts of Folenki Live when it's done the last day we go out to dinner together and we all just kind of hang out and it's just like at that point I'm so too tired to talk and I just like look around, look at them all and I'm like, Man, there's a lot of people that made this thing possible. I'm so grateful for them that they believe in the same vision I do because I couldn't do it without them. And the fact that they're here, they're bought in, they're doing it, this is their mission as well now. It's really special. The reason why I do this, why I'm obsessed with this is because every single person that we're able to touch and change during this event, it doesn't just affect them. Usually it starts with them and then it affects their families and then as they start growing, then they start hiring employees and a team and all of a sudden there's a team of people they're affecting and they start getting customers and they start serving those customers and they start changing their lives and every single one of the people that are sitting there if we can touch them and affect them the right way, it's a ripple effect that will go through tens of thousands and in some cases millions of people. Thank you. So we got 4,200 of them and if we serve them at the right level from the very second they come in all the way to the end we can affect literally tens of millions of people from this weekend. If you look at it, probably half of them are people who've come before in the past and for them this is like a big huge family reunion, you'll see that like they show up, it's like they're going to be crying and hugging and this is going to be this most amazing thing in the world. And then the other half are people who are here for the first time and half of them are scared, they're nervous, some of them spent the last minute they had to come here they came with a hope and a dream and not knowing what to do next. It's exciting for all of our hardcore funnel hackers, we're going to be back I'm mostly excited for this new group of people who we really have a chance to change their lives. When all is said and done that's the only thing that matters. We're all going to be tired, I'm going to be beat up in the late nights, early mornings, telling the stress, my voice will be completely shot by the time it's done but that's okay because it's not about us at all. This is for them like it's a really big deal and so from the top all the way down to the bottom we'll make sure that we are always having a super focus on like the service that we're trying to do for them. If we do that, it'll literally be the transformation point for a lot of these people in their lives. This is my mom's first time coming to any of our craziness. I'm excited to join this little group of people who are going to be more excited to talk about it and be excited to listen to it. And last of all we want to thank all of you guys for trusting in us for having the belief, having the commitment to not just think about it, not just talk about it, not just dabble but take the step wal kia industri rever ljaltilin ljaltilin ljaltilin ljaltilin ljaltilin ljup containing 이상 nhuh, nhuh planes fat α ivory g ensures wrapped in a こкі เฉoper
