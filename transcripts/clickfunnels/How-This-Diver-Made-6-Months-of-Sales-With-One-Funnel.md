My name is Ted Hardy and I'm the founder of Immersion Freediving. Hey Ted. My business is very niche. You probably don't run across a lot of freediving instructors. No, but that's wake. How did you get started? In the beginning, it was me teaching classes every weekend, but there's no way to scale when you're a one-man show. That's when I started to realize that there was a whole other way to do my business. Okay, I know where we're going. My first funnel made what my business would normally do for half a year. Nice. I was stunned. So, yeah, I became a big fan of ClickFunnels after that. So, yeah, it's pretty cool. And that's when we decided to move up to the mountains. What? There's no freediving up here where I am. This is nothing. And what's wild is I have a much bigger impact on the freediving community here than I ever did diving my butt off every weekend for a decade. Wow. And how has it helped your impact? ClickFunnels absolutely helps in my core mission to stop the needless fatalities from Charlotte or Blackout. I've got a free course. I've had people go through that course and literally save someone's life. ClickFunnels allows me to share it with way more people than if I was just teaching five people once a week in freediving classes. Wow. Rock and roll. The ClickFunnels community is almost as important as the actual software. Everyone is encouraging and helpful. You don't have to be like the world's best at what you do. You have to be a little ahead of the people that you want to work with. You could probably help you from three or five years ago. When I showed like friends and family, they're like, you build that? I'm like, yeah, I made that. And you can too. Start your free trial of ClickFunnels today.
