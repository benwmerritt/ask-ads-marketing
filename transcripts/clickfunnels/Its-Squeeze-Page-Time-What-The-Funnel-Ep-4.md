The squeeze page, the landing page, lead page, lead squeeze, main squeeze, opt-in page, there's countless names, but they all have the same purpose, to provide potential customers with value and get them to join your email list. Now email is where it's at, all right, it's still hip. And before you say okay, boomer, number one, I'm a millennial, and two, in most cases, industry-wide email sells more than social media. It's a business medium, it's a transactional medium, it's a personal medium. So no matter what you're doing, you need to build your email list and therefore you need a squeeze page. So first, a bit of history. The squeeze page is actually the evolution of its much more problematic ancestor, the pop-up. Pop-ups were created and used by a ton of marketers who were basically able to make big offers and promises for nothing more than a simple trade of someone's personal email. And for a long time, people were making a ton of money this way. But over time, things changed and the internet wasn't exactly the Wild West anymore. There were systems and rules in place, but that simple trade-off, a free something for an email, remained. But the vehicle and the style changed into the squeeze page. It's become one of the most effective ways to grow your email list of targeted potential buyers and it's essential whether you're an established brand or a new entrepreneur. So the squeeze page is made up of two pages, the lead magnet and a thank you page. For those that are new, a lead is someone who indicates interest in a company's product or service in some way, shape or form. In this case, buy your squeeze page. A magnet contains electrons that have both uneven orbits, wrong definition. It's basically a free product or service you can offer that has an extraordinary power or ability to attract, like a magnet. So if we put those together, a lead magnet is a free offer you're making in exchange for someone's email address. It's a win-win for both of you. So you have this very simple page pointing to nothing else besides what they'll get for their email. No menu bar, no links to social media, no nothing. Just a simple design, crystal clear copy and a single call to action. Now what can you offer? Well, you should ask yourself, is it something that will attract customers and ideally repel the type of people you don't want on your list? You could be offering a mini course, presets, a cheat sheet, a template, a video, a coupon, a demo, a contest. It could be something very simple, but as long as it adds value to those accessing it, they will remember you and they will open your emails in the future. But first, they need to opt in and the way to do that is to make them curious. This is done through very simple copy. Some formulas you could use are learn how to blank by doing blank, get blank. I'm revealing blank and of course find out blank. Now in order for this to be effective, you really need to put yourself in their shoes. So as you look at this page, is the offer good enough? Is the copy simple? I know brain or trade like trading a squirtle for a shining Charizard. Does it say so much while also saying so little? Does it feel trustworthy or should I just put in one of my old junk emails I've had since high school? But is there also an element of subtle forcefulness that encourages action? Does it tell me exactly what to do? Oh, okay. Boom. They enter their real email, they log into daily and that brings us to page two. The thank you page. You give them what they just asked for. If it's a download link, an ebook, a trial, whatever it is, then you thank them for opting in and that's it. Now you could offer something else here, but that shouldn't be the priority with this funnel. Your goal is to simply collect emails so you can continue the conversation later to send them emails, free content and eventually something else you have to offer. Don't try to sell them something right away. Let's look at some examples. This is Kaylin Poulin's squeeze page for her brand Lady Boss.
