So tell us your name and your business. My name is Brooke Jirot. I'm the owner and founder of Funnel Beast. My main motivation was freedom. I had left a corporate job. We started a family. I was helping my husband grow his electrical business. Then decided I had to do this for myself. Good for you. So I started a digital marketing agency. And how did that feel?
