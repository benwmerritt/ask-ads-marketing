Survey Funnels. The easiest way to identify who is hitting your page so you can speak in sales messaging they understand and make targeted offers based on who they are. Let's get in. You should use surveys when you have a product or service that appeals to a variety of different markets. They take a bit of work but think about how many horrible dates you could have avoided if you just asked them to fill out a simple survey. Yeah and it's the same for customers. Because the power of a funnel comes from being able to speak directly and persuasively to each customer you obviously don't want to generalize. That's what a website is for. If you used a traditional website it would only appeal to a small number of potential customers. You may not know this but if you have a static website the fonts, the color, the actual text and videos used to make it might actually only appeal to men or women which could cause you to lose 50% of your potential customers even though your product is designed to help both. So with a survey funnel you can ask questions to identify who you are selling to and cater a strategic buying experience based on those answers. But the questions go deeper. Are they married people looking to strengthen their bond? Do they have kids? Maybe they're not married but they are currently dating. Are they in a long-distance relationship? Or maybe it's for those people where you both get along super well and everything seems perfect and you talk every night and you buy thoughtful gifts but you're both always just with different people and you don't want to make things weird. You don't want to ruin the bond you know and but at the same time it just makes sense and she's always saying she wants to find a guy like me but she doesn't seem to realize that I'm a guy like me. I mean I'm right here, Megan. As you can see although your product would help all these people you may lose two-thirds of the sales because you used a sales page speaking to one kind of customer and that's why you need a survey funnel. So for the pages you have the survey page, a squeeze page for each group and a results page for each person tailored specifically to them. Surveys are as much for your customer as they are for you so the questions should help them self-identify and get them thinking about where they're at and if you'll be able to help. So let's say for example you have a relationship course. You're calling it how to take your relationship to the next level. Ooh actually don't use next level in any of your marketing. This isn't 2010. Instead let's call it the ultimate guide to love, dating and relationships. So now who would buy a course like this? Well I certainly would. I mean lots of people would. From a bit of digging we've found the majority of surveys follow this general multiple choice format. One, self-identifying questions. Two, another self-identifying question based on a specific subject. Three, ask them to self-declare their level of skill. Four, self-declare their biggest challenge with the subject. Five, educate and clarify. And six, random curiosity-based question. Are you in a happy relationship? These are a good place to start but one of these questions is not like the others. One of these is a bucket question. This question determines their results and where they'll be sent to next. Based on their answer to the bucket question they'll be taken to your squeeze page designed specifically for them. So after each person enters their email they're taken to the results page. This page could be centered around a case study, a video or a PDF anything. The format matters less than the content and offer you have tailored to them specifically. The best part is that because each page speaks to a specific bucket your conversion will be higher even if you sell the same offer on every page. Let's look at a quick example from the sponsor of today's video, ClickFunnels. Our landing page isn't necessarily just a survey funnel but it has one built in. We have a ton of different business owners who come in and are interested in using sales funnels but they all might be using it differently. So to tailor our sales message we ask them this, which of these best describes your business or service? Then list off the top industries that ClickFunnels has been known to serve. Now this is our bucket question which will ultimately decide where they'll be sent and after they answer they go to step two. How did you hear about ClickFunnels? This helps us see where they came from and lets them know where we are featured. And then step three, how long have you been in business? This is a self-declaring level of skill question. Step four, are you currently using sales funnels in your business? That's a self-identifying question based on the subject. And step five, did you hear about ClickFunnels from a smart, handsome YouTuber who deserves a fat raise? After that they calculate the results to generate a specific case study. And there it is. It asks for their email and leads them to a results page which features a case study of someone who is in their industry just like you who has had immense success using the software. And you can see this exact survey in action in the link below this video. Sneaky I know. So that is the survey funnel. This is easily one of the most effective ways to generate more customers and massively grow your business. This virtually replaces the need for a team of salespeople because it can speak directly to your customers and walk them through your problems and ultimately your solutions which frees up your time and allows you to focus more energy on sending more people to your funnel.
