ClickFunnels has really changed my life. Meet Adam. Musician, course creator, funnel hacker. My name's Adam Ivy. Or should I say, I'm Adam Ivy. My name's Adam Ivy. You got this. My health entrepreneurs scaled their businesses through using video marketing specifically on YouTube. Nailed it. How did you get started? At 17 years old, I found myself homeless and I had no place to stay. Fast forward, 2016, I go legally deaf in my left ear. Kind of debilitating as a music producer when you can't hear. So I decided I'm going to start making videos for my music producers and tell them how to build that overall business out of a passion for creative. And by 2018, I had a ton of people in the comments saying, Adam, do you have an online course? Adam, how can I work with you? Adam, I'd love for you to coach me. Do you have a book? Do you have a podcast? And I didn't. So what was your next move? I signed up for ClickFunnels, did five figures in under a week, and it changed my life. I made more money in that week than I had ever made in a year from a day job in my entire life. Thanks, ClickFunnels.
