To me, it's like a website is a billboard, right? It's there, and we think, like, if I build it, they will come. But, like, as soon as you get started in a business, you know that's not actually true, like, you have to find traffic. But, like, it's got this menu of options, right? It's like, literally, there's, like, a menu that you're, like, header bar at the top, and it's like, you can learn about the people, and you can read testimonials or, like, do all these different things, and there's all these choices. And it's like, you're leaving so much control to the consumer or the potential consumer to, like, do the thing you want them to do. And the reason that I'm obsessed with funnels, and I think a lot of funnel hackers are obsessed with funnels, is it's like, it's still a website, right? Like, it's a website, it's on the Internet, there's a browser, you, like, type in a URL. But instead of, like, having this menu of choices, the way I look at a funnel is, like, the consumer has two choices. They're either going to click the button to do what you want them to do the next step, or they're going to leave. And that's okay, because not everybody's going to convert. Like, you're not going to have 100% conversion on everything, but that's part of how you find your people, and how you, instead of getting them to shop around and then get decision fatigue and just, like, forget what they were even doing on your website, it's like, no, this is the thing that I want you to hear and the thing that I want you to do, and it just makes it really easy for them to progress along the customer journey that you've designed for them.
