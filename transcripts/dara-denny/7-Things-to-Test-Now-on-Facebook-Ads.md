What's up marketers? If you want some quick and easy things to try today on Facebook ads to drive sales and results, this is what I would try in 2023. Number one is Advantage Shopping. Now I actually recently did a video all about Advantage Shopping and all the things you need to know and my expert tips there. But Advantage Shopping is like machine learning on steroids. So if you're a media buyer who thought that there was a material difference between CBO and ABO, then you need to give Advantage Shopping a try. Now we've tested and compared regular old ads, aka ABO and CBO versus Advantage Shopping campaigns. And I'm going to be honest, there have been many cases where Advantage Shopping went out in an incredible way. I've seen this as a great way to actually scale accounts over the last few months. With that said, I'm only seeing this be really successful with clients who really have an understanding of what type of creative works they have some creative winners and they're spending more than 30k per month on their Facebook ads. Number two is one that even I would roll my eyes out if someone else suggested it to me. So buckle up. But Reels and Stories Only Targeting. Now I've seen for a few brands, especially if they have really dope TikTok style content that they want to run on Facebook ads, that they've been able to get really good traction out of Reels and Stories Only placement. And again, this has been another way that I've seen a few brands scale up their overall budgets on Facebook ads. I know a brand that actually was able to increase their overall budget by about 25% just through the Reels and Stories Only campaigns. Of course they tried it on automatic placements, but it was actually the Reels and Stories that did way better. So if you have tons of TikTok content that you're just dying to test, try it on Reels and Stories Only placements. Number three, I did another video about this one recently, but Educational is really on the rise for UGC. So instead of doing a problem solution style UGC that we've all seen a million times and are frankly really sick of, I would really focus on doing educational, listicle type content, how-tos, tutorials. Anything where you're teaching your consumer or your audience something instead of just trying to sell them something is candidly a must try right now. Number four is a public service announcement. The campaign structure of Tofu, Mofu, and BoFu is out. Now I have been teaching on YouTube for the last two and a half, almost three years, and some of my videos actually show this Tofu, Mofu, and BoFu campaign style. I never use that anymore. So don't use it. Typically I'm using a three campaign account structure with a retargeting campaign, a creative testing prospecting campaign, and a prospecting scaling campaign. And for many of my clients, we are now adding the Advantage Shopping campaign. So there are a few more ad campaigns in the mix these days, but no Tofu, Mofu, BoFu. Just prospecting creative testing, prospecting scaling, prospecting retargeting, Advantage Shopping, and then maybe a retargeting campaign, which actually leads me to number five, which is many of my brands aren't even doing retargeting campaigns anymore because all of those retargeting audiences are already souped up in all of your prospecting campaigns. And to be honest, we need to take a step back from this whole idea of the Facebook funnel and retargeting people who watch 50% of the video and who engage with other websites and got to add to cart. No. Think about Facebook ads as a part of your funnel. The entire Facebook ad ecosystem is a part of your funnel on some customer journey that maybe people will interact with, but it's not like a Facebook funnel doesn't exist. So retargeting is just kind of on the outs. With that said, if you're using a retargeting campaign, a majority of my clients are doing 90% of their budget and prospecting and 10% of their budget and retargeting. And if I audit accounts, I flag that immediately if that's any higher. And for some of my brands, again, we're not using retargeting campaigns and it's like 5%. So like 5 to 10% should be in retargeting. That's it. Number six, I'm actually going to give a shout out to one of my fellow media buying YouTuber friends, Charlie, the ad disruptor. You got to check out his channel. He has a method that has actually renewed my faith and dynamic creative testing. And I believe it's the three to three method where essentially what you're going to be doing is you're going to be using only three image or videos, two pieces of primary text copy, and then like three different headlines. I actually think that the reason why dynamic creative testing has not worked for me in the past was because I was using up to like 10 different videos and images and it was just like way too much. And I would load it with like five different headlines and primary text options. I've tested out Charlie's method recently on a few bigger brands spending more than 300k per month on Facebook ads and some smaller brands that were spending less than 20k. And in both scenarios, I saw that the results were either comparable to my normal creative testing structure or even a little bit better. So if you're looking for a new YouTuber to follow that does content all about Facebook ads and paid social, be sure to follow Charlie. And number seven, I'm just going to answer the question that everyone always asks me, which is Dara, what are their quick and easy creative wins? Woof. Okay, let's just start with images because going down the rabbit hole of like video can just be really wild. So if you need an easy creative win and you can make it in a day, these are the three that I suggest. Number one, do a press hit screenshot style ad. These really do convert and they work again and again and again, I'm going to be really honest though, sometimes the publication will come for you. And you know what, you just take the ad down. But a lot of times they won't and you can get tons of spend and make tons of money. So you know, we all have to choose our battles. I would do it. The second one is a features point out ad. I really do see this ad work across several, several verticals, especially as skincare, especially in beauty, especially in apparel. And really the hack here, I think is instead of doing like actually pointing out the features, like point out the benefits of those features and like the value that they actually add. That's when I see it really working. And the third one, I would try a before and after style ad. And you know, maybe I am just trying to like dangle the bait in front of you guys because I know someone in the comments is going to be like, but Dara, you can't do before and after style ads, but you definitely can. And also be more creative. You do not have to say before after an ad, you can just so the before and then the after. And really the only times that you're actually violating policy here is if it's for weight loss or cosmetic procedures. So it is allowed for makeup, it is allowed for skincare. I just see that convert like crazy and people are so scared to do it because they think you can do before and afters. Well, you can and you should in 2023. And that's it. If you actually watch the entire of this video, this would be a really great place to subscribe because the algorithm loves that. And I do this every single week for free. Show your appreciation. See you next week. Bye.
