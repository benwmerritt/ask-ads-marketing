What's up marketers? I asked you to send in some of your real live ad creative from your brands. So today I am going to analyze them and roast them. Now I am a media buyer turned creative strategist that has worked with some of the top DTC brands to make ad creative that converts on the Facebook ads platform. So you're going to learn how I analyze creative, which is really valuable for those of you who are using Facebook ads to grow your business. So be sure to like and subscribe so I can continue to make these videos for you every single week. Also be sure to stay to the end where I review an ad from Nike and explain why you shouldn't be looking at big brands for your creative inspiration. Or else you're probably not going to make it very far on meta. Now this is the way that I analyze individual ad creatives. It's really a four prong process. Number one is format. Is this actually the right format to be delivering this specific message? Next up we have audience. Now do we think that we're actually targeting the right audience with this creative? Or is there a better way that we should be messaging to this audience? Now in 2020 for meta slash Facebook ads generally does the targeting via the ad creative. So it's really important that the ad creative is appealing to your target audience. Next up we have awareness level. Now one of my favorite tricks is you know by slightly tweaking the language or actually by using certain formats, we can actually be targeting people at different parts of the customer journey. We can be targeting people who are problem or pain aware or people who actually know what the solution is or people who actually know your brand just by trying out different messaging points. So I always like to look at the awareness level as being targeted in an ad creative because I've actually been able to unlock other levels of scale by simply going up that ladder to reach a broader audience. And the final thing I'm always looking out for ways that we can inject a little bit more desire or emotion into the ad creatives because this is one of the key things that gets people to convert and convert quickly. All right first up Nate skin. This is a really clever ad. Number one, I think this ad is super, super clever. I actually responded back to this on Twitter demanding to know what the results of this ad creative because like I just got it out. Now I think number one, we have a really excellent hook here. We're showing the product on second one and we kind of understand already what the product is, but there is an element too of like wait what's going on here and it hooks you really well. Now something I will say here is a really good opportunity for them to test some more messaging is really testing this hook language. I like how they say every guy needs this. They could also say something like every guy needs a nose trimmer like actually just talking a little bit more about the product specifically I think could be really interesting. Now I think another really good hook for them that swivel is really cool could actually be right here when they talk about my first kiss went a little like this. I actually think that's a really engaging and also emotional hook. I think they did honestly such a really smart job with injecting not only desire but emotion. They're really digging into that sort of embarrassment that you feel right before you have your first kiss and there's also the romantic desire angle there. They're saying hey essentially you're going to be more romantically desired if you have this product. I think it's really really smart. Now the one thing that I will say is this is a pretty high end production right. They are using studio equipment studio cameras and these are actors which is why you know it's being pulled off so well. Now if I was their creative director I would actually instruct them to try testing out this type of ad creative with an iPhone first and see if that could actually be a better way to get to this target demographic because I think that we're actually reaching the right target demographic here but it seems a little young right. It seems a little more gen Z as opposed to millennial especially with this idea of the first kiss and I think that having more tick-tockified type of content could be a better way to reach them. So that's actually something that they should think about like okay if they want to go for you know a slightly older audience more millennial audience that first kiss angle might not be the best for them but that could be where they want to use more of that studio equipment and try out a different story angle. All right next up we have the titter titer I don't know how to pronounce this it's a weighted blanket. Now I think actually I think this is a really cool concept essentially it's this weighted blanket being reviewed by a group of friends and immediately what stands out to me is like the audience are we targeting the right audience here that's actually a little questionable for me. Are these young people actually the ones buying this blanket? I would instruct them immediately to look at the audience breakdown inside of their ads manager to make sure that they're actually reaching people and more of this Gen Z demographic but if like they have a wide range maybe a little bit more of a range of age diversity here could have been better for them I actually think it could have been cool to see people who were you know more on the young side and the people who were more on the older side and how that really spanned across generations but it seems very Gen Z I say as a little older millennial geez. Now awareness level these people have to be brand aware right because we're using the brand name and so that's probably going to really limit this to being solid and retargeting I'd imagine but you know it's a weighted blanket it says weighted blanket people kind of get the idea so they're definitely product aware all I'm saying is you know the potential to be scalable could you know there's not there's less of a potential for it to be super scalable and an additional thing that I would try testing here is actually taking some of these standout reviews and using them in the hooks right so the less single one this feels like a hood from my boyfriend one and using those in really fast clips I think it could actually attract the audience a little bit more than having this sort of this YouTube magazine real review and again this is probably the type of ad creative that I would try testing out in a more of a UGC angle as opposed to having the studio production it could actually be really cool for people to pretend like they were filming themselves and saying hey like this is my authentic review of this product and having a wide range of people I think could have a potentially better effect again especially if they're more gen Z or younger millennials but overall it is pretty cool I really like the concept I think we're gonna see more of these uh review concepts in 2024 actually next up the bedtimes this is kind of like the New York Times for kids essentially now what was kind of interesting is I actually googled this brand before I took a look at the ad creative because I wanted to brush up on it a little bit and the SEO here was actually kind of awful which I actually think is gonna hurt them in the long run because you know a lot of times people will see it on ad think it's clever they're not in the position to buy because there are a million reasons why right and so they follow it or they decide to google it later in the day when they think about it and uh this thing's gonna go I don't know also this review doesn't work which is kind of frustrating and I actually think the reviews could be really cool here but anyways they sent in three ads we had these you know really tried and true concepts now I think they've done a good job of testing out these three different formats right so we have a features point out we have a testimonial which actually feels a little bit more like a social proof testimonial it seems a little bit more legitimate with that twitter check mark and then we have an us versus that now first let's zoom in on this features point out ad now I really like this quote my kid is literally a walking inside the theater right now that's actually stands out to me as a golden nugget review because it shows the transformation and I actually think that this is some phrase that I've heard of some of my friends talking about their kids I think some of the actual features though they aren't as hard-hitting as they could be sparks curiosity and learning improve memory and reading schools be the smartest kid in class become more cultured and educated I would make sure that you are testing this variant against hey what are the actual features like what is actually in the bedtimes are they stories across different cultures right are they brain teasers like I think there is an element of me being like okay I see these benefits but what actually is it and that's something that I would highly recommend that they test out I do like how they highlighted be the smartest can class I think this is a good image honestly pretty good first attempt now this testimony our nightly battles over bedtime are a thing that past these stories are I actually think the nightly battles over bedtime is the point that I would highlight more because this is something that is actually showing the benefit for the parent now the tricky thing about advertising these type of brands that are actually for children is you're not marketing towards the kids you are marketing towards the parent so a game changer for learning and fun is number one kind of a boring review and kind of standard generic and blah blah blah but you can actually hit more of an emotional point by focusing more on the transformation for the parent as opposed to the kid right so here it's like the nightly battles over bedtime are I think in the past that's a benefit for the parent so not only are you making your kids smarter and more cultured and all this stuff but you're also having this huge emotional benefit for the parent which is something that I would dig into a lot more I think this us versus them I really loved this categorization of raise an innovator versus raise a browser I think that that's actually something that I'd like to see them dig into a little bit more but this is a very simple us versus them and I think it's pretty solid some of the aspect ratios and skews and the padding kind of like drives me crazy like but you know I think the actual content of it is pretty solid all right next up we had an ad from Hilly banks for active payroll you know all brands need to market and this is a payroll company that's targeting small businesses as well as fortune 500 companies now something that I would suggest that they do with this and a variant they could test is actually take this push it up take out that we got you because no one cares and then take these bullet points and show those bullet points directly on the ad now it's definitely a tried and true copy format for you to have bullet points and that is super solid however when people are scrolling in their feed especially if they're on instagram they're not going to see that so we want to make sure that we're testing out you know hey by showing more upfront benefits directly on the ad creative does that actually help or are people interested with just a headline and that causes the right people to dig in further and see the interesting thing is this is a nine by sixteen right so this tells me this is primarily going to be delivering to stories yet we have this bullet point in this long text that's not going to show up or it's going to show up and it's going to look kind of funky I also think that putting links and ad creative looks funny and I wouldn't do it but I would definitely try putting those bullet points directly on those ad creatives all right what do we have next ooh this one is from one of my favorite creative agencies raindrop um dropped they have I just couldn't raindrops are really so in creative agency um they do youtube creative television creative and hi at social creative really really well hey this is a really clever concept let's watch it together okay so number one I like the framing because we know that no matter what is going to be said in this ad that's really good so even though these people are talking about a potentially negative sentiment it's actually a positive so they're leaning into that negative marketing which is really edgy and tends to work for a lot of brands and leaning into the negative is actually something that I've seen that can be a real positive in terms of um actual performance for brands also the first one they've been getting likely going to keep it pretty millennial or gen z um and also pretty coastal this feels like a very coastal elite in terms of the casting now the audience I'll say too not a great range of age diversity that's potentially and very likely intentional because they knew who their customer is their customer is a affluent millennial likely living on the coast my one critique of this is I don't think some of the actors actually pass the sniff test and what I mean by that is like I actually found that there are parts of watching this where I cringed because the acting just seemed and that could either be good or it could be bad I think that the blonde woman particularly didn't like it felt too much like acting it didn't feel too much like genuine emotion whereas the brunette when she was talking I was like yeah like this was a perfect cast like I totally get her vibe I totally get what's going on blonde haired girl I struggled with that and I struggled with seeing her as a CEO and someone who actually had that change and when she was you know showing a motion that was like just seems kind of forced I also wish that um this actor particularly had more of a storyline another thing that I'll say I like about this is I like the anti-cta don't go to laundrysauce.com don't go to laundrysauce.com I actually think I might try testing more of these anti-cta's very cool very good overall pretty good dying to know how it actually converts next up yogas we have Jason from yoga strong now he sent me his entire you know book of creative so I had to choose one so I chose this one particularly now I think this is a really great hook because the idea that Haley Bieber actually potentially has this yoga mat right you could get a cease and assist from it though I'm sure this yoga mat from yoga strong and it changed my life I don't think that that those two like phrases are really the most important things here like people know what a yoga mat is and like whether or not it changed your life I'm not sure I think this is actually a good point where we want to inject those actual benefits a lot closer into the front of the ad creative so essentially bring up those features and benefits a lot sooner to show why it's different and why it was a game changer I also saw another ad creative that they had which was about why they chose this yoga strong mat as opposed to a $20 amazon mat I actually think that comparison is way more impactful and has a lot more of an interesting storyline and that's something that I think people are already gonna be thinking like why should I spend money on this yoga strong mat when I could just buy something else from Amazon but they are thinking that so you should create content around that to convince them to buy with you and why you're better overall I'd focus a lot more on the competitors I'm thinking about awareness levels you know the people that are going to buy a yoga mat know what a yoga mat is they don't need education on what it is it's really a comparison play about why you're better versus the others so I would think about I would have that top of mind why developing ad creative and start testing a wide range of comparison creatives and really go from that angle of why someone should choose that over someone else next up we have Priya from peacocks and paisleys now initially this popped up with no sound and something that I think was also hurting this ad creative is I didn't actually know what the product was initially I was like okay is this clothing is this tapestry I really didn't know also this doesn't have any captions on it so again when it first popped up for me no sound was on this is definitely something that other people in your funnel are going to be experiencing when they're on social media so really easy add in some of those captions and I also think some of the pacing here when we are listening to the audio could be clipped up and sped up quite a bit there were a lot of gaps um and you know I think that this is a video that's about 30 40 seconds that could easily be shortened down to 15 I really do like how they show the the fabric up close and I think it was a really good fabric choice I actually thought it had jewels on it as opposed to just a plain tapestry so that's something to know and I do like how they're showing someone actually making that I think that's really special but I think they tied they can just be sped up quite a bit and putting those captions all right next up my friend Ivan a fellow creative strategist he sent in three ads for crystallia glass so we have three ads here there's a pretty good range one is going to be more of an influencer take very high production really well made and then we also have a testimonial created as well as a static image the influencer one I really liked this movement of her opening it but I've actually found some people get in trouble with the tracker tech so I would make sure that in addition to testing this variant that you actually test the attire for sentence or phrase on second zero I also didn't know why we kept this particular testimonial up for pretty much the entire duration of the ad I think that it could easily drop off I'm also not sure who's creator is uh-uh could be important could not now something that I wonder is particularly with this font choice on this ad is this the right font choice and treatment for this particular demographic this type of text is actually pretty masculine I'd say it's pretty even though it is big so it's like easier for an order audience to read it reads a little bit young to me so I might actually take a look at what types of fonts are going to be more appealing to that you know 40 50 plus female which is who's actually you know the testimonial that this is the font the font was a little off for me which I know is just like such a nitpicky thing honestly it's really the only like problem I have this I think it's actually really good ad and the actual product like looks super solid I really love this static I think this is super smart because it looks really generally have someone saying hey I want this in my house and then they say hey this is how easy it is I think anytime that you can show how easy your product is not only to use but also to onboard or just get started that's obviously one of the big common objections so this actually to me reads like an objection handling ad where they realize that hey one of the biggest things that they see people are having friction with is the ease the timing and they're saying here hey this is going to be so quick and easy and all that you have to do is select the design you like and then we're going to give you an estimate right away which is really bringing down that barrier to entry purchase so really smart ad here well done Avon all right next up we have a gym at now this is a carousel style ad now immediately the thing that I'm going to say is there's no actual visual differentiation between the different packages it's all you know I don't actually know which one's better like you are putting a lot of pressure on your audience to go through and read every single thing which people are going to do they're really busy I'll also say that I have no idea who this is for visually or even what it is so immediately you are putting a lot again a lot of work on the user to know if this ad is even right for them to engage which and I'd say not this could be easily remedied by adding an image of your gym at the top and making people understand hey it's a gym but it's also you know potentially a training program I think a membership package which you know they can see of course in this headline ad but I really do think we need a visual element here to target and get to the right people okay next up we have the only being two formats really tried and true formats we have an us versus them as well as the features point out actually when I first saw this I thought it was just testimonial this one particularly is a little busy so I think that we need to understand okay what exactly do we want the focal point to be on I think it's actually the testimonial and I actually really like this testimonial because it's coming from the kid as opposed to the parent talking about the kid so I think that's actually a really smart test that they're running here I hope they're split testing this headline in this language I think it's really important I don't think that these particular features or benefits are are the best ones actually because okay quick energy boost do you really need a quick energy boost for a kid I'm not sure that doesn't really read right to me digestive health support boring that's very clinical language nutritious and non-digital those boring clinical language on the go crunchy snack on the go snack is great there's a little bit of a mismatch between the language and the point outs versus the language that is in the headline and that just kind of makes it like it just it all felt like that division falls apart for me so quick energy boost like maybe it could just be as easy as like you know healthy snack on the go like guilt-free snack like dig into that those emotions a little bit digestive health support like tummy safe or something like that um nutritious is non-gmo like you know just say healthy I I don't know that's just you know kind of nitpicking I but I think it looks good us versus them I really like how they chose Doritos you'll probably get a C sinuses from it but I think it's more interesting anyways I like the them part like I think they did a really good job being like a food junkie facing immediate consequences and they have us a proud snacker proud of every crunch now on one side right the for the features point out I'm like okay this is a snack for kids on the us versus them I actually don't know who the snack is for and that's pretty important so I'd say that it like even if this is a snack that can be used by adults and kids whatever it could be really interesting to make that a lot clearer in this us versus them because I also I have I would have a really hard time seeing someone giving like in 2024 Doritos to their like toddler I mean I know what happens but like I think it would be kind of taboo at least in New York anyways I couldn't imagine that so I do think that there's like a bit of an audience gap here missing on the us no yeah co-pilot IQ Eric sent this in I was really excited when he sent this ad in because I've actually been seeing a lot of ad creatives like this and some ad creators have been running for a year plus which is crazy and I know that you see this and you think wow this is a lot of information this is kind of an onslaught I think that's kind of the point actually and like this is for you know something specific to health and I imagine it's trying 55 plus but what I think is interesting right is like they have also a bit of a schedule here that is going to help people understand like okay like day one day two day three like the nurse is going to like read the glucose reading day four you're going to get a call with your nurse and it shows that like spread out and then it shows the progress from like week one week 10 week 20 week 26 I think showing that progress and showing all of that you know what the first few days actually look like that is connecting the progress and the results in a single image ad which I think is really smart and it shows that it's covered by insurance so I also think this is like a thing it's like if you know you know if you know you have this problem if you know that you are like affected negatively by a metaphor man I don't I have no idea what this means but I see this ad and I'm like yeah this is a pretty solid ad for Medicare been running for 30 two days which means it wasn't a total loser they're probably starting to scale it up I imagine it's doing pretty fucking well for them right now okay last Nike let's talk about this so number one this ad was sent to me by my friend Zach try out the latest game from the Nike store now this ad is sending you to figure out where the closest Nike store is to you so this isn't an actual ad creative that is meant to generate online sales and that's really important because a lot of times these big brands have a lot different metrics that they're going after they understand that the halo effect of their ad creative on paid social is a lot bigger because it's all retargeting like most people on the face of this earth especially in the US know who Nike is so it's not like we have to do like benefit comparisons how to ensure them the fabric up close it's like they are either a Nike fan or they're not so we want to make sure that we're getting these Nike fans and a potentially new market in a second to take an action for this particular test right looking at the ad creative we see that these are younger people so maybe Gen Z Gen Alpha and they want to get more of those people inside the store potentially so that they can then develop that customer over the long term and have them choose Nike as opposed to Adidas right what's interesting too is they also split test this ad creative right and this is like what really like checkmarked for me is like yes this specific test they want more Gen Z people inside of their stores now if you're a smaller brand trying to use meta to grow your brand and you look at this type of ad creative you might think huh I have to have a professional photoshoot I have to have you know this like branding I have to have this sort of tagline or whatever you really don't especially for the new and upcoming brand you really have to make sure that you're focusing on the problems that you're solving and the audience that you want to target and also the transformation that people are going to have when Nike is advertising on Facebook and on meta ads they're not trying to get that direct response conversion right there they're actually going for the long game and trying to convert Gen Z or Gen Alpha over a much longer period of time so that someone from Gen Z or Gen Alpha sees this ad your sweat test has an address I don't think that's an amazing tagline because I don't know what a sweat test is like if there was actually a test or something I don't know it just doesn't make sense to me but Nike can do that because they want to be top of mind really and they want their visual identity to connect to someone in that demographic so that when someone in that demographic is like yeah I need to buy workout clothes oh yeah there's a Nike name I should go check that out because I saw that recently and when they're looking at the people inside of their ads we see okay like look at the age look at the diversity in these different ad creatives and they see themselves reflected in that and the brain makes the assumption that then Nike is for them a really long-winded way to go about it but yeah a lot of times I'll talk about brands and they'll show me what really big brands are doing for their ad creative and I'm like whoa whoa whoa they're playing a way different game than you you need to play the direct response talking directly to the pain points game while they are actually working on developing an entirely new market over the long term because they have hundreds and thousands of stores all across the world they have the budget to play that long game without you know whatever I'm done all right thank you so much for watching this video if you want me to analyze any more of these ads you want me to do a video like this gonna let me know I'd love to do it and I'll see you guys next week bye
