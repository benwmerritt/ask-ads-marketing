Hey friends today, I'm gonna be giving you a mini masterclass on CBO or campaign budget optimization I'm gonna show you how to turn on CBO when to use CBO versus ad set budgeting And I'm gonna show you the four advanced CBO strategies that I use every single day to create scalable revenue But first things first. What is CBO? CBO or campaign budget optimization? Allows you to set your Facebook ads budget at the campaign level as opposed to the ad set level and to dive deeper This essentially allows the Facebook algorithm to pull your budget into the ad sets where it thinks it's gonna get the best results So instead of maintaining a consistent budget for each ad set on any given day Facebook is actually gonna allow itself to put your money in the place where it thinks it's gonna get the best results Which ultimately means you're gonna get better performance overall So it's kind of funny for a while Facebook actually said they were gonna be doing away with ad set budgeting completely And you were only gonna be allowed to set your budget at the campaign level Thankfully a few months ago in mid 2020 Facebook very quietly announced that they were actually gonna allow Advertisers to keep the choice of choosing to set their budget at the ad set or campaign level Which is pretty cool because even though I only use ad set budgeting for a few instances This was like a really big stressor for advertisers over the last year who were trying to figure out how to use CBO to test new Audiences scale their budgets. It was just a mess. So thanks Facebook before we dive into advanced tactics I actually just want to talk a little bit about how to set up your CBO campaign So you're actually gonna be able to set up a CBO campaign at the campaign level when creating a new campaign in Facebook ads First you're gonna choose the objective And then you're gonna have the option before moving on to ad set creation to choose CBO and once you flip on CBO to optimize your budget across AdSets you'll be able to put in your daily budget and select your bidding strategy now Facebook automatically selects lowest cost And if you're new to advertising I would go ahead and just keep it at that But you also have three additional bib structures which include cost cap bid cap and target cost And I know in some other ad accounts you actually have options like minimum row as but that's not actually something That's rolled out across all of my accounts So the next big question I always get is when should I use CBO or when should I use ad set budgeting? Again in the land of Facebook ads there are two ways to set your budget One is at the ad set level and one is at the campaign level which is CBO and while it's important to always test test test I do find that there are specific instances where I always use ad set budgeting and where I'm much more likely to use CBO budgeting So for ad set budgeting there's only really one instance where I almost always use this and this is when I'm testing out new Audiences and the reason why that is is because I find that I actually need to have more control over that daily budget so that I can make Sure I'm getting the right amount of impressions to properly evaluate if this ad set is gonna work for me I tend to find when using CBO work for testing out new ad sets or new audiences that the budget will pull into one ad set or the other And I'm not actually able to control that spent so I can't properly evaluate whether or not it's working And frankly that's really the only time that I use it now CBO There are two major instances where I always use CBO which are pretty much everything that's left and number one is for retargeting I always use CBO for my broad retargeting campaigns who are targeting people like website visitors and social Engagers and I also use it for my DPA or catalog sales campaigns Those are people who view to product or even added it to cart and the reason why I do this is because I find that Facebook is actually So much smarter than me and knowing which retargeting audiences are more likely to convert on any given day And the second place where I always use CBO is for my scaling prospecting campaigns So these are campaigns that contain audiences that I've already been testing through ad set and I know that they're winners And I know that they work really well, so I like to put those into CBO campaigns so that I can start scaling them up using CBO I find that when I try to scale things using ad set budgeting number one It's a lot more work for me and two it just doesn't tend to work as good Next up is the real meat of this mini magic class These are the advanced structures that I use to create scalable revenue using CBO So there are four structures that I actually really like to use when scaling up an account on Facebook ads Number one is the guiding ad set structure and this is really Facebook recommended It's something that my reps really passionate about and I always see them talking about on their webinars number two is top ad Says this pretty self-explanatory, but I'm not gonna give it away now number three is the best ad sets at different percentages And number four is the super lookalike super interest ad set plus a broad ad set I know what you're thinking which structure should I use to be honest that always depends on millions of things But when I dive into what each of these structures is actually all about I'm gonna give some Recommendations along the way and as always if one does not work out you got to test something else So first we're gonna begin with the Facebook recommended guiding ad set structure And frankly this is a really great place to start if you're brand new to CBO and essentially it's this you're gonna take your best performing ad Set duplicate it into a new CBO campaign and then you're gonna create a broad ad set in that same campaign That gives the bare minimum parameters for your customer avatar We're talking about age range gender and geo location And that's it no interest targeting or lookalike layering This brings the total number of ad sets in the CBO campaign to do the idea here is that your best performing ad set is gonna Train the broad ad set to find people who look exactly like your best customers out of that best performing ad set So essentially the algorithm is going to be training that broad ad set and do the dirty work so that you don't have to go through tons of Amount of testing I will say that I do find the structure often starts out slow Maybe you're gonna get just a few purchases out of your best performing ad set And the broad ad set isn't gonna get as much spend But then you're gonna see after a few days maybe even a week that that broad ad says gonna start taking more and more of your budget and Then ultimately getting more and more results and the next advanced structure I want to talk about is top ad sets which yes is pretty self-explanatory And I do find that this is the best ad set when you have a bit of a smaller budget and simply all you're gonna Do is you're gonna take all of your best performing ad sets into a CBO campaign here I do generally recommend limiting it to Five or six ad sets and if you have fewer ad sets than five or six That's totally fine The most important thing is that they just perform well for you and what I really like about this structure Is that you're gonna continue to find which ad sets are still driving results for you? And if you find that some ad sets aren't driving as many results and you can actually just go ahead and turn them off now The next ad set structure I want to talk about is your best look like ad sets at different percentages And it's actually probably best to just begin with an image of this structure So what you're gonna see here is you're gonna see your best performing look alike Segmented to different percentage points. So you have one at 1% one at 1 to 2% 2 to 3% 3 to 4% and 4 to 5% Now I've actually tested this structure all the way up to 10 ad sets and that's for the 10 percentage points that you can Actually go up to when creating your look alike audiences But I actually found way more success just limiting this to five ad sets test at your own risk Now the setup of this structure can be kind of complex But if it works for you the results can be super sweet and this is especially true If you have a really hard time prospecting out of one single look alike audience that tends to have great returns for you Just be sure that when you're setting up this campaign that you exclude the different look alike from one another So for the 1% audience would be excluded from the 1 to 2 the 2 to 3 to 3 to 4 the 4 to 5 And so on for each ad set and the fourth structure is a super look alike audience plus a broad ad set Now this one is actually my personal favorite and I actually find it's the ultimate scaling campaign for your conversion to purchase Or even your lead generation campaigns and this campaign tends to work so well because you've already tested and vetted these audiences And it includes both look alike and interest targeting So you're really working with the highest quality amount of people again This is kind of like the Facebook recommended structure What's gonna happen is this super interest super look alike audience is gonna be training and guiding your broad ad set But it's just gonna have so much more data points, which is why I've been finding it so much more effective and that's it Thank you so much for watching this mini masterclass I actually find that CBO is super polarizing amongst other advertisers Even advertisers that have been using Facebook ads for years Sometimes I find that they don't adventure out and try CBO which is such a shame because I do find that I get a lot better results Using CBO but only with retargeting and this audiences that have been previously vetted However, I would really love to get a second opinion on this CBO stuff and luckily I actually live with someone Who also works in Facebook ads every day, so let's go bother him Can I ask you a question can I ask you a question about CBO? What's the question? Okay, is there like always an instance where you use CBO versus ad set budgeting CBO Okay, I said body thing only one of this in audiences, but cold audiences. I taught him that I Do that before you okay? They created for that, but what about like when you're like, when do you always use CBO? Oh Campaign scaling for example, and I already when I already have my winning Oh come on, don't take it all way
