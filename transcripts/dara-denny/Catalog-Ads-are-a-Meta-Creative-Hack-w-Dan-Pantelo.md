To start like DPA has this reputation, right? Of being this thing that like marketers don't want to deal with. My job is to convince you that this reputation is unwarranted and in fact you should flip your perception of catalog ads. You should totally think about them differently. 68% of ad spend in that category goes to catalog ads. That's a massive amount. The delivery structure of catalog ads is totally different from regular image or video, right? Why? How will UGC ad last forever? Unfortunately. No, no, no. If there's one thing we know about UGC, it's gonna die, right? At some point. And it's unpredictable. It's unpredictable. There's too many factors at play. It's volatile to the performance things up and down and in many ways catalog ads is the opposite of that. So if you can crack the code on DPA, you are able to pretty much like scale an ad format that doesn't hit creative fatigue. You might know ugly ads, but have you heard of boring ads? So imagine a meta ad creative that is so easy to create that you do not need a team of video editors, graphic designers, or even creative strategy. Yet it has nearly infinite variations, but actually less chance of human error. And because of all that, it tends to actually have better performance. This is DPA ads, dynamic product ads, AKA catalog ads. And here with me today, I have the master of catalog ads. My good friend, Dan Pantella, who is also the founder of MarrPipe. And from what I understand, you just spend all day thinking about catalog ads, right? Yeah, so sounds like a nightmare for most marketers, right? Scary for creative strategists, I will say. But it's not as scary as people think, I promise. It's actually way more fun and interesting than I think most marketers think it is. But yeah, we spend all day every day just strictly thinking about catalog ads, how they work, how they can be improved. And we handle catalog ads and catalog strategy for some of the world's biggest retailers and some of the world's most exciting, fast-growing DTC brands that we all know of. That's amazing. So if you could give someone a quick overview of DPA ads, catalog ads, and why they're so important, especially for someone who's not as familiar with it, because I feel like a lot of people, especially ones that watch my channel, they know the us versus them ads, the feature point out ads. And catalog ads are a little bit of a mystery. So what would you say to them about DPA? Yeah, so to start, DPA has this reputation, right? Of being this thing that marketers don't wanna deal with, right? And I'm gonna, my job is to convince you that this reputation is unwarranted. And in fact, you should flip your perception of catalog ads. You should totally think about them differently. I do think, I think it's the technical aspect for me as a marketer. The catalog is just kind of, it's kind of frankly easier to come up with a UGC script or a new static on my side. Exactly, and that's why we got into marketing, right? Like as a marketer, you're like, I'm creative, I love ads, I love like, ethos, pathos, all that stuff, right? Like all the things that make a good ad, a good ad, and good advertising creative, appreciable, appreciatable by people. That's why we got into marketing, right? That's what really compelled us in the first place. And so we wanna, as marketers, we all have this natural urge to be creative in what we do, right? And so catalogs are like way more of an engineering-centric thing, right? Because it's just like a massive spreadsheet, right? Every brand, if you're selling things online, you have a product catalog, right? And so all these brands have a product catalog that is managed in something called a PIM, a product information management system, okay? So every brand has a PIM, whether you know it or not, some smaller Shopify stores who are just starting out are like, I don't have a PIM, Shopify has a built-in PIM. So whether you know it or not, you're using a PIM. Some brands who are bigger use a more sophisticated one. It essentially is your catalog, it's like one massive glorified spreadsheet that is like the center of truth for all your product data, right? So it connects to your warehouse, right? And when your warehouse runs out of stock on something, that'll update in the live spreadsheet that this SKU is out of stock. And then that is also connected then to your website. And so your Shopify store, once that's out of stock, can automatically update on the Shopify store and say out of stock, right? That sounds complicated though. So like, but that's like the whole point of Marpipe, right? You guys make it easier. Yeah, exactly. So essentially what catalog ads are, right? Is, and a lot of people don't even know like the foundational groundwork here is like, everyone knows you can record a video or make an image and upload that to an ad platform and use that as the ad. But a lot of people don't know that like, you can actually just like plug in the product catalog right into the any ad platform. Any paid social ad platform will accept your product catalog as an upload and it'll just run the product images in your product catalog as your ads. That's what catalog ads are, really simple. You just plug in your product catalog and it's just like, there's a lot of places with that like setup process. There's a lot of places people can go wrong. There's a lot of things you can get wrong. It's technical, it's boring, but there's actually, there's a lot, there's like so many reasons why brands should be focusing on this. There's a lot of benefits behind catalog ads that people don't realize. People don't usually realize like, how big of a category it is, right? How big of a category is it? Okay, so a while ago, Meta dropped this stat that in the e-commerce category on Meta, right? So like you're taking out all of like the B2B stuff, all of that, or like e-commerce category, retail, okay? They said that 68% of ad spend in that category goes to catalog ads, right? That's a massive amount. As opposed to image and video ads. So like the actual ad spend that this one ad format is taking up is monstrous. So while marketers are sitting here talking about like video ads. Creative strategy. Creative strategy. Yikes, I'm gonna be out of a job, okay. This is a monster of like an ad unit, right? And so like, and it's growing really quickly, right? It's only getting better, like ASC, we'll cover that. Like ASC comes out, like makes it a lot more powerful. But yeah, so like you have this ad format that is just like a monster in terms of spend. That's how like, we didn't realize how big it was. I used to run an agency back in the day. I was wondering how you got your start with Mar-5. Okay, yeah, yeah. So we had a performance creative agency. Oh, okay. And it was like a really small shop. And we were just focused on making like good ad creative, ugly ads, trying to make ads that don't look like ads. I feel like this sounds familiar to a ton of people watching this, so yeah. Right, exactly. And so, we were focused on like creative testing, right? All of that good stuff. Which you talk a lot about. Like you have some really good content on creative testing. And so, we were doing all that, but then we started working with some like big retail brands that were like more established and had like a large international retail presence. And we looked at their ad accounts and we were like, oh my God, like 80% of your ad spend is going into stuff that like is not image or video ads, right? That we like have no control. We cannot like help you there. Yeah. And so, we started digging into catalog ads and learning more about it. And then we realized like, wow, this is for like, for so many big categories, this is the main ad group. Why does it work so well, right? What is, how can you make it work better? How did they like figure this out and crack this code whereas like other brands didn't, right? So, we had like so many questions about catalog ads that made us like double click on all of these things. And eventually, we figured out like, this is a misunderstood space. A lot of people don't know like how to figure out and crack the code, right? Like so many people have challenges like setting up their DPA, getting it up and running. But once you do, right? Like the advantages are insane, right? So, if you can crack the code on DPA, you are able to pretty much like scale an ad format that doesn't hit creative fatigue, right? So, this is like a big thing with catalog ads, right? Like they are ads that look like ads, okay? Yeah. Yeah. Which I feel like is the thing that people say is bad. But I think particularly for people who are in market, like that's actually really good because it gets right to things that they are already looking for. And I think something that you and I talked about before too is that DPA ads have a fundamentally different delivery system, which I consider almost like a hack on the algorithm. Yeah, yeah. So, this is like really important to highlight, right? Like, and which is why when some brands set up catalog ads for the first time, they see like a totally different performance profile from anything they've run before. Like league's different. I mean, it could be like, you know, positive or negative, right, depending on your setup. But the delivery structure of catalog ads is totally different from regular image or video, right? Why? When you upload a catalog, your product catalog into Meta or wherever, you are, the algorithm is reading your product, all the SKU level data. So, if you have like a shoe brand, for instance, it's reading all of the shoe sizes, the color ways. The color ways, even like the fabric. Exactly. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, one thing that Meta is really good at, as we know, is understanding like what you're in the market for and like what you're shopping for, right? So, if you're shopping for a size seven brown leather shoe to wear to your fancy like wedding occasion, and your price range is $160 to $180, Meta knows what you're shopping for, right? And so, and Meta knows which catalogs out there in its ether of all the catalogs that has access to fit exactly that profile. And fit your size. So, if you find like a brand and oh, this certain size is out, Meta will actually look at your competitors, right? And figure out, okay, what's another brand? What's another like option that we can give this person so they can convert? Exactly. The delivery is way more efficient. Why? Because like if I'm serving a, and you know, if I'm out of size 10 shoes, and you know, the person who would be receiving this ad is known to be a size 10 shoe, right? I should not serve them that ad for that shoe, because I'm out of stock for size 10. So then it's even more efficient. The video ad would never know that. The video ad doesn't know that you're out of stock for size 10, right? And so, if you like run out of stock of a certain item, it stops serving the catalog ad. It doesn't target a person who doesn't fit the profile of like favoring the colorways or the sizes, right? And so this like applies really nicely to apparel. It applies really nicely to like travel categories. Even to like the furniture and home good space, right? Like there's a lot of information about your, in your catalog, about your SKUs. That makes it really much easier for the algorithm to like pair it with people to serve the ad too. So the delivery is actually like much more relevant. You could almost think of it like catalog ads or like the advertising version of like Amazon's. You may also like section. Ah, yeah. Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like, you know, you're shopping for an Amazon item. You click on something you like. Clearly you have intent. You're searching for this. You want something in this category. You might be searching for like protein powders. Yeah. And then like right below that product is that like famous section, which is so effective of like other products with a similar price range that have like, you could see how many reviews they have, like how many, like what their price point is, like how it's different and like a quick comparison chart. Like that is so, Amazon is like the best at selling things in the world. Yeah. And that's like takes up so much real estate on all their product pages. So you gotta imagine how effective that is. So it's like the advertising version of that. Right? Like it's clearly an ad placement. It's clearly trying to sell you consumerism. It's not trying to hide its intent. But it's like, hey, let's make product discovery really simple and easy for people who have intent for things. Catalog ads crushes it with that. That's the point. I consider it like, it's like a competitor hack in a way. So if like your competitors, you know, number one, you know, if they're not working with Marfa, and they don't have their catalog set up correctly, like if you do, that's a really great entry way for you to then capitalize on their traffic that isn't as optimized for their catalog. It's something that I've been talking about a lot, lot more with brands. And I think it goes back to the fact that like, because there's so much spend here, brands are finding more efficiency here than they are on big creative strategies and really complicated creative strategy team frameworks even. So it's, you know, and another thing too that I think about is with media buyers, like they are enabled to invest in this type of creative that doesn't actually need the rest of the team to be able to create and optimize. But I wanna talk about some DPA ads. I know you have some examples for us. Well, before we dive into that, right? One big thing is actually we just signed a brand that we both know and someone that we know who is gonna be totally okay with me mentioning this Scott Kramer at ASP. Oh Scott, yes. Okay, so amazing marketing team and creative team there, right? They've scaled up some amazing beauty brands. One of them is called Bliss, right? And he was talking to me about catalog ads and he was like, you know, Scott's like an, he's like a marketer, he knows his stuff, he's savvy. He's someone to follow if you are really serious about growing growth teams and growing brands. He's like one of my number one follows. Yeah, so Scott Kramer was like, we have this like really good UGC system figured out for Bliss, which is one of their biggest brands. Like why do we need to focus on DPA, right? And I was like, I think you should be really careful about de-prioritizing DPA even if UGC is working for you because your UGC is inevitably gonna hit a point of creative fatigue. Like yeah, your winning ads in there are UGC. We all know UGC is gonna unpredictably fall off a cliff at some point, right? No, UGC ad lasts forever, unfortunately. No, no, no, right. And so if there's one thing we know about UGC, it's gonna die, right, at some point. And it's unpredictable. There's too many factors at play. It's volatile to the performance swings up and down. And in many ways, catalog ads is the opposite of that, right? It doesn't require a constant creative engine that you need to keep feeding, right? If you have this awesome like UGC system set up, that's great, you should still have that. That's a big asset for a company that has like practicode on that. And that's like a good part of a media mix, but like it's volatile, right? And it's also really expensive to maintain, right? You need to keep feeding the beast, right? And so you need to keep like, you know, it's expensive, like constantly sourcing UGC. You're familiar with the pain point there. It's expensive, it's cumbersome. I ran a UGC creator department at my last role and it's honestly just an ordeal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, it's a headache. And that's why creatives are so stressed. And creatives have so much going on all the time because they need to constantly feed this beast that is always hungry and hungry and hungry. Catalog ads are the opposite. Take a deep breath, relax. If you figure out catalog ads, it does not hit creative fatigue. It will, you know, it scales like, it's very consistent in its performance, right? It takes longer to train, right? How long would you say it takes to like, not get out of the learning phase because I don't really believe in the learning phase, but how long does it take to like, sort of get its bearings when you first launch a DPA or catalog ad? Yeah, so like, okay, for example, how long do you think it takes for you to figure out on average whether like an image or a video ad is working or not? Like at what point would you like, some day for some brands, it's like, I know like by the end of the day, if it's gonna be a banger. But I'd say for most brands, two to three days until I start seeing conversions and at what rate, and I'm like, okay, this is either potentially gonna be scalable or not. I don't do like a full analysis until like the seventh day, though. Okay, cool. All right, so for catalogs, if you're rolling out a new catalog, right? Meaning you have never done catalog ads before. You're uploading your catalog to an ad platform for the first time. It can take usually a month of warming up the catalog. And learnings, right? Because, and this actually, a month is if you have like a thousand SKUs or several thousand SKUs. Oh, okay, yeah. Right? The less SKUs you have, the faster the learning happens because imagine the algorithm is like rapidly testing every single product. Every product in your feed is an ad that is being tested against all the other ones, right? So it takes a while for it to figure itself out. And so the learning period is longer and this can be frustrating or cumbersome to some marketers who aren't used to that, right? But it's an important disclaimer, right? The benefits of consistent performance on the backend, if you figure it out, or the cost to get there is like, you have to go through a learning period of training the catalog. But once you upload the catalog for the first time and you get your source, we call it the source feed, is the main primary catalog, you should only have one in your account because you want all the learnings to accumulate in one catalog. One mistake people do is that they will upload different catalogs for different product sets. There's a different way to do that. You should not be running multiple catalogs. All of them should be one, so you're consolidating the learnings. And then you can make categories from within that one catalog. You can make product sets in the additional, That's the technical term. In the supplemental feed section, right? Yeah, so there's a supplemental feed section in that you should be playing in there rather than creating new feeds. So once that feed is trained for weeks maybe, then you can start playing around with different product sets, different like, in terms of like designs, which we'll break into in a bit. You can like test all of those as supplemental feeds, right? Operating off of the source feed and for those to run a test, maybe like a week to a week and a half is typically what it takes for you to understand whether like a design treatment for your catalog is working better than like the control. So. A design treatment, yeah. I definitely want to dive into that because I think some people will see DPA ads or they do see DPAs and they're like nervous because they don't think it's creative enough. And I think there is a big consensus right now that if it looks like an ad, people are gonna scroll right by. And that makes people nervous. We've actually found the opposite. So like first let's cover the numbers, right? So we did a study with Veros, right? So have some great friends there. And we looked at 3,500 meta ad accounts for e-commerce brands, right? Across all different categories. And of those 3,500 ad accounts that we looked at in e-commerce, there was $4 billion of ad spend under that umbrella, right? So we analyzed like this massive data set. Was there a timeframe that you guys were looking at specifically? Yeah, it was actually one year. It was a detrailing year from November, from last November. Okay, so November 2023 to like November 2022 essentially. Yeah, okay. Exactly. And so that's the timeframe. And we looked at, we were able to actually for the first, like I actually reached out to the Veros team and I was like, can you guys separate catalog ads performance from like everything else like video ads? And they actually couldn't at first, but then the team there is like really badass. So they were like, we're gonna figure this out in like a few days. And then their engineers got back to me and they're like, we figured it out, we have the view. Huge Veros fans, yeah. So we were like, we were like awesome. Like what did the numbers say, right? Like, and we were nervous because we were like, man. Our business as a writing on this positive result. Yeah. Yeah. Or else we wouldn't be talking about it. You know, we would just. Yeah, exactly. Right. Selective data. So here we have, I'll just, I'll pull this up real quick. Amazing. So over here, we looked at our, we looked at two things I wanna show, right? ROAS over one year, right? And, oh sorry, actually the data was from July trailing year. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Rather than November, right? So the ROAS of. ROAS. If you just, ROAS. Of why do I keep saying, everyone keeps calling me out for it. It's embarrassing. I know, honestly, I need, yes, I'll see myself out. So the ROAS on catalog ads is on average, through the whole trailing year that we looked at across 3,500 bad accounts, the average performance, average ROAS of catalog ads was 78.3% higher than the performance of image and video, which was, which we thought was pretty crazy. Yikes. I mean, it's good for you. It's crazy for creative strategists though. But I think there is more creative strategy in DPA, which we will get to. There is, there is. And that, that's, that we'll go, we'll get to that in a second. But then the CTR piece actually really is, is, is crazy too. So, so if you look at click through rate, right? Which you would think like, who's clicking on these really basic, boring looking ads? I'm just- No, people are just scrolling by. If they see an ad, they knew it's an ad. They're just gonna scroll by. Yeah. Okay, I hear some version of that literally every day. False, false, false. And this, this proves it beyond a reasonable doubt, right? So actually the click through rates over time across all verticals on catalog ads are 36% higher than image and video ads on average, right? Now, so like, of course there's gonna be like, you're gonna, okay, like I see you in the YouTube comments like, oh, that's not true for my ad account, right? Yeah. You know, I tested catalog ads, doesn't work for me. You know, image and video has always been my top performer. You know, we hear a version of that all the time. But the truth is, is that there are brands in your category that have cracked the code on catalog ads and are spending the majority of their ad spend against it and have a way easier time managing their ad account and spend way less energy on creative stuff than you do. And are probably getting your customers because if your catalog is not up to date or up to snuff, then when you're not delivering properly or you're out of stock on something, your competitors are taking those customers. Exactly, right. So, so, so, so you know, if you haven't figured out your catalog strategy, don't be mad, be glad. Because I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not mad. Yeah. There is a solution. Because there's a solution and it's an opportunity for, it's an opportunity for you to figure out like, what is the opposite side of the spectrum of this like endless creative, you know, rollercoaster, like, you know, treadmill that we're on. Yeah. And so, so let's dive into some stuff I wanna, I wanna share. And I actually have, I have a pop quiz for you. Oh no. Yeah. We're gonna test, we're gonna put Dara into the test today. Subscribers love to see me lose. But actually everyone in the comments should chime in too on what the results are if they're doing this alongside me. I can't be, I can't be the only one. I'm really excited for this. Okay. So, so, but before, before we dive in, right, I just wanna lay some like basic groundwork, right? Show people what catalog ads typically look like, right? So here we have, you know, examples of catalog ads in different formats, right? Like on Meta, they look like that. They're just a product image on a white background. You know, on TikTok, they have this form where they appear like in the bottom left box next to a video. You know, you've seen them on Twitter X, right? And then obviously all over the internet, like I just went, when I made this slide for this, I just went on one Washington Post article and I saw five ads. Yeah. And four of them were DPA. Ah. Five ads on this Washington Post article were DPA, right? So really popular across the open internet. Like if you're going on websites and you're looking up products, like I was literally, I was looking up Seltzer's and Chucks. I'm wearing those Chucks that you see in that ad right now actually. Wow. And so, so pretty crazy, but yeah, they're all over the open internet and on paid social. And they look like this, right? The big and ugly problem is that, like, man, like that has zero of the creative elements that we all know increase performance. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, like give us some features benefit callouts, give us a sexy headline, you know? Right. Like, you know, so like this is what most, when you set up catalog ads and you plug in your catalog into a ad platform, it is going to run the product images in your product catalog. These are the same product images from your product page. So they are almost definitely going to be your product image on a white background. Yeah. Okay. Right. But how do you edit that, right? Like how do you have any creative control over your catalogs, right? Because you're, I mean, it's just, the system is pulling your images straight from your product catalog, right? So like, how do you have a designer step in between that? Right? Like that's where something like Marlpipe comes in. Okay. Right? So that's what Marlpipe does. So it's kind of like a, like a Canva or Adobe for product catalogs. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. So, so we'll ingest the product, you'll just, instead of plugging your basic product catalog right into Meta, you plug it into Marlpipe first. And then you get this canvas where you have the product image and then you can do things like, you can click one button and auto remove all the white backgrounds in your whole product catalog. So that it's just the product transparent background. Then you can put in branded backgrounds. You can put in, you can resize it, move that to the left, put in a lifestyle image that features the same product in it. So people have like a point of comparison, pull in some, some like static elements, like your brand logo, that will stay the same across all of them. And then then dynamic elements, like the price of that specific item. So you can actually have lifestyle images pop up and be delivered on DPA. In theory too, like you could technically use those same images as like regular image ads, but it's a totally different delivery system if it's on DPA. Exactly, right. Interesting. That's a really cool test. Yeah, so with something like Marlpipe, you can actually, you can finally pull the creative lever. Right, and so like Facebook has been releasing a few features that are worth mentioning to this effect because they realize how important it is and how far this goes with performance. So like everyone, people know about like Facebook frames, right, which is the ability to like upload like a frame that goes around your product image. Yeah, scary. And if you like, if you know, you know, where if you've like tried this feature, it's like all sorts of stuff. So like, you know, usually it's like, it'll cut off your product image, right? And then it'll like appear in like weird, weird ways. And also the delivery, people don't know actually that Facebook frames only delivers on Facebook, not on Instagram. Oh, interesting. Yeah. So your Facebook frames are actually not rendering when appearing as catalog ads in Instagram. So like Instagram is off limits for your Facebook frames. Yeah. Don't know why. Seems like why don't they just apply the same thing on Instagram, but hey, that's what it is, right? Okay, so we want to be able to have real, true unlimited creative freedom to make templates for like what our DPA could look like, which we refer to as design treatments. A design treatment is like a template, right? That you can filter your whole catalog through. So sometimes people will see examples of like Mar-Pyde creative. And they'll be like, this looks like a really simple image ad. But actually it's much more complicated than that because it's a template through which like a thousand or 10,000 product SKUs are filtered through. Oh, okay, okay. So like for example, I can show you real quick, right? Just so we have a sense for it. Here is an example with Leteco, a shout out Ben Schreiber who runs this account, this ad account. They had amazing performance, but here we can see like, this is a simple like template, right? And you have a product image, you have, this will change as like different SKUs change, right? And then you have the product title here. And then like free shipping with the price. And then like this is a static element. Like this doesn't change. And as we shuffle through different SKUs, it'll change the product title, right? And like the price here. So like it'll dynamically, so you can see what different examples of SKUs look like filtered through this treatment, right? And then you can just like render it all out and see what your whole feed looks like through this treatment. Oh, so you can also like make adjustments too if you like don't like the padding and stuff, right? Exactly, exactly. Right, so you can look at that and then you can just send that all out straight to Facebook and like run it as a test against your control. And your control again would literally just be this product image, right? So you can get really, this is a simple example, really straightforward and basic, but there are so many like cool things you can do and get really fancy with it. And I'll show you some examples. So, cool, all right. So we have established that catalog ads look ugly by making them look better. We can take advantage of the creative elements that we know work really well. While also taking advantage of the delivery system, that's like so much better. Yeah, I wouldn't say catalog ads are ugly, they're boring. Right, yeah, yeah. Exactly, boring, right, exactly. Cause if it's just a product, picture of your product, who am I talking about? On a white background, you know, yeah. Yeah, so I wanna run you through, we'll come back to that later, but I wanna run you through a few pop quiz tests. Okay, great, let's do it. So we are gonna put your creative chops to the test today. Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna show you some, and this is gonna highlight the importance and the performance impact of really simple creative tests when it comes to catalog ads, right? So we're gonna see how much this matters. Okay. Okay, so there's this brand, Cozy Earth, and this is brand new actually. This case study just came in on Friday. So literally a few days ago. I love this brand, this is a great brand. This is an awesome brand, they're crushing it on, they're part of the Facebook Disruptors Program. I mean, they're doing really well, and they're scaling ads, it's been crazy, trust me. So they're doing really well. We love to be able to work with a DTC brand that's really innovating in the category right now. This is what their catalog ads looked like before, which you can see on top, right? Before they started working with a tool like MorrowPribe, which is just their lifestyle, it just pulled lifestyle imagery and product imagery. Same thing you would see on the product page. Yeah, so that to me is like, I see a million of those DPA ads or catalog ads every day, and I'm like, yeah. And also you can kind of deduce when you see these in your own feed, like why you're seeing it. Like it's either because you had visited that site before or even looked at that specific product, or you looked at a product from a competitor, that's similar. Again, like the delivery, it's better. It's more relevant, right? But like, man, what if we could upgrade the creative, right? And so this brand actually tested, I mean, props to them and their team. They've tested 30 treatments. Here are an example of four of those treatments. One of these is the best performing treatment that they've tested. And it's interesting because it looks like something that I would have like a designer create because it's like a split screen ad. Yeah, but you see it's using elements that it's pulling from the product feed. Like you can see there's like the product image with a model and a studio background. There's the lifestyle image juxtaposed next to each other. That's a really popular tip, including price is a great variable, including discounts, slash-throughs, value props. I'm surprised it worked so well because that price is like, it's not cheap, you know? And what I think is interesting though is they have that as like the one that's the biggest so your eye automatically goes to it. But I think for like the right customer, like that's not gonna scare them. Because the delivery is right. It's not being served to customers who are scared by this price point. That's a great point, yeah. And beyond that, right? DPA is when we look at accounts for mattress companies and for jewelry brands, like the majorities of the world and stuff, right? David Ehrman, we're talking to you right now. Those are obviously really high price points. Yeah, and I'm not gonna get delivered David Ehrman jewelry, by the way. Yeah, not yet. Well, for those ad accounts with those really high AOVs, they love DPA, DPA works really well. So do not be discouraged by high AOVs. They actually, they work really well with DPA. Honestly, that's a really big unlock, I think, because I think so many brands get into the hamster wheel of creative strategy and they're like, how can we convince people? How can we use the human desires and human psychology and blah, blah, blah. And this is just sort of like, actually, I know the people and it doesn't have to come down to targeting, which I think is something that has made media buyers nervous over the last few years is, okay, interests are being deprecated, look-alikes are bullshit and don't work at all anymore. But Meta still has that data and they have the system where okay, by looking at your catalog and that information and that data, they can now still deliver to the right people. And the price point one is honestly, I'm gonna be thinking about that a lot more. Do you know the story of the Gordian Knot? No, I don't know what that is. It's a story about Alexander the Great and there was this myth in this town he was conquering. That there was this cart that was tied to a post by this crazy, crazy massive knot. And the idea was there was this myth that whoever can untie this knot will rule all the kingdoms in the land. And this was a 100-year-old knot that so many people tried to untie and couldn't figure out. And so when Alexander came to that town and he conquered it, he looked at the knot and he just cut it with his sword and released the cart. And that is just the allegory for, the best answer is usually the simplest one. And so when it comes to ad creative, I think you can apply a really similar lens and catalog ads is the vehicle for doing that. Try the simplest solution. Just show the product the price. Take advantage of this amazing delivery system. Just deliver to people that are gonna buy a $265 sweater, you know? Done. Okay, show me some of these other ones. Okay, well, no, well, this is your test, Dara. You have to guess which one of these performed the best. Oh, Jesus. These are three, so you have four design treatments here. That this brand test. These are real design treatments that Cozy Earth tested. One of them is the winner. Why don't you take a look and think through, what do you think about these? Which one do you think won? Okay, so we have number one. This is the one that has the $265 as the biggest font there. So immediately I see that. As a creative strategist, I hate that. That's horrendous. I like the fact that they're using a split screen. They have two different models. It shows the wide range. Even different color skews, which I think is interesting. Something I've seen in general for apparel is if you can show multiple color ways and for the same skew, sometimes that tends to increase conversions. And it's interesting, because number two is using that same idea. It's using the same two pictures, right? And that's a more authentic split screen. The thing that's drawing my eye immediately is, hey, this is 25% off. So immediately I'm kind of like, I don't know if this is fair because this is an offer. And my media buyer brain says, oh, this offer is probably going to do a pretty good job at converting someone, especially something that's over, just showing the $265 price point. Honestly, I can't even read the other stuff, but I don't think it really matters. It's just like a CTA, whatever. Number three, now what's really interesting about number three is I've had designers make this exact ad creative before, like, to a T. But as an image ad, not as a catalog. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which I think the thing I'm really grasping onto that is so important about DPAs is just because the delivery mechanism is so different, and it's using all of this catalog data to help do that targeting, I think would be really impactful. So I'm gonna analyze this. Okay, we got an image on one side, we have a cross out. So this is another offer ad, and then it's softened fabric, guaranteed, 100-night trial, that's incredible. And then free shipping. Right now I'm kind of between two and three. It's offer-based, but I also think the 100-night trial is really good for overcoming objections with people. What about number four, just no numbers? Number four, no options. What do we got, brushed bamboo, what's that? It's just the, it's the name of the product. It's the name of the product. But it looks good, that's the thing too. It's like, would I be right in saying it's number two or number three? I need your final answer. Geez, I hate this. I didn't get to where I am by always getting the correct answer, by the way. I got to where I am because I always wanna test things. That's something that all media buyers and creative strategists should be taking from this. I feel like you're tricking me, and that's actually one. But I'm gonna say, if I had to put it, all of my money on everything, I'd, two. I don't think, I think men are less likely to buy. So I'd say two, women are gonna buy. Okay, my heart dropped for a second because you said, I think that you might be tricking me and it's actually one. Yeah. And it's actually one. I knew it. So again, underscores. That is crazy, and I, yeah, that's crazy. And I'm willing to bet that creative strategist looking at this, if that ad came across, you know, my desk from a creative team, I'd be like, what are you doing? What are you doing? And also, like, you don't really need to be a creative to make this, do you? You don't need to be a creative to make this, and. It's just dragging and dropping some stuff. I think that result, Canon should make people uncomfortable because it breaks a lot of the rules that I think people think they know about selling on paid social. Now, let's look at the numbers, right? So simply by this brand test at 30 design treatments. Well done. They, this is the winner. This is the best one that they've tested. You saw four of them that were 30. This emerges the number one winner. This is what their DPA looked like before. This is what their DPA looks like after 90% of their meta DPA spend now goes to that template. That's crazy. They were able to scale their DPA spend by 220% after figuring out this design. Yeah, yeah. And they increased their ROAS by 60. Roas. Roas. They increased their ROAS by 60%. So when it when it comes to catalog ads, right, small creative changes, right, basic creative changes. Yeah. Put in the price, put in the logo. Put in an additional lifestyle image. Very basic things that you don't need to be a creative at all to do that someone can do in a Canva, right? Will drive a major performance differences. Now, a question that I have as like a creative operator is 30 design treatments tested. How long would it like does it take like a system like yours to make these different templates or treatments? Yeah. So like let's assume I forget how many skews that the Cozy Earth has, but let's say it's 5000. Yeah. So let's say it's 5000 skews. So 30 treatments. I mean, we're rendering out a new catalog for every treatment. So that's 5000 times 30. Right. Is how many new images are being created? Yeah. Across 30 new catalogs. OK. And you're not actually creating a new catalog because that would be bad. We're not. We're we're hosting a new image catalog that we then upload as a supplemental feed to the original one. OK. OK. So you're not. So most people when they like old, this is why like something we thought something like Marlpipe was really important to build because in in like the prehistoric Pilgrim days before Marlpipe, you would you would have a creative you would have a creative actually custom make this template for every single product skew in your catalog. So you'd have a creative sitting there making a thousand new product images, making a new catalog, upload that as a new catalog, go through a four week training phase. I have had actually back in the day, I have had people do that. Isn't that wild? Yeah. That was that used to be a thing. That used to be a thing. I've been media buying for a long time. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. So so like let's not ever if you know if you or someone you love knows anyone doing this manually, you know, don't. So so like, yeah, you just all they did was really make 30 design templates, which is the equivalent of making like 30 like image ad templates. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And they just click render and the whole feed renders through. So you're so within within a minute, like you're creating, you know, 30 times 5000 in this example. And you're testing them and it took them about about a month and a half to test all of those and find the winner here. But that's like essentially like 30. That's essentially 30 creative tests. And let's just say they have 5000 skews across 5000 skews. Like it's the same work as testing 30 ads. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. In terms of like lift and set up and stuff. And then the other like, you know, the time constraint is just letting it run. Right. And gather the data. Yeah. But it's also highly optimized because these ads are only really being shown to people that have some sort of vested interest in your product. So you're not like delivering the right the wrong product to the right person or whatever. Yeah. OK. And, you know, just one one thing it's like for the people who say, I tried catalog ads that doesn't work for me. Well, if your catalog ads look like that and you didn't try different designs because you didn't know it was possible or it seemed like too much work to do. Yeah. It's actually really easy to do and they can really unlock your ability to scale catalog ads. You want to look at another example? Yeah, I do. Yeah. OK. This is going to be a different category. Yeah. OK. We're going to look at one of the biggest furniture retailers. I'm always in the market for furniture. I'm like one of those people that my like I just I'm always thinking that I need to completely remodel. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm like, I feel like you have really good like interior design taste. Flash, you know, a picture of my apartment. I try, but I always I feel like every six months I'm like, I need something new. It's probably because it's like always in the background and like my studio is in my living room. So I always feel like I need to like change it up. So well, here's the real test. Do you feel like you get targeted by furniture all the time? All the time. You want to know you want to know who spends a ton of money on me? West down just every single day. You are the target demo. I am. Let's go. I am. I really am. OK. Well, here we have Raymore and Flanagan, OK, which is probably not targeting you. No, they're not. But they are targeting your parents. Yeah, they absolutely are. So this brand tested 10 treatments. These are five of them. Yeah. So a little harder because there's more options to choose from here. But they actually ran some evergreen designs at the same time as running some big fail designs. Yeah. And so and this is one of this actually is an important point. Running sale overlays on catalog ads is like always a performance win. Like that works really well to the point where if you're running holiday sales or seasonal promos and you're not using you're not applying overlays to the items that are on sale in your catalog ads, like you are definitely leaving money on the table. We have never seen that not lift performance, right? And so like it's easy to do. Yeah. It's like it's very easy to do, set up and activate. Well, I don't know why people why everyone doesn't do it. But certainly the brands on Marlpipe do. And so here's some examples. OK, so we got five examples. We have a Memorial Day sale 30 percent off. Got a big juicy offer there, but I won't be tricked this time. President's Day sale, small, small spot. And what's interesting, too, is that one has like in the little CTA button now price point. OK. Number three, your style delivered vast. About six ninety nine. Now, what's interesting is that has no offer. So if we're learning from the last one, I might choose number three. Number four, next day delivery, though, that's really impressive for any type of furniture company and as someone who's bought furniture, if I see next day delivery, I will probably pay up to like 20 to 30 percent more just for that, because it could take. Sometimes furniture takes like six months to deliver. Sale, save one fifty five. OK. I'm going to go with three. Three. Yeah. Why? I'm going to go with three because. It looks like the one that won. Pattern recognition. Pattern recognition. Maybe four. No, let's go three. Let's go three. You were so close, Sarah. What? What was it? What was it? It's four. I hate these things because people always expect me to get it right and they expect me to pick from a lineup the top performing creative and I'm like, it does not work like that. All right. So. So, yeah, number four was the winner. And yeah, it's it's so the the free next day delivery on the mattress is like great value prop. Yeah. So I even I should have listened to myself. I even said I would pay 20 to 30 percent more. And look, the AOV was $300 higher from this. So, so, so then in the 25 percent increase in revenue from attributed to this and 50 percent increase in row as. And what I think too is interesting is like, I think this is a really good example of how you can make categories or product sets for your overall catalog because for Ramon Flan again, not every single product is going to be available on next day delivery. So they're going to have like a set ski list that's like, oh, we have all these things for next day delivery. Let's create a product set for that so that we can deliver that to the right people and push a certain amount of ad spend behind that. Right, right. And this is exactly like you can do things you can get away with with value props that you can't in regular ad creative because of how catalogs are set up, right? So like you can say free next day delivery and this will only appear on on items that that applies to. But if you're a hero, you GC ad, if the main value prop is free next day delivery, but you only have free next day delivery on like, you know, like 10 percent of your product, then like you're screwed, right? Because then people are going to go to your site and be pissed off that like this is going to apply to the thing that they want. Right. Yeah. Right. So you can say like, you know, like $25 first payment with afterpay, right? On like a hundred dollar product. Yeah. Right. Like you can do things like that with catalog ads. You can advertise the afterpay first payment price, right? Because it'll automatically calculate what that is every SKU that's shown. So you can you can get away with like applying value props to things that only apply to certain products rather than your whole store, which is like different from, you know, a video or an image ad overall. Okay. Right. Unless you're really targeted with where you're setting that traffic to, you could get like, you know, fancy with the setup there if you want to, but with catalog ads, it's easy. Yeah. So anyway, um, goes to show like one simple overlay test. Do you think it takes a designer to build this? No, I do not. It doesn't even take a creative strategist. So, so there we are. Um, so thank you for being a good sport. Yeah. I knew I wasn't going to get it. If you, if you guys at home got both of those right, you know, let me know in the comments. I'll give you kudos. Um, so, so, I mean, one of the things that I think like, you know, we're walking away from this, I think with the realization that like, okay, catalog ads are a huge, you know, format. Um, they're really unique in their delivery. So it's important to try to like crack the code. Yeah. Creative is a lever that we can use to crack the code. And there is creative strategy on DPA. That doesn't require a lot of creative resources at all. In fact, paid media managers can do this themselves all the time. You don't need to have creative chops using a tool like MerbPipe. You can do that. Um, but, uh, you know, let's talk about like overall just like, let's zoom out for a second. Right. Maybe and just like one thing I just wanted to make sure we cover was like, um, what kind of brands should use DPA? And if you're just starting out, like what, um, what, what, like, what should you do? Right. Um, so there's like, there's a myth, right? That like you need to have a lot of product SKUs to do really well with DPA. Yeah. Cause some of the brands we talked about today had like 5,000 plus SKUs. Yeah. And for some, I think some brands look at that and they're like 5,000. Like I only have a few hundred. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, so like what is, is it, is this, is this myth true? Um, kind of. Uh, so, um, you know, we like to see, we like to say, okay, if you're like a single, single, like pro, like hero product, direct to consumer brands, which there are like, for example, like really good friends over at nude, a Brian, shout out Brian Kano. Amazing marketers there. Um, yeah. Huge fan over here as well. I'm always looking at their ad library. Yeah. Like they're great. Um, but like they have like three products. Yeah. Right. They have like their main shaver. And then they have like two versions of it, I think. And yeah. So it's like, they only have a few products, hero product, very like straight forward. Like that catalog ads like might not work for you. Right. Um, and in, in, in fact, like the more products you have, the likely, the, the more likely your catalog ads are to perform. Okay. Yeah. So like we like to say that like, I like to see at least 50. Okay. I like to say, see at least 50 skews over 250. Great. We're cooking with oil. Yeah. And I think that's actually too, at the point where creative strategists look at a brand like that and they're like, I'm nervous. How can I account for all of these products? And it's like catalog ads. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And also catalog ads are great for liquidating that like surplus inventory, by the way, that you might not be focusing on in your, in your like hero ad creative. Like if you're making UGC, you're, you're going to be almost definitely talking about your best selling product. Yeah. Yeah. Or the new product. Exactly. And then you're still taking up space in your warehouse catalog ads. Also, yeah. Like a sale or like a discounted offer is another great product set that you could run. Right. Really cheaply. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Right. So great for liquidating the excess inventory. But yeah, we like to see product more products, the better because the more skew data you're giving, you're feeding the algo. So. And what kind of industries would you say would be the best here? Yeah. So, so like we, you know, high skew account industries are like apparel, beauty, market places like gopuff or thrive market, which are two of our really successful customers. Yeah. Travel, travel brands. Yeah. So like travel feeds are pretty crazy looking. Every expi, every travel experience, every trip is a skew. Event ticket companies. So like, I've gotten asked a lot of questions about event tickets lately and I'm like, I have no idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's crazy. Like they have a massive product catalog. Every ticket is a skew. So you can actually create a design to like bring that just raw text data to live in a design. So that works really well. And actually there's some like large travel brands that like build tools to make this possible in-house for themselves. Like they have whole catalog design. I have heard of that. Yeah. Yeah. Which is like crazy. But yeah. So those are some categories like high level. Like they're definitely like the standout ones. But if you're in another category, look at your skew account to determine whether catalog ads is something you should try and really like, you know, keep trying to crack the code for. I would say if you're over 50, you should definitely try it. If you're like over several hundred, it should definitely be working for you. It's just a matter of like, can you crack the code? Right? Yeah. And so how do we crack the code? How do we like get started and set up? You know, like we always look at so many ad accounts from like some of the world's largest brands. Like we work with, you know, like Bloomingdale's and Crocs. I noticed that our studio is on top of an Express store right now. And Express is one of our biggest customers. So we work with brands like that. And you know, obviously like they have their stuff set up there. You know what's interesting? Those like massive retailers, like really know their stuff when it comes to catalog ads, which is very different from my experience talking to DTC marketers. Find that interesting. Like why the biggest ad accounts in the world spending the most that I've seen with the best performance have teams that like really know their catalog stuff. But DTC brands who are like doing all the, you know, like they, a lot of smaller brands just like don't know their catalog stuff. And one thing you can rely on with these like really big retailer teams is they will know their catalog stuff. So like, you know, if you're trying to be like them, you know, maybe like learn, learn from that. Right. And that's actually, that's actually why I wanted to bring you on. And like, just so that you guys know, like Dan didn't sponsor this video, Dan's a good friend of mine. Like we've hung out for years. And I've actually never done any videos about catalog ads or about DPA ads. And something that I've noticed actually as I'm starting to work with much bigger brands is how much bigger of a percentage their ad spend is going to this type of creative that honestly no one else has really talked about and done a deep dive on. So like, I thought it was really important to like highlight this type of ad creative, even though as a creative strategist, I'm honestly not even really necessary for it. So like, like, it doesn't make me nervous. It makes me really excited because I think that a lot of brands right now going into an election year, they're going to be struggling with performance. And you know, there's going to be billions of dollars flowing into these platforms. And it's not just, you know, DPA isn't just for meta. There's also an option now for TikTok, which I want to dive into a little bit more as well. And I think that the more brands that can invest in their catalog health really can help sustain a lot of performance as this year becomes a little bit rockier. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, and I think like that's a really, it's like important to highlight the, I guess, like the opportunity within the fact that this isn't such a discussed thing, right? Like, it's boring, right? From the surface, it seems boring. Hopefully here, we've dug into a lot of reasons why it can be actually really interesting. Yeah. But, you know, like, it's the, the, the, the, there's, they say like that the most like sexy businesses are the most boring ones that like people talk about, right? Like it's the same thing with, with, I think with ads, right? And so there's this like, undiscussed, like not because it's more fun to talk about creative strategy, but catalog strategy brings the big bucks home for the biggest brands. Yeah. And so like, if you want to get serious about scaling your approach there, right, it's something you're going to need to take seriously and dive into. And like we spend all our time thinking about that. And that's what we build resources for. You know, we're always talking about like, if you on our, on our newsletter, we, I think, run the most niche newsletter in all of marketing. Our newsletter has 7,000 marketers on it, that it is only about catalog ads. We run a weekly newsletter where we only talk about catalog ads, news of catalog ads, like, you know, catalog ad creative strategy. And, you know, we have like a very niche, like that's all. So like we have 7,000 marketers who are on our newsletter just looking at just. You know, wanting catalog ad catalog info. And so it's like a bigger, I think, content area than I thought there was demand for. Yeah. When there's few people making content about it, we did make like a really exhaustive guide on from, and this applies. This is for beginners and for like deep experts alike. We actually see that like the biggest brands that we work with and the small mom and pop Shopify startup brands get like an equal amount of value from this. It's on our website. If you go to our website, you're going to get hit with a pop up every single time. That's just going to say the complete guide to DPA in 2023. And this is like a really exhaustive, just guide that we made for like the three pillars of catalog strategy where you can dive in on your own time and you can look at like, what is the perfect setup look like? Where what are the most common like places people go wrong? What are the biggest like errors that people encounter? There's a lot of like, there's a lot of just like stupid potholes that like you don't need to like run over, but people do when it comes to catalog setup. Yeah. Cause it's like a little bit more technical. Like I'm going to be honest. If I'm going to be working with a brand that's going to be setting up a catalog, like I will personally not be setting up, you know, it's like, okay, that's not for me. Exactly. Like, right. So, so, so if, so we have, we have a step by step guide exactly for that, right? For whoever is setting that up. And if that's the marketer, right? Then, you know, all yours about creative strategy, best practices and about channels too. And channels is like the tick-tock piece that you mentioned. Really interesting. So like, okay, this is where it gets fun. So, I've been having fun this entire time, but I'm just, okay. Yeah. I feel like, you know, it's, I love like talking to brands that jump on demos with us because like we are so, we like at Marpite, we are like such so like, nerdily excited about catalog ads in a way that no one else is. Um, but like, Hey, this is what we do all day. So like, we love it. Um, but okay. Channel strategy. This part is so cool. So if meta works really, if meta catalog ads works really well for you, you've cracked the code on it, right? Your next obvious step is to take exactly what's working for you on meta catalog ads and copy and paste that exact catalog that strategy into other paid socials. Right. We find that that translates really well in a way that other creative formats do not at all. Yeah. Because honestly, if you find a format that works on meta, taking that format and sending it to TikTok, in fact, I'd say most of the time that doesn't work. It doesn't. Right. Cause like you need to build a channel specific. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You'll have like your TikTok creative team. You'll have your meta creative team. It's generally the same team, but I often find that they're really good at one or the other. Right. Right. Right. And yeah, like, I don't know. Yeah. Like you have that trend of like TikTok, UGC, like getting popular on meta and then like, I've seen that work. I've seen that pipeline work. Like, okay, if something does really good on TikTok ads, it will likely maybe perform on meta ads, but it never goes the other way. And people wish it would because they are obviously spending a good majority of their testing dollars testing on meta. Yeah. And those learnings don't transfer. So it's just kind of. Learnings don't transfer. But with catalog ads, we've actually seen like, because it's so simple, we've seen like really clean transfer of performance across platform. So once it works really well on meta, we are like really encouraging brands to try that into everywhere else where they spend media dollars and in fact, venture into some places where they haven't. And with TikTok specifically. Yeah. Uh, with, so with TikTok, they used to have this really bad format for catalog ads. So they use it. I see it in my head. They used to force you into these like video templates that were just like pre cooked ones that like they like circle it. Yeah. Yeah. It was like kind of cringy. It was kind of campy. And they were like trying to force video on what is inherently like a static image. Thing. They were ignoring the cardinal rule of catalog ads of like make ads look like ads. They were trying to make it not look like ads, but it's a catalog ad. It should look like an ad. Right. So, um, so, so they were like trying to force. So when you like uploaded your catalog, it had to go filter out through these like, like pre made video templates that you had to pick one that you like. And, um, it was just a, it was a nightmare. Like if people were like, we're like, this doesn't like, this doesn't work half the time. And the other half of the time is like, we don't like it. Right. And so, um, they just released, uh, TikTok just really when they saw it, like the rise of catalog ads is very, very like obvious on meta. Yeah. Um, and, uh, and some would say the, the, uh, the death of UGC, but well, you know, you're really trying to plug that. I won't allow it. Maybe a little true. I love one of my good friends is Daneel, uh, who runs in Sense. Yeah. And I love teasing him with that. I'm like, Daniel, UGC is dead. Catalog ads are long lived DPA. So, um, so, so anyway, um, in the TikTok just released, um, a, uh, a new in November, uh, static, finally they like relented and they were like, you can just run static image DPA. Um, and so now you don't need to force it through these like weird video presets and filter it through that. You can just run regular static image DPA on TikTok and it works really well. Um, and it's, it's, it's a new, it's a new capability there and people who are running it and testing it there are seeing great results. Um, we're talking like, you know, all, all from all different types, shapes, sizes of companies from like the massive biggest retailers you can imagine to like small startups are, if you're seeing success on meta, tested on meta, if you're seeing success there, crack the code, bring it to TikTok, bring it to Pinterest and bring it to snap. Those are the three. Those are the three channels that we see like really clean transfer over and that we encourage you to test. It's interesting. I've been hearing more and more people talking about Pinterest lately and it's actually has the award of being my least favorite ad buying platform. They also call look like audiences, act alike audiences, which I truly hate it as a user, but, um, I've seen a few brands having success with it recently. And I think the brands that are, or the ones that are using catalog ads. I think they're stepping up their game and catalog ads are, it's because the Google, the one of the, the Pinterest new CEO is from Google. Yes. And that you are now able to buy Pinterest ads on Google. Yes. Yes. Yes. Um, I didn't know, oh, well, I knew the guy was from Google. Didn't know you could buy Pinterest ads through Google. You're now able to, or you're going to be able to, they just like announced that functionality. Amazing. That's great. That's, that's so cool. So, I mean, but yeah, like Pinterest, you could see how it lends itself to being a really like catalog ad friendly platform. Yeah. Right. So, um, so yeah, catalog ads do, do great there. Um, and I think most advertisers, I would bet you that like the top advertisers who are winning on Pinterest and spending on Pinterest the most are spending over 75% of their budget, at least on catalog ads. Yeah. Um, which is crazy. Like it's a huge part of our ecosystem. It's under talked about. There's not a lot of resources for it. So I'm like really glad that you are like, recognize that and are like, let's, let's shine some light on this like boring thing that like I have one friend who's like weirdly obsessed about it. Well, I'll say that another reason why I like it is because it's really easy. Like, yes, I'm a creative strategist slash media buyer doing this for years. I am all about optimizing for the platform's strengths, which is why like, you don't need to do like audience targeting anymore on meta. And this is just kind of like another step in that direction. Like why over complicated? And I have seen brands just getting amazing results out of DPAs lately. But again, like I always shied away from it a little bit because of the technical catalog setup aspect that I like could not and would not explain to anyone to do. But I just don't even think that a lot of people have this type of ad unit on their radar. And honestly, the big unlock for me is like that the delivery mechanism is so different and it is really like that competitor hack that I don't think enough people know. The competitor hack, the like the simplest. Yeah, just exact. And I mean, I think that once you can overcome the initial hurdle of like the perceived complexity of the setup, you really. Just pay someone to do it, you know. Pay us to do it. I don't care. Well, that's what we're here for. Yeah. Yeah. So, so I mean, yeah, but there, yeah, pay someone to do it or do it yourself. We have a guide for it. So choose your path. Yeah. You know, you could do it for free if you want to go through our guide or you could just pay someone to deal with it for you. Then all you need to do is slap on some really creative, like really simple, Canva-esque overlays. Yeah. Test them and like profit. You know, like so, so, so yeah. So I think something that a lot of like meta advertisers and creative strategists, like one of their hurdles to a DPA ads is like, there's no video function. So I'm kind of interested, like, are there, is there a possibility to have like video DPAs? Is that even a thing? Yeah. So, so we, like, TikTok has, I think as we know, attempted this unsuccessfully. But on, I think where they went wrong is like the presets, right? They forced you into these like weird pre-templates. Ugly templates. Yeah. And so, so what, what meta is doing right now is actually really interesting. Shout out to the meta team. Like clearly meta is investing a lot of engineering resources into making catalog ads a lot better because they're, they just meta just rolled out. And I think it's in all ad accounts now. I know that before they did a slow roll out. So it was one of those things where like 5% of ad accounts had access to it and then 10 and 50. So I think they're at 100. I think everyone has access to this now. But you are able to upload video, like your own completely custom video as a DPA ad format in, in DPA ads, right? So, so like the, if you have product videos of your products as a column in your product feed, which not many people do, but now people are creating because of this new functionality. If you have product level video, you know, sometimes you have those stores, like actually Kizzik is an example of this. So Kizzik has on every product page, they have a little video of their product too. It's like you have the images. So, so like on a product page, you know, you'll see like the images and so you'll, you can go through all the angles and then you'll see like at the, maybe the end or like last slide, maybe like an image, a video that like will do like a little 360 of it or something simple like that. Right. Um, so if you have that in your, that means that they have a video column in their product, that's what that means, right? So, um, they can, you can now run that as the DPA. Uh, so you can take advantage of the DPA delivery format with video, like in motion, right? Which you couldn't do on meta ever before. This is new. Interesting. So in theory, like if you're a big retailer and you noticed, Hey, we have this one video that does really well for one of our best selling products on meta, we could take that top performing video, put it into like, put it on the website as one of the product options when you're scrolling through our product images, once you're scrolling through, that would then be uploaded as a video, like as a video in the catalog, which means that you could be using that same ad creative on a completely different delivery mechanism. Exactly. Exactly. And, um, and, and this is current, this is something that like before meta rolled out to everyone, they tested with brands like Kizick. Um, and, uh, and they saw that it worked, uh, you know, it worked. Um, so the performance is there. It's like the benefits of DPA delivery plus the benefits of like motion and video, uh, the, the thumb stopping element there, you know, when, uh, so, so if you, so like if you have, uh, you can, so that's like a new kit, net new capability with ads that is new, exciting and people are testing right now. And if you're a brand that is seeing success with catalog ads and you haven't tested this yet, you definitely should. Yeah. Yeah. I think like one of the big things I'm taking away too is like, if you're a media buyer for a brand that has over 50 skews and likely you're a media buyer for a brand that has more than that, like, and you aren't up to speed on DPA and catalog, like you really need to be. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. And so like thank you for inviting me and letting me nerd out about. Thanks, sir. You know, I think this is like the only DPA masterclass on YouTube, which I'm really excited about hosting. Yeah. Um, but let's, you know, give people the hard sell on Mar pipe. Yeah. Yeah.
