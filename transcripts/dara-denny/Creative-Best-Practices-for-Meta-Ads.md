What's up marketers? One of the most common questions I get asked is what are your best practices for creative on meta ads? And sure, there's the easy stuff like design, text, or the technical best practices or specs, you know, the kind of stuff like this. But what I'm talking about is how to actually develop creative that converts. How can you really put your best effort forward with a creative to develop something that actually makes customers want to buy from you? It's a whole lot trickier than making sure that you have a one by one and a nine by 16 of each image. So these are going to be my seven best creative practices and a huge thanks to Storyblocks for sponsoring this video. They play a huge role in helping out one of these steps particularly. I'm also going to be showing you a peek at what my real live creative checklist looks like at the end of this video. It's only ever been available in my performance creative course, so be sure to stay to the end to see that. So let's go ahead and start with number one. You have to have an understanding of the top performing formats on paid social and you have to make the decision on which format is going to be right for your demographic, your message, and even the platform. So these are some of the top performing formats. We have a features point out image in us versus them static or GIF. We also have before and afters, which can come in a wide variety of formats. We have a UGC problem solution ad, a UGC tutorial. We have testimonials, which can be an image or video form, founder stories, press and news features, statistics, and of course, ugly ads. So knowing these formats and knowing when to use them, this is really step one of creative strategy and step one of your creative best practices. The first thing you should ask yourself when looking at your creative is, okay, does my ad creative fall into one of these top performing categories? And if not, why are you making that decision? And can your message potentially be better communicated using another format? Something to consider. Number two is for video creative only, and it's to understand your hook in your hold rates and how to increase them. So your hook rate is going to determine how good you are at getting people's attention. Essentially, this is the percentage of all impressions who watch the first three seconds of your video. And your hold rate is going to tell you how good you are at keeping or maintaining that attention. So this is going to be the percentage of impressions that watch up to 15 seconds of your video, or if your video is under 15 seconds, that means that they've watched the entire thing. And these are both custom metrics that you have to add in manually to ads manager, kind of annoying. So here are the formulas for them both so that you can be sure to add those. Now, there are many tactics and strategies that you can do to increase both of these metrics for increasing the hook rates, particularly it's a combination of using the right imagery and the right messaging in your hook. So on the messaging side, some things that I've seen increase those hook rates are to state a common problem. You can also call out your demographic by age or role, which really helps in the targeting. And on the imagery side, you can use different camera movements or angles to initially gain that attention. You can also use ugly ad tactics or even insert bright colors to stand out against the monotony of the feed. And these ideas even become more important when you're considering how to increase your hold rates. So how you're considering, Hey, how can I actually maintain that attention? And the idea here is to that, okay, if I can attract more attention and maintain more of that attention, the idea is that the conversion rates will go up, which is definitely a correlation I've seen a lot with video ad creative. So some of the problems that I often come up against with video creative is that, you know, number one, the pacing is off or they have bad B roll or no B roll at all. So instead of waiting a few weeks to get more creator content or my God schedule another shoot, which can really delay things and cost a ton of money, I just use storyblocks. Storyblocks has everything that you need to make better ad creative that converts. They have a curated stock library, professional video editing templates for your favorite program, including After Effects, Premiere Pro and Apple Motion. They also have sound effects and motion graphics, which can include things like title animations overlays and logo reveals. So for hook rates, particularly, here's how I use storyblocks. So if I'm working with a brand and I'm like, we're not doing a good job at stopping the squirrel here, we need more color, we need more texture, we need to really agitate that problem more, I'll actually go into storyblocks and see if they have any additional footage that could stand out better than anything we currently have on hand. And my little hack here is to think about texture plays that feel oddly satisfying. I know this is a term that we've used a lot over the years when talking about creating content for paid social. So I like to look at the squeeze footage or even the paint or paint splash footage, even just adding a few of these clips alongside creator content. This has gone a long way in producing more creative that actually converts for the platform. And for increasing hold rates when I need to increase the pacing or increase the amount of b-roll, I like looking at clips that can help add emotion or integrating footage that can communicate more of a background or a setting. Also more texture plays can be really effective here. Now the big thing that I love about Storyblocks is that you were in the clear on all things legal. Anything that you download with Storyblocks is 100% royalty free. It's literally the best coverage in the industry and you don't have to worry about double checking that you still have the rights.

Now at number three when it comes to creative best practices is you need to use messaging directly from your customers and you'll need a system to extract that information. Right? You're going to need to make sure that you're routinely going through and looking at your reviews from people who've ordered your product and let you review on the website, going through your ad comments to see how people are perceiving your brand or if any other reviews from your customers got placed there and some of the website. I go through a process that's called customer review mining. So I actually categorize the different types of hints and clues that my customers are leaving inside of their reviews. Here's a quick slide to show you exactly what I mean. So we have a pain point pre-purchase. So what type of pain was your customer experiencing before they bought your product? Also the trigger, which can also be known as the discovery. So what actually caused them to buy and how did they discover your brand? I also like to find failed attempts. So what were some of the other things that they tried to solve their problem that didn't end up working for them? That can really help twist the knife a little bit more and make their problem seem more urgent. And of course we want to look for those transformations, right? We want to see their better life realized. And my expert tip here is to look out for those golden nugget reviews. Those are the reviews that are super special that stick out in your mind and honestly couldn't possibly be manufactured by a brand or a team member. You should never ever make up testimonials. I have to find that sometimes when teams are lost in the sauce on their ad creative, one of the big things I realized that they're doing incorrectly is they're not actually using that messaging directly from their customers. And number four, like and subscribe to this channel. No seriously, I show hundreds and hundreds of ad creators on this channel. Every single month I release one video every single week on Tuesday or Wednesday mornings. So you will be in great company if you are trying to grow your brand's paid social particularly if you're trying to crack the creative nut. And number five is actually going to zoom in on one of the most popular formats right now, which are ugly ads. And I believe that you have to have a balance of ugly performance ads and your branding and how you're actually trying to stick out in the sea of your competitors. You know, there is a really big debate between performance creative versus branding creative and just growth and brand teams in general. And I often find that the brands who do the best are the ones that are wildly experimental and they're down to do ugly ads. They're down to test this new and exciting format, but they also stay true to their brand and they are a little bit aspirational. And they, you know, as much as they are putting out these type of post-it note ads, they're also trying things that are a little bit more elevated. I find that sometimes when brands just decide, okay, we're going to do ugly ads only, that it's not actually the ugly ads that are the problem, it's the teams that are the problem. And they get a little bit of blazy with their output because they just kind of think that they can throw anything against the wall. That's just my kind of hot take. Very hot. But yeah, I'd say that like as a creative best practice, especially if you're someone that's reviewing ad creative, you need to have a good eye for, okay, is this actually going to reach and press and motivate my customer? Or is it just going to stick out because it's unusual? Number six is another one that's kind of nuanced, but does the ad creative pass the sniff test? And essentially what this means is, okay, if you're using creator content, is the creator actually believable? And if you're using more image style content, okay, are you actually using messaging from your customers? Does it actually feel like something that's going to motivate them and attract them and be representative of their desires? Or are you using too much jargon or marketing speak or something that's too technical? Sometimes when I'm reviewing creator content, and I feel like the creators are doing a bad job of acting, or I'm reviewing image creatives, and I'm like, ah, you know, the messaging just is a little off or there's something that's about it, but I can't really say what that is. I'm categorizing that as, oh, it doesn't pass the sniff test for me. And oftentimes when I decide, oh, let's just deploy these anyways, oftentimes the response from users on Instagram, on Facebook, isn't favorable because they too are, you know, feeling that same, that you initially felt. So listen to your gut on that one and have more conversations with your team about the sniff test. It's not something I've ever heard someone talk about on YouTube or on Twitter. So and number seven is kind of like a last line of dispense after all of this strategy, which is you need to have an understanding of visual hierarchy and basic design principles, aka when you are looking at a creative, particularly statics, you need to ask yourself, where does the I initially want to go? Is this best for attracting your target audience? Is this best for motivating that target audience? Also, how is your padding? How are you using white space? And can you help provide more white space or more direction so that the I is initially going to the most important part of your message first? This is actually something that I found was like one of the hardest things to teach creative teams, particularly video editors. Most times I feel like designers really understand this, but it's a little bit harder, I think to teach video editors this to teach media buyers this and to even teach creative strategists this. So this is something that I find myself really trying to brush up on teams with and it's something that I kind of have a eagle eye for. And finally, you know, when it comes to creative best practices, it's going to be a little different for every single brand, right? Every single brand is going to have certain dos and don'ts, which is why having a checklist is really super, super important. So I have a creative QA checklist that I used when I was managing creative teams and that I still use to this day when I am working with brands. So in a few steps, right, we have step one, the basics, look at the asset in its entirety, watch the asset in its entirety and get the dumb stupid shit out of the way, right? Are the timelines correct or the size is correct? Are the safe zones being respected? Look at all this text, look at, you know, look at for the spelling mistakes, the right font, the auto captions, all that stuff. Also listen to the asset with headphones. Sometimes it will sound different. I've even had this happen to me on YouTube recently. And of course, did you follow brand guidelines? This one's a little hard, you know, sometimes that's going to be several dos and don'ts. But you know, did you do it? A question that I always like to ask the creators make that contact, does this look good to you really? So why or why not? Fix it. The second step is like those performance boosters. So these are going to be the things that I've found to really increase conversion rates on creative. So do you have that engaging hook? Is your pacing quick enough? Does the storyline make sense? And then, okay, let's look at performance boosters. Is there a way that we can inject a little bit more human desire here to make this more effective? And then for images particularly, you know, look at the asset, determine where your eye is going first. Also look at the asset on your phone. Is it easy to read? Can you cut out any words? One of the biggest things I often give people feedback on is, hey, it's too wordy or the padding isn't correct or we really need to get rid of a lot of fluff here. And of course, the dos and don'ts. This is going to be specific to every single brand and oftentimes, this ends up being the longest checklist. So every time you end up doing a creative test or every few creative tests, you're going to have learnings, you're going to have things that you know the brand likes or doesn't like. Be sure to add those in so that you're not reinventing the wheel every single time because that's not fun. Again, huge thanks to Storyblocks for sponsoring this video.
