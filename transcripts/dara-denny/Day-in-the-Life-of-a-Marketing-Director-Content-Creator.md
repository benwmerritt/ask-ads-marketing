Music Because it makes us think, what are we missing? Sometimes we can win. And I'm not. What's up marketers? Welcome to a day in the life of a senior director of marketing. My technical title is senior director of performance creative. Essentially that just means at thesis I oversee all of the ad creative team. So our studio team, our post production team, our creative director team, and our UGC division team. Now I have tons of meetings today. I don't have my first meeting until 10 a.m. today, which is with a really big client. I also have an in-person meeting later today in Soho. There's going to be a lot going on today. I'm also going to be filming two podcasts later with Savannah Sanchez. We do the purchase optimized podcast. Be sure to check that out. For me, my work life is completely dictated by my Google calendar, which you see here all that blue that is all meetings. It is a lot. And also my to-do list. Oh God, what's something quick that I can do so that I can feel the slightest bit accomplished today? Okay, now I have to review some creative for a big client of ours. And essentially what I'm going to be doing is adding in some additional creative, strategic analysis, you know, stuff in easy. So that's why I'm actually having in for the specific creative retro. So I'm going to knock this out for a little bit. And I'm like four problems at once that made me queasy. I know. I like welcome. Here are some of the brands actually that I'm doing UGC content for. This is a new thesis brand, which like is supposed to make your eyelashes longer. It's pretty cool. Act in an acre. I was possibly going to be doing some consulting with them and then obvi. So I am a friend of Ashes and I actually got this box during D to C after dark. But I never got to actually film that content. So I'm going to be doing that. Now I'm also doing UGC content for this new brand. It's a wine brand. I think is really cool. I was doing some unboxing stuff for them yesterday, but it's called Gratzi and they sent me a whole bunch of wine, which. And they sent me a whole bunch of wine and some glasses, which is really fun. I'm actually going to be filming some stuff with my boyfriend tomorrow, which I'm really excited about. So I had been prepping for this big client meeting that I had ironically right before my in person meeting. And that's what I was doing this creative analysis for. And I just found out I got pushed the next week, which is actually fine because I was panicking a little bit because I was trying to figure out. Okay, how am I going to finish up the strategy research, eat lunch, get to Manhattan? And I'm going to have to take this meeting in Manhattan because that meeting is right before my in person meet. And what long story short got moving next week, which is great. So I actually just ordered lunch. I'm going to go pick it up right now and just take a deep breath for a little bit. Okay, about to eat some lunch. I just made like a sort of healthy Caesar from Sweet Green, which is really my go to because it's so close by to my apartment. This is where I check out to really go through my analytics and see what you guys are liking on the YouTube front. I will say the last video I did, y'all didn't really like so much the best TikTok ads. I knew this was kind of a gamble because it's just like me reacting to ads and like some of you like the super fans are going to like that because you really want to understand how I analyze these ads, but it's not like step by step education showing you a new process or anything. So let me know what you thought of that video and if you didn't like it, like those are especially the people that I want to hear from, but you know, can't win them all. So that's just part of the game on YouTube. I decided that I am going to go ahead and commute to the city. I'm going to take the train. So I'm just going to go ahead and pack up and find a cafe and so that I can chill out in a little bit. For those of you that have taken meetings with me, you realize that I am now wearing red lipstick for almost all of my meetings. And honestly, it's just a power move. So I've been vlogging this entire day and it's kind of funny. I feel a little bit more stressed vlogging because I feel like I have to vlog everything, but it doesn't at all feel high stakes ever. So like my normal YouTube videos, I'm like, oh my God, I have to explain this in the perfect way and I have to try for clarity, clarity, clarity. And this is just kind of like, I'm just going to show you the kind of shit I'm doing. This was a 10 dollar card. This meeting just got finished. Honestly, it went really well. I love meeting people in person. It's like one of my simple pleasures after COVID. But I'm going to go grab a cab right now. I had to go to Brooklyn because I had to onboard a client. Okay, finally just got out of that car. It honestly took way longer than usual because there was a lot of traffic on the bridge for some reason. But I got something very exciting in the mail. So you can see that says Dara Denny LLC. That's right. I'm incorporated. Limited liability seal, New York. We love that. Oh God, what is this? I truly have no idea what this thing is. All of my papers that say, hey, you're a business. I thought I had like 10 minutes to get ready and prep for this meeting. I have three. I'm not going to be leading this meeting and I'm just going to essentially jump in and do a quick intro on myself and like what the brand can expect from. Oh my God, this just deflated. And then at 530, I have a podcast recording with Savannah, which I'm really stoked about. Oof, just out of that meeting. It's always this time of the day where the sun is just wild. I have five minutes until I start filming my podcast with Savannah. It has been nonstop today. And the staff has an emergency, so I'm going to need to postpone either to later today or another day. Pretending to talk on YouTube. Bum bum bum bum. Okay. Today, we're going to talk about how to properly brief your UGC creators. What's up marketers? In today's video, I'm going to show you exactly how to brief a UGC creator. I just filmed that video. Woo! Oh, what a day. I'm supposed to be filming with Sav in a minute. It's been a lot. It's been a day, my guys. Okay, Sav has had to reschedule to do a client thing, which I totally get. I've been there about a million times. I really feel like I need to go for a walk and do some like self-care stuff. What's likely going to happen is that Facebook is going to pull the spend into two or three of those. So what's going to happen with the other? Okay, I just got back. I went on my walk. I even made a TikTok because someone made a response to another one that I posted this morning. And yeah, I'm going to do some intentional unwinding tonight. I'm going to order in some healthy food. I'm going to watch my new favorite TV show, Tell Me Lies, anyone else watching. And just try to decompress a little bit. I often find a lot of times that I get done with thesis work around six or seven. And then I eat and then I am doing consulting work until midnight or I'm cleaning until midnight. I just don't really feel like I've had that much time recently to like sit down and decompress. And I really feel like I need that now. So I'm going to do that. But thank you so much for spending the day with me. Let me know if you like these kind of videos. And if you'd like to see more of these, I have some really fun, exciting travel and studio shoots coming up. And I'd love to share them and take you guys along for the ride if you're interested. All right, that's it. I will see you next week. Thanks so much, guys. Bye. Oh, like and subscribe. It really helps, especially if you're like watching until the song. It literally costs you nothing. It's the hot new thing.
