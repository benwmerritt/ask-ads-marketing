What's up marketers? Welcome to a day in my life as a content creator. Now, many of you know that I have a full time job where I am the senior director of performance creative, which means that I oversee all of the ad creative teams at an agency called thesis. But today's president's day, and we actually have off at the agency, but I have a full day of work ahead of me for content creation, aka my side business. So I wanted to take you guys along for the ride. We have a lot to do today. I have tons of administration work to do. I have to do my taxes. I have to make sure I'm still going to be speaking in a few weeks. And I also have to do a not so fun refund type of thing. I'm also going to be filming three YouTube videos, five tick tocks, one UGC video, and I have to upload my YouTube video and create my thumbnail for tomorrow's upload. Oh, and I want to find a therapist. So I want to try and get that out of the way as well. So I was already up pretty early today. I got up at seven and I went to my eight AM Pilates class. I'm going to go ahead and have breakfast and start planning for today. Okay, we have so much to do today. So if I'm going to be filming three YouTube videos, five tick tocks in a UGC video, I want to go ahead and get one of the tick tocks out of the way. Now, I have actually been doing several tick tocks every single day for the last few weeks. I just recently decided I wanted 100k followers on tick tock for not really much of a reason, but I have seen my YouTube channel starting to grow quite a bit. And now I'm also posting to short. So it really was a good decision to me. Now the way that I'm figuring out the ideas for all of these videos that I'm making is through this notion board that my friend Michael Sanchez made. He actually created one specifically for you guys as well. So I'm going to include that in the description bar below. And I literally just looked through these hooks and I choose which one I'm going to wake. So I'm going to choose a now and then make a tick tock. So I figured out which tick tock I'm going to make. So I'm going to go ahead and set up and I'm going to make it right here. People always ask me how I look so good on zoom calls and on tick tock videos. And it's because of this little right here. Ask yourself this one question before you launch that ad on Facebook ads. I can be really can be what? It doesn't even introduce till you know second 10 or even second 15. Pretty good. Ask yourself this one question before you launch that new creative on Facebook ads. One tick tock posted it in the bag. I am not actually feeling so well today. It's kind of a bummer. I just have a bit of a migraine. I already took some medicine. So I'm going to still really try and power through the day and get some stuff done. I am going to actually go through my tick tock and post one of the top performers to YouTube shorts now. I've been saying that's been a great way to get new subscribers, get new people on the channel and also just increase views overall. It's really done a lot in a short amount of time. So I'm going to go ahead and do that and then from feeling better by then hopefully I kind of want to go to a coffee shop and break up the day to do my taxes, checking on ad world stuff and then do some of the not so fun refund stuff. I'm actually so curious about how this video is going to do on YouTube shorts because it went viral on tick tock. Okay, so I decided to step out for a little bit. There is construction going on in the building right next to me and it makes it impossible to work from during the day. So there's going to be no way I can film those three YouTube videos until after 5 p.m. which means it's going to be kind of a long day. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to a cafe. I've always had this idealistic notion that I could do admin work from a cafe during the night. So I'm actually going to try that and then I might actually go and get some headphones or something from Best Buy because it's been getting really, really hard to work from the day with all the construction going on. So let's go to a cafe. Let's do some tax work and some other blah admin work and get to it. One final thing though, the only thing that I have to film during the day is the UGC thing. I can do all the tick tocks and stuff at night but to be honest, the sound doesn't need to be impeccable for that like it does for the YouTube videos. So I'm still going to have a little bit of filming stuff to do but most of it is going to be pushed into the evening. Okay. So I was able to finish most things. Yay. And now I'm going to have some lunch and then I do think I am going to actually make a quick trip to Best Buy because the construction is pretty loud and I need to get some noise cancelling headphones. So let's get some lunch and then I think I'm going to try and film two tick tocks before I go. Okay. Done with lunch. So now I'm back to figuring out which hooks I'm going to use for my next two tick tocks. Okay. So it's about 130 and I want to try and like get a lot of relaxation in later tonight. Got back from my workout, had a quick shower. I'm going to hurry up and get ready and put on some makeup. I have a little bit of golden hour sunlight peeping through and I want to do that UGC so that I can just get it done and out of the way. So let's go. Oh, okay. We only have a little bit of optimal sunlight left. So let's go ahead and quickly film this UGC. By the way, this UGC that I'm filming, I don't really do much UGC anymore for brands because I found that number one, I was spending way too much time doing it and it just wasn't as profitable for me. But I am working with a brand right now as a part of my freelance business to source some creators for them. It's a bit of a difficult niche. So I wanted to create some content that could actually serve as an example to the creators that we're working with. So I'm going to go ahead and do that really quickly now. Do almost all of my UGC here standing by the window because the sunlight is so good. Okay, three cameras rolling. Let's go ahead and shoot this UGC. A master class on CBD in under 30 seconds. A master class on CBD in under 30 seconds. A master class on CBD. Do a few more takes and then we should be good to go. Let's go. So I was able to finish the UGC. Yay, I think it's going to come out amazing. So right now what I want to do is I actually want to get some B-rolls from shots of me sitting down, some shots of me on the phone on the couch and just something I can use to jazzy the YouTube videos a little bit more because I feel like they've been a little boring lately. So I'm going to do that because there's still a lot of construction going on upstairs and luckily this won't affect the audio quality or anything. I'm definitely still going to have to wait until five to film the three YouTube videos I have for today and what I might actually do is I might do a fourth one. So we'll see. I would really be going above and beyond there but I do want to be a little bit ahead of schedule moving forward so let's go. They just got an interesting email actually. Another consulting opportunity. Oh there's a dumb cat. It's interesting. So two of the TikTok videos that I did today were both about creative strategy and I know that that's not going to be as engaging of a video as something having to do with Facebook. Ads or something having to do with which creative to run. Like I found that people just want to know the format or the type of creative they should be doing for their brand but they don't actually want to put in the legwork to know how to develop that strategy, know what type of imagery and what type of messaging is actually going to make their customer convert but some of the comments that I get on TikTok are just so brutal. So I have been posting there a lot and if you guys want more of my content be sure to go over to TikTok to watch me over there and give me some encouragement in the comments because it is rough. Interesting. Okay not a ton of b-roll but I think I'm done for a little bit. This is technically a day off so I want to try and enjoy it a little bit. I am going to hang out for about an hour and that's when the construction should be done upstairs and then I can go ahead and start filming then but I think what I might do actually is I might really quickly write out another script so that I can end up completing four videos today instead of just three. I think that's how I was supposed to work. Well it might be five actually if I'm including this day in the life of video that I'm doing. We'll see. Nothing gives me more anxiety than my calendar. Okay it is literally 5 p.m. on the dot so I'm gonna get set up and I'm gonna start filming these three maybe four videos. If this looks familiar it's because we are starting to film videos now. Yay let's see if we can do four. We're definitely doing three though. What's up marketers? Today's video is gonna be about the 10... What's up marketers? Today's video is gonna be about the 10 ad creatives you need to test on your Facebook ads. First video down I'm not gonna lie the ending on that one really sucked so sorry but I'm just kind of like tired. I'm really feeling that like end of the day grind right now so I have at least two more to make. Maybe I will try to make the fourth one. I don't know I really wish I didn't say that now because I feel sort of obligated but I'm gonna take a deep breath. I'm gonna get some water and then I'm gonna shoot the other one. I just filmed video number two. I'm ready for number three. I don't know if I'm ready for number four. I just didn't even write the script so it's like kind of not even in my head. I was thinking about showing people how much money I'm making with 30k subscribers. If you're interested in that actually let me know and then I'll make it. I'm not gonna do it now. What's up everyone in today's video we're going to be reviewing some bad ads. Now I know on this channel you know ad... Also I did a short video on TikTok and it did really well so I want to try it on YouTube too. I don't need to explain everything. I'm screw it. I'm only doing three. I didn't even write the other script so you know it's trying to go above and beyond. Can't always get there so I have completed all of the content today. I can't believe it. I am gonna chill out for a little bit. I still have one TikTok to post but I already filmed and edited it so it's just in draft. It's ready to go. I'm gonna chill out for a little bit but I'll be sure to say goodbye before I head to bed. Catch you later. Okay y'all I'm signing off today. I was able to watch a little bit of TV but I just have like this tension headache or something. I don't know. I need to go to bed early so thank you so much for spending the day with me and I'll see you next week. Bye!
