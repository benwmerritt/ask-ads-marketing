Hey friends, today's video is going to be a bit different than the normal how to Facebook ads content. I'm going to be diving into how you can be a media buyer. Now this video was actually requested by a few subscribers of mine. So if you're interested in seeing more of this kind of content, be sure to leave me a comment below. So this video is going to dive into what a media buyer actually is. Reasons why I love this career path. Honestly, I'm so thankful every single day to be in this industry, as well as how you can get your first paid gig in media buying in the exact places I'm going to tell you where to find those gigs. I've actually generated over $30,000 in revenue for myself in the last two years. And also probably most importantly, how you can be a great media buyer. There are thousands of media buyers advertising their services. And to be honest, the quality is rough. And if you would put in a little bit extra effort to be one of the greats, it would make a world of a difference in the service that you provide as well as the kind of money you can make. So definitely stay around for that. Number one, what is a media buyer? According to Google, a media buyer is responsible for the placements and negotiation of price for all advertisements on radio, television, print and digital. The primary goal is to ensure that the advertisements are seen by most people possible for that target audience within the budget. And for the purposes of this video and for my actual job, I work in digital media primarily in paid social, which means that I buy and strategize advertising on things like Facebook ads, Snapchat, TikTok and Pinterest and sometimes Google. So if you buy ads for any of these platforms, you would be considered a media buyer. And like, yes, thanks Google. But like, what does a media buyer actually do? What does that actually look like? For me, I am a director of paid social at a leading advertising agency. And I actually lead a team of media buyers and their days look different every single day. But in general, we're, you know, creating the paid social strategy for clients, which means selecting the platforms that we actually want to advertise. So of course, not every single client is going to be a good fit for things like TikTok and Snapchat. But that is part of the overall strategy is deciding which platforms we want to put our clients on. Number two, meeting with clients and vendors. I spend a lot of my day in meetings, of course, even like writing copy for ads and like developing that creative ad strategy. That's something that's becoming more and more important on paid social. So we spent a lot of time going through the creative and figuring out what kind of creatives we want to run analyzing current campaigns and AV tests, and of course, actually deploying that strategy, those campaigns and those tests directly in ads manager. So like I said, honestly, no two days are the same. Now to be a media buyer, you don't have to work on a team full time like I do. You can also freelance or start your own business or agency or even act as a consultant for other businesses. Now I've actually done all these things one way or another in my career. And I definitely think that the best way for media buyers to start out is to actually get a few paid gigs before you go chasing after those full time positions when I'm going to get ready to dive into that more in just a second. So now how to get your first job in media buying or your first paid gig? Like I said, I really do recommend people start off by doing a little bit of freelance to make sure that it's right for them and also so that you can get a few results and data brags under your belt so that you can more accurately show what an asset you'll be to the media buying team. Number one, you need to educate yourself as much as possible on all the platforms that you want to be running. So in addition to reading articles and watching YouTube videos, you need to consider getting certified because potential employers actually look really positively on that. And if you're trying to get a job where you're going to be primarily using Facebook ads, for instance, then really consider getting blueprint certified. Even though I do not recommend blueprint certification as a way to learn Facebook ads, if you're trying to get a job where you're going to be using Facebook ads, potential employers and potential clients really look on that favorably. So that will put you ahead of other people that are trying to get that same gig or drop. Google also offers a similar free course as well as Snapchat. So you can also add those things to your arsenal to stand out from the crowd. I think that marketing degrees are pretty much trash. They're all theory and fluff and you're not going to be really learning anything actionable that you're going to be taking to a business. Now, number two, you're going to need to tailor your resume and your cover letter for the job that you want. And be sure to highlight the relevant experience you have, particularly the numbers. Instead of writing just what you did at that job, be sure to communicate what impact your actions had. Priority is obviously going to be given to any kind of paid media experience that you had, but be sure to also include other forms of marketing, as well as any kind of content creation or team leadership experience that you have. And the reason why is this, clients and agency need people that are really good communicators, but can also lead the strategy. In many cases, your clients or even potentially the people on your team are not going to know that much about Facebook ads or Google. So part of the reason why they're hiring you is so that they can also learn things from you. And also please tailor your cover letter. I'd suggest picking out your three best data brags and then tailoring the beginning and ending for the exact position or gig that you want. I've done tons of hiring in my career and honestly, you'd be surprised at what random bullshit companies get. Fortunately for you, you're definitely going to stand out if your cover letter is tailored to the job posting in company and it's extremely relevant. And number three is a little bit unusual, but I highly recommend anybody who wants to be a media buyer to start a website. A one pager is totally fine, but this goes a long way in establishing trust. And it also allows people to get to know you so that they don't forget you after they see your resume once. This is also just a really great way again to highlight those data brags, those screenshots, so that people feel like that you really know what you're doing. I can definitely say that all the gigs I had, as well as my full-time position, was because of the website that I had at the time. Now, I currently don't exactly have a website, but I'm also not looking for anything right now either. And number four is to start conversations with people who are looking to hire media buyers. And to be honest, there's no shortage of people looking. I honestly get DMed probably five to 10 times a day for people looking for qualified trustworthy media buyers. And again, I want to say this, you might be ultimately looking for a full-time position, but if you're just starting out in this industry, I highly, highly recommend getting a few freelance clients and really starting to hone your craft and then taking those data brags that you get from those wins from your freelance clients and taking those to larger agencies so you can get a full-time media buyer position. So when I was starting off as a media buyer and I was going after those initial gigs before getting my full-time position, the two best places I found to get my first gigs were community Slack channels. And one is Online Geniuses, which is all about marketing. And there's a really good hiring channel on that, that I've definitely gotten clients out of. And another one is for Ladies Get Paid. And yes, it is mostly for people who identify as female, but just those two Slack channels in combination from these, I was able to generate over $30,000 in freelance revenue for myself over the last two years. So those are two really great resources. Now, there are also a few Facebook groups that I see tons of posting on, but I just don't think the quality is as high as what I see in Ladies Get Paid or in Online Geniuses. So like I said, those were the four steps that I took to get my first few gigs as a media buyer, which eventually led me to my first full-time position as well. But be sure to watch to the end of this video where I show you how to be a great media buyer, because honestly, once you get to that point, you're earning power skyrockets and you honestly cannot keep up with the business that comes your way. But next, I actually want to dive into why I love my job and why I think that being a media buyer is a great career choice. So number one, you're going to have job security if you decide to become a media buyer. The agency that I currently work at as well as my personal consulting boomed during the COVID-19 crisis. And really, as long as you're able to adapt and stay current on the platform, you're always going to have a job and also take care of yourself, which is really important. And another reason why I really like this job is you can make some really good coin as a media buyer. And like I said, if you are a great media buyer, then the sky is truly the limit on what you can make. Definitely well into six figures. I find that beginning media buyers for their first full-time job are making anywhere from 40k per year to 50k per year. And those that are more senior are making anywhere around from 70 to 85k. But if you're a really good freelancer or even an agency owner, you can very, very easily make six figures. And if you're just starting off as a media buyer, getting those first few gigs, I find that you can easily make around anywhere from 500 to really $2,000 per month per client. So number three is actually probably one of my most favorite things about being a media buyer, but it's that you can truly work from anywhere. Now I started working remotely about a year before the pandemic happened. And within that year, I actually was able to work and travel full-time on four different continents. But I've also been promoted twice within that time. So one of the things that I love about that is that I didn't have to sacrifice my career to live the kind of alternative lifestyle that I wanted to lead. And I can confidently say that the year where I traveled and worked full-time was easily one of the best years of my entire life. And again, I'm really grateful that I didn't have to sacrifice either my career or the kind of life that I wanted to lead for that. And media buying is what made that possible. And number four, the work is actually fun as hell. I truly love building businesses and seeing how my work directly impacts the bottom line. So if you like seeing immediate impacts from your work, a career in media buying could be really good for you. Additionally, again, no two days are the same and no two businesses are the same. I always find that there's a new challenge to overcome and I rarely find myself ever getting bored. Additionally, the industry is always changing as well. And I like that. I can definitively say that the job I had a year ago is completely different from the job that I have now. And that's a do partly because of how quickly these platforms change. And I actually really like that. I find that as a fun challenge. And the last thing I want to talk about is how you can actually not only be a media buyer, but how you can be a great media buyer, which is going to open up a lot more doors for you. It's going to give you a better quality client. And ultimately, you're going to be able to make a lot more money if you start focusing on differentiating yourself in these key areas. And number one is, you know, I really do find that the best media buyers create their own content. You know, that can be in having a blog, doing Twitch videos, YouTube videos, or even having a newsletter. I really do see that the best media buyers are also really good teachers. And this is going to do a few things for you. Number one, it's going to show the world that you really know your stuff. And number two, it's also going to establish trust. So in my case, I've done both YouTube videos, and I also used to have a blog about two years ago. And my blog actually got me the job that I currently have with my agency. And since I've been doing YouTube for just the last three months, it's also opened up tons of doors for me that I would have never have had if I didn't start my YouTube channel. Additionally, just the act of, you know, creating content, and especially for me, just filming these YouTube videos has instilled a lot of confidence in me and has allowed me to effectively communicate a lot more clearly, not only with my clients, but also with the people that I'm managing. The second thing I think makes a great media buyer is someone that has a really robust understanding of other marketing channels. This can be email, creative or content, or even something like conversion rate optimization on websites. Now I actually started off my career doing content creation for a very large agency. And after I left the agency world for a few years, I actually specialized in email marketing. And these skills are actually something that I rely on every single day as a media buyer, even though I'm not directly in those platforms. And the reason why that is, is because being able to speak to the entire lifecycle funnel and also after optimization for those items makes you much more valuable as not only a media buyer, but just as a marketer. Number three, the best media buyers have a community. They have sought out other people who are smarter than themselves that they can learn from. And they also start conversations with these people. You know, you can definitely do that on the Slack channels I mentioned, like ladies get paid or online geniuses. But I've actually found my own really solid community on both TikTok and Twitter. And through these platforms, I've actually been able to connect and directly speak with some of my mentors in the industry, like some people that I really admire, which has been really awesome to do. Another thing that I think makes a great media buyer is being able to balance analytics and creative. I see a lot of people talking about how important analytics are to running Facebook ads. And that's totally true. You have to be able to run robust testing campaigns in both the ad set and ad level, even some cases on the campaign level. And you have to be able to read and analyze that data. But I also think that the creative aspect is just as important and being able to find someone that can toe the balance between being incredibly analytical while also being able to contribute to the creative process is quite rare. And my biggest recommendation here is that if you find that you are more analytical, or you find that you're more creative, spend time trying to exercise the muscles that you feel like you aren't as strong in. I remember a few years ago when I was concentrating mostly on email marketing, I had a really hard time creating graphics and doing graphic design. So I actually did a challenge where I did 100 graphics in 100 days. And now I actually do some graphics that end up on ads or even websites, which is kind of cool. All that I'm saying is that if you feel like there's an area that you're not very good in that you're not very strong in, knowing that is the first step to getting better at it so that you can invest in those skills and try to get a little bit better. And the other thing that I thought of too about what makes a good media buyer is that they have their own processes when it comes to onboarding clients, when it comes to launching those initial campaigns, when it comes to creative strategy. This is actually something that I ask a lot of media buyers when I'm interviewing them now. It is something that I've been asked by several employers as well. And I think that having a really solid answer for that is something that sets you apart and could also lead you to a much higher paying job if that's what you want. Now what's really cool about this question is I actually asked some of my friends on Twitter today what they think makes a really great media buyer. So I want to show some of my favorites right now because I think they have some really solid answers. Okay, and that's it for this video. Like I said, this is definitely a different type of content that I created today. And if you guys are interested to see a little bit more about what it's like to be a media buyer, other tactics so that you can get your first media buying job if you want me to go in depth on anything else, please let me know. I think that this is actually kind of fun and out of the norm. So I really did enjoy making it. But ultimately, I do want to create content that's going to be most useful for you guys. And that's all. So I will see you next week. Bye.
