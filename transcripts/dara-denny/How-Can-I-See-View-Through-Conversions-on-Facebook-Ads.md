Hey guys, welcome to my channel. Today I'm going to show you how to see your view through conversions on your Facebook ads. So when you look at your Facebook ads manager, you're going to see one number under purchases or results. This number is actually the result of two numbers being put together. One that is for conversions that are attributed to clicks and the other are conversions that are attributed to view throws. If someone was a click based attribution, that means that they actually clicked on your ad and made that purchase or conversion. On the flip side, view through means that they only saw your ad and then made that conversion without actually clicking directly on your ad. And both of these definitely have their place in Facebook ads marketing. Now I'm not going to tell you that view throws are better than clicks or vice versa. There's a lot of debate on that and really it boils down to what's best for you and your business. And for the purposes of today's video, I actually just want to show you how you can view that data. So what you're going to do is first you're going to go to your Facebook ads manager account and then you're going to click columns and then customize columns. And then down on the right hand side, you're going to look at your attribution window. Likely you'll be using Facebook's default attribution window, which is based on a 28 day click in one day view. So this means that Facebook is going to attribute a conversion to your ad within 28 days of someone clicking on your ad or within one day of them viewing the ad. To see that breakdown, you're going to click on comparing windows and then click one day view and then 28 day click. And again, this is because this is the default attribution window you have. If you're using a different attribution window, you can go ahead and make that selection. Are you going to be able to see which of your conversions are attributed to clicks or view through? I would be in the habit of looking often at this data so you can know exactly how your customers are interacting with your ads. Do they click right away? Or are they likely to see your ad, then Google your brand and then eventually make a purchase without actually engaging with one of your ads? This is important to know because it says a lot about your customer journey and how much your ads are actually stimulating a direct response. Okay, and that's it. Super simple. Leave me a comment below and let me know if you guys actually look at your view through conversions. I find that actually not many marketers do this. So if you start looking at that and informing yourself about your customer journey, you're already ahead of the game. So let me know and I'll see you guys soon. Bye.
