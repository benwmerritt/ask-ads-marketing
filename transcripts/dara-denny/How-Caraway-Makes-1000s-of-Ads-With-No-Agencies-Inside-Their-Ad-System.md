This is me in Caroway's Secret Test Kitchen in New York City, and this is me talking to their VP of marketing about how they're scaling with meta-ads in 2025. This has been a top performer for us. We cannot eat it. You're not using any outside agencies. I mean, last year we set records. It's like, I think we had over 300 ads live in our account. Welcome back to AdSpend. Let's get cooking. Caroway is a non-toxic home goods company that launched in 2019 after founder Jordan Nathan got Teflon poisoning while cooking in his New York City apartment. He went out to market and found that there was really no great solution at the time, so hence, Caroway was thorn. Since then, Caroway has become one of the top home good brands in the world, with over 2 million customers and more than 100k 5-star reviews. And these are the growth strategies that make it happen. But first, the problem. Two years ago, Caroway was really struggling to get creator content that actually performed. They got content that looked good and got good engagement when posted to influencers' channels. But it didn't actually translate to revenue when they ran that as an ad via paid media. So they built a system, Caroway's Paid UGC program, where they could partner with creators directly to drive performance and not just awareness. We're looking for people that get it and are willing to take a brief and turn it into something that we can leverage on paid media. And last year, partnership ads with creators through this platform made up 40% of their budget on meta overall, making it the most scalable and top-performing creative in the ad account. So this is what this process looked like. Let's first talk about their team. The growth team at Caroway is split into four pods. Paid acquisition, retention, offline, and partnership. And Paid Acquisition is where all things paid social, paid search, and growth creative live, including the Paid UGC program. And on their acquisition pod, they have a director of growth, a senior growth marketing manager, a growth marketing manager, and a performance creative manager. And I think a really interesting thing about your team specifically is that you're not using any outside agencies, to my understanding, for your creative. Everything is in house. No one knows your brand better than you know your brand. And no one cares more than your internal team members. It's not to say that we don't have agency partners in other areas of business, like we certainly do. But with Paid ads specifically, we've just decided to partner very closely with meta on strategy and getting feedback and keeping a platform, you know, what other brands are seeing. Now, another really interesting nugget about this program is that it is completely separate from their ambassador influencer team, which sources for organic content, which makes a lot of sense because these teams actually tend to have really different goals. However, this is not something that I've seen at time practice. So instead, the acquisition pod has their own separate budget so that they can get the exact type of content that they need. Voiceovers, shot lists, hooks, CTAs, all tailored to a specific theme or product push. Another unique part of this is when we find someone who really gets it, we'll offer them a retainer. Hey, we'll actually work with you on an ongoing basis. We have creators that are kind of always on for us. Caraway's performance creative manager runs all the ad briefing for the program, analyzing performance data through tools like motion to identify what's working, and then building on that with new angles or a caraway take on something that they find on four play meta ads library and scrolling through their favorite creators. And again, these briefs or content sprints tend to be theme or product based. So I'd say we're also looking for like the mommies, you know, for fathers say some dad content, we're really trying to hit on different target, but we're also like here's some key points to hit. Here's a couple hook ideas. We have some for all the raw assets. We get right to that content for a certain period of time, and then we can extend those usage rights. After briefing, the creator makes the creative and then delivers the raw content as well as a rough edit directly to Caraway, which really helps speed up their own editing process. So they only have to add text overlays or captions ads are then launched in a ABO creative testing sandbox campaign similar to the way that many other D to C advertisers do it. Ads then typically run for two weeks to gather performance data. And if those creatives are exceeding goals, then they are going to be duplicated into scaling campaigns with additional winners. And if they lose, they turn it off and document why they think the creative lost. So let's go to look at some of these ads. I want to talk a little bit about some of your top performing creative. When I saw that as I was excited, I was like, oh, okay, we got Founder's ad here. That's telling a story. This one has consistently been a top performer. We cannot eat it. Now, this ad opens up with a deeply personal story. I call this the personal history hook, which is a really great way to draw people into your story without being overly salesy. And the second part of the ad actually jumps into the research that Jordan himself did, which also is going to provide really important education and context about Teflon for viewers. And another thing that's kind of crazy is that Caroway isn't mentioned until second 37, except in the hook, of course. And a few times they actually mentioned this phrase forever chemicals, which also really packs a punch. It was one of the stickier things that I found inside the ad. So this is a unique one. That's that, you know, cutting board. Let's just show you how much plastic you're eating. I saw the scraping of it. Oh my God. And this one is a unique one as well, because he is actually a macro influencer. So this is actually one that's a niche partnership where we actually worked with him in a paid capacity. It was a pretty significant investment for our paid influencer team. And this is what we call an authority angle, which is so, so important with the rise of AI, especially AI avatars and ads. And I think that's why right now we're seeing a bigger need for this type of content. It's actually something that I'm seeking out for a lot of my clients right now, especially those in the health and wellness space, because you often need that stamp of approval from someone that you already trust. He's a known personality, and he's showing something really compelling. And we've seen our, I mean, our site search for cutting board set has gone like through the roof. We sold out a couple of times. Like this has been a top performer for us. What about a non video on? Oh, maybe a sticky ad. I mean, a lot of our statics, which is, again, speaking just to create a diversification, like most of the statics here that you see are, I'll use this one as an example. This one is directly hitting on, hey, we know that we are an investment, right? So like, we're just addressing that off the bat. I think it's great when brands lean into the reason why people might not buy the Reapn2 buy. And then this one also does a great job of showing like, here's what a fully non toxic kitchen can look like. Here's our beautiful storage solutions. Here's how everything pairs really well together. Like, I think that cross merchandising does really well for us too. Oh, I see you have the good one right here. Yeah. So that's kind of an interesting one. Because I remember seeing that on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, but let me do a lot of that format. Yeah. And we also have it forever green. Yeah. So we always have bundles on our site, which will always be like the best deal that you can get on our website. We are not a promotional brand with the exception of the holiday season. And even then, like I'd say our promotion is maybe less compelling than some of our competitors. And we use that to our advantage. Like, to me, that's a benefit. We are a premium brand. We don't want to be associated with being discounty or sales heavy. But the bundles are a great way to say like, you can get a ton of value if you get everything all at once. So we always offer that, you know, price, cost savings option to customers that want to go all in on Careaway and really take the toxins out of their full kitchen. When I met Careaway a few months ago, they were already a few weeks into planning for Black Friday, Cyber Monday. 40 to 50% of their overall revenue happens in November and December. So this is a really crucial maker break time for them. Now, they do tend to see a lowland performance during the summer months, like many other DTC brands, they call the summer slowness. They actually tend to ramp up their spending in August to September, so they can be full speed ahead spending those big budgets by the time October comes around. Right now, we are in the let's take a look at what we did last year and the years prior, what worked, what didn't work, what do we want to iterate on, what can we repurpose? I think also too, we try to live by like the 70% iterative 30% new kind of ratio. Now, Careaway uses the term iterations pretty loosely. They aren't just doing copy iterations like this, for instance, but they're also briefing in creators on concepts and scripts that have already worked, creating new angles from already tested footage, and swapping out formats on messaging that they already know has great performance. How many credits are you trying to get out the door? Like when does that process hurt for you? It started a couple weeks ago, and I would say, I mean, last year we set records, like I think we had over 300 ads live in our account. And candidly with the rise of AI this year, I personally would not be surprised if Careaway 2-3x'd this amount of creative during Q4. Last year, we found that really beneficial as far as like the creative rotation and again, like creative diversification and making sure that you are focused on seasonal moments, there's seasonal moments within the season. Now, this means that they're actually creating a whole range of creative for each unique holiday moment. That means specific ads for Thanksgiving for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the hosting season, and even Q5s. However, despite all of the specific creative for these unique moments, they are still keeping all of their Evergreen creative on. This is something that is really important, and I suggest for all brands to do during Q4. But even though, you know, we have a ton of holiday specific content, there will still be just Evergreen always on the Jordan ad, for example. It's a top or far lower, not going to turn it off just because it's the holiday season. So do you let your like Evergreen campaigns, like do you just keep them on like during Black Friday and you just like you add more into your sandbox testing campaign that's like Black Friday, Cyber Monday specific? Correct. And they graduate too. We have a holiday specific ASC campaigns, you know, we'll keep spending in our Evergreen top performers as well. So we are wrapping up here and something that I love asking in all these interviews that I do is these three questions. So what do you think makes a great meta ad in 2025? I know we talked about a lot of your great meta ads that I just wonder in general. Yeah, yeah, it makes you stop. I mean, I think still what makes people stop is something that doesn't look like an ad because you're going to watch it and not feel like you're being sold something. So to no one's surprise, I think having like a really solid hook to get someone to stop and watch and have some curiosity like that is key. But on the flip side, like some of our ads are inherently very ad looking. I mean, it's been very pretty, you know, like I wouldn't think of Caroline think like ugly ads, although the ugly ones really do work. What is something that you wish you learned earlier or you wish people who are starting to become media buyers in 2025 content is king? Now it's like create a diversification to appeal to the largest him that is relevant to your product and just not being scared to push the boundaries on creative as well. If you could then give one piece of advice to a brand that's starting off on like in the next few months, what's one thing that you would want that to know? Find it could be customers, it could be like really small micro influencers or content creators to represent your brand who would be excited and authentic in talking about your brand and bringing your product to life and showing those different use cases. Then there might not always be one, but like you should start to pull on those threads over time like our elevated UGC. Like I think that was a swing that we took because prior to that the normal like iPhone lower res UGC was really working for us. So that's a test and now we're iterating on it because it has worked for us. And that's it for the third episode of ad spend. I'll see you guys next week. Love you. Bye.
