Hey guys, welcome to my channel. Today I'm going to show you four ways to scale your Facebook ads campaigns while still maintaining profitability, plus the pros and cons of each method and how to decide which one is right for you. Now these are the exact four methods that I use every day to scale businesses at the agency. By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to scale your business using Facebook ads. Be sure to watch to the end of the video. I'm going to be giving you a checklist that's vital for scaling your campaigns on Facebook ads. You won't want to miss it. Now the first scaling method that I want to talk about is called the 23. Now not 23, but 20-3. For this method, you're simply going to increase your budget 20% every three days. This scaling method is perfect for businesses who are a little bit more risk adverse and want to take this scaling process a little bit more slow and calculated. After all, this is the most risk-free way to scale your Facebook ads. Here's why. According to Facebook and their reps, they say that by increasing the budget only 20% every three days, you actually will not be resetting the learning phase. This is super important because when your Facebook ads campaigns are in the learning phase, that means that they're not fully optimized. Facebook isn't quite sure where to find people that are going to make the conversion that you optimize for. Another reason why this is the most risk-free way is because if your Facebook campaigns stop becoming profitable, you can simply reduce them back to the budget to the last time you had good results. Now the cons of this method, I'm going to be honest, it's pretty slow going. And yes, this method is pretty time-intensive. You're going to have to be sure to set reminders for yourself every three days so that you can be sure to make those budget increases. Also, another issue with this scaling technique is that it's super prone to user error, mostly because you might be too quick to turn your campaigns off or reduce budget if you're not seeing the kind of results that you want. If you see that your results are down for a day or two, that doesn't actually mean that your campaign is bad or that you need to turn it off. There are many reasons why we see a dip in campaign performance and sometimes it's due to holidays, sometimes it's due to current events, and other times natural ebb and flows in the precious process do just happen. So if you're going to be using the 23 tactic, you have to keep in mind that if you keep on tinkering with your campaigns, turning them on and off, reducing the budget when you're not getting the kind of results that you want, you could actually be hurting your campaign performance. Ultimately, I would recommend the scaling campaign for new businesses who want to have a lot of control over their scale. And maybe they don't want to scale as quickly, because this is definitely a much slower way of increasing your spend and ultimately your profits. The next method that I want to talk about is audience expansion. And what's cool about this method is you're not actually increasing budgets on any one campaign or ad set, but instead you're increasing the number of audiences or ad sets that you're using. This is another good way to increase your budgets at a slower, more calculated pace, but it does take some testing to get it right. And there are two ways that I really like to do this. Say you have a lookalike audience that you'd like to increase the spend on, instead of just increasing the spend on it, and you'd like to try an audience expansion scaling tactic, what I would do is I would duplicate that lookalike audience. And if it's at 1%, I would simply create another ad set where the percentages were one to 2%. So you would have one audience that is for the 1% of your lookalike audience, and then another for the one to 2% of your lookalike audience. Now, if you found an interest audience that's doing really well, and you'd like to try audience expansion on that, what I would do is I would simply take that interest, put it into audience insights, and see what other interests come out of it that you would like to test. You can also do this for interest customer avatars. So if you have multiple interests within a single ad set, then I would go ahead and look at all of those interests, inside audience insights, to see if you could find something similar to also test. The major pro of this scaling technique is that you're not actually increasing spend on any one campaign or ad set. So if you've had problems increasing spend in the past, and you've seen your results drop, then this is a really good method for you to test out. The cons of the scaling technique are that it does require a lot of testing and a testing budget, which means that you'll probably be spending at least some amount of money on audiences that don't work out at all. The third scaling method I like to use is called the duplicate and exit method. For this method, you're going to take your best performing ad set or campaign, duplicate it, and then multiply the budget. Now I've tested many different ways to multiply the budget. You can two exit, you can three exit, four exit, five exit. I have actually found the best results from both two xing it and five xing it. Obviously, whichever one you choose is going to be dependent on how quickly you want to scale and also how risk reverse you are. And yes, I almost exclusively use campaign budget optimization or CBO for these scaling campaigns. The pros of this method, it is super effective for those who want to scale and scale quickly. And while I have found some of the best results from using this exact method, there are quite a few drawbacks as well. Number one, it's pretty risky in terms of upfront investment that you're giving to Facebook, because frankly, your campaigns might not work. Another drawback, which is more from personal experience is that I found that a lot of these campaigns can take up to five days to have the same returns that I had at a smaller budget. But once it does get there, I actually tend to find that this method has better results than the other two methods. The fourth method is to simply increase your budgets. Now, I know this might not seem very strategic, but the reality is, is that if you want to scale on Facebook, increase the budgets in the places where you see the best performance. Ultimately, that's what all of the other methods are doing. And frankly, you don't have to have a super calculated approach to see success. But I can guarantee that if you follow this checklist before you start scaling, you're going to see a lot better success. Number one, be sure that your audiences are big enough for a budget increase. You want to make sure they're at least four million in size, but you can also go up to as big as 20 million to have a good, healthy audience so that Facebook can find the right people with your new budget. Number two, be sure to keep an eye on the frequency for your top of funnel audiences. So these are people that have never heard of you. It's supposed to be the first touch point. If you see that frequency creeping above it too, then that's a sign that you need to increase your audience size. Number three, increasing your budgets is the perfect time to start testing more creative. And as you increase budgets, your creative is going to become more and more important in converting more people and maintaining a good ROAS. Number four, CBO does tend to work better in scaling campaigns. So I'd suggest using CBO for all of your campaigns that you're trying to scale, even if there's only one ad set in it.
