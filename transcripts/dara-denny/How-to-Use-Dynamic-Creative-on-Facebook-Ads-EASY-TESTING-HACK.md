Hey guys, welcome to my channel. Today we're going to talk about dynamic creative on Facebook ads. This is a feature that takes a selection of images, video, copy, headlines, and CTAs and allows the algorithm to combine them into the best performing ad combinations. Now this is a super powerful tool for two reasons. Number one, it allows you to rapidly test your creative to find the best performing combinations. So this is really great when you're unsure about what your audience is going to respond to. And number two, it not only creates the best combinations of your ads, but it also creates the best combinations uniquely for each user that sees your ad. Because you see Facebook is so smart that it knows that different people are going to respond to different things. Maybe person A always stops the scroll for cute dogs, but person B always engages with cat videos. Facebook knows this. So if I use dynamic creative and included one cat video and one image of a dog, person A would get that dog image and person B would get that cat video. So what does Facebook say about dynamic creative? According to Facebook, you're going to be able to find high performing combinations of creative components for your campaigns and to drive performance. You're also going to be able to launch ads with multiple combinations of creative assets quickly, and you're going to be able to deliver the best creative for each campaign audience and ad policemen. So where can you turn on dynamic creative? You can turn on dynamic creative in the ad set section of your campaign build out. And the thing is, is you can only turn it on for ad sets that haven't been published yet. So if you have an ad set that you'd like to try dynamic creative with that's already been published, what you'd have to do is duplicate it, make sure to flip on dynamic creative and then publish it. So once you've flipped on dynamic creative in the ad set section, when you're in the ad portion of your campaign build out, here's where you're actually going to be able to select the kind of content that you want the algorithm to choose from. So you're going to be able to choose 10 images and or videos. So you can use both if you have that kind of content. Next, you're also going to be able to choose five primary pieces of copy or captions. You're also going to be able to choose five headlines and five descriptions. And you can also choose between as many CTAs as you want. And again, Facebook is going to use all this content to create the best combinations of ads for every single user. So this all sounds great, right? You have a super powerful tool that you can rapidly test new creative and also each new creative is combined uniquely for each user. So what are the cons? One of the big cons here is it's really hard to build up social proof on these ads, since each new ad combination is being created uniquely for each person. And number two, I've also noticed a number of glitches when using dynamic creative on Facebook ads. Number two, I've also noticed a really common bug, particularly with newer accounts, where if I want to use a combination of both images and ads, sometimes if I select an image first, then I can only select other images. Or if I do video first, then I can only select other videos. And to be honest, I've never been able to work that bug out. And number three, this is actually more just speculation from what I've heard from other media buyers. But I have heard that dynamic creative can drive up your costs a little bit. That's not something that I've really experienced, but I've heard enough from other media buyers that I did want to mention it. Some people say that their CPMs are always higher with dynamic creative. But to be honest, I haven't found that. I did just want to mention it because I've heard it so much, I thought that I wanted to just give you guys full disclosure to know what I've also heard from other professionals. So when do I use dynamic creative? There are two major instances. One is with new accounts when I'm really not sure what kind of creative the audience is going to react to. And number two, I also like using dynamic creative and my top of funnel prospecting campaigns, particularly when I'm starting to scale up a brand pretty big. And I think the reason why I see such good results from this is because the creative is being combined uniquely for each user, which allows me to get much better results at scale. Okay, guys, and that's it. Leave me a comment below. I really want to know if you guys have tested out using dynamic creative in what your results were. I've noticed that dynamic creative is kind of polarizing among media buyers. And I know some people that swear by it and I know others that refuse to use it. So I'm really interested to know what you guys think. Okay, thanks. Bye, guys.
