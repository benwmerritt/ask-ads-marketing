What are ugly ads? Yeah, just take the pretty vibes that you're used to making as a marketer and just make it less pretty. But that's it. Do not look at your competitors. Just don't. Don't do that. Like please, for the love of God, ignore your competitors because all your competitors are doing are looking at other competitors and those competitors looking at them. It becomes an echo chamber within certain industries. You have iterated yourself to oblivion that you're not even creating like new things. I get caught up in this. It is the customer a little bit, but if you over focus on just your existing custom, then you are failing to find ways to grow to other customers and other potential audiences. It's all about authenticity. It's so easy to shoot content. Everyone is constantly shooting content and everyone is constantly consuming that kind of content that seeing stuff that is more polished is actually less common and seeing stuff that is like marketing, advertising style, branded, blah, blah, blah. That's not what anyone wants to see. Your brain is like, no, skip. Would you say that when creating ugly ads, you want to dive a little bit more into the customer? Yeah. Yeah. It's it's. What's up marketers? I'm here for an incredibly special episode with the creator or founder of ugly ads. Very hot. Now, I have worked for a very hot for years. He was actually my former boss at thesis and he hired me. So I'm super excited to dive in today to talk about ugly ads and what's next for him after, you know, what you're really like after this podcast after we record this, right? Going to go home. Yeah. Just really what you know what you're up to and what you're going to do next. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good question. Yeah. That's the big question. Right. So do you want to give a little intro for yourself or people who maybe haven't heard of you yet? Sure. You want the little intro or the big intro? Let's do the big. OK. So hi. I'm Barry Hott. I've been a long time Facebook advertiser doing Facebook ads since 2008. So that's way too long. I started doing it for like summer camp hiring and then worked at like for like a local sushi restaurant and hair salon and eventually worked my way up to working at a startup where we were running the ads for massive brands like AT&T, Toyota, Kraft, Microsoft. Don't you don't act like, you know, you know this. You could recite this yourself. I think you did recite this to me the other night. Yeah. So I spent hundreds of millions of dollars for those big brands. And then I left that space to be more focused on direct to consumer aggressive growth stuff. So I've been more focused on like brands like Lumen Skin, which we worked on together. Yes, we did. Keeps, Urban Stems, Nuts.com. And then more recently stuff like Harry's Razors and then a bunch of like really small stuff and like kind of some weird stuff that makes good money like CarCover.com. Like is love working on CarCover.com. Yeah, we're going to dive into that. Yeah. So to give you a sense of how long Barry has actually been working on Facebook ads, he's been working with on the platform since the only placement option was the right column. Yeah. And there was no optimization for anything, by the way. It was just clicks. It was just CPC. So you couldn't even see if people were buying or there was no tracking. No, there was no tracking. There was no, there was just, you could just get clicks and then that's all you could bid for. So you just would make like click bait stuff to get the lowest possible cost per click. So now I consult, I do consulting, advising for agencies, brands, marketers, anyone who wants to like improve what they do. That's kind of what I do now. And then I work on a few brands myself and I own a piece of a creative agency, AdCrate, that you're familiar with. And now I just also started working on a brand called Rotten, eatrotten.com, where I'm like, I'm doing their head of growth. So I am doing their paid social and creative and all that stuff. So I'll be running the ads and coming. You brought some in here today, actually. Yeah. Shout out to Rotten. Go get, go order some eatrotten.com. They're really delicious. They're like, we're like, I think they're more like fruit snacks than traditional gummy worms, but they are rad. And we're going to take over like the whole candy world, like very quickly. I also helped launch Lone of a Ranch Water in 2020, which is a hard seltzer, kind of a Texas, Tennessee Southern vibe. And that got acquired in 2021. I did that as on the side while I was working with you, I think. Yeah, that was when we were at thesis when you were working on Ranch Water. So yeah, that was on the side. And then that got acquired. And, you know, I've kind of just been wanting to find another product I can like sink my teeth into and have a bunch of ownership of. And now I have that again with Rotten and I'm super fired up to get to work on that. And I think I'm going to start making content, hopefully. And hopefully you can hold me. I mean, you've been wanting to create content for a while now. So hold me accountable on that and like get me to like make content about. I'm just going to run out this podcast studio once a month and force you to come in and make all your content for the month. But like, I just really need to just record in my office, just like me, like send out ads running, you know, making optimizations, talking about the creative edit that I did, you know. Yeah, I think honestly, people would really be interested in following your journey of growing Rotten, especially since you're at the pre-launch phase and you guys are going to be launching next week and really what that journey is about for someone working on the ground level with a brand and its founders. Yeah, it is really unique, especially with my experience kind of having been through this before, like knowing, I kind of just know what I need to do. And I'm just doing it. So it's funny to me, like thinking like, oh, someone would want to watch this. I'm like, no, this is so easy. This is so basic. But like, in reality, there's a lot of people that have no idea what to do. And I'm just like, oh, no, I'll set up a lead campaign just to do a pre-launch lead thing instead of a link click campaign because we're not optimizing for purchase yet. And then like, although the people would be really fascinated. They would. I think anyone who just heard me say link click campaign that knows me well would be like, what? Well, you said lead gen campaign. And I'm like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like a link click campaign is more foreign if you really think about it. But like just to like get stuff flowing because we're not selling really on the site yet, just get that going and see how a couple ads do against each other in terms of, you know, getting people to go to the site. Or even just comment on the ads and see like what the initial reaction is. And just, just to get the shake the cobwebs off of the, I mean, they're not really cobwebs. It's like really get the, the wrapping off of the ad account. Yeah. Just like really tear that thing open and get some spend flowing through it. Trying to suss out any issues that happen. Like I shouldn't even say this now. I'll just keep that for my content. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. So like that's, that's the stuff that I'm working on right now and I'm super fired up about it. Just getting to be, by the way, getting to be creative again about one product that I have ownership of and I don't have to like go to a client and be like, Hey, what if we do this? And then like, Oh no, we don't have time. No, because you can just do it. Yeah. You don't have to like bid for like what you want to do or try to convince someone the value. I have to a little bit like I still like work with the CEO and like the creative director, but they're both like, yeah, that's a great idea. Yeah. Oh, you want to do this crazy thing where we buy a used, a crappy used creepy van just to give away to our, to our, to a fan. Look out for that. By the way, geez. We might use that or we might use that to like distribute candy, like free candy from a white van. Oh my gosh. We even, if we don't do that, like just that we have the creativity flowing on that, because maybe I'll just make a static image ad of just a pack of the gummies in front of a creepy white van. Like in that alone is. Put a post it note on the van. Yeah. More on that in a bit. So on that, I want to dive in a little bit more into this idea of ugly ads, which is something that you're really pioneering right now in the industry. So if someone doesn't know what ugly ads are, how can you break that down? What, what are ugly ads? Yeah. I actually got asked this at, I'm going to get asked this all the time. Someone asked me at the bar at an event last night, they were like, what the heck is that mean? And I, I describe it as like just take the pretty vibes that you're, you're used to making as a marketer and just make it less pretty. Like that's it. We're all good by brand marketing. So that's, that's, I met someone last night, they introduced themselves and they were like, I am a brand marketer. Oh, you're not going to like me. It was so good. Um, but it was just like, we're all trained as marketers, you know, either if you, like I went to school for marketing. Um, but even if I didn't like every job I've had, you know, as reporting to someone who had a background in marketing and those people, uh, went through either school or, you know, other people that were older than them going through that had been marketing forever. And it's always like, Oh, make this really polished thing, make this really, you know, clever messaging, this really, whatever stuff. And it's just like so far from what consumers on social media want to see, it makes sense in like print publications. It makes sense in, in TV where there is that polished TV is polished. Like it should, you're the ads you put alongside that should be polished. It would have been weird to have like a VHS quality, like 20 years ago, have a VHS quality video TV commercial in between, you know, a fancy TV show. Like that wouldn't, maybe it would be good and be jarring. And maybe that did work for someone. Is that why the Blair Witch project was like semi successful? Yeah. Yes. There is, there's totally like, I should use that as an example more. Like that's a great point. Like it's all about authenticity. Back then it would have been weird to do that. But now because it's so easy to shoot content, it's so everyone is constantly shooting content and everyone is constantly consuming that kind of content that seeing stuff that is more polished is actually less common and seeing stuff that is like marketing advertising, he styled branded, blah, blah, blah. That's not what anyone wants to see. And we have subconscious ad blockers that kind of just prevent us from even engaging with or wanting to, or even taking the time to see that stuff on Facebook. Your brain is like, no, skip. Yeah. It immediately knows not to even bother paying attention from it. As soon as the first few pixels scroll into the frame and Instagram or Facebook. Yeah. Which is why I think like user generated content or more like iPhone produced content is so popular. Because like now people are using TikTok more akin to the way they're using Netflix and it's for entertainment and they are entertained by creators who have their own production capabilities, essentially, which is just an iPhone these days. So yeah, we're not shooting on iPhone. No, we are not. This is a whole different thing for a Facebook ad, right? Yeah. This is for YouTube or for wherever. Like this is for a place where people are going to sit down. They're already choosing to watch this content. Right. We don't need to get their attention. Yeah. We've already gotten your attention. You're watching this right now. Like we've we've succeeded there. So but with Facebook ads, you don't have people's attention. You are used to be fighting with, you know, just like your friends, right? Or as an advertiser, we used to be fighting with making content that like your friends were putting up or like the celebrities that you follow. Yeah. Right. But now Instagram, Facebook has all been ticked, it's all been talkified in that the content that you're seeing is not stuff. You're even following. Like it's not stuff you've opted. It's all for you. Paged. Yeah. It's all, you know, you might see your friend's stuff and some like whatever that you follow, but like then you're just getting spoon fed the most viral content on the planet, not even the most viral content on the planet. The most relevant content to you and your interests on the planet, right to you. And now we're having to, as advertisers, compete with that. Yeah. So it is harder than ever to make good, relevant content. And there's a lot of people say it might say like UGC is dead. We've heard that. I made a video about that a number of months ago. Yeah. I remember that. It was a great one. And you know, my, my old take on that is like, it is in that you can't just film UGC and expect it to work. Yeah. There was a while where like the idea of make all the ads was just like, you literally just go make anything and it'll work better than your pretty thing. But now it's like you still have to make it look authentic and you have to build story and you have to build content that is worth consuming and that content that's worth consuming has to be relevant and then it has to sell. Literally, that's it right there. If, if someone's watching this and they just take what I just said and extract that and can execute that, then you're going to be rich, but it's not. Yeah. But that, that is a, that's a really hard ask. All of it. And I think that for brands who, you know, have, have heard you talk and are interested in, you know, especially interested in scaling on Facebook ads or TikTok ads and they realize, Hey, our, the way that we used to create ad content isn't working anymore. How would you advise a brand who has never worked or has never created ugly ads? How would you advise them to get started? Yeah. A few things. Um, one, just go shoot ads, go, just go shoot ads right now yourself. Um, that's the easiest thing. It's like, So do you think they should just take their phone, walk out the door and shoot an ad? Yeah. It like one shot, one take. I don't care if it's one shot, one take, go shoot 20 takes, go shoot, you know, just turn the camera on and let it roll for 20 minutes. I don't care. Do it selfie, walking around, just go and shoot it and you'll get the creative juices flowing. You'll start to have new ideas about it. You'll start to see the challenges that you face, even if you're not comfortable on camera, even if you're not comfortable, uh, speaking in, even if English is in your native language, just go shoot something. If you can have yourself on camera, cool. If you can't shoot the product while you talk about it, shoot something else while you talk about it, but just shoot B roll, do some voice over after. You just get it going. Yeah. Right. Like just get that flowing and then watch it back, even if that's really uncomfortable for you and try and think through like, is any of this useful or relevant to my audience? Yeah. The way that I like to think about it too, sometimes when I'm working with brands and they're getting started on this ugly ad style or this more authentic style is like, think about how you would potentially add, not as a creator, but just as a person, um, number one, if you're FaceTiming with a friend and you're showing them a product, like what does that look like? What are you talking to them about? About what you like, or if you are doing some content for Instagram stories, like sometimes like even just like POV, taking a shot of the product or talking about a service and thinking about how you would talk through that on camera or while on FaceTime with someone. Yeah. That's such an important key to all of this is talk, right? Speak like you're talking to a friend. Don't talk like you're trying to like sell something you're trying to talk to. Like the Instagram audience, like just really try and talk to casually like a friend. That's the, you know, it's hard to do for a lot of people, but it's still worth trying that. Maybe even have a friend there with you. Yeah. Someone else, you know, like that you can talk to and just go. And I say that I, the big reason why I say to do this is it is so rare. Maybe this is self-selecting. Maybe this is self-selecting the people that come to me that to talk to me about this already just have this ability, but it's, it's so rare that I talk to a founder or a CEO or someone like that who isn't passionate about what they're doing. Yeah. In a way that they can speak about it passionately. Yeah. It's, I don't, I can't recall a time where I've really met someone like that. Like they can almost always have some set of, it might not be exactly what needs to be in an ad and it might not be perfectly polished or like not polished, but like the exact messaging that needs to be used, but there'll be bits and pieces and chunks and sometimes a little bit of that like founders. Why can be helpful? I don't love that that much from a performance perspective. Right. I know you recommend that. I may, I think founders ads are amazing. We can talk about that more. I think they are, but I really get fired up when it's a founder talking about it, not as the founder, but just as the person who has the problem. Yeah. And I think that actually founders are often most uniquely suited to talk that because they were so passionate about it. Not like if the she drop shippers. Not always. No, that's a drop shippers. I love you drop shippers. But I do think that if they were someone who experienced that problem before or someone that they loved experience that problem, they are so uniquely suited to communicate that problem and those pain points and like really twist that knife, which is why I often encourage founders. Okay. Like UGC style, you don't need to hire out the huge studio. I've done those huge studio shoots for founders. Have I seen success with them? Yes, but I've all, but I've also seen success with them. You know, just like one shot, one take. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, I think that's, you know, the, some of the best ones I've seen are just like either like, oh, they put the camera like leaning up on their, uh, in their kitchen, like on a, on a wall and they just shoot or they're doing it in their bathroom or they do it in their car and or they just do it on a walk. I love a walk. I actually think the hack for a lot of this is like doing it on the street or doing it in the car. Great. I think having someone do it on the walk is great. Actually, my favorite possible thing you can do is like try and figure out the relevant setting to be in for it. Yeah. On the subway. Yeah. You know, like where, what, where your product would maybe be used or where your problem would happen if you could be like in that place or have it somehow relate to that, um, that can add an extra layer of, of relevance because you're always created, uh, you're always targeting with your creative. So in that first moment, whatever people see or hear, whatever their first feeling is that's going to get them to pay attention or not. It's not just about, are they going to pay attention or not? It's like wearing this, you know, three dimensional spectrum of relevance. Yeah. Uh, why are they going to pay attention? Right. So you want to be not just getting people to pay attention, but the right people and for the right reasons. Yeah. So if you can target with that, with your words or your like setting, that helps. What are a few brands that you think do ugly ads the right way? Um, well, I've, I've, but I had all the ones that you work. Damn it. You know, I hate always plugging this and I, I, someone from Dr. Squatch needs to reach out to me and like say, say thank you because I plug them all the time. Uh, not that they need to thank me, but like, I want to just talk to them. Um, and I think that's one of the big performance creative agencies that does a lot of their stuff. Oh yeah. I'm not sure. We know. Yeah. I think we know. Um, but it's, they, I mean, they're just doing such wacky stuff and trying stuff and it's not that they're doing wacky stuff. It's that they're clearly doing stuff that is ugly, but it's, it's being done in a way that is more relevant or more based on organic styles and things that they're seeing out in the wild. It's super, it's super like ticked, talkified in a way, but I also think that it really, a lot of their messaging messaging too hinges on like a core human desire. Like a lot of, a lot of times they're not even talking about soap at first. Oh no. And, and you know, oh great point because like they, so many of their ads, they're, I mean, I think some of their great ads that seem to be stuff they're iterating on and they're playing with and working on just based on looking at their ad library. Maybe they're doing that to sub subterfuge and, and you know, make, trick me into thinking they work, but, um, some of my favorite ads of theirs take 15, 16, 17 seconds, whatever it is to get to show the brand or the product. Yeah. They just live in that problem for a while. And I love to say that, like live in the, live in the problem. Yeah. Cause I think it's a big common misconception when I'm talking with brands, they say something like, Oh, you have to show your product on like second one, or even zero, or you have to introduce it within the first like three to five seconds. And for every time that, that could be true or circumstantially true, there's always a ton of different examples where you're just actually twisting that knife a lot more. And you're also calling out your target demo a lot more and letting them know, hey, you're in the right place. Whatever I'm about to sell you were one in the same. Oh, I'm just so fired up that we're doing this right now. This is totally like, it's, yeah, it's really neat to just like have the have your creative, just be, be thinking about like, not what do you want to get out of it from your brand perspective, but like, what does, what do you want a consumer to get out of it? Right. Like that's really. Yeah. Focusing on. And when I, again, when I'm going back, like I say, like live in the problem, like live in multiple problems. Yeah. If you can give me five problems in 15 seconds, geez, like now I'm like, oh my God, what is this? I need, I need this. Yeah, yeah. This is, um, because I have maybe one or two or three of those problems, maybe not all five, maybe I do have all five. Maybe I didn't realize I had those problems. And now I'm like, shoot, I do have those problems. I love making ads that make someone realize, like give them up, give just like, I literally just created this problem, just handed to the viewer and now they have this problem they like have to solve. I love getting at like really niche problems. Like those are the ones that I'm like, oh yeah, like this person did their research. Do you do like research when you're beginning to work with brands and when you're beginning to like create ugly ads and like, what does your research process look like? I study reviews. I think you say this in your content too. Like I love to study reviews for our products and competitors. And anything else in the space. Cause it just helps me understand you. You'll often, you'll find so many like reviews that are completely useless, but you know, one in five, one in 10, you'll find it was like, I was this. I was having this blank problem. Yep. And I'm like, yep, that's it. Yeah. Like that is what I've been looking for. That is what I need because that is relatable and not niche. I'm looking for a big problem that is hyper relatable to the biggest amount of people that I can. And so that's what I'm looking for in those problems. And I also, when I'm looking in reviews, I'm looking for like really easy to understand really relatable statements, very simple, like third grade, fifth grade level language. Yeah. I had this problem. Yeah. Um, and you don't even have to like close that loop by the way. And if you're using that for copy, like just even using that in an ad, I had this problem, people start to close that loop themselves of that, whatever they're watching is the solution. Um, so research wise reviews, big time. I mean, now chat GBT, like, Oh, this is one that a lot of people have been wanting me to talk about in the channel. Yeah. And I haven't done it yet. It's great, dude. Like you can just like manually throw whatever in there. Um, but you can now get smarter with it. Like there's link, a link analyzer. She can like put a, you know, URL in there and have it analyze the page and get. Like analyze, like if you had like a link where all of your reviews lived, or if you just had a PDP, I mean, yeah, review the PDP. And like summarize that and you'll get a bunch of stuff back. And then you can say like, all right, make me whatever for it from this. Yeah. I also like for rotten, I did that for like our, you know, product information, whatever. And then I also, uh, transcribed the, our like long form launch video that we haven't launched yet and like fed that into chat GBT too. So it now has the landing page info and the like script for this ad, which. You know, gives, it gives like a bit of the vibe of the brand, but also gives like the story more, cause it's like a 90 second or whatever it is spot. So there's a lot in there that explains like what the product is. And now it has, it's like you're creating an ecosystem at first before you start. Cause I find like what a lot of advertisers do and where they have problems with chat GBT is they jump in and they're like, Oh, create this ad copy for this brand and you're not creating the ecosystem. Yeah. Great point. Oh my God. Great point. Yeah. Like you could do that. There are sometimes we'll just go like, okay, I'm, I'm an advertiser. Sometimes you do want that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm an advertiser. Uh, I'm making, I'm making ads for this brand and I'll just see what it does and I'll, and sometimes it'll be okay. And I'll, or I'll correct it from there. Cause it's so easy to just give it like corrections. Yeah. Right. Like that's great. But, um, I was literally coaching a client the other day about this and it was like, okay, and I watched them. We were, he was sharing a screen and he showed me like he started to do exactly what you just said. And I was like, well, wait, wait, wait, just like, just let's get, let's extract some things first. Right. Say, okay, here's the product. What are the pain points for this product? That's where I always like to start. Yeah. Aside from the reviews, uh, like chat, GBT, what are the 10 pain points, uh, of a consumer of this product? Yeah. And I want to, and I want to know how it's going to like sort those by like priority or like popularity. Um, cause like that's, I mean, like, think about that. Like 10 years ago or five years ago or two years ago, right? Whatever it was to get that information reliably, you'd have to do market research. You'd have to be completely manual. Or you'd have to pay like a marketing research firm for that data or like something like that. Probably right. Yeah. And now I'm like, all right, whatever, if chat, GBT, like suggests this, that's good enough, like it's good enough for me to like prioritize these pain points in this order. And I'm like, okay, that's fine. Um, I might, you know, I'm still going to put my, you know, I'm going to double check it. Yeah. Yeah. Think through, does this make sense? Can I, you know, use this? But like that, that is so valuable to me because again, I was helping him, this guy with this brand the other day and like they were trying to do, they were going after this one problem. And I was like, this isn't seem like the biggest problem of your audience or, or the most easy to visualize or storytell behind. So I was like, well, let's go see what chat, GBT says. And then let's find a different problem and focus on that pain point. Right. And we did, and we found like a much better pain point. Um, so it was like, um, they were focusing on like, uh, it was a, like a beard product and it was like, um, like kissing your significant other, like, and it's being prickly for them. And I was like, okay, like that's a small one. Well, also like you're getting a kiss. So how bad is it really? They don't like the kids. It's bad. But like that was like the pain point they're going after. It's like, that's how believable or relatable is a little. And then we found this other one. I was like patchiness, like beard patchiness, which is like something that this product solved. And that's something that like way more guys, we're like, way more guys relatively have that problem and want to solve that problem. And this product solves that problem or fixes that helps that problem. So I was like, let's dig into that. Cause we can show that we can talk about that. There are a lot of emotions about that. There's a lot of, um, anxiety. There's a lot of just, uh, negative feelings around that. So many guys I know, like I talked to them. I'm like, Oh, why don't you grow a beard like this? And they're like, I can't. I'm like, you can, but then they want to. Um, so I think like just finding that insecurity that I can tug on, you know, I sound terrible doing that. Like I really hate that, but like that is a really easy way to get in and make someone feel something really quick. Yeah. And I actually had this conversation with two founders yesterday because I told them, I was like, you know, you need to highlight your problems more. You need to twist that nice more and further. And they got immediately anxious when I said twist the knife because they feel like it's, it's icky to sell or it's, you know, it's exploiting people's pain points, but if you were creating a product, it depends on what it is, by the way, some things from like, we really shouldn't. Yeah. There are, there is absolutely a line, but I also think that if you see this problem popping up again and again and again in your reviews, and it's something that people, your customers are echoing to you and you're using their words, you're actually doing someone a disservice by not highlighting this more and not diving into it more just because of some arbitrary like point of view of, oh, I, you know, I want, I want to sell, but I don't want to sell that hard. Like, I think the thing that you said there that's really helpful for selling that is if it's from a real person. You have to use their words. Yeah. If you can do that and find that. Another thing you can do with chat, GBT is like extract a huge list of reviews and then ask for it to find. I asked it to find golden nuggets and it is scarily accurate. So when I'm doing my process, I do like customer review mining. I still do it quite manually. I'm using chat GBT a lot more, but what I'll do is I'll put all of the reviews into chat GBT, ask it to find the pain points, they'll list it out. I'll ask it to find all the transformations and it'll list it out. I'll also ask it to find failed attempts because that's like another way to sort of twist that knife more and then the golden nuggets one, even just using that phrase. It finds the good ones. That's funny. I never thought to do that. I like that. I'm going to steal that for sure and not give you credit. It's in the course. But yeah, no, that makes, I mean, that makes so much sense. Like there's so much in there that you can just do. I, when I would, the thing I do, I think you were saying this, but like, I ask it to find past tense, I statements. Ah, okay. I was, I had. Yeah. And that's what I want. Um, because I want to be able to just find that and extract that both for me, like emotionally to understand the problem and empathize more. Um, but also to literally just copy and paste as. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, there's a first time I think I mentioned the word empathy and like that's all of make ugly ads is based on his empathy for deep, deep empathy for the viewer, the consumer, um, rather than focusing on the brand. So would you say like digging that a little more? Would you say that when creating ugly ads, you want to dive a little bit more into the customer? Like, yeah. It's, it's. That's it. That's it. Actually, uh, like, should you create a post at no ad that like explains the problem, essentially, like you actually just, you just triggered me for a second because it's not the customer that's a really dangerous. I get, I get caught up in this like, and we can move on from it, but like, it is the customer a little bit. Yeah. But if you over focus on just your existing customers. Then you are failing to find ways to grow. To other customers and other potential audiences. So there's like a chicken and egg there where I see this sometimes where people like do post purchase survey, whatever. And they'll be like, Oh, you know, our, um, all of our customers like love golf or something like that. And I mean, this is like AT&T, right? Like AT&T, their small business division has a high propensity for golf. I mean, you could argue it's because, you know, they're business owners and they a lot of them play golf or you could argue it's that they've been promoting golf tournaments for 40 years or something like that. Like it's hard to know which is which, but you have the data that says it's this. So it perpetuates doing this more. I try and look at the data and think like, what's missing? Um, I try and think of like, what do my customers want? Okay, great. But now like, how do I get more customers who don't look like my existing customers? And that's, that's a much bigger challenge. Like how to be more scalable, essentially. Yeah. And it's a really, it's a scary challenge from a data perspective, because it's stuff you literally are trying to do without data. It's stuff that when you try it, your costs are going to be worse because the system is getting to the technical media buying. The system is used to your existing customers type. Right. If your product is typically great for like women 35 and up starting to run ads that work for men 18 to 34, like there's going to be some friction there. The system's going to not be able to, to allocate budget to those users. Um, and it's going to take a while for it to like start to click. And yeah, I think we even just see this in general and brands start using UGC after doing nothing but static graphic ads for years and years and years. Anything, any new creative style. Yeah. Um, and sometimes they do suck, but sometimes it just needs to like, it needs to just reshape and reform and figure itself out. Yeah. It needs to learn, essentially. Yes. Definitely. So that started to sidetrack that question about like looking at what my empathizing with my customer. I'm trying to empathize with people that could be my customers. Yeah. Um, cause like with ranch water, and I would say the same thing for rotten. It's like, okay, there's, there's obviously people that just like know what ranch water is and like it, but a lot of people don't know that that's a beverage. Well, they don't know that now it's a canned beverage and like it's a hard seltzer. So there's a lot of people who just like wouldn't even drink that. So like, if you think about just like all of the, the, the circles of like, okay, ranch water lovers, hard seltzer lovers, you know, uh, just people that drink in general and people that don't drink, like it keeps getting further and further away. So you have to make messaging to apply to those different groups. Like, are we going to make messaging that applies to people that don't drink? No, like that's bad. Right. But if I can make messaging that can work for someone who is a craft beer drinker, right, which you wouldn't think, Oh, someone who drinks craft beer, like I'm a big craft beer nerd. Um, you wouldn't think you could sell a hard seltzer to a craft beer drinker or to, or to a light, you know, a course light drinker, whatever it is. But if you think that you can't do that, then you'll never do it. Right. You'll never have to make it. So instead I like that challenge. And I'm like, if I can make an ad that can change those people's minds, that ad will also fundamentally work and make sense for those people. For the white cloud drinkers. Yeah. Exactly. And then also for the ranch water drinkers as well. It's going to make sense for all of them. So that's what we're trying to do also with Ruth Rotten is like, okay, obviously there's people that are right away. Yeah. Gummy worm lovers. Like that's easy. We can check that off. Like no problem. Right. There's also people that are even smaller than that. Like gummy worm lovers who love this branding aesthetic, like not nostalgic. Like they're fired up. People are just fired up for it. Great. That's easy. That's a slam dunk. I don't care about that. I want to go after people that like, want, like aren't, you know, buying trolley every day or aren't, you know, going to buy a candy. I want them to try this because if I can give people more reason to try that and buy that, then anything I can make for that should also work very well for those people who are closer. Yeah. So that's, that's how I look at these things. But it's, I don't know why I have that perspective, but it, it certainly is because I've. Well, you've worked on brands that have scaled and you've seen how you have to adapt the messaging for scaling. It's not just about finding new, in some ways it's about finding new, new pockets or new markets or, oh, we realized that teachers were buying. So now we want to expand to daycare people or whatever, parents, et cetera. But if you can actually start getting that more scalable messaging from the beginning, it's going to be your costs are going to be lower and you're going to be able to scale up a lot quicker and easier. Well, the cost of being lower is the hard part. Yeah. Because it is like you're being less relevant to your immediate product. So it's actually costs might get worse in some ways, but you're, yeah, you should be making it more scalable. It's really hard to like. It's nuanced. Yeah. Yeah. So I've been asked this several times and I think it's really interesting for you working on rotten right now, but a common question that I get when working with CPG brands or even like food and beverage is, okay, what problems do my consumers have when thinking about a product like rotten or like you're talking about tapping into empathy as well. Like how would you guide like a creative strategist to think about pain points, problems and transformation when thinking about gummy worms? Yeah. I mean, like with ranch water, there isn't a problem really, right? Like with rotten, there isn't really like a problem. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like the problem is like you're not we're making the problem. Like you're not cool. If you don't, if you don't have these gummies like available and give them to your friends, like you're just not cool. You're not punk enough. You're not like, you know, you're not, you don't know what's cool if you don't have this, like, so, um, you know, with, with ranch water, we started to like, we read a lot of comments. Yeah. Um, whether once you have a brand going and you get a lot of comments, read them, especially the negative ones, hide them, but read them. Um, because we found a lot of men were commenting on these ads, like, like really, like homophobic shit. Like it was bad. Yeah. Like, yeah. Really insecure men who were like, who were upset about Celts are like, heart cells are wild. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People were triggered by it. Yeah. Um, for, for whatever reason. So I was like, what's like, what are we doing here? Um, so I went after those people. I said, I, well, I set that as my goal, both from a personal Vendetta, but also because I, because I was like, those people should be buying and drinking this beverage. Yeah. Houdly. Um, but like, they were like, Oh, you know, I'm a course, you know, course light till I die or whatever it is. So, Lord. So what I started doing was making content that was about like manliness and about, yeah, like real men don't care what other people think about what they drink or something like that. Real men don't make nasty comments on the internet. Just, you know, for what it's worth. I know. Like it was, yeah. It was, so like I was trying to like, you know, reverse card those people a little bit and just like kind of almost set a trap for them and insecurity trap where they're like, wait a second, hold on, hold on. I think that I would, I would be girly if I drink a heart seltzer, but wait a second, this ad is telling me that if I don't drink this product, then I'm insecure about my manliness. Now, what do I do? So I don't know if that actually worked. Like there's no way to know. But that's the kind of thing I'm trying to just like create that story, create that thing and reduce the friction, reduce the conflict, the no. Any reason why someone's trying to say no, I don't want to buy that. That's what I'm going after. Yeah. Because consumers and users on social media, it's always a no at first. No one gets online and at least most people don't. Yeah. With the, with the idea that they're, oh, hey, we're going to buy something. Actually, hilariously, the thing that like is so easy is when it is just, there's a bunch of people that are just like, oh, yes, I've been wanting this my whole life. Like literally ranch water was like for a lot of people just like, oh my God, I've won. Right. Yeah. Thank God this exists. Rotten is going to be the same thing. There are absolutely people who are like, oh my God, where's this been my whole life? I want this. You disrupted the gummy, the gummy war. But that's the easy, that's the easy stuff. And like that's effectively just retargeting and super low costs and not when you see those costs and that efficiency, it's not real. Yeah. You're not, you're, you're, you're capturing existing demand, existing intent and that's easy. That's not really like, that's not worth, if you really want to grow a business and scale it and whatever, like you need to capture and create more intent, you have to capture people who are, have no idea what you're selling or why and make them want it more. So I think a lot of people just actually, actually use retargeting messaging and what is essentially prospecting. Well, oh my God. Are they're just going, are they're like going for the awareness level where they're either already aware of their problem or their solution and they're just trying to convince them of what's best. That's essentially what an us versus them ad is, right? It's someone who's already kind of sold on the solution, but they're in between potentially one versus the other. That's a great point. Yeah. It comes down to like, are you, are people problem aware? Are they solution aware? Are they brand aware, product aware? Right. Um, but some of those, it really can vary. Um, and, oh man, there's so much to that. Like those, those can work really well for capturing something new. Like we could be doing like, yeah, we could do trolley versus rotten, right? And we probably will do those. You could do trolley versus rotten, but you could also do trolley versus like other, like just like the other unknown snack. I think the rotten versus the other one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We can, we can do that. We can do like rotten or you can also because of the branding will probably do like rotten versus like, you know, eating boogers or something. Yeah. Like we're just going to do wacky stuff. Um, but like, you know, it's, it is about, it's targeting with your creative. So if people, if you're only making a thing that's like trolley versus this, then you're only the only people that are going to be interested in people that are familiar with trolley already, which is for us probably good and relevant. Especially for a new brand. I see a lot of brands when they get their first creative success on a new ad account, it's often in us versus them. Yeah. And it's an easy, again, it's an easy way in because you're already tapping the people that are already have the intent already have the understanding. Yeah. Um, but that can be a trap because you, you're making something that like, you're again, going back to what we were saying a second ago, like it's only something that some people who have this awareness of this problem will, we'll go after. So you're not really growing the category. Yeah. And because one of the most common things that I get asked, and I know you get asked this too is, Oh, I was able to scale to 1000, 2000, 6000 a day. And there's always a point where they feel like if they move beyond that, they can't tap out from that anymore. Yeah. And potentially it could be the reason why it could be what you're saying, because they are only had used messaging that was communicating to people that knew their problems slash solution. And they haven't really looked at their messaging and gone beyond thinking about how they can convert people that need a little bit more convincing. You're totally right. And like, this is what we're about to face with rotten surely is like, we'll launch at whatever spend level and it's immediately, I'm assuming probably going to be pretty efficient, like right off the bat, because we're just going to be scooping off the demand that is already there. The time that's already there. And then what would happen normally is like, we'll see that cost per acquisition to be like, all right, we're going to make some money here. But in reality, the more you push that, like anytime you increase spend, you're increasing your costs are going to go up always. But like, especially when you have that, that like shell you have to break out of to get out of the highest intent users, it's going that your costs are going to go up. So don't look at it as that your costs are actually like going to go up. Just look at it as your costs are artificially low. When you're that's a great way to look at it, because you're not actually, you're not scaling and you're not convincing. Yeah, you're not convincing. Yeah, you're just right. Just getting it in front of them, which is sometimes just enough for a lot of these things, you're just capitalizing on the existing demand, which by the way, like we could probably make plenty of money for rotten just doing that. There's probably enough just existing demand. Gummy worms are my favorite growing up. Yeah, they absolutely were not mine. I'm more of a fruit snack guy, which is why hilariously, like these to me taste like the fruit snacks that I loved. So I'm super into it. But yeah, like I'm eager to see how it works out and what we're going to have to do. We have so much to do in terms of like ad creative offer and like, you know, first purchase, whatever. I'm so eager to see what our repeat purchase rate is because the product is good. Yeah. But like also, I don't know how much people are consuming candy. Especially adults. Like I feel like too, at the point of where I'm at in my life, I'm like, I have enough problems and I'm trying to avoid sugar. So like something like 60 percent less sugar. But something like this, I'm like, maybe for a special event, maybe for a birthday, maybe as like a funny gift. Like those kind of things would make sense. These do make a great gift. Yeah. What's funny is in the launch video, by the way, one of the lines in it is 60 percent less sugar. So your guts don't turn into goo. And I like just love, I just love that. And like I saw someone internally use that in a DM to someone, someone who was like, no, I'm scared of free candy. And they were like, but the person who responded from our hand was like, but it won't turn your guts to goo. Oh gosh, that's so funny. I'm really excited to see how like that brand voice develops, like answering people in the comments and stuff. We've worked with some brands who are great at that, like the Perfect Gene. So I'm really excited to. Right. Yeah. He's right now. So what I'd like to do now is I'd actually like you to show some of the ugly ads or social, social formats that you think some people here could replicate or take inspiration from. Sure. Like if you were going to give someone like, OK, these are five ugly ads that you should test, what would be like your five like format examples? Well, I mean, it wouldn't be on this, but you know, obviously like I want to just do post it notes. Yes. You are the OG post it note maker. Yeah. Although some, although some people think it was me because I talked, I did my first video about it. Yeah. 2021. You didn't give me credit for it in that video to this day. Like I want the record to show that I inspired that. Wait, and I will say too, I got inspiration from the Cove ad that they made like in 2020. Did you make that? I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. I don't think so. But we were working with Cove. You were working with Cove. They also had they were the brand that own keeps as well. Right. Yeah. So I don't know. I mean, it's it's not like that big of a secret. So it's not like that big of a deal. But I mean, we were I was definitely barking at you to do it more and then I went and made a video about it. Yeah. At thesis. Respect. Good, good on you. So let the record show now that it was for me. But like, again, it's not like I developed that. Yeah. Maybe you and I both popularize it and Ash from Abbey helped popularize it. So I'm like, that's something we're going to do for Rodden is just like it's just a cheap, I mean, it's completely free. Excuse me. It's not free. You have to buy a sharpie. Preferably a sharpie. It doesn't have to be sharpie. Use some other brand. Use a jelly pen if you want. I don't know. I don't care. But probably a sharpie and just write relevant things. That like your audience would be interested to see and like I like I'm going to do one that says like, you know, parents hate this or parents love this. But why not do both? Like you do those are two different ads and see which one does better. So I'm going to do like won't turn your guts into goo. Yeah. Like who cares? And I'm going to be trying to be a little thoughtful about the setting for it. Like try and put it in a. Right. Not going to over the top go for it. But like I might put it like on a yellow or green surface. I don't know. Try to figure out like what would be your an organic, believable thing. Actually, I want to do it in front of a white van. Like I said before, do it in front of a white van. Also do it at like a picnic setting or someone like, you know, you know, it's the kind of gummy worms you'd take out on a date. I see like, I think we're trying to at first. I think they we all want to do more aggressive stylized. Yeah. Yeah. So I think we're going to go harder first. Let me find actually here's a post. I have a post at the board. Oh, the gold. I have a handwriting one. So I've even veered from, you know, just calling it post to note ads and just gone to wait, did you make that stop using tire shine one? I didn't. But because I have that as I have that as an ad for you to review. That's my client. Oh, I think. Okay. That's fine. I bet some of them are going to be your clients. That's really funny. So those are my those are my boys at Exoforma. I have a huge shout out to them. Actually, we can just talk about them as a case study. I can do a whole hour talking about them. They brought me in to consult for a few months and like literally as soon as we started working with them, these guys are unbelievable. I wonder if they're okay with me talking about their story, but I'm only going to say nice things like these guys would meet with me and then literally go out to the parking lot and shoot like right away. A plus client. I mean, they literally took my notes and did that and like that ad slaps dude. Like I probably shouldn't tell you that, but like that ad slaps and like they basically just made a great hook from it and we'll talk about that hook because that hook is killer for a lot of reasons. We'll get into that later. But yeah, like just they tried a bunch of different post-it notes, tried them in different settings on the car and it's not a product that has anything to do with revving the engine, but they put it on the dashboard there and on the tack and which is a good like it's a good placement and it's also just like a little bit unusual. It's in the car. But it's in the car. It's a car product they're showing and you quickly get that connection and like it's a simple phrase stop using tire shine. So like if you are using tire shine, you're like, whoa, what am I doing wrong? But if you're not, you'd still be like, wait a second. Why not? Yeah. Like, whoa. So, but it's still, it only is relevant to you if you have a car. It only is relevant to you. If you have a car you probably care about. So like, and then, you know, a lot of this hinges on what comes after that. Anyway, but it was really good to see them do this. And just like that was one of the first ideas I think we came up with. That's really cool. Yeah. High hook rates on that. Cause that's like massive. Yeah. Really, really good. Excellent. And again, it's not necessarily like that they need massive hook rates. It's just, it's about the relevance like. And getting the right user to stop. The right people to stop. Like if I would see something like that in my regular, like my regular scrolling, I don't even have a driver's license. I'm not. Yeah. I have a car. What is this? I have a car, but I definitely don't care about my tires. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a little bit, but, so yeah, there's that one. This one is one of mine. That's that is my handwriting on the. Oh, Nets.com. Nets are in this box. A little bit of taboo advertising. Yeah. Well, actually, yeah, a little bit, a little bit. And I like what would actually after my time there, they, they. They iterated on it. They edited it. They just photoshopped it. And like it's, by the way, you can totally get the vibe is different and that it's and that it's like not handwritten in this one, but it still works. But it says your nuts have dropped. I think your nuts are in this box is still way better. I don't know why they even did that. But like, yeah, there's so many of these. So again, that's where I'd start if you're trying to get into ugly ads. Like this isn't the only way to make ugly ads. This is, by the way, really bad. These are really bad. This is like. Posting notes on a computer screen, on a photo, on a. Oh dear. Wow. That's really ugly. Yeah. I do. Oh, thank you. Yes, it is. I did this. And like that was just, it didn't work that well, but I would try it again. You know, I don't know if it's if it's because of the copy that's on it, which isn't that great. I also think if they zoomed out a little more and maybe showed the computer, that could I have a great point. I have a few examples that showed that because when I see this, I'm a little disoriented around like, oh, is this, did they want you to think it was actually on the car because that would be cool. Yeah. But it's like disorienting in the wrong way. Yeah, I agree with you. And there's just, you know, look, kind of like that primer example, right? Like that you can see it's on the computer. Yes, actually a great point. And I do love that. But like, you know, like this was a, you know, about me trying and yeah, like I'm super open to failure. And what's great is you can fail on these over and over and over again. There's no cost. Yeah. You know, except for the cost of running the ads, but like, you don't have to spend that much to know if this is in the ballpark or not. These noteworthy ads are wild though. That's a lot of text. And actually I have a few examples that show this checkmark bullet point style of ads and I want your take on that. Like to me, that almost seems like people trying to turn the post-it note style ad into something it's really not quite. Yeah. Because it's not, it's not hooking people or maybe it is potentially for the right audience. But when I see that, I'm like, okay, you're trying to make a bullet point style of ad using a post-it note. And it's a little bit for me, it's too much to ask for me to read all of that in that format. It's, it doesn't matter. Like, it doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't. No, no, no, no, no. It's, it's like, you can, you can do a five word, six word, post-it note, right? We're a line of copy in any other format where you can have a long story on there. And I don't, I don't have a problem with, with it. I think it just, it's maybe harder to do and harder to get right. But if you write something that is, that gives people the right vibes and the right story and the right, if you can make people emotionally connect, you know, you could do a whole, you could do a whole friggin 10 paragraphs of post-it notes. I will say something that I had done with several brands too, when using the post-it note strategy is actually just taking our best performing UGC ad and then taking that entire script, putting it on different post-it notes and then having someone do a voiceover for it. That's a format using this strategy that I've used again and again. Or some people say posters notes aren't a strategy. It's not a strategy. It's just, it's an aesthetic. It's a vibe. It's a storytelling device. Yes. Yeah. And the reason why I like, I want to do it with rotten is just a kickstart. It's just to like get ideas, literally handwrite them out there, see what messaging can work, low costs, low effort, literally just like, it's, it's, to me, it's even easier than like doing it and in like a photo editing software. Cause I can just handwrite it, slap it, take a picture of it and then move on, try something else and like run a bunch of those, see which messaging works well. And then take that messaging and then I can double click into that from a copy perspective, double click into that from a messaging perspective on other styles. Right. Um, and that's what we want to be able to do. So that's one, right? Post-it notes. Um, and then going back to the other, like the other stuff, um, I, I mean, I hate again, blowing up this style more, but whatever the, the, the, the publicty puberty brand, uh, publication, uh, style, which, uh, pu, bi, T, y. Oh, do I, I don't know if I have one in here. I thought I saw one just a little bit down. Oh, there are these, these, yeah. Where it's, um, it's like the answer to the press screenshot ad, which often gets, um, we get disapproved or you get a cease and assist from the publication. It's like a way of showing potentially more social proof or press social proof without it actually being. You, you can say that I don't, that's not why I think like this. Uh, and you're, you're not like, that is a thing. Right. That is one thing you could make a publication thing. And that, that is in here as well. These work to me really well because these are some of the biggest, most viral pages on the, on the planet on or on Instagram. And that's the exact style they use. Yeah. So like, why not? First of all, examine, why does that style work? Well, what have they done? Cause they, they're monetized. So they're trying to make stuff that is viral, that is, or easy, easy to, for people to want to consume. So why not recreate that yourself? And then also like, look at how they tell the story. Look at how they do it visually and with text and try to like lean into that. So, you know, it's just literally that white bar and the photo like fades from the full color photo down, fades to black on the bottom with the white text over it, super simple, very easy to understand. And a lot of them have this main photo with a like highlight photo in a circle above it, whether that's like a zoom in or it's a detail photo or it's like showing the problem in one and the solution in the other or vice versa. And there's just a lot of ways you can use this to test copy and to test. Talking about problems in that way, as if it's news. Yeah. Right. It's just an, in this news aesthetic and you're not like recreating like TV news because that's something people aren't really watching on social. Yeah. You're not watching your like nightly news clips on Instagram. Like you're just not, if, if you were a lot. And sometimes there are ways like there are weird news things like Florida man news things that you get shared on, on Instagram. So you, that is a style that can also work. In the news aesthetic does often I found work for like 55, 65 plus. So a different demographic, we would actually recreate news segments at thesis to use for certain brands because they worked so well for that demographic. Totally. By the way, like you can make, you can make your own fake news. Like you can literally hire real fake news. You can literally hire people on Fiverr or whatever to like go and make like in a news style, green screen background, like, like reporter ish set up and film something for you. Yeah. Or podcast. Yeah. Right. Right. Definitely do that. We did that two weeks ago. But like definitely don't go and make fake news and make it seem like it's actually like legit real do not be, do not do anything illegal. There is a line to cross. Please don't do that. But like you can make things that vibe, you know, legally and safely. And I would, I would definitely consider that. This is another one I like here. This, this is like the Twitter, the Twitter style, Twitter screenshot meme style. You'll see this a lot of like, fuck Jerry Instagram. Like again, go look for some of the biggest Instagram accounts that are relevant to your audience. And they're all like Twitter screenshots. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Huge. That actually going back way back to before you asked like what I do for research. The other thing I do for research, I forgot to shout out was like create a Instagram or TikTok account about that interest. I do the same thing now for YouTube actually. Really? Yeah. I haven't thought about doing that for YouTube. That makes sense, obviously. Yeah. Actually, so I'm doing Patty Yellowway's Accelerator as you know, and he has an entire method for like getting a new, getting like a new YouTube account and like going through and like figuring out like. He's stealing from me now, Patty. He is stealing. I mean, yeah, you know, great artists. No, no, no, I'm sure. I'm sure it like, we both probably got that from the same whatever. Yeah. It was probably Mr. Beast anyway. Like. Exactly. But yeah, no, that's, that's, that's really smart. And it's the same premise, right? It's just like to pursue that, that specific content as if you are in that. So like, I am not a nostalgia punk, like candy nerd, right? But like, I'm going to create an Instagram account to pursue that. And see what stuff comes up and is fed to me and like pay attention to that. Try and understand the vibe, understand the, the language that's being used, understand the aesthetics that are being used in like, by like skateboarders, by candy lovers, by whatever it is so I can better communicate to them. Yeah. And also just see what pops up on your own feed to see like what, like what storylines and formats seem to be like getting the most engagement from this type of people. Exactly. It's huge and like cutting down the amount of formats and messaging and storyline types that you feel like you need to test. Yeah. And that's where, that's where I like to, you know, I recommend people go focus more on organic content for inspiration for ads rather than go look at other ads from other brands. That's kind of a hot take. That's really, it's my hottest, my best hot take is like, definitely go look at organic stuff rather than do not look at your competitors. Just don't, don't, don't fucking do that. Like please for the love of God. Like ignore your competitors. Like maybe look at them when you're getting started, just for like some, whatever, just to get a baseline try. I don't care, but like do anything else because all your competitors are doing or looking at other competitors and those competitors looking at them. It becomes an echo chamber with inside certain industries and it's really funny to see brands copying other formats after the brands and other messaging tactics. And at a certain point when brands often come to you and me is, oh, maybe they're spending a certain amount they want to scale. I feel like that's like always the point where brands want to talk to me personally is, oh, we want to scale beyond this amount. And what I always end up telling them at some point is, oh, you are in a point of iteration paralysis. You have iterated yourself to oblivion that you're not even creating like new things. Yeah. And this is actually a question that we had someone ask us on, on Twitter, which was how do you draw the line between doing iterations on your ad creative, but also doing net new big swing tests? Yeah. Um, I remember that question. I was excited to, to talk to you about it. Um, you know, I parallel path both. Like it really depends on what I'm seeing and what I'm feeling, but like, um, lately I've been more in the iteration zone and that, that might be because of the stuff that I'm working on and it might be more dialed in on some of that stuff. But the big thing I tell a lot of people now, and maybe one of the most valuable things I can say in this whole talk is if you have something that hits, don't take it for granted. Like, yeah, if you have a unicorn ad or something that really slaps just whatever you can do to like, don't like, you don't have to just iterate it to death, but you can reshoot it. You can reshoot it. You can borrow that messaging or that messaging in the hook and adapt it to another format. You can, if it's a UGC ad, have another creator, do the exact same script. Take, take the same thing and just record a different voiceover. Or a method that you've done recently, which I've really liked is have another creator green screen that actual ad. Yeah, that is, that is advertiser stealing from advertisers. So I don't know if that one works, but yes, but like, you can even like literally go in the, in cap cut, there's now a voice changer. Have you done that? Ah, yes. Yes. So it's not just like it's, it's not just like it reads the text. It'll literally take your voice and change your voice to something else. You can just do that. And it's a total, it creates a totally different vibe. You can take that same video and run it through a different editing style. Take that same video and like, do edit in like stock video clips, make it more like exaggerated, make it more over the top, make it more subtle, play different music behind it, like take away the music, like anything like that, that can work. I mean, some of that is iterating to death and for nothing, right? You're not really going to squeeze more, much more out of it by doing some of those things. But to be fair, when I say like iteration, like to death, I also like really just think of people who end up just changing out three seconds of the hook, keeping the, like keeping the same thing, just swapping out the messaging, just doing like headline tests. And like those things are important to some extent, but I do think that those, like at a certain point, those, there's only so much, there's only so much stopping as effective as they could be. Yeah. There's no, there's a limit to how much you can like get out of that. Yeah. The question I want to, I want to ask, you know, anyone in that situation is like, okay, how do we make this more broadly relatable? How do we make this, or how do we make this relatable to a different audience? Yeah. Same messaging, same thing. Like let's assume this messaging works or this, this, this pacing works or this, Matt, like the overall angle, right? How do we make this relevant to other people? So do we get a different, just a different looking talent to say the same thing? Do we get someone to come in and do it faster? Do we get someone to come in and do it slower? Do we get someone to like, there's just tons of different ways that we can, we can make that work for more audiences and different audiences and bigger audiences. And that's what I try and think about. And some of that's scary and some of that's difficult because again, you're not always going to have the immediate add data to support that. Yeah. Your add data might not immediately be like, oh yeah, that's a winner. It might take a while for it to adjust and shift. So that's what I see so many people so scared of. And especially to answer one of the other questions that we got about cost caps, using cost caps is going to keep you in that really narrow area of just the people that already have the most intent and it's going to prevent you from scaling over time as efficiently as maybe you could otherwise. I understand anyone's going to like say, well, yeah, but it's also going to keep you from losing money. If you're really that like tight on money that you're like, I just don't think you're really bound to scale. And I think you're just holding yourself back. I've talked about this too with a number of people. I think that at a certain point, you have to choose between absolute efficiency and getting learnings. Oh my gosh. Yes. Yeah. Which is ultimately why we have a really similar, we have a really similar way of doing creative testing because we do want to prioritize getting learnings. Cause what I've seen a lot of brands do that go the dynamic creative testing, CBO, RAU is, and I hear this all the time, Dara, the new ad tests aren't getting enough spend and you end up not learning because you have one or two hero ads that dominate the spend. And you know, over the last few weeks of you making this new creative, you don't actually have a data read on any of the other tests that you have. So they'll tell you that's the point is like, Oh, the ads didn't do well, so they didn't get spend. So we saved you money. When those ads die, are you just out of luck? Or could you have gotten some learnings or even possibly tapped into a new market that maybe would have been a little less efficient in the beginning, but could have proved to be more efficient over time. Totally. Yeah. I, I, that's my whole problem with this. And I try not to like really engage, even engage with the, the like cost cap people anymore. I'll still engage with people that like test in CBO because like that's not that dumb, like it's, there are some brands that I like, I, when I, I work with them on that and they do that and that's fine. It's totally fine. Especially if you're setting minimums, you're for, you are forcing some budget. Um, which again, like someone who I'm usually the guy, it's like, yeah, trust the system, but like also like we have to be humans and learn and understand creative and figure stuff out. So we have to force and do some correction, some forcing so that we can get that learning of why, why is the system saying this sucks? Why is this not wanting to spend on this? Oh, because people aren't paying attention. Oh, because it's not getting people to click. Oh, because like whatever it is. And like maybe none of my analysis is right. Maybe that's fine. I might have a totally wrong analysis about it, but at least I can have some analysis on it. The, a lot of these people think it's just random. Like all the cost cap people, they're like, Oh, it's just what the creative that works is it's just random. And there is some randomness. If you are going to throw a thousand ads at the wall, like, yeah, if you were going to stick because you're bound to have just gotten some creators who know how to make good ads because they do have experience or some that are just lucky or some that are just really fucking attractive. Yeah. Cause there, there's sometimes it's just, it's an unknown variable. Right. And we can boil it all down, but at the end of the day, a human does have to make the subjective decision on what it is. Yeah. Which is what I find a lot of people struggle with, with creative strategy and analyzing their creatives because they want some complicated formula. That's like, Oh, it's the headline that worked. It's the messaging that work is, but at the end of the day, that's why I always prioritize everything I do with research because I'm in a lot better situation to look at the creative and be like, okay, based on what I know about that consumer, what is it that is attractive them? It could be the creator. It could be the creator. It could be the messaging. It could be the editing style, the storyline, the pacing. But if you don't know your customer in the first place, or if you don't know the ecosystem in which your customer is, has problems with their lifestyle is like, you're not going to be able to determine. By the way, you just said, you said so many things there that are really important. One of them was pacing and like, it's so hard to isolate any of these items. So hard. Test because like, especially with video, right? It's like, okay, you can talk about what's in the, what's the like text overlay in the first few seconds. That's a component. You can talk about what's the visual in the first few seconds. That's a component. You can talk about like, what is being set. And then if you go reshoot that and you say the same things, you say the same, have the same text overlay, but someone says it more rapidly. Maybe that'll do better. If someone says it more rapidly, but it's less relatable, or they say it in a way that is really boring, or if they say it staring directly into the camera, or they say it, you know, while like looking all over the place, like, yeah, there's all these infinite variables that we can't possibly control exactly for that can, can get in there and mess stuff up. And so many people are like, oh, yeah, that failed. Let's never do that again. And it'll be like, let's never say that line again, but maybe that line was great, but it was said poorly or said too quickly or said too slowly. And I see that a lot with like formats in general. I feel like the people are just getting started off. A lot of times they'll be like, oh, features point out ads don't work for me. Or us versus them don't work for me or UGC doesn't work for me. And I'll look at their UGC and I'll be like, you did one test that had four ads with a not a very talented because you thought it was going to be bad in the first place. Yeah, you were so it's a self fulfilling prophecy. Like you didn't want it. You didn't want to make UGC. So you didn't make good UGC. So it's going to fail. So what I'd like to do next is I gathered some ugly ads. I bet you were a creator of some of these or helped advise on some of these. So I want to show you some. And I want you to roast them. Wow. With my son going off to college, I'm already at this point in the questions. What does this light mean? Is this sound OK? My son knows nothing about cars. It's pretty good. Me either. I truly don't know how I expect to survive the law. But at least now is car maintenance. This is fixed. And we need to port scanner that connects to an app on his phone. Wow. Now, every time the check engine light goes on. And that product intro didn't come to like second 20. Right. Just like I would if you were home. The fixed app also tells him whether the car is safe to drive or not, which is super helpful before his long trips home. Well, the premium version of the app. So we know when it changes oil, tire, fantastic. Fix is going to provide comfort to be my wife while he's away. Check out fix. OK, fantastic. Can you just play the first like three seconds again or just real quick? Yeah. So just I don't like that showing grass. But it said check engine, so it's targeting well. But it shows. OK. Talking about setting, look at where he's shooting that selfie. Go back for a second. Look at just where he's shooting that selfie. Look where he is. Right in the garage. In the garage. Um, I mean, that's brilliant with two cars in the background. Yeah. So like, you know, we can talk about targeting with your creative. Like it's targeting with your creative. I didn't like, you know, saying it in like the grass. I would have rather that been somewhere else or displayed some of the way. I don't know what it was spraying. Yeah. But it still didn't matter because check engine is still relatable enough. I wish there was some other way to display that. But so all this is great. The one thing I don't like about this is it's like too specific of a story, like with my son going off to college. Going off to college. Yes. It's such a narrow. That's such a small slice of the entire advertised addressable market. So I think there might be a lot of people that might be like, oh, that's not me. Goodbye. Yeah. On the other hand, it is an easy to understand story. So yeah, people are going to keep paying attention through it. It doesn't really matter that the sun's going to college. It doesn't really matter about that. It's just about it's just about a dad caring about the they're someone in their life. Right. Like I would encourage them actually to like take a step back and like forget about the sun going to college and just talk about I worry about my son or my daughter. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly that. That's that's how you just make that a little broader. And literally that's just a question of like reshooting this, this second hook. Yeah. Right. Like and finding other ways to to get in there. Like because it could be it could be about me. It could be about like, I, you know, I have this car. You know, yeah, just could be for anyone. Like so there's a lot of ways to do it. But again, I think it is a rule that it is a believable, relatable thing, but you could make it more broadly relatable, more broadly relevant to more users, I think. Ugly ads approved. Oh, it's fantastic. Wow. Wow. He came out with a good one. That's lovely. And look at the caption style too, by the way. Super organic. Yeah. It's just the organic caption style. Yeah. So it's not branded. It doesn't really matter in this ad because nobody's ready for the brand yet. Like nobody cares about this brand. So why even bother? Yeah. They start to see the product in it. And that's what really matters. The the product is branded. They can click the ad. They'll see the brand there more. They'll learn about the brand more. But at this point, nobody cares about the branding. So why bother with it? So it's really good. Excellent. Yeah. I want to know who made that. Right. Shake their hand for sure. Add number two. Noonbrew. Also not mine, but friends. I'm a fan of Andrews. Friends of friends. Yeah. Now this is something I've seen a number of brands do. Now they'll try doing this post-it note style ad, right? But they're using three to convey this story. Yeah. I mean, I just I'm not. I mean, is that showing a different. Are those showing competitors products or no? Those are their products, right? Those are their products. Yeah. Then I don't know. It seems like almost like you're pairing the post-it notes with those products. So I don't think that's good. I actually I hate that. It's just confusing to me. I kind of almost wish it was like the competitors products blurred out. Sure. Like that has the jitters. That has the sleepless nights. Yeah. Free honey. Yeah. I don't. I don't like this at all. I like it from a static standpoint. I kind of wish it was uglier. I don't spend running for 77 days. Those can be wrong. But it could be. Yeah, it also could be retargeting. But also it has a great value prop, right? It's like free honey, which like actually was sort of my problem with this ad initially is pain point, pain point, free honey. Great call out and save $26. Yeah. Yeah. Like it just feels like to me, this is super retargeting. And like that's fine. I just, you know, nothing we've talked about today. Like is about retargeting. I don't care about like it's not that I don't care about retargeting. I get so little joy or value working on retargeting ads as a concept. And I don't really do a lot of manual retargeting or any really anymore. Anyway. Yeah. I just try and make great messaging that makes sense for prospecting. And then thusly also still works. Yeah, I agree. I don't create, I don't make ad creative tests specific to retargeting. There are sometimes that I will identify a test that's went out and I'll be like, you know what, in retrospect, it didn't hit on like the broad, cold, prospecting audience. Let's drip it into retargeting. Yeah. But that is actually super few and far between. Yeah. And also that's the dangerous thing. And I wanted to go going way back to earlier in our conversation, like that's the thing that a lot of a trap, a lot of marketers fall into is they're making ads that actually work really well and perform really well for their warm audiences. And when you're using these hybrid audiences now, pretty much everyone is like we talked to is like doing broad audiences with no exclusions or minimal exclusions and like depending on how or what you're excluding, the ads that you make that are most relevant to your warm users are going to look great. But that doesn't mean that they're scalable and it doesn't mean that they are fundamentally what works to bring people into your brand. They're just the things that are taking credit for the conversions. Yeah. And that can also be a weird attribution problem. You might just have a really clickable ad rather than an ad that actually people even care about. Oh, goodness. So there's a whole huge layer of stitch. This video I just this clip I just said into earlier when we were talking about this earlier, because that's a huge thing that people are getting wrong. And like they don't, I can say that and I can't prove that. But like people think I'm crazy when I'm telling them like, he is crazy. Thank you. I am crazy, but regardless of that, like people think that I'm wrong, which I'm not about this, that there are ads that people are running that look in like they're performing well because the costs are low or whatever it is. But in reality, they're just scooping up the easiest conversions, easiest purchasers from the people already most likely to buy. They're the least incremental ads and they're the most just that's scooping up nothing. So it doesn't, it's not helping you except it's helping you look better. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's look at this next one. So this is a lead generation client, I believe. So some of the people that are in the course and also on Instagram stories ask that I did more B2B or service-based businesses. So let's take a look at this one. B2B should be making ugly ads too, for sure. Yes. It's terrible hook. Sorry, go back. Awful, awful, absolutely terrible. Did you know that this is an awful hook? I mean. It goes quick, but I don't think it's the best way to look at creates curiosity. Sure. I guess, but like, what are we, I mean, this isn't targeting anyone. Unless like, we don't know the target demographic yet. We did. We, okay. So now it's like, okay, make money simple again and it's free. Okay. Yeah. I mean, go back like perfectly fine from start it here. Just start it from not from there. Start the ad right there. Start the ad right there. 20,000 right downloaded this, but that's interesting. Yeah. I don't know what that little, uh, cheeky icon is on the top there. I think that's really a waste of space and. And this is the property council, I believe. So, you know, put a house there or something. Maybe. Yeah, yeah, good point. Yeah, yeah. But like this book about what like. It's about like investing in property as a way to make like passive or. Yeah. But I mean, just give me that more. Give me in the first post it or in the second post it or whatever it is, like, give me more about that. Yeah. Did you know? I mean, like it's just, no one cares about this. No one cares about the. This. And so, yeah, you'll maybe get some curiosity and maybe you'll get like a better hook rate because people are going to stick around, but they're, they're going to fall off and not give a shit. Yeah. So. This one ran technically for 329 days, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But look, maybe it's the best ad ever. I don't, I don't know. And I can be wrong. We could be wrong. We could be wrong. But also it's all depends on scale. Like that might have run and been amazing for that period that might have just run in the background, like as a retargeting ad getting a nickel a day that might have. Who knows? You don't know how anyone else is running their accounts. That might just be the one ad they made and they just like walked away. Yeah. There's like a deodorant brand I like admire. And I was like, they haven't put a new ad live in six months. Like I don't even know what they're doing. I don't even know what they're alive. Like, yeah. Okay. Cool. But like you just don't know if what it is or why you're happy. You don't know. You don't, you never know. Okay. Next up. Array. Uh, a D to C darling. Is it? I don't know this brand. Yeah. Pretty big brand actually. I don't know. Okay. They don't even say it. Take me. Okay. Works in under an hour. Feels good after eating good. I hate this. This tells me nothing. I am angry. I, as soon as you put this on the screen, I was, I was, I didn't like it. Um, because it's, I don't know what the product is. I don't care. I have no reason to, to like, I don't care about the setting. I don't care. I actually liked that the setting is kind of crap. It's kind of ugly, but like. So ugly setting, but messaging is, is not aligned because. Take me. Oh God. Like take me. What? Like, why? Well, it's like, there's no reason. There's no, I don't have any reason. It should be like, ask a question. Take, like, do you have this? Or like, I don't know if you know if they could do that. Yeah. Or even if it's like works. And cause for me, I don't know what it works for. Yeah. So works in under an hour is irrelevant. Yeah. So for me here, it'd be like reduces bloating in under one hour. Okay. And that would have been, they're probably not even allowed to say that. They're probably not. Probably not. Um, I hate supplement ads anyway. Or I don't know if the supplement seems like it is. It is supplement. Hate it. Um, you can do that all you want. I just, I don't, I think there are a lot of baloney, but, um, do better. Like give me something more than that. Ask a question. Then say, take me. Take me. Oh, terrible. So here. I already love it. Already love this. I mean, it's just, I mean, it's clearly. Can you start over? What was it? I used to be very well, I didn't even get to read it. I read too slow. Uh, used to be very self-conscious in my bikini. That's a 10 out of 10. I mean, they took the course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You used to be very self-conscious of my bikini line at the beach. Wow. So relatable. Not to me, but I get it also. Oh, and then she repeats it. I don't like that. But. Okay. I am paranoid. My bones would be on show. Then I saw this viral skincare routine for the bikini line on TikTok. And because I was just like truly beauty. Yeah. It comes with a cleanser. This exfoliator and this oil. Yeah. It's for 20 days and it's supposed to be read of beauty in rooms, farms and in vacation. I mean, it's like the natural truly. This is a straight rip off of truly beauty, which like, no, no shame. Good on them for doing it. But like you're just showing revealing skin. You're showing like sexy, like attractive, like, like my only concern to be if you're running this in an ASC, it would, a lot of men would pay attention to it. Yeah. Yeah. That would be my concern. There's also almost, I don't know if it's too aspirational, this view, but it's, it's not, I think it's fine. I think all of this is, is really well done. You know what's funny when I first saw this ad? I thought it was actually this hook was all that it was at first. I would use to use that photo. Right. Yeah. I would use that as still. I'd use it. Or even just like the first like three seconds have that on loop, a little bit of movement. Like I, like I've seen things like that work. Yeah. Why not just let that, let people click and find out the rest? Because it's enough to get people to click with intent. Right. You don't want to get, get people just to click. You want to get people to click with intent and that as a still or is it just a looping video or whatever is, is enough. Because it's, I used to be, right? I, I past tense. I used to be very self conscious, best sense problem. Like they probably got that from a customer read. And people are, you'd hope so. And then, and then people reading that assume whatever this is for is going to solve that. Yeah. Brilliant. Love it. I think the rest of the ad I didn't even evaluate that much because, and then might, might need to be improved, but the rest seemed okay. I didn't like that the hook repeated, but. Yeah, that was, I would didn't like the hook that the hook repeated either. All right. Yeah. This isn't, this is a bitter one for me because I almost worked with them. The pod company, I didn't. So I love seeing this shadow to them. They've been doing, seemed like they're crushing. Hope they're making a ton of money. I love this. I really wonder how well these are doing. We saw it. We see that like Crocs, I think was the original purveyor of this style. We know, all we know about this is that marketers loved it. Marketers loved it. And in theory, it's been running for months. Is it still? Yeah. Yeah. I actually checked it right before this. Again, we don't know what that really means. We don't know what that really means, but we do know marketers love it. Yeah. Um, and that's my concern with a lot of these is like me liking it, you liking it is should be like a red alert. Like, uh-oh. Yeah. Probably isn't a good ad. This is probably just something that like we like. And also the Crocs ad, like when I initially saw that, I thought, Oh, okay, you're like trying to go after Gen Z. When I think of Gen Z, I'm like, are they really in a position or want to buy an ice bath? Like to me, this seems a little bit more towards like marketing towards millennials. I'm sure this could have like a nostalgia bent to it, but I'm like, I think all of it makes sense. I think it is thumb stopping. It is weird. It is unusual. It, it doesn't look like an ad also. I mean, now it does maybe because like other people are doing it, but fundamentally when this scrolls into frame, there's no almost no one's ad. Sudconscious ad blocker is going to be like, Oh, this is an ad. Turn this away. It's Microsoft. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what is this? So that's it. It is thumb stopping in that way. Um, but it's not clearly an ad. So it's one of those rare ones where it's not a native style that people are used to seeing, but it also doesn't immediately trigger as an ad. Yes. So that one might be working really well. Uh, this one free course menopause secrets. So this is another one that's for more of our info product people. Yeah. If they haven't already tried doing that, I would just switch the two menopause secrets free course. Um, it's interesting. I, I, uh, I hope this is okay for me to say, I think she looks too young for this to be potentially. No. And I mean, I think it's really important to call it when there seems to be a misalignment between the creator and the messaging. Yeah. Because that's definitely something that other people are going to notice. And especially if the creator is also misaligned with who you're actually delivering to on face, on Facebook and Instagram. And it's like one of the number one things I look at is breakdown data and looking at how the spend distribution is actually going to the different age ranges. Of course. So, you know, we could see something like this. Can you repeat that? Because like that's like, so like, I love that you do that. I know that you do that. And I do that. I study the breakdowns. Like I feel like that's what everyone else isn't doing. Like maybe not everyone, but like so few people when I like talk to them when they hire me to like show them and tell them, like, I say, oh, let's go to the breakdowns and like, okay, where is that? Yeah. Here. I'm like, you should be looking at this all the time. Yeah. I mean, at a base level, I'm always looking at the breakdown data. So organizing all the data into where the spend and purchases are pulling for ages, gender, depending on the product. Sometimes it doesn't matter. I don't look at the, I don't really care as much about the purchases or whatever. I just look at the other, the spend. The spend is the most important because ultimately that's where Facebook is like sending your cash. And if this is delivering to someone who is 30, 35 and not someone who, you know, would actually be interested in a free course about menopause, then you're in trouble and there's already a misalignment with your creative, with your messaging. And I want to just double click into that for a sec. What's happening there is like, it's Facebook's both looking at the relevance, the creative relevance. So like who's paying attention to that ad more than others. Even if it's an aesthetic image, Facebook understands that we don't have data on that, but it'll be looking at, I assume, you know, this, I can't prove this, but I assume it knows which ads people spend more time lingering on than others. And it uses that as a data point to know who it's more relevant to. And that doesn't necessarily mean those are the right people that click and buy. So that it still has to figure that out. So what you see sometimes is it'll start, you know, focusing on this age range and then it'll shift over time as it's figuring those things out. But it's trying to predict how to best get you the most conversions. And again, point against cost caps is like, if you use too low cost caps, it won't even try to expand into essentially scale. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. So we have 10 more minutes. I am going to actually get out some of the questions that we had. Okay. I love this question. Sorry. Should credible big unicorn brands make ugly ads? Yes. What? Everyone should. Everyone should. It doesn't mean you only have to make ugly ads, make pretty ads too. I'm not against that. I'm not saying don't make pretty ads, but yes, everyone should be making stuff that makes sense and is relatable and fits into the feed for your audience. Even the most luxurious of brands can and should do that. And I want to tap into that. Because that was actually the number one question that I got today was the question I get all the time. How does it make sense for luxury brands? How can luxury brands do this without damaging the brand? The game is authenticity. Okay. So what's the biggest problem? Uh, if you're a luxury brand, like go shoot the product on a phone, on a private jet, on a yacht. Okay. Yeah. If you turn to me and say, well, Barry, I don't have access to those. My question to you is, are you really fucking luxury? If you don't have access to those things? No, you're fucking not. Also luxury brands, it's like, it's exclusive. You don't want everyone to buy. So like sometimes like I, I see luxury brands like, Oh, we want to scale using Facebook. And I'm like, that's kind of like your, your luxury. Like there's sort of like a toss and turn. I, like there's some weird give and take, I think with luxury brands who want to use Facebook as their main scaling method without putting in, you know, that, that cloud effort, essentially. I think that the cloud effort is important, but like really comes down to how you shoot it and making the aesthetic, right? Cause look, if you're a luxury brand, all you're thinking of is like, okay, we get the best models, we get the best lighting, we get the best cameras, right? Cause we are this brand. So obviously everything has to be the best. But like in reality, just find ways to, to skip some of those and invest instead in the setting, in the vibe, in the environment, in the whatever. And shoot on the iPhone. Yeah. Shoot it on iPhone, shoot it related. And you, there are brands doing this. There are fundamentally brands that have been doing this and making that interesting content. It was a Bentley, I think did that. Like they had an Indian comedian doing, doing a thing like doing TikToks with the car. Oh, I saw that. And I saw, I've seen Gucci do the style of ad where they're shooting some of their, like it's essentially BTS content, like behind the scenes. Like I encourage brands to also consider behind the scenes content. Well, if they're doing especially apparel, this is something I see a Nani Bing do, which is like a, like a New York City brand that's more luxury in nature. And they've been shooting all their campaigns recently for, um, like for Facebook and Instagram on an iPhone, but they also have a heavy assist from dynamic product ads. Sure. So. Yeah. There's just so much that like, yeah, we could go on forever. Yes. You can shoot luxury in that way, find a way to shoot it uglier, shoot it more authentic, and that makes it way more, like again, if you can shoot it in those really high, beautiful places, invest in that. Yeah. Right. Don't shoot it in a trailer park. Like that would be bad. Don't do that part ugly, but pair it with other high value luxury products. Yeah. That's how I do it. If Rolls Royce would ever like to make a post-it note ad with me, I accept. They can and should. They probably shouldn't. But if they did, like they could think of like how to make, you know, use a fancier, use a fancier pen, you know, use a, use a, use a $400 pen. I actually said that to someone. I was like, okay, write the, write the note with a Tiffany pen. And that kind of signaling in your ad is something that I love breaking down. So for a brand like cuts, like when comparing a brand like cuts versus true classic, it's actually so interesting to look at how cuts differentiates themselves because they're using a remote like suitcase in their ads and they're using, they're clearly flying private. They're clearly like, you know, at a lounge. Yeah. Like if you look inside of their ad account and like their campaigns, that's how they might be unnecessary. They might be going, that might be, they might need to make them uglier. Like maybe that is aspirational and maybe that's good, but that might be over, overdoing it. Maybe not. I don't know. I'd have to go take a closer look. Take a closer look. I like what they do. Um, another question that I got from Shelby, who we actually spent with time in, um, it was wearing this hat on Instagram. Yeah. I was like, I saw she's making ads for you for rotten. Oh, is she? I thought she was. Yeah. She said she was, she tagged you yesterday. I said she was making ads for you. Oh my God. Maybe I missed that. Oh gosh. I'm so excited. Okay. Great. So a question that she has for you is if you could partner with and make ads for any single brand out there, who would you want to partner with and why? Rotten. Not rotten. Freedom. Um, no, like I do mean that. Like I really, by the way, I get offered tons of opportunities to work with lots of brands and like people want to start things up and ask me all the time, which is I'm very honored and flattered by, but like this is one where I was just like, oh my gosh, like where it's alternative, it's weird, it's fun. We're going to do some crazy stuff. Smart people are involved. Uh, like we have an amazing animator, designer guy, creative director. He's awesome. And like, but I don't know if there's any other brands. Like I really want to, I have worked with my like ideal dream brands before. Like I've worked on a lot of these. Like I don't know what they're. I haven't worked with Dr. Squatch and I don't need to, I don't care to like, I have nothing else like to prove to myself in that way. Hell yeah. Yeah. So I don't care. Like I'm, I'm secure in that way. Oh, maybe I'll come back to that. I have people have asked me this question before and I just, I've worked on so many big brands anymore. I just don't care. It's probably a good way if they're watching honestly, yeah. Honestly, genuinely, uh, I've worked with some brands like I've really liked before and it's only ruined it for me. Like, like, relatable content. Yeah. Like I'm sure like if I worked on liquid death, right, that'd be cool. But like I bet it would make it not as fun. I wouldn't. Yeah. Not that that's a brand I care that much about, but yeah. Yeah. Um, another question I always really like to ask people too. And you've talked about this a lot, but what are the creators that you really admire and follow? Yeah. That's it. No, Mr. Bees, Colin, Samir. Um, I watch a lot of Colin and Samir because they are just, they're talking about the business of creative and you know, it's not Facebook ads. Um, they're talking about content and making content for people and, uh, story. And like it's really cool to see them break some of that stuff down and here, you know, they're interviews with creators and then the creators are talking about building stuff for audiences and building stuff. So all of that's incredible. Anything where you can go listen to Mr. Bees to talk about content, 99% of it is his Colin and Samir episodes are actually where you should start. Yeah. Yeah. Um, like, yeah, I think it was one of those where he said, like, don't, uh, don't worry about like the algorithm. It's not the algorithm. It's the audience. Yes. Right. Just replace the word algorithm with word audience. And that's what's not working for you. Right. It's not the algorithm. It's the audience. So, um, there's so much there because he just is unrelenting in terms of like making content that gets people's attention and keeps people retained and keep them watching. He is the person that goes the furthest and digs the deepest. I think he is obsessed with it. Like he is obsessed with it. And he, he gets everyone around him to give him negative critical feedback. And like no one else does that. Like do everyone should be doing that more. I try to do that as much as I can. Like, I don't want validation. I want people to tell me like, how can I make this better? Yeah. And I think that's something that I actually find a lot of advertisers and internal teams have a hard time with is giving that critical feedback. And that's something I struggled with as a leader initially too. Everyone just wants validation. Yeah. Cause a lot of people told me creatives are really sensitive to like really pad your feedback with creative teams. And one of the last big impactful lessons I learned at thesis was actually being the asshole in the room was a gift. For me it is for sure. And my, like that was something that when I was leaving, my team told me, oh, I actually appreciated how hard, how harsh you were. And it was during the times when I wasn't giving that like harsh feedback that actually there were more, there was more friction and people creatives want to be challenged. Yeah. They do better. I think, I mean, I consider myself like a creative. Sure. Like I do better with pressure. Um, I don't always want the pressure or need like, yeah, yeah. I know that I get more out of it when I have more pressure on me. Yeah. Well, Barry, it was super awesome having you in the studio today, writing this out, doing this thing.
