What's up marketers? I'm really excited about today's episode because today I am joined by the VP of growth at thesis Berry Hot aka my boss. Now this is going to be a two-part episode all about the aftermath of iOS 14 which rolled out in full about three weeks ago on April 26th. Now I know that's not really a long amount of time but quite a bit has changed since then. So Berry and I are going to discuss what this change actually looks like for our clients right now at thesis and we're going to be answering your questions that you asked us on Twitter and on this channel. Like I said, this is going to be a two-part or so you should be seeing part two in a few days. So let's go ahead and get into it. Hey, I'm Barry. I'm the VP of growth at thesis. I've been with thesis two years, maybe a little bit more. And my background is extensively in paid social ads. That's also like my biggest passion and hobby. I've been doing ads on Facebook since back in 2008 back when they're on the right-hand side only. I appreciate your reaction shot to that even though you've heard me say that like 30 times. You know, in that time I've spent hundreds of millions of dollars for brands like AT&T, Toyota, Kraft, Microsoft. And since I left that kind of bigger brand world a few years ago, I've been primarily focused on for less four years of my career on direct to consumer aggressive growth advertising. As well as working on CRO and creative. I want to ask you some of the most common questions that people have been asking us on Twitter and also asking on the channel. And I think, you know, what I want to accomplish is like pull back the curtain a little bit from what we're seeing at thesis and how we can help other media buyers. So the first one I want to ask is something that I've actually heard from a lot of our clients is should I shift my spend to Android or should we segment spend between Android and iOS devices? No, simply no. That's that's the answer. You shouldn't. What you should do is instead monitor what Facebook does automatically with your ads. You should be able to still see a breakdown and you still can see breakdowns of that delivery so you can see where the spend is going. You can't see the actual conversions on those on those individual devices, but those device types you can see how much spend is going there. So you can look at like what that was in March versus what that is in May and have an idea of like, okay, we're in this allocation has already shifted by Facebook. But I would trust Facebook to be handling for that and I'll be interested to see if it does shift towards Android due to how your attribution settings are set up. But I am not expecting it to shift significantly and I know that like Facebook still needs to deliver ads on those placements and on those devices. So yeah, this is what like I know a few of the other growth managers on us have like talked about. It's like not a high fidelity test. Like we don't have high confidence that doing something like this is going to fundamentally change your results on the platform because everything up until this point. That we know about the Facebook ads algorithm. If you're optimizing for purchase using a conversion campaign, Facebook's algorithm knows better than you which devices to put that spend towards. And this would be a huge deviation from that and I don't think that this change is necessarily going to mean that we're going to have to start splitting that out. That was my original fear actually like one of my few fears with this change is that we were going to have to revert to Michigan method and methoding it. So like segmenting things out by gender by age by location like I hated that stuff. And I so far have not seen any indication that that is something that we're going to have to do again, but it is still early days with iOS 14. So well, it is interesting hearing you say that because there are some things I've had to like make decisions about and thinking about in terms of the age and gender and some of our ads where we can't. See the conversion breakdown anymore. So I've either had to like revert back to old data where we do have it or I've had to make kind of a gut decision. So there might be instances where I might need to or want to break out my age. You know, maybe just in half. I'm not going to break out every demo because that's not important, but maybe do you know, you know, old, you know, medium, young, whatever. Yeah, just to see if some things make sense or not like as we go that that might be something worthwhile. But again, like to your point about not being a high fidelity test, not only is it not a high fidelity test like you know, you have to understand that anytime you cut something out of your ability to target. You're saying to Facebook, like, I want to target this smaller inventory. So like, and pretty much every time you have you go after smaller inventory, you're going to have higher costs naturally. That's the beauty of automatic placements is that Facebook automatically delivers where it can get you the most effective delivery, whether it be through the best conversion rate or through the cheapest impressions or, you know, the least. Competition, whatever it is, that's what the beauty of automatic placements is. And the more you chop that up manually, the more inefficient you're likely to be. Exactly. And then that just like causes your CPMs to go up to and it's just yeah, it causes everything to go up. It's a bit of a mess. But yeah, I think that this will be something we'll eventually test, but it's not something that I'm like gunning to test right out of the gate. I'm going to wait until I hear that more people are actually getting the ATT prompt because from what we've heard, not very many people have gotten it yet. So even doing a test like that in the beginning, which seems like, oh, you know, you're really like being proactive about it. It's like we don't actually have the proper sample size yet. So it would be a futile effort. So yeah, that's the big thing is that I don't think we're near the full scale yet. So there's still, there's maybe when it is fully rolled out. That might be a bigger problem then. Yeah. So another question that I got was about audiences. So, you know, are lookalike audiences going to be less effective and should I test more interest audiences? Our lookalike audience is less effective. Maybe. But like, I would say tangibly no. Right. Just, just in terms of there's still tons of conversions getting in there from almost anything that you're advertising, you're still getting a huge amount of conversions for your for the for Facebook to build lookalikes successfully. So that's not something I'm going to lose sleep over. I wouldn't recommend anyone lose sleep over that. I don't think we're really focused on that too much. And with the direction things have been going with all this, you shouldn't be focusing that much on look likes anyway. Get get look likes in there, whatever you think is good. You know, it's easy for me to say because I've been doing this a long time but like, I don't know purchases typically of any type. That's what I want to do with like so if you want to look likes of other events to great. If you want to do look likes of on Facebook activities, great, go for it. I throw those all together. Optimize to it. Check that box for lookalike audience expansion. You know, same thing goes with interest. Even more interesting. Interesting about interest is that, you know, the same thing is happening with there. Facebook wants you to be using broad. They've had the audience expansion. You know, click check the checkbox for a while. You know, the expansion. Detail, detail, detail, expansion. Thank you. But they actually have had that available. But we've seen in some accounts, it rolling out where it's actually, it doesn't even it's not available. And what it actually says is that your interests, whatever you're targeting is being used as a guide. It's still going to go after all of the users that it wants but it's going to use that as like a guide of where to start, rather than like only targeting these people so it's effectively removing that button and you're only going to be able to target broadly, not hyper hyper tiny, rigidly anymore which to be very honest is really great for everyone. Yeah, and and that's that's how we've been we've been looking at targeting for a while now is really, you know, focusing on like broad and, you know, and just so that Facebook can optimize but that concept of like, okay, we want to be broad we want Facebook to use its machine learning, but we as human marketers with brains and experience, we might know something might work well to start and like give that give that a bias let's let's say like, let's go from here, Facebook so that's that's what I'm interested to see. And, you know, maybe there are some smaller brands that have smaller audiences that I'm not thinking of but I really do think a lot of these both between lookalikes you'll be fine between the interest you want to use you'll be fine. I don't think you're going to lose a lot there. The stuff that you want to be concerned about and thinking about is your exclusions. You know, your custom audience exclusions. If you're using a purchase event to exclude purchasers. Well, first of all, if you're not using a purchase event to exclude purchasers past purchasers. You know, I question what you're doing in the mostly in the first place unless you're intentionally going after your customers. I would always recommend that. And what I want to clarify something you said there, like, what he's saying is that if you're only using a pixel purchase audience to it like exclude from so if you're excluding purchasers and you're only using that pixel based audience you're definitely missing people. And what's going to be a big concern with iOS 14 is those that audience is going to be a lot less reliable. So you want to what I'm actually saying, I'm saying like there are people that aren't even excluding purchasers. That's what I'm saying. Okay, got it. There's some people that aren't even doing that baseline. But yeah, in addition to that pixel, you would also want to be using some sort of CRM list or, you know, whatever you can do to get your convert your actual customer data back into Facebook to use as a list to exclude and to build lookalikes from that's what you need. That's that's just in addition to being able to do it from the pixel that's that's the high value stuff that you like should have been doing already. No offense if you weren't, but like you should definitely be doing that now. So you're, you can avoid sending ads to existing customers that opted out. That's not a good experience because that one of the things that you and I talked about earlier, which I thought was interesting was like, when you're using that tactic going back to broad targeting but like broad targeting was starting with interests where it like goes from there. Or even just broad targeting in general. One of the things I like to do I like to play with is think about who is a customer that would never buy my product, like really, really never buy it. Like, I've seen people do that with age, sometimes too rigidly they're like, well someone's 65, they're never gonna buy my product. I'm like, someone who like my parents are not my parents are older than 65 and they buy stuff on the internet. I would, you know, I know exactly what you mean. I tend to not like be so strict with my age is even if like I'm I know my core audiences between the ages of 24 to 45. It will also it'll like bump up your CPMs a bit and I think that overall like even though fundamentally you know your customer like Facebook knows Facebook the best. Correct. And they know who's going to convert. So, exactly. But so, aside from that like, again, people that's sometimes you'll be too limiting with. With age. I'm saying think about who are, who are those people that will never buy your product. If you're selling beef jerky, you can almost 100% safely exclude vegan interests. Like that, if that is a risk I would be willing to take is adding that interest as an exclusion. 100% I would be comfortable doing that. I absolutely acknowledge that there are people that are in the vegan interest bucket in Facebook, because they're super broad. I'm sure there are people that fall into that bucket that also would buy jerky either for themselves or for someone else. But I'm okay with losing that a little bit, just because I know fundamentally those people won't ever convert. Now maybe that isn't necessary maybe Facebook machine learning will figure that out pretty quickly. But, you know, there are things like that you can play with. I wouldn't waste. I would not burn hours playing with this thinking about this. But like, if there's something simple logical like that. Yeah, go go go play with it for five minutes and then see what happens in a few days. I think a good way to think about that too is like think about the kind of people that are potentially going to vandalize your ads. I've also used this strategy like working for different political campaigns. And we would very deliberately exclude people who were on the opposing like political spectrum. So we would like either exclude or target for is that allowed now would Facebook allow that. Well, we're using publications like using publications. So if we like say that like we were running for like we were running ads for someone who was more Democrat or like left ring left wing, then we would be sure to exclude from like Fox News and like certain right wing media. Sure. And that was fundamentally love the concept of that targeting I've always thought so much about that. What I've seen recently in regards to interest targeting and look likes is just and this is completely subjective. This is not like an objective statement. This is just like what I've seen over the last few weeks at thesis is, you know, I have seen a small lift from using certain interests targeting and this is by like using the stacked interest approach we're not just doing single interest we're looking at interests that have worked already is stacking them together into one ad set. And I have seen a small lift from utilizing those and are in our with our clients that are at scale but I do find that it's not. It's not a great scale point and they do tend to fizzle out a little bit. So I don't see this as like a huge unlock for our accounts but it's tends to be we get efficiency for a short amount of time, it dies out we're going back to broad and you know but that's just kind of the name of the game at this point when you're at scale. And then as for lookalikes I'm seeing a similar thing, you know, we're being able to get a little bit of efficiency out of them for a few weeks and then they're not really able to maintain that same level past like two or three weeks so again like we're still leaning heavily on broad audiences and of course testing as much creative as we can in allowing the creative to be more of the allowing creative to do the heavy lifting for the targeting. Yeah, well said and I was about to just jump in and say like, we've been disproportionately talking about targeting so much here, compared to like how much, you know, it actually impacts like the massive impact of anything you're going to do on Facebook is target, you know, something normal ish, nothing crazy, and focus on creative. That's that's really all like, that's all that matters. Keep playing with creative if you're like, Alright, I've got this great ad let me just target to the figure out how to target to the right people and bid correctly like, nah, like, no, that's not it. You need to just keep iterating on creative and that's, that's what you know you and I spend the most time talking about what we spend talking to our teams about is almost always creative, and then just making sure the targeting isn't bad. Yeah, yeah. You know, making sure we're, we're, we're targeting enough people is really the conversation so again, we've disproportionately covered targeting here rather than creative but this isn't really a call about creative I suppose so. Yeah, exactly. And I think too it's like, we at thesis as like our part of our thesis strategy and modern day best practices it's all about broad and a majority of our conversations like you said focus on creative if we're testing a new audience for instance and a campaign or for a client, I would venture to say that we had then at least like six to seven different ad variants for that one audience test if if that even which just shows how much time and effort we put into the creative aspect of things. It's very true. For sure. So, next question that I've been getting a lot is our bid caps or cost caps still working. As far as I know, yes. We, I've definitely seen, like I personally, I've never had a good experience with coughs, coughs caps. Again, if you're like, whoa, what is this guy talking about he's been advertising for a long time he doesn't use cost caps. Again, comment below I'd love to, I'd love to hear from you. I both myself and from others not seeing it work for scale. I am certain cost caps are great for if you really really do not want costs to go over a certain level. I'm sure cost caps are great, but to scale. I don't think it's a good tool at all I would strongly recommend. I would mostly use lowest cost for a lot of things. If you need a little bit more control you want to keep things a little safer, definitely go with bid caps. And to that effect, I haven't seen it dramatically stop working. As far as it continues to work fine. The data still coming in, we might have to bid a little higher, we might see some higher, some slightly higher costs. Yeah, like, I think that's, that's pretty, pretty much business as usual. Yeah, yeah, that hasn't changed so much from my perspective either. And like you said, this is a harder question to ask because they feel like some agencies or some media buyers build a lot of their strategy around using very specific or certain bidding strategies. So, sure do. Yeah, like no matter what, like you and I are going to give a really biased answer. And, like, from our perspective and at thesis we're primarily using lowest costs, especially for creative testing. And then if we have core campaigns where we want to control the spend a little bit more we are like using bid caps in some instances. Yeah, and actually, you bring up a great point, which I would imagine anyone who's, who's heavily bid focused any, any provider who's, you know, has a lot of bid on auto automation, right or optimization. So, I think those tools are either going to be seeing some, some lag here or needing to account for some more lag here, because the data is not going to be coming in as quickly and worse, you know, if you're making bid optimizations manually or automatically. So, conversions are now being reported on the day of the conversion rather than day of the impression, which is the biggest, I think the biggest change out of all of this for advertisers is that, yeah, conversions now are, or if you clicked on an ad yesterday, and you convert today, and it means in ads manager it'll show that you converted today. So you can literally have ads that are turned off if you turned them off yesterday, have ads have conversions today, even other off, which changes how you look at reporting windows, that changes how you like look at the ad delivery filter in Facebook like the had delivery filter, because you can have had delivery, have an ad, an ad set or ad that didn't have delivery today, but had conversions today, especially using the seven day click attribution. That's a whole other can of worms that we maybe need a whole another, you know, video view, but that's, that's another reason why like, there's going to be some serious lag if you are trying to like play the increased decrease bid game, and I'm not 100% sure how Facebook systems are actually going to be able to accommodate that either. Yeah, exactly. Because to me too, it just seems like another variable and another hoop that you're making the algorithm jump through in many ways and just recently we have tested cost caps on a few clients and it did exactly what you said it choked spend, and we didn't get any results and for a lot of our clients were playing a volume game. So we absolutely cannot have spend be choked, because that has major implications on revenue and overall business goals. And the only way that we've found to control costs when we need to is with big camps. But again, by as dancer and like you said the bigger implications are that now conversions are delayed or at the time of conversion, which means that we're constantly having to go back and check out ads that we might have turned off or we deemed we're not working so. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's also going to be weird looking back at ads and seeing like, suddenly they have better performance now since you turned them off. And yeah, the day after you increase budget your performance is going to be terrible the day after you decrease budget, your performance is going to look really good because you have more delivery yesterday. And now that you, you're going to have more conversions that just have a natural time lag to them, you're going to have more today so you're, you're going to see more conversions today. And you're going to start this hyperbolic roller coaster where, you know, you see great performance you crank, you crank spend up, but then performance is terrible suddenly so you, you cut it in half, but then you see great performance again so you're like what the heck, let me turn this up again. And you're just every day or every other day or every three days, whatever it is, if you're just hyper reactive like that. You're just going to be, you're never going to get off that roller coaster so you really got to look at longer, some longer, you know, trend lines, some windows to better understand that what your performance is over time. And going back to the cost cap thing and like restricting spend, right, like, that's death for some, some clients, some brands to loot to not have, you know, sales in those days and even worse is that to get back on track to catch up for that lack of sales for that period. You have to then spend more and more even more inefficiently to catch up to that amount of sales that you lost that day because cost cap might have restricted your sales too much so that's a really bad place to be in you want to be able to try, you know, for me I usually want to try to keep spend and keeps delivery pretty flat over time unless I know we're going to be doing a promotion or I know there's specific holiday to cater to, but really, the more the more peaks and valleys that you have or the more peaks that you have in your spend, or the more you have to spend in a shorter time, the worse your performance is always going to be you know nothing scales perfectly on Facebook that's just not how it works. I'm not sure I'm going to add this in the video but I did hear something really interesting today from a Facebook rep about what they are specifically looking at and what they anticipate the biggest degradation and results are going to be from, and I want your opinion on it. So, So yeah, because I thought it directionally it was a really interesting way to look at our campaigns and be able to identify like oh is this actually as a result of iOS 14 or is it just like crappy results that we need to change. So first, the first thing that's going to be like knocked out our first place he suspects that like we're going to see a deterioration of results is DAR dynamic ads retargeting. Next step is just retargeting. So retargeting as a whole which I think makes sense because yes our retargeting pools are going to be reduced. They're not going to be as accurate so that's fine. Next up he said look alike audiences, which I think is going to be based on just the fact that since Facebook is now like Facebook is now being forced to change how they optimize and target they're just not going to be able to match as clearly within look alike audiences. And then after that they have Dabba or dynamic ads broad retargeting, because again they're losing those. Yes, broad audiences, they're losing their optimization signals from that and then the final thing that they think will be impacted, which is going to be not as much as broad audiences. So, which I think makes so everything. Well, well what they were what he was saying was is like this is a spectrum and that the thing that he expects to be to be affected the least is just broad audiences and broad targeting. Yeah. Yeah, which was something like that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, which was somehow comforting to me is that's how we do a majority of our creative testing. I think I was expecting anything different but it was kind of nice to hear like that confirmation and to like write out that spectrum and see it for myself. And I think that like those are the things that I'll try to isolate over the coming weeks to see like oh, like how are those things trending or is it going to be much like is it much different since this change started. I'd be interested to see the dynamic the diva stuff the dynamic audience broad talk sorry dynamic advertising broad audiences. What is it dynamic ads dynamic ads broad audience audience. Yeah, I always get it. We use that for I mean I've only ever seen that work for one client and we use that for one client. Yeah, I hope there's someone else out there is like I use it all the time I'd love to know what they're working on. That typically works well for brands that have many products, a wide variety of products and products that are easily able to be communicated just in a single image basically. But yeah, I'll be interested to see how that that performance falls off. It does make sense to me with the less events but I still it's such a large scale I do still hope and expect it to be pretty darn good. Yeah, fingers crossed right but like I said this is a spectrum so it's like the second to last thing so and I guess it makes sense, just because since creative is still going to be that's like more evidence to me that creative is still going to be our most important lever. And with dynamic ads, you know, like we don't really have too many levers we can pull their creatively like we can change the copy, or if we want to spend an arm and a leg for a program like Mar pipe where we can actually like overlay, like, overlay little stickers or testimonials whatever then like, yeah, we can do that kind of stuff with dynamic ads but it's just, yeah. Yeah, I mean I got that I'm going to do my my bigger bit about and I don't know if I've talked to you about this before. I've been looking at Facebook ads for a long time as TV. We need to be making ads for tons of people. You can't make ads that are just for small audiences that doesn't scale. You can get audiences that are that can get the most amount of people to pay attention, the most amount of people to convert. You should be thinking about not creating a TV ad and that it's 100% polished and button up and widescreen, none of those things, but for TV in that, you know, you need to make it compelling for large swaths of people that are very generic. Like, you know, look at demographics at the level of like, you know, people that watch comedy central like that's so many people, people that watch, you know, all the like, really broad you can't be like oh it's this person who, you know buys this exact brand of product you can't, you can't really do that anymore, you shouldn't have been anyway. Like you shouldn't that that died four years ago, maybe five years ago. Yeah. And, you know, so you should really be thinking about how to make the broadest ad targeting with with with your creative, right, but even don't even target with your creative, make your, make your targeting with your creative broad, make it as palatable as you can for the most possible people, make it relevant as you can for the most possible people and attract him. So like, yeah, that's that's really like you said, the trick here is like focus less on audiences. And coming for a long time from Facebook, either writing's been on the wall, ever since they added that checkbox for like, for a detailed audience expansion, this has been like, that should have been the sign to everyone to be like okay, let's not focus on this anymore they're telling you, they're photographing us what they want the future to be. So, yeah, and the way that I like to sum it up for clients and young media buyers is when you are number one testing with a broad audience and creating and knowingly from the start developing creative that is much more broad audience you are creating creative that is much more scalable. If you are thinking about oh I want to create this specific, this specific hook or this specific ad for a certain subset of people. You are fundamentally restricting like what Facebook can do with that creative and your results. So, if you had a quick hit, you might you might get quickly, you know, you know creams for a week, or you know, maybe not even a week, maybe a couple days maybe immediately, and then just Peters out right like if you do like a very specific meme or you do like a very specific like rick and Morty reference and like hyper narrow like yeah you can get a hit there but it's not going to scale. And like that's what most for for at least for you and me I'm sure there's other advertisers who could live off of those those smaller scraps you know but for for us it's about scale and and I guess should be forever about scale about how do we make this scalable how do we make this repeatable. How do we have ads that continue to work over time so we don't have to make a new ad for a new audience, or the same audience and that's not scalable that's not repeatable. Yeah, one of the most common questions I get on the channel actually is hey I launched a new ad or a new ad set and the results are really great for two to three days and then they died off that's evidence of that in action. Is that you know you you might have created something sorry it is but that's evidence. What's the what's the other one what what what what do you think I would say would be the other the other reason that that that's falling off after two days. I actually don't know I'm not reading your mind well right. Yeah, it was like a shitty product I don't know. Yeah, no what you said is very possible right you just like hit it hit it and quit it, but to me it's almost always engagement. It's calm. It's you said it yourself earlier vandalism on the ads. Yeah, that I really hope there's someone who like this is watching this and that opens up something to them. People writing negative comments on your ad and you leaving them there. Fundamentally, it affects everything. Negatively, it affects performance. You are allowing someone to do the equivalent of going up on your on your billboard and writing this product sucks, or like why would you use this product or anything anything negative that people can say, you're allowing that to stay there instead of like wiping it off. Like, hide those comments I'm not saying don't you're not saying to delete them I'm not saying to ignore them respond to them if you want but fundamentally hide them that way other people coming to your ad don't see those and negative comments but gets negative comments. Positive comments don't necessarily get positive comments, but at least it's a much more palatable for people to play with. Gosh, I really hope that that like helps someone because that's one of the when I learned that when I noticed that a while ago on an ad like I was in and was like, man this was performing so good and now it's like the worst ad we've ever run. And I go and look at it I'm like, oh people are just like, making fun of me making fun of my whatever. I don't know so we like hide those, or either hide those or recreate the ad fresh, and you suddenly see the performance start working again. And this is so common to that one of the first things that I check out when an ad starts to reduce and results is I immediately look at the comments like I am in the habit now of looking in the comments for a majority of the ads that we we run, especially when something starts to scale up. I'm monitoring those things super closely and it's not just about monitoring performance to this is also a gold mine for other ideas for new ads and new copy that you can get and actually just taking exactly what people are saying, and you be utilizing that for your next pieces of creative. So because you'd lean against it right. Yeah, someone like you know I'd work with with ranch water right like people all the time are saying like, Oh, is does that go well with your purse, and it's like, come on like, it's it's not like there are people like that are saying terrible things about very sexist. And so I'm like, Okay, well maybe I should make an ad that's like talking about masculinity, like maybe I should, you know, not in a toxic not a bad way. Yeah, about how like, you know, like maybe I make an ad that goes after that maybe make an ad that makes a joke about it being like sounding like ranch dressing but it's not ranch dressing. It's, you know, like a Texas ranch, like, you know, maybe I play with that a little bit. Rather, and, and yeah, like you said, like you can get a learning from that, you can, you know, play into that because if that's what people's minds are already coming up with when they see your ad they see your product. You might as well like maybe like, give them give a wink at them. Yeah, I do with that. But still hide hide those negative comments because you don't just because it's social. I think there was this movement like in 2013 it was like, will will show people were great at customer service by responding to oh yeah, like, that's that's that is great. But your ads are not the places for that I've had to talk to a lot of clients about that they're like, really proud of being able to talk to, you know, talk down a, you know, someone who's like a real hater, someone who's writing really mean stuff on there, and they're really proud of that they're like Yeah, we were nice. And but yeah but still, if you can see that 2030 50 100 people have liked that negative. Yeah, that's because people are paying attention to it when they see your ad. We have we have a client the perfect gene. I love to go to a Vodia love love love. What's up a party. Yeah, I hope God I hope you watch this. Love the perfect gene. Actually, I'll go so far as to give them a non hair spot like quote like I love the perfect gene as a client and as a product I wear the perfect gene pretty much every day. So, Fernando loves the perfect gene as well. We got him a pair of the pants and he took him to Mexico he wore them on the plane back to Peru a few days ago and he actually sent me a message and he was like, loved it, like, he's like I felt like he took business class for the first time he's like I was so glad that I was wearing my pants, because I felt like I belonged there but like the secret was they felt like sweatpants. So, like, that is an ad, you know, to be able to wear jeans that look that to something that looks like exactly like there are genes because they are genes. But like feet does not feel like genes. It's awesome. So anyway, shout out to the perfect gene in a Vodia, because like they have people coming coming at them all the time about like, Oh, you know about being there. Oh, you are men wearing tights. What is what's happening to me like a lot of awful stuff and like they put people on blast. Yeah, it is amazing. And like, that's a whole another separate thing like if you're willing to fight dirty, go for it like that's the only circumstance I'd be like, fuck it. Pardon my French. Yeah. But you'll leave the leave the negative comments in there and go at him. But like, if you're not going to do that, hide him, even if you do do that, you should probably hide him and make a distraction from people actually buying your product. So I will say this. One of the one of the negatives to excluding your past customers from your ads is that they're not getting your ads to be able to say, Oh, I love this product. I love to be your advocates. So like there is a world I've heard of people like running engagement campaigns for like $3 a day to their customers, but to like seed positive comments like that's not dumb. It's not a great use of money or time or energy but hey, we've really gone off the rails on this. No, I know but it's kind of great actually because the next question is retargeting audiences are going to reduce in size, particularly for website visitors. What strategies should we use to offset this. I think that something that I still see an ad accounts run by other agencies or their media buyers is a lot of advertisers haven't shifted to consolidating their retargeting so they're still segmenting out website visitors or certain page visitors from add to Carter's from initiate check value in that. I think there's only value in that if you are differentiating your messaging and if you're not, then I don't think that that is super valuable. Yeah, but then there's a whole other conversations which we're not going to get into now about like, is it really valuable to differentiate your messaging for those audience like is that in itself worthwhile Some would questionable questionable absolutely. Yeah, yeah, I mean, especially if you're like leaning more into offer like offer based messaging, I'd say, and you only want to have specific offers for people who added to cart for instance and you were like, you know, I don't want to like I've what I think a lot of brands is I don't want to jeopardize my brand image by seeming like a discount brand and like you could you could segment your messaging for discounts and offers to only be people who added to cart but yeah, in this like broader audience, I would say that the presence of, you know, iOS 14 and retargeting audiences reducing in size overall, I would, I would say to those people like, you know, consolidate your retargeting into like one or two assets at most like, especially modern advertising right like you and I usually would be like any ounce that you could be spending on being thoughtful about those who is in these audiences and what messaging are they getting and then updating that messaging however you any energy you're putting to that is going to be is going to pay out better coming up with better net new creative ads for the top or even iterative tests to test that I'm like I'm like already on already good creative. But it was an interesting stat like for people to know about thesis to is we actually recently wrote a blog article that looked at our different brands that we were managing and looked at the percentage of spend between prospecting and retargeting. And across the whole we were looking at, you know, a majority of our brands were spending about 90% and prospecting and only 10% and retargeting. So giving, you know, with that in mind for when you're working with brands at scale, giving too much thought to the messaging or to the structure of your retargeting campaigns is just something that we're not seeing huge lifts from and but we are seeing those bigger lists from when we're actually taking the time to do bigger swing tests on net new creative or iterative tests on creative that's already working. I will say, I agree with all that except that you know there's some bias to our the data that we have. Yeah, that's if you have you have higher, you know, if you have higher consideration products higher price products like a $1,500 something you're selling anything is going to take more thoughtful messaging perhaps. I mean, there's I can also argue that it just needs more messaging not necessarily, yeah, particular exact messaging. So that's, you know, there's a whole nother there but I do understand retargeting has more value for that. And for those those higher consideration things, especially at scale so there is something there but again, I wouldn't waste a ton of money on that. And I think, you know, as long as you're controlling frequency and being thoughtful about that and you know what the messages. That's, I wouldn't, I would still keep it 9010 pretty much almost any instance of anything that I'm selling I would be doing 9010 anyway. And what you said to about social engages is important because that is a retargeting audience that is not going to be changed from this like iOS rollout. So if you haven't been targeting your social engages then like what we do is we just combine Facebook engages and Instagram engages into one ad set and target those and that's really all you need to do we don't really complicated and it works great from some brands it works less great for others and it's like launching and testing and it is another lever you can pull. Totally and look, there are there's people that would say like, oh let's do post savers as its own separate thing and like I love that. I love that from a from a premise standpoint. That's also something we track on all of our like when we're analyzing our creative we're taking a look at people who saved or shared our ads. I don't like that I just look at like how many people saved and how many people. Oh, but you shouldn't look at the cost per that way. That's true. You can compare you can compare two ads because it's not just the number it's the how efficient it is true true. Yeah, it's like it's like a legitimate conversion rate on your ad because they are doing free advertising for you so I totally understand it fundamentally. Before you could be looking at the you could also look at the rate. I had no joke for loaner of a ranch water are our share rate or cost per share for our was it the April Fools thing, which was the buttermilk ranch it was a joke playing up the whole like branch which it's not that it was so it was borderline like actually viral. If I could go back in time, I would have spent five times as much as we did on that feeling only only the day later, I looked at the shares I didn't look at the shares as it was going, and the cost per share was like, five cents, it was like, I was like, we would have hit the entire planet. If we just like spent a bunch more. So, yeah, that was that was one of those if we wasn't five cents I should look at it was, it was shockingly low, I couldn't believe it how many people shared it from the ad directly, not just not the then viral shares. Which was, which was pretty crazy so you know, that's rare. That's a that was a one in like 50,000 chance that that happens, your ads will never do that. But just a side note about like, yeah, maybe you should have that that percentage there because if you see something that has a higher share rate. I bet like I bet some of our perfect gene ads we should take a look closer at that. I bet that like have more viral actions and those are not trackable by ads manager those are not trackable at all forget about is 14. We can't attribute those to Facebook ads at all. So, No, you're right, we should take a look at that and we're also we're doing we have coming up for them like a few like meme style ads like in the same vein is like nugs and disco skin like it's gonna like I think like that kind of stuff has like more of a virality effect or it's like it's just content. For which is like infinitely more shareable because when people feel like they're being advertised to it like feels crunchy. Yeah, so exactly. Yeah. So, next question, which is a big is
