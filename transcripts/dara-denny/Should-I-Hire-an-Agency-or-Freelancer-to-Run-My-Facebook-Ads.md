What's up marketers? Today's video is going to answer one of your most common questions that I get on this channel Which is should I work with an agency or a freelancer to run my Facebook ads? And in the spirit of transparency, I currently work for an agency thesis where I work with direct-to-consumer brands that are spending anywhere from a quarter million to two million dollars per month on their paid social Advertising. However, in my career, I have also worked in-house as a freelancer, as a consultant, and of course agency side. And to be honest There is no one-size-fits-all and there are pros and cons to all of these options However, based on my experience, I now have a pretty good idea of what types of businesses should work with an agency or hire a Freelancer or even just hire in-house So what we're actually going to do today is answer a series of questions that are going to point you in the right direction Now these are the questions that I always make sure to ask potential clients So you're also going to kind of see what it's like to be in the sales process with me at thesis So let's go ahead and dive in now question number one is what is your ad spend budget per month? And where do you want to be within the next six months to a year? Now the reason why I always ask this is because I want to make sure that their budgets are actually in line with the type of Retainers that we would be charging them at the agency What I actually did for you guys is I created a table to showcase what I tend to see plays out the most in the industry So more often than not if you're spending less than 5k a month on your Facebook ads or other paid social platforms Likely you're just gonna be doing it yourself and up to 10k often the same thing I see a lot of people doing it themselves Or that's when they start to hire a freelancer as you get up to those slightly larger budgets at 50k per month That's when I see people really working with a more experienced freelancer or even starting to hire out to a boutique agency And up to 100k is when you start to see more of the bigger agencies coming to play and up to 200k That's really where I'm seeing a lot of expert freelancers or bigger agencies up to 500k is almost solidly agency territory And then up to a million dollars per month or more That's really where I see bigger agencies as well as people just hiring in-house and again All of these numbers are just based on my own experience and what I often see play out in the industry But this data point of ad spend per month is really important to note because a lot of expert freelancers or even agencies Won't work with brands that are spending less than a certain threshold because the fees associated with their services aren't gonna make sense But as you begin to invest more in the platform and you need more services That's when those bigger agency fees are gonna start to make a lot more sense for you So again, if you are spending less than 10k per month, I would highly recommend that you have a go at running those ads yourself In fact, I have a number of videos that show you exactly how I would set up and run those campaigns So be sure to check those out now question number two is what services do you actually need? And this one might seem really obvious if you click in this video, right? You want someone to run your Facebook ads, but that means something way different to me now Than it did even 18 months ago. For instance on my team at thesis. Yes We run your Facebook ads your snapchat ads your Google ads all the ads platforms But that's actually a pretty small fraction of the work that we actually do for our clients in addition to the media buying We also produce and edit our own creatives and design and build out landing pages and we effectively Manage the clients growth strategy, which is gonna include anything from offer testing Message and landing page testing as well as other platform testing on my team at thesis There are growth managers CRO managers engineers designers and video editors It is a full-fledged growth team not just a paid social team and to be honest a lot of businesses do not need all that That depends a lot on your budget and where your brand is currently at with its growth So if you're spending over a hundred k per month on your Facebook ads and you need a full-fledged growth team Which is gonna include creative and CRO then an agency is probably your best bet or are you spending a hundred k? But you have your own internal resources for creative and for landing pages Then a freelancer is probably your best bet and at some points I do see that most brands go in-house why there are a number of downsides to that which I will talk about later in this video Next up with question number three is what type of creatives have worked well for your brand and how Experimental are you willing to get here? Now this is actually kind of a sneaky question because I'm actually trying to gauge how easy it is going to be for my team to work with you And for us to get you results So number one we like to see what type of creative testing has already been conducted and how that aligns with your vision for the future Because if you're wanting super polished video and image creatives that type of content is likely going to be better sourced from coming in-house Or from a very expensive branding or creative agency. Anyways, that's not really what works on paid social so much That's why I personally have not invested or pushed my team to produce those super polished creatives Something like this because if you've seen my videos You know that things like this and this tend to do the best on paid social really gritty simple UGC content that shows the core features and value props of your product This is what truly moves the needle today and again sexy creatives like this are created to make your boss or your investors happy But determining your creative needs is also going to help point you in the right direction for what type of media buying team You need to be working with so if you need all the studio all the UGC creative to be sourced produced and edited You're probably gonna be much better off with an agency or you're a brand that has enough money to hire that all in-house But if you plan on supplying all the creative for your media buying team Then you could probably just go with a freelancer now I will say that there are some other business models that I've seen that really interests me like my friends Savannah Sanchez Who is an expert freelance marketer? But she also sources out her own UGC content that works really well So she is able to do the actual media buy and develop some really cool and conversion ready UGC creative So that is another option too, but those type of experts are super super rare Now the cool thing is is that if you are up to date on modern best practices and Facebook ads and paid social You know that creative is the biggest lever So I have been seeing a lot more smaller agencies start to build out creative teams of their own to remain competitive But again unless you're spending more than 50k per month and you're paid social ads These fees are likely not gonna make too much sense for you Now I want to go through the pros and cons of working with all these different options Because ultimately this decision is gonna be made by a case by case basis again There is no one size that fits all no brand is the same so I'm gonna give you some hot takes real quick So some hot takes on doing it yourself pro. It's the cheapest option there is Additionally, you're gonna be learning a new skill set which I actually think is incredibly valuable Especially if you're going to be managing someone to run that platform in the future I also think you're gonna be a lot less likely to be ripped off by those people now The huge con here is there is a massive learning curve if you aren't well versed in marketing or these platforms in general So there's gonna be a lot of uncertainty and likely you're gonna be doing it wrong without even knowing it So the cons with doing it yourself is that there is a massive learning curve and likely you're gonna be doing it wrong Without even noticing at least for a little bit which could mean money wasted which is why I show you guys exactly how I build out these accounts for these budget types Because I would kind of feel bad for even charging someone to do that because that is literally all that I do It's truly that simple next up is a freelancer now some of the pros of working with freelancer is oftentimes They are way more cost-effective and working with an agency, but they have quite a bit of experience on the platform However, some of the cons of going the freelancer route is it's really hard to vet out these professionals Sure, you can get references or even case studies and ask how they go about their account building process But I still find working with freelancers to be a super mixed bag and to be honest You could also have a freelancer who's really great at what they do, but just like not a good business match for the brand I know I have definitely worked with some brands where I just wasn't the right match for them Additionally when working with a freelancer you have to be super super clear about what their actual duties are Are they there to run your Facebook ads or spearhead your creative strategy or spearhead your growth strategy? I often find that when I was a junior freelance media buyer I often got roped into a lot of other sections of marketing just in the name of making it work I feel like a lot of you have definitely been there as well So if you're gonna go the freelancer out be sure to be absolutely clear about what their duties actually are now next up is an agency And I currently work in an agency and one of the things that I really love about it is that there are multiple People and multiple perspectives working on your account Additionally, there's also gonna be a wide range of industry insights that come with working with many other accounts however some of the cons of this is that you never actually know who's gonna be working directly on your account and Agency people are often overworked and your account might not get the type of attention that it deserves and Agencies can be pretty expensive now. Let's talk about hiring in-house Some of the pros of this is that a single person or a single team is Dedicated to your growth in your growth on our own which means that you're definitely going to have People who are paying attention to your account at all times which is pretty dope and often I find that hiring an internal growth team or internal paid social team is often more cost-effective than working with an agency However, what I've actually found by working with some of these internal paid social people is that there is a huge lack of knowledge About what else is going on in the industry? I have to find that they're just a little bit out of touch with best practices Because they only get that one account to build learnings from whereas agency people work with so many different accounts every day that we can Pull learnings from them and then reapply it to other businesses and that's it Um, I'm so curious about what you guys thought about this video Be sure to hit me up in the comments below because again, this is all just my perspective and Again, not all one size fits all when I was a beginning media buyer I also worked with brands that were spending 2k 3k 4k 5k per month and they're paid social advertising and that's totally fine But what I often found is they weren't getting the true value of my services Because they had so many other marketing things that they should have been concentrating on like their email their CRO Bulking up their creatives. So, you know What can you do? Anyways, I'll see you guys next week. Bye
