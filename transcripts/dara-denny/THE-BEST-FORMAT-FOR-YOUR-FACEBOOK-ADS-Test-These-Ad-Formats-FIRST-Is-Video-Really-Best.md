## Transcript
Hey guys, welcome to my channel. Today I'm going to be talking about the six kinds of Facebook ad formats that you can use in your campaigns Particularly the ones that have made me a lot of money So be sure to watch to the end of the video where I show you which formats always get me the highest row as so a quick overview There are six types of formats that you can use on your Facebook ads There's single image single video carousel slide show collection ads and Instagram stories So once you've created your ad set You're going to be taken to the ad section of your Facebook ads manager and this is where you're going to create your actual ads and under Format you're going to see that you have the choice between three different options single image or video carousel or collection So single image or single video is pretty self-explanatory You can choose between having a single image or a single video as the ad creative This is a really common format and you probably see it all the time in your feed another common format You guys have probably seen our carousels This allows you to choose up to 10 images videos or slide shows and places them in a carousel format So they can click through the different slides and I love using these because Facebook actually Optimizes on whichever slide is performing the best So this means that if slide 4 is getting the most engagement that Facebook will actually start sewing that slide first Collection ads actually show a hero image or video at the top and then for products below It also opens up into an instant experience That's going to show you more of the products from the catalog and if you actually want to create a slide show I know this option isn't here But what you're going to do is you're going to click on single image or video and then you're going to see the option to make A slide show of your images This is a great option to have if you don't have any video and what I like to do is take the best performers from organic social media Put them into a slide show and then use that in my ads and if you haven't noticed There's no option for Instagram creative, but I have a workaround for that What you're going to do is you're going to create an Instagram stories only ad set and then you're going to select single Image or video in the ad section I love doing this because Instagram stories are super engaging and they're actually a lot cheaper than the feed and I'm going to be honest At some point guys you're going to need to test out all of these But my tried and true formats that I always see working over and over again are video carousel and Instagram stories Sure, I've gotten really great results from using just images But nothing beats out video and like I said if you don't have any video be sure to try a slide show ad my particular Favorite though is Instagram stories specific creative and it's something that I recommend to all of my clients because like I said It's super engaging, but also the CPMs are a lot lower So you're going to be able to reach a lot more people for less money Carousels are also hugely successful because Facebook is allowed to optimize for the first slide and because people are allowed to swipe through all The different images.
