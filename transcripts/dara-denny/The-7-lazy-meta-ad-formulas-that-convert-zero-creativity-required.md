Is it lazy or is it just a smart use of your time? Because I'm about to show you the seven ad formats that require almost zero effort but can still transform your meta ads. I actually posted this video on Instagram a few days ago and so many of you agreed that just because an ad is easier to make does not mean that it is less likely to perform. There's a real lesson in that. In fact, I think sometimes taking the easy way out is exactly what our campaigns need. But here's the thing. I'm not talking about slapping together some post-it no ad and calling it a day. These are strategic and proven formats that work because they're built on what performs. So here are the seven lazy ad formulas that have driven real results for our clients. And the best part is that most of them require a most zero new content creation. Formula number one is what I like to call ad stacking. This is the ultimate lazy ad because it requires no new content and frankly zero video editing skill. All you're going to do here is take your top performing creatives and combine them into a super ad. Now there are two ways you can do this and it's really crushed for some of the brands that I work with. Number one, take your top performing video ads and simply stitch them together or you can take your top performing hooks and put them into one video. I would stack anywhere from three to four of your top performing hooks. So why do I think this works? Right? Number one, I think meta is actually making a bet on longer form content, which is why they're going to be rolling out the new video highlights feature. I've talked about this in a few of my videos and I've actually seen recently that videos as long as four or five, even seven minutes long have been producing incredible results for the brands that I work with. So this is honestly the easiest way to test this out and I know what you're thinking, oh my god, that's too long. The tick talk of vacation of it all. We don't have that much attention. The reality is, is that there is no ad that is too long, just too boring. And formula number two is what I like to call the easiest image iteration that converts. I'm not sure if you're ready for this one, but it really packs a punch because for every single one of these images, I am actually super high confidence about the visual, high confidence on the messaging, even the creator and text overlay and font choice. How is that? Simply because I am taking the image of the first frame from top performing videos. So yeah, you can't do this for all of your videos, but for many of your videos, actually, you can easily turn them into statics by simply taking a screenshot of that first frame. So literally look at your top performing video ads for the last two plus maybe even three years and get 30 of these images. Think smarter, not harder. Honestly, this is a top tier iteration in my opinion and a really great way to revitalize content that performed well a year or two or even more ago. Formula number three is what I like to call top of funnel shorts. Now I've been hearing a lot of advertisers lately talk about top of funnel content or content for the unaware audience, which can often look like organic or regular creator content on TikTok, but can also candidly look like this. It's very content first. It doesn't feel like you're selling at all candidly. And this is often a content format that we turn to first when working with a new brand because it's such an easy win. As long as you get the messaging, right? We've actually had many winners from content that looks candidly exactly like this. Now one of my favorite new spins on this right now that we've seen crush for some brands is what I like to call desire metaphor shorts. Now the explanation of this is candidly longer than the execution of it. So stay with me for a bit. So Stephen Rice, a popular American psychologist, had a theory that was called the 16 human desires, which basically said that all humans had these core 16 desires that drive all of their behavior. So knowing which ones your products and services can tap into is really a superpower. And a test that we've seen crush in hooks as well as standalone ads is to take these desires in brainstorm how to visualize them. I kind of think about this like a metaphor and using story blocks, you can easily find that content and whip up new ads to test in less than 10 minutes. So for power, you could do something like this and tranquility. Here are a few examples. The great thing about story blocks is they have millions of instant video clips images and templates that don't feel like AI and they are 100% legal for commercial use, even in ads, unlike some AI tools. So even if you just get one winning ad, the subscription will pay for itself. And for a limited time, you can also get two months free, which is just an awesome offer. So to get unlimited downloads for one flat rate, check out storyblocks.com slash daridenne formula for the easy reasons why concept. Now, listen, this is not an original formula, but it is one that continues to work whether or not I want to admit it. I assume that you continue to watch this channel because you want to see what works, not just what's new, but comment below if I'm wrong. Now, the type of reasons why style of ad that I've seen work really well wasn't even really the talking head content like this, which is really popular, but actually more like this. And this was actually the top performing style for one of our brands over the last 365 days. So makes you think, right? Okay, formula number five, hot girl stories. Don't cancel me. In fact, I don't love admitting how well this works, but it really does. And essentially what I call the hot girl stories format is essentially how hot girls use their Instagram stories. It's obviously better if you do have a hot girl to do this ad format with. So maybe isn't that easy to pull off, but I actually have seen this kind of stories type of content work pretty well without a hot girl. Anyways, I have actually hired some creators just to make static content like this, and it really crushes and it's pretty affordable. In formula number six, the founders letter. And now this is a net that had that requires zero new content because it is entirely tech space. This is the founders letter. I mean, look at these results for some of the brands that we've used this ad on. It is absolutely wild. This is my number one must test for Black Friday, Cyber Monday or candidly any type of sale. And formula number seven, I'm actually just going to give you a roundup of some really easy formats that we've seen traction out of lately. So things like the tweet style ad, these Reddit style ads, and of course, these grids. I mean, look at those results. Isn't that kind of crazy? Now here's the thing, particularly for the tweet in the grid ads, you really need to draw inspiration from the way that people are talking about their problem or your type of product on Reddit or on Twitter, you really have to get that organic essence. I actually think this willow health ad is really smart, because it really does enter in a whole new type of demographic for GLP ones. Some people that need to use this product really do because they're significantly overweight, but there are some people who just want to use a few pounds. So I think that this messaging right here is really, really smart. I also think this tweet ad is hilarious because it's obviously a tweet ad, but for Reddit.
