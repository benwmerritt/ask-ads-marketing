What's up, marketers? In today's video, I'm going to show you my exact column setup on Facebook Ads Manager, aka, I'm going to show you the exact data, KPIs, and metrics I track every single day on the platform. Now, of course, this is not going to be the exact same for every single brand, but this is my core setup that I use to monitor my client's performance and creatives at thesis, which is the agency where I work. This is also the KPIs that I'm tracking typically to do account audits as well. So right now, I'm going to take you through every single metric and why I track it. Let's go ahead and dive in. Okay, so before we dive into the exact column setup that I'm using here, I want to do a quick overview of Ads Manager. Of course, right up here, you can toggle between your different accounts. It's really important if you're working at an agency to make sure you're in the right account. Right up here, you can also toggle between different time periods, like last seven days, last 14, or something more custom. For the purposes of today, we're going to be looking at last 30 days data. And then of course, right here, you have the columns. And in order to customize those columns, you can go right here, toggle between something that Facebook has already set up for us, or you can also customize them and then save them. This is a new default that I have, though, that I'm going to be going through with you guys. Now, something important about how we are optimizing our campaigns at thesis is that this is not the only source of truth that we have. We are also looking at things like Google Analytics, other third-party data services, and ultimately leaning on blended ROAs or blended ROI or Mer to make sure that our campaigns and our spend are being spent efficiently. But what's inside of ads manager is how we first evaluate performance and ultimately how we are analyzing our creatives. Now, post iOS 14, this data is a lot less reliable, but on the creative front, so everything that is being tracked directly on Facebook or on Instagram, that has remained unchanged. So things like your click-through rate, your CPC, your CPMs, as well as your hook rates or your hold rates, those are all still as accurate as they were before iOS 14. And that's ultimately what we're using to evaluate a lot of the creatives performance. Of course, secondary to those purchases and that ROI. But, you know, these are the numbers that we are primarily using to optimize our campaigns day to day, but always getting that internal gut check from those third-party data services. So let's go ahead and dive into my column setup. Now, the things that you see on the screen right now are pretty standard, right? We have on or off. So this is how you're turning on or off your campaigns or even your ad sets or your ads. Just like to keep that simple. That's pretty standard. Then you have your campaign names, delivery, bid strategy. Now, oftentimes I am using lowest cost for a majority of my ad campaigns. But if I'm doing an audit somewhere, that's why I really like to have that right front and center so I can see exactly what they're doing there. Same thing for the attribution. I'd actually say something interesting to note is my view on attribution inside of Facebook ads is something that has been changing a lot recently. Previously, especially pre iOS 14, we had mostly used one day click because the issue with attribution setting inside of Facebook ads manager is also your optimization setting. So you are literally telling Facebook to go after people who are more likely to convert from a one day click or a seven day click or a seven day click one day view. And in a lot of our testing at thesis, we found that especially those view through conversions were a lot less incremental and ultimately were wasting spend for our clients. However, because of iOS 14 and because of that lack of data, it's now actually been a lot harder to optimize campaigns, especially at the ad creative level when you're not getting as much of those purchases. So for some of our clients, we have been shifting to seven day click. And even when we are starting to take over those accounts who are optimizing on a seven day click one day view, we are more recently just leaving it there instead of making big changes like we used to. So next up, we have budget. Very important. This is one of the key ways that we are optimizing our campaigns is by throttling the budget or by reducing the budget, particularly at the ad set level. We haven't been using CBO as much on a lot of our campaigns. But again, you know, this varies media buyer to media buyer, even at thesis. But personally, I have been using a B.O. a lot more recently. Another really important thing right next to that is an amount spent. Now, I will say one of the key differences between managing accounts where you're spending $50,000 a month or $500,000 a month versus those lower budgets is you want to make sure that your account is spending. And that's actually one of the top things that I am monitoring day to day. It's not even the result is making sure that the campaigns are actually spending. There have been times in the past where over the weekend we would see, oh, like for some reason, this campaign didn't spend it all. And it put our clients behind quite a bit in terms of their results and the amount that they were supposed to spend. So I always want to make sure that that's front and center. So after amount spent, I have cost per purchase as well as website purchases. Now, Facebook automatically puts this in as results or cost per result. And I like to go ahead and just put in the purchase of data point instead. And the reason why that is is because number one, a majority of my clients are optimizing for those purchases. They're not looking after like landing page views or anything like that. So I like to make that just very clear in my column setup. But also if you were to go to the ad set level for instance and click on an ad set right here and you wanted to see the one that had the most purchases. Often what happens is initially you'll see something like this because oh, these are the newest ads that they just put in. But you want to see what is the ad that's actually doing the best here. And you can aggregate that a lot quicker. I've noticed that when you just have results, sometimes Facebook gets really glitchy and it won't aggregate the top ad when you click on this little button right here. So that's what I like to do. Okay, let's go ahead and go back. So right next to purchases, I like to have frequency. And this is one of those metrics that I track very closely, but I notice a lot of media buyers don't. And one of the reasons why that is is because I really like to make sure that I am not blasting, particularly my retargeting audiences out of the water. And you can see here over the last 30 days on average in the retargeting campaign, someone has seen an ad about six times. And to me, that's actually an okay number. Really what I'm looking for here is about four per week and then anywhere from six to eight, depending on the product over the last 30 days. So this is actually within good shrinking range. But it's definitely something that I tend to monitor closely, especially when doing those audits. I have seen some wild numbers on the frequency and it is a waste of money. So you want to be really careful of that. Next up, we have unique outbound click through rate. Now, I know that some media buyers go back and forth between just doing click through rate or link click through rate. And the reason why I choose unique outbound click through rate is I really am looking at the people who are clicking directly on the CTA and then getting to the landing page. And that's very clear. When you're looking at just regular click through rate, that's also people who are clicking directly on the ad or are clicking on the profile page and like going to check you out in social media. So this is just very clear that it's taking you to the landing page. And then right after that, we have reach impressions. And then I do monitor CPM and CPR. I tend to follow both of those, even though I am looking at frequency just again, you know, CPMs. I hear a lot of media buyers saying that they try to optimize their campaigns for CPMs because they obviously want lower cost. And this is not something that I personally do, but this does help tell a story about what type of creatives are doing the best and how Facebook is rewarding those better performing creatives. But it's also just helpful to talk about in discussions with clients and same for the cost per reach. I tend to just like to look at that as like a gut check against the frequency. Another two metrics that I follow that are more like storytelling. Metrics are going to be cost per unique outbound click. I never ever optimize for this, but it is something that I look at and is more of a gut check for when I notice costs are starting to go up. It's like one of those things that I look at like our clicks getting more expensive ours or is our conversion rate going down. Now right up here, I am also tracking cost per add to cart. Now this is something that I actually used to optimize for a lot more pre iOS 14. And really this is something that I like to look at when I initially launched creative tests and looking at the ad level. And really what I'm trying to determine is are there early signs that this creative is going to perform? Are there a lot of add to carts and how are those comparing across other ads that are doing well in the core campaign for instance? Now next up, I actually have a custom metric that we added into here and you can add custom metrics by going to customize columns. And then you can add your custom metrics right here. And this one is a landing page view. And what this is showing is actually the amount of people that clicked on the CTA and then actually made it to the landing page. This is just really to help you determine if there's something wrong with your website. It's one of those metrics that I like to follow just to make sure that there's nothing incredibly wrong or to make sure that we are using like the right link or UTM or whatever. Next up, this is another custom metric that we have which is conversion rate. And this is really to determine more how things are converting on the landing page side of things. So really what this is looking at is out of the number of people who clicked on the ad, how many of those people ended up converting. So this is something that I used to evaluate not only the ad performance at the ad level, but it's also something that I look at overall. And something that I really like to track to make sure that our landing pages are doing the job that they should be doing. Now we're getting into more of the interesting creative metrics that I like to track. And really probably the most important one is VideoHook. This is another custom metric that you have to actually add inside of your ad's managers. And I will be including those formulas below so that you guys can add those yourselves because these are really important. But essentially what VideoHook is looking at, it's looking at the number of impressions that actually stayed and watched the first three seconds. of your video. This is hugely, hugely important. And we found that by adding more interesting imagery, by having more unique messaging in those first three seconds, and thereby increasing these metrics, we've been able to increase overall conversion rates on our ads, which is really important. And then same for VideoHold. This is actually looking at the number of people who have stayed on your ad for the first 15 seconds. So VideoHook is looking at the number of people who are hooked on that initial ad and that initial imagery. VideoHold is actually telling you if the following imagery and the following messaging after that initial hook is actually holding people and doing its job. So this is another storytelling metric that I really like to show to my clients to be like, hey look, we had a good hook rate on this ad, but not only that, we also had a really strong hold rate and people are actually staying on that particular asset all the way through. And we find that when we are able to do those two things, conversion rates tend to be higher, ad performance tends to be higher, and people are a lot happier. The next interesting creative metric I like to follow is post shares. And really this is just, this is not ever something that I optimize for. It's just something that I like to track to see, you know, how much free traction essentially I'm getting from my ads and how often people are sharing it themselves. This is another really cool storytelling metric to use when you're speaking with your clients. If you are running creative tests and you notice, wow, like this particular ad or asset has been shared a lot more than usual, that's definitely something that you want to talk about and talk about why that is and how you can do future iterations on that same creative. Now, next up, this is actually a metric that one of my colleagues that I work with at thesis, Ben had told me that he follows and it's something that he used from like a really big agency, which I think is interesting, which is an engagement rate. But he calls it the vanity engagement rate. And really what that is is when you are tracking the regular engagement rate on Facebook ads manager, that is including things like click, like views. But this vanity engagement rate is only tracking social proof. So things like likes, shares, comments, and then you can see there's with reactions. You can also track it without reactions. And I think that this is a really interesting thing to track because it will show you what the actual impact social proof is having on your ads. So you can look at the rate here, which is saying like, oh, out of how many impressions of someone actually leaving social proof on your ad. And then there's also that cost per engagement rate. Again, these are not metrics that you really want to optimize for, but they do help tell a story and they can help you evaluate your ad performance. And then I know that many of you are going to be like, why is Roaz all the way at the back of this? And to be honest, it's just because the majority of my clients are our subscription based clients. So we are really going after cost per purchase and that cost per initial purchase and not really looking too much at Roaz. But it is important and I do track it. So, okay, and that's it. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. If there are other metrics and KPIs that you guys are tracking that I did not listen to this video, please let me know below. But I'd really love feedback to hear what you guys think of my column setup. And if you're feeling bold, let me know what your column setup is and we can all talk about it. Okay. Thank you so much, guys. This is great. I'll see you in a few days. Bye.
