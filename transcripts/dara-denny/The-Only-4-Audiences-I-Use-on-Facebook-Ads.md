When I am running Facebook ads in 2022, 2023, I am only using four audiences. And yes, this is even for my brands that are spending up to $1 million per month on their paid social advertising. I've spent over $100 million on Facebook ads. And thesis, the brand where I work, is spending in the multiples of millions every single month on Facebook ads, TikTok ads, Google ads, all the ad buying platforms. And honestly, these are the only four audiences that we use on Facebook ads. The first one is gonna surprise none of you if you've been watching my channel and that is a completely broad audience. So this is an audience that has very broad targeting. So there might be some segments based on gender, based on age, even based on location, but there's zero audience targeting in terms of interests or look-alikes or custom audiences. So essentially, you are pointing the algorithm at all of Facebook and saying, take your best guess. And to be honest, this best guess tends to work out pretty well. And even for the brands that are really small that I do some consulting with, so brands that are spending less than 100K per month, even less than 50 or 20K per month. And here's the reason why. Facebook knows better than you who to target and where to place your ad creative. So Facebook, Instagram, real story speed. And using a broad audience is the Facebook equivalent of letting Jesus take the wheel and targeting. And it really does tend to perform the best recently. I know this tends to make a lot of brands uncomfortable and there's always a few people who are like, my brand is a lot different, or what about this use case scenario, or what if I need lots of education, or what if I have a high ticket product? And in all those cases, I still say, it's worth a try. Instead of you telling Facebook what to do, allow Facebook to just do what it does best. But I'm gonna be honest, sometimes broad audiences aren't the thing that's working best for a brand. So in that case, the next thing that I always have brands try is an interest stack. And yes, I have done a video about this before. I always stack my interests. And the reason why is because you actually want to get as many overlapping interests as possible with your target audience. It's my belief that if you have overlapping interests and people tend to have interests in those multiple things, it's actually gonna prioritize the people who have those multiple interests inside of your interest stack. So there's two different ways that I do interest stack. Number one, if it's a new brand and they hadn't really tested on Facebook before and they haven't really done audience targeting or interest targeting, then I'm gonna be creating broad avatars in that interest group. So I'm gonna be taking a look at the other brands, the other interests that our target avatar has and compiling them all into one interest stack. And a lot of times these interest stacks are going to be 20 million, 40 million, even up to 100 million or 200 million people inside of that audience. And that is preferred. You still want these interest stacks to be pretty big. And if you're wondering, huh, isn't that really similar to a broad audience? Yes it is, but more on that in a second. Now, when I start working with a new brand or start consulting with a brand, I always make sure that they've tested these three audiences. First one, completely broad, that's an easy one. Everyone needs to do it. Next one, interest stack. Number three is going to be a look-alike stack. And I really encourage people to not overthink this. If you're worried about, oh, what percentage of look-alike should I be using? Don't really think about your spend or your brand journey in this regard. So if you've spent less than 100K on ads total, then do your 1%, do your 3%. But if you spent more than 500K or more than a million, that's when I would just be going to the 5% or the 10%. And really what I'm looking for here is a stack of all of the highest event that you are going for. So if you are going after those purchases, let's do a 3% on your pixel purchases, 180 days. But let's not just stop there. Let's be sure to also get a look-alike based on your custom list export or from your clavio so that you can have a look-alike based on all the people who've ever bought from you. Then I'm also going to create a look-alike based on people who've had multiple purchases, based on the people who were my VIP customers. So maybe they've bought more than three, more than four times. And frankly, I am going to create as many possible combinations of this buyer persona as possible, and I am going to stack them into a look-alike. So ideally you're going to have anywhere from three to 10 look-alikes all based on this buyer persona. And by buyer persona, I mean based on your buyers. And I know what you're probably thinking. By stacking all these, you're really kind of diluting it. Are you? No. The reality is that even with the smallest of brands or the newest of brands, these bigger, broader audiences are really what does better post-IOS 14. You cannot target your way to success anymore on these ad platforms. However, in some ad accounts, I really do find that look-alikes tend to do better. I really do find sometimes that interests tend to do better. And sometimes, most of the time, I really find that the broad audience does better. And you're probably thinking, aren't all these audiences the same? Yes. So I have a metaphor that I like to share with my clients and the people that I consult with. When thinking about your targeting, I really like to look at broad, at interests, at look-alikes, all those different paths through a forest. So if you're going down the interest path, you're actually going to be hitting different trees or different people sooner than you would on the broad path or the look-alike path. And sometimes I find that these different pathways are really important to gaining initial traction when launching on the Facebook ads platform. And sometimes it really just means dialing in on a specific type of efficiency or better efficiency. And now I know what you're probably thinking. That's great for prospecting. What about retargeting? This is probably the most common suggestion that I give to brands that I'm consulting with, and that's to consolidate your retargeting. The reality is, is that retargeting really just is not moving the needle as much as it used to. And that's because a lot of times, your retargeting audiences are already going to be mixed inside of your prospecting audience. Yes, even if you make exclusions. I really just don't think that those exclusions are worth it anymore. The only thing you should ever be excluding now, I think is just purchases, but be sure to do a pixel purchase and a custom export list purchase, like through your Clavio, do a Clavios thing for that. But yeah, for our clients that still use retargeting campaigns, we are using a consolidated ad set for that, which means that we are stacking an audience of our Facebook engagers, our Instagram engagers, and our website visitors, I'd say up to 90 days, I guess. And having those all in one ad set and using that as our retargeting ad set. This is for brands that are even spending up to a million dollars per month on their paid social ads. Really, I try to keep it really simple now with retargeting and not overthink it, because you're not really going to get as much juice from the squeeze thinking about this particular campaign or this subset of your buyers. Really, if you guys are spending less than 100K per month on your paid social ads, frankly, even up to a quarter of a million dollars, I would probably just initially launch three campaigns. One is gonna be your retargeting campaign with your one ad set that has your stacked Facebook, Instagram, and your website visitors, and then you're gonna have another core campaign, which is gonna have your best performing ads inside of a lookalike stack, inside of an interest stack, inside of a broad stack. And your third campaign is just simply going to be your creative testing campaign, where for each new creative batch, you are going to be testing on a completely broad audience. And the idea here is, is you wanna test your creatives on broad and create creative made for broad audiences, because that's the most scalable. It's also gonna have the best likelihood to work on your lookalikes, on your interests, as well as your retargeting campaigns. You don't really wanna be creating creative that is specific to one small subset audience. It's a lot better if you think about creating the most scalable creative possible. And that's it. I'm super curious about what you guys think about this video, because normally I talk about creative, so I wanted to change it up and talk about targeting. Leave me a comment below and tell me what targeting you are using right now on your Facebook ads. And I will see you guys next week. Later, bye.
