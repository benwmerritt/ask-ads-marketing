Okay guys, listen, my microphone broke. I've moved and there's this weird echo in this room, but I just feel like I really wanna sit down and do more videos with you guys. And to be honest, I've seen some crazy ads this month. So I figured why not just like have a beer with you and look at some crazy ads together. Let's do this. Yeah, some of the ones that I saw, wild. First one, I don't know where I saw this. Honestly, going through foreplay is just like the social media feed that I always wanted, always full of great new advertising to see. And I saw this ad for bland button. I just saw the thumbnail at first and I was like. Farmer reveals how to kill all mosquitoes in the area in 60 seconds. Yeah, you know, they're doing a lead gen thing, but I wanna meet the marketer who did that thumbnail. That was great. Oh, that's really cool. Next one, Ferromonal Cargos. This is evidently lip gloss that has pheromones in it. And of course, like these advertisers don't know boundaries. They don't know their limits because when I was first looking at this, this was the one that I saw. This made my boyfriend leave his wife for me. Like, I think as advertisers and especially like the people on Twitter and YouTube who like share how to do this stuff, we've gone too far. We've shared too much of our secret sauce. But then I, you know, I went to their foreplay. Why do they call it arousal lip gloss? Catnip for men. Honestly, you gotta respect it, but you know that shit don't work. Okay, this open format actually showed up in my ad feed and I died because of that dog and that thumbnail. And the great thing here is this advertiser knew. They knew exactly what they were doing. Otis isn't just a dog. He's my child and I want him to be as well as me. That's why I trust him. Otis was like, lady, don't you have me sitting in front of this camera? Love it. All right, what else do we got? I think I'm really fascinated with this pheromone bracelet because I literally... You know what? I see that and I'm already thinking, did the lip gloss people and the bracelet people, did they get together? What's going on here? But is that Lady Gaga or is that one of those weird ad creative trends where it's like a look alike? I think that's Lady Gaga. I think that's the pheromone bracelet because I literally used it to manifest the perfect guy into my life. Oh, well that's illegal. That is, she made this. Oh my God. Okay, Bush Bomb. This is another one that I saw on foreplay. Going to be honest there. But I mean, let's... Right in your seat, girl. Hey, come back, you're my god, Vigo. Pretty face in a real nice figure. I'm gonna shoot you down, pull it over there. Also, you're gonna get sued using that sound, like you just are. But I was definitely interested because this product, the Vigetio? Anyways, interesting product. Solving a real, whoa, solving a real problem. And obviously, how are you gonna make a UGC for this? I don't know. But the mannequin approach I really liked and I especially liked the little drawing save aid. Honestly, I was impressed. Oh, I'm gonna save this one for last. Oh, speaking of the lookalikes, I did do a reel about this ad on my Instagram. So be sure to follow me at DarIdentity over there. And I also did one on TikTok. But this Alexander Wang ad like kind of blew my mind when I first saw it, right? It shows four celebrity lookalikes and the thing that kind of killed me is in the organic post, the caption is 100% authentic. So there is like a slight subtle nod, but it's kind of wild. So I made some content about this already and people were super polarized at, whether this was not ethical or whatever, or it makes it devalues the brand. Also, like Alexander Wang is like, already in hot water because of headlines like this. So it's not like they had a clean record to begin with. I kind of respect it. I've actually worked with a few brands who worked with a certain creator and we would realize, oh, this is performing Saguaro. Why, why, why? Looking to the ad comments and they're like, oh, this looks like so-and-so. This looks like the celebrity. Honestly, there should be a rule where you should have a drink before finalizing any creative. Magic mind and orgasm for your brain. Like, I only just went in seven days. They just always end up targeting me. But when I saw that, I was like, ugh. It's probably gonna work and then get disapproved. Okay, so actually it was these Oviara ads all in succession that made me want to do this video. And like, I get it. Ozenpic is, honestly, it's having its moment culturally and pop culturally. And I'm not gonna lie, like, when I see an organic supplement that claims to be nature's ozenpic, like, I'm gonna look into that. I might even double click into that. Like, it's not, like, I'm not above that kind of thing. But some of these Oviara ads, and we're gonna go looking at them from least absurd to most absurd. So the last one is absolutely the most absurd. I actually almost spit out my water when I was looking at these in four play. So, you know, first one right here, the split screen ad. Oh, you know, cute girl, whatever. You clear five primes of toxic and you're now some red. You know, you see that and you're like, wow. Didn't we just have a thing where we were like shaming the Kardashians over diet tea? Like, that's what that is. That's kind of insane. You know, and then this other split screen ad right here. And I love it, because she's holding it in front of the lemons and oranges. I mean, I guess it's, maybe it like communicates cleanliness. I don't know. Anyways, it's clogged my toilet. It's crazy. This one right here, you know, blocked up with, instead of this, just do this. Yeah, I saw that one and I was like, I don't know. P-O-V, looking in the toilet, taking over by repels. Wow, wow. This one, I actually laughed out loud when I first saw it. And it's not the best one. The best one is coming up in a moment, but I am gonna have a trigger warning. So here's your trigger warning. If you've enjoyed this video so far, like, subscribe. We're gonna do more of these crazy ad segments if you like it. But also like, you know, if you're sort of perturbed by these ads that are about something private, something personal, like these were approved. I'm just sharing them because they are crazy, but like you can leave now. Okay, but this one made me laugh and this doesn't show anything weird. So the one after this does. I mean, that ad is just, it's the bunjor that kills me. Bunjor, like I don't even read the other thing because I don't want to. I'm one of those people that's like, no, like we don't talk about it. I'm from the Midwest. It's like, it never happens. This is the one that killed me because from, you know, all appearances initially, the reason why I was like, perusing forplay, this is a brand that I track because I've worked in supplements for years. But I saw this ad initially, I was like, oh crap, I think they copied one of the ads that one of my clients made because we've done like a certain format. And then I looked at it and I was like, holy crap. And honestly, that's it. Those are the crazy ads that I have. If you liked the segment, be sure to let me know. I want to do more of these like casual reviewing ads with you guys because I think it's fun. And honestly, advertising's fun. It's the reflection of the cultural societal moment. It can be funny. It can be serious. I'd like to explore all those with you guys, but for this one, we just want to do crazy ads, right? I will see you next week. Cheers.
