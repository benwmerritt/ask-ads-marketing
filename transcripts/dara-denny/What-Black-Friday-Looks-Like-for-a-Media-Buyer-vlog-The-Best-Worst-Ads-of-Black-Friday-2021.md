So it's about 40 minutes into Black Friday 2021. And I can already tell that this year is going to be way different than last year. Number one, I had just decided about five minutes ago that I actually was going to blog today because it is going to be so much different than last year. And if you want to see what I went through last year, take a look at the video right up here. But as you can see, I'm actually winding down for the evening. I'm going to do one quick look at my accounts. I had already checked on them a few hours ago during Thanksgiving. And to be honest, everything looks pretty chill right now. I'd say that results wise, I have some clients that are doing pretty well, others that are struggling a little bit. No one is killing it right now, but also for the ones that aren't doing as well. We really anticipated that on the nature of their businesses. So like I said, I'm going to go ahead and check in on some stuff. And then I will see you guys in the morning. See you. Good morning. It's about 8am and I went ahead and checked Slack first thing. And there are no messages, which is always a good sign. And since I checked in on the accounts already yesterday and everything was pacing well, I'm going to take a bit of a slow morning, make some breakfast, make some tea. And then I have another quick something that I'm going to launch for one of my accounts that I realize would probably improve performance at the last minute. I'm going to go ahead and do that. But aside from that, I don't have any really big agenda to do task items on my list. And I do actually have a little fun errand to run later today, which I'm excited about. And I'm completely enabled to do because my team and I prepped to a well in advance for this. I will be bringing my laptop with me, though, just in case there are any emergencies. So I'm going to go ahead and get ready. And I'll see you guys in a bit. OK, just got my breakfast and I'm going to go ahead and check in on some accounts. This is what I'm eating, which is pretty much just oatmeal chia, blueberries, raspberries and a little bit of almond butter. I have this almost every single morning. It tastes really sweet, but it's actually really healthy for you. Wow. CPMs for this account went up by over 40 percent in just one day. So between Thanksgiving and today, I'm not super surprised. It's a really competitive industry, apparel and accessories. But it's still kind of crazy to see data like this. However, yesterday they had a row as of 1.3. And today they have a real as of 1.3. However, yesterday they had a row as of 1.3. And today they have a real as of a four, which is something that I'm not really used to seeing on accounts anymore these days. We're not really positioned to scale up for this client. So what I'm going to be doing for them is just giving them a really quick update about how their numbers are pacing and give them my recommendation to scale up a little bit. But I don't think they're really in the position to, which is totally fine. So I just did one client check in results are super solid. I'm actually recommending though that they maintain spend to make a proficiency for the rest of the month. I have to check in with two client accounts and then launch something really quick for one account that I spoke with you guys about yesterday. It's something I realized at the last minute that's probably going to increase efficiency for them. And it was based on some learnings from another account that I had. So I'm going to go ahead and do all of that. Hey guys, as you can see, I finally got dressed and ready. And I was actually heads down doing some work on some last minute budget adjustments that I had to do for a client. They wanted to scale up pretty rapidly, which is exciting. And the reason why I was able to do that was because I'm actually going through a client by client right now for my book of business at thesis and just giving them a really quick performance update this morning, going over their key metrics of things like ROAS or CPA, how they've been trending this week and how they're really doing today and giving them just like a really quick recommendation like, Hey, like you should stay at this budget or if there's room to scale, I'm also letting them know. And I've been doing this about every other day or this week and it's provided a lot of trust and also comfort for my clients because they know that someone is checking in on the accounts, but it's also allowed me to not be attached to my computer around the clock because I'm doing these really specific performance updates. So this is definitely something I'm going to continue to do in the years to come. But because I did one of those updates first thing this morning, I was able to communicate with the client, Hey, this is what our current budget is. And they were like, Oh, actually, like we want to be quite a bit higher. So I was ready to go ahead and make those adjustments. And it's only 11. And to be honest, I think I'm going to be pretty much done for the day. I just have to send out a few more updates and then I'm going to go to my appointment in the city. So I'm going to go ahead heads down and do the rest of that. Also, for those of you that don't follow me on Instagram, I'm doing an AMA so that I can answer these questions in this vlog. So if you don't follow me on Instagram yet, I'm going to start doing more of that kind of stuff over there. It's just my name, Darah Denney. Actually, you know what? There have been a few clients that have been messaging us being like, Yo, will this stuff look good? Let's push up. So even though I thought that today was not going to be kind of crazy, I'm like, Oh my God, there's like so many things I want to do to like improve performance or like push up budgets here. But I do actually have to leave the apartment in like an hour and a half to go to my appointment in the city. But I'll bring my laptop with me just in case there are any emergencies or anything that I want to do on the train. But like this is why I love this job because there is like a certain amount of like energy and like whatever on the state. It's a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. Okay, I'm actually going to charge this camera because I plan on vlogging with you guys for the rest of the day. And I can already see us running out of battery. That sound, by the way, is the exact sound that I think that is going to greet me when I arrive in hell. Okay, so as you can see, I am getting ready to run out the door. I have checked in on all my client accounts and given all the client updates that I was slated to do today. And honestly, things are looking pretty good and it did get a little hectic there for a while. So, but honestly, it was super fun. And I really do think that we're going to be getting awesome results for our clients. So I'm going to go step out for about two hours and go to an appointment. And I think I have a little bit of time actually, I'm going to go and do a little bit of Black Friday shopping myself. As you can see, these are like not New York City winter ready. So I need to go buy a pair of boots and I think that's what I'm going to try and take advantage of today for Black Friday. So let's go. Okay, okay, just got home and I was answering some Slack messages on the train and while I was at my appointment, nothing super big to update you guys on, but I am going to go ahead and check into all the accounts and make sure that everything is pasting okay. But otherwise, it's about 4pm and I kind of feel like my day is winding down. So I'm going to go ahead and check in and then I'll give you guys an update right after. So I wanted to do a quick segment on the best and worst Black Friday ads that I saw so far this year. And I've been tracking these for about the last day, but obviously a lot of brands this year ended up launching their offers as early as a week ago, even as early as two weeks ago. Actually, one of my brands did that and it paid off very, very well for them. And one of the things I was actually talking about with some of my clients is next year, I'm definitely going to be advising that every single one of my clients end up launching their offers early, as early as the weekend before Black Friday. And the reason why is because there is definitely a correlation with the ads and the campaigns that had more time to get learnings and get out of learning. So something that I noticed with a lot of brands this year is a ton of brands were doing ads like this Brooklyn and ad right here that pretty much just says like Black Friday sale and sometimes they included the discount, sometimes they didn't and they've included the logo. But there's really no indication of what the actual product was and I saw tons and tons of brands doing this. So obviously I saw Brooklyn and doing this, they had a number of ads that were running. I saw Sakura Light doing this. I saw Allison Olivia doing this. I saw Homesick doing this. And to be honest, I don't really love this strategy. I totally understand for brands that have a ton of brand awareness like Brooklyn and maybe even something like Casper, like those big brandy to see names. But this is not something that I would recommend for smaller businesses because to be honest, there was even a brand that I had saw this for. It was Allison Olivia and I was like, damn, I know that brand, but I don't really like remember any of their clothing items, so to speak. So for me, that was just like a total miss. And I think that something like that is only really going to work in retargeting, but not for prospecting obviously because if no one's ever been introduced to your brand before, they're not really going to be super interested in that discount. Now another ad that I really liked this year was this house ad. Now this is like very standard, what I recommended for a lot of my clients, which is to take their best performing image and either put a headline bar or a dot whack that just simply showed the actual offer. And what's kind of cool is I actually saw a number of different strategies that house was using, so they also did a little bit of a white listing right here, which I thought was pretty cool. And I know that house is a brand that doesn't traditionally do discounts, so that was one that I was definitely thinking about purchasing, but I haven't quite yet. Now this leaf ad I thought was super solid, and this is actually using another strategy that I had talked about in my video previously, which was to take your best performing asset and simply put a headline bar or a dot whack on it. And what I really liked about this ad is this is using user generated content, or at least it feels like UGC, which even though I had recommended to a lot of my clients to use images and use graphics, definitely want to do that. I thought that this was a really nice way to break up what I was seeing in the feed. I'd be super curious to know which one of their Black Friday Cyber Monday ads actually performed well, but I thought that this ad was super solid. Now another strategy that I saw quite a bit of was like this one from Wild One, which is using DPA ads and then putting the dot wax right into the dynamic product ads. I can't really tell from this particular ad if they are using a third party software to help put those dot wax right into their dynamic product ads, or they're faking the dynamic product ads. Either way, I think that this is a really solid strategy. So something I've actually been recommending to a lot of my clients recently is to invest more in carousels. And the reason why is because I've seen that there has been an uptick in performance on carousels overall, sometimes for some clients actually outperforming single images and even video. And the reason why I think that is is because when you are using carousels, you can actually optimize so that the specific video or image that shows first is going to be optimized for every single user. And if you are placing mostly on Instagram, the way that this actually shows up is it doesn't actually look like a carousel at first. It looks like a single image and it looks like a single video. So in a way, I tried to communicate this to my clients. It's almost like a hack of using dynamic creative testing, but not really. But I definitely recommended that for my clients that had a lot of single image graphics they wanted to use to also throw those into a carousel and see others performed. And those have been performing really well this year, which is awesome to see. Do you ever like see an ad out in the wild from one of your competitors and you're like, did they just copy my ad? This is an ad that I feel like they've copied from one of my clients. I'm actually going to send that to the Slack group right now and see what everyone else thinks because that's really funny. We all take inspiration from other brands, but when it's like really blatant like that, yo, that's interesting. Okay, we'll see about that. What else do I have? I have a lot more on my computer too. I try on Black Friday to take a look at not only things on mobile, so things on like Instagram and Facebook mobile, but also to look at desktop just to see if there's any different trends there. Oh, something that I've noticed recently, like with the seed ad is that lately videos that are created in like a four by five format have been optimizing really weird lately, specifically on Facebook and looking like this. So I actually recommended for a lot of my clients to only create one by one videos this year because this is just something I've been seeing for like the last month. I think it's a bug, but it's still really weird. This Santa Luisa ad is like totally fine. It's nothing that's like really weird, but I thought that the offer was like a little weird like it's Bogo, which is buy one, get one. And like the idea is like buy one, get one free, but it's buy one, get one 60% off. To be honest, it makes me think of this meme where I'm like already trying to do math in my head, which confuses me, you know, the complete opposite of the Monday Swimwear ad where I was like 50% off. I was not even thinking about buying swimwear for literally the next like two years because I literally spent like $700 at Monday Swimwear right before I moved to Mexico last year. So like I'm good, but if I see you for a percent off, I'm going to buy it. So like, you know, that's just like goes to show how much the offer really does impact the amount of sales and revenue that you're going to make on Black Friday. This early access Black Friday sale ad, I think is actually something that I'm going to also recommend my clients to not do in the future. And the reason why is because like I said earlier, I noticed that my clients that launched their ads early and got out of learning quicker actually tend to have better performance this Black Friday Cyber Monday. Now I know I've said in previous videos that like, I don't really fear learning limited. I don't really fear the learning phase, but in this post iOS 14 world, I am finding better performance out of campaigns that are a lot more consolidated and have a lot less ad sets that are in learning or learning limited. And I feel like if you're going to have an early access Black Friday sale, you're only going to be launching that for a few days and then come Black Friday, what you're going to turn it off, you're not going to let it run to Cyber Monday, which is why I would recommend figuring out a positioning and messaging that you're able to span that you're able to span from Black Friday to Cyber Monday or Cyber week or whatever. And the Stuart Whiteman ad, they got me. They got me so good that I went into Macy's on accident because I didn't realize that the 34th Street Stuart Whiteman was going to be a Macy's and like I went and bought today and like I did not get 50% off about the wrong shoe, but about the right shoe for me. So you know, it is what it is. Yeah. And here's like with a sleeper ad to like another example of like things formatting weirdly, I saw this a lot this year and I think it's cause like a lot of advertisers don't know that there is like a bug going around. So this Sunday Citizen ad, now this is a brand that I have never heard of. I think it does a good job of like explaining what the product is. Clearly I'm in its prospecting audience. So it shows like a girl with like a cozy sweater. Cool. Love sweaters. But what I actually really like about this is that they mentioned the shipping time, which it was a huge concern this year for brands and for consumers as well. So they said that every single ship's for free in two days, which I think is a huge value ad. So I think that this is going to be something that like even towards more of the holiday season or Q5, which is what they called the time period from Christmas to New Year's. This is something that I would definitely continue to highlight over the next few months and Sunday Citizen does a really good job of that. I've never heard of this brand before, but it's kind of cool. And that's like really it for now. Like I said, Black Friday is not the time where I feel like we're going to be seeing like super out of the box ad strategies. This is really a time where brands like want to play it safe, want to put the offer front and center and just like get to it. It's really like throughout the rest of the year that we're testing these big swing ad ideas and funneling all of those learnings into Black Friday Cyber Monday. So we can just have our best foot forward. But yeah, it is like... What time is it? It is 5.30 in New York. And to be honest, I'm pretty much done for the day, which is awesome. I checked in on all my accounts. Everything is pacing really well. I would say that I have about two clients right now that are absolutely killing it. And the rest of my clients are somewhere between average towards expected results, which is really awesome. And I do have one client that is struggling a bit, but because of the nature of their industry, we knew that this wasn't going to be a really big time for them. So those poor-ish results were expected. I'm still kind of a disappointment and a letdown though, because we did decide to launch an offer at the last minute and it's just kind of like, ugh, can't have everything. But yeah, so I'm actually going to be winding down for the day. I'm going to go out with some friends. I'm going to keep my phone close by. I'm probably going to bring my laptop with me just in case anything happens. But otherwise, this is the end of my Black Friday, Cyber Monday. Well, this is the end of my Black Friday. And to be honest, it was pretty enjoyable. I woke up early for my, I woke up early for me and I was able to make a healthy breakfast and do some stuff for some clients. And I did have a little bit of back and forth a little bit more than I anticipated, but it was totally fine. Not nearly as bad as it was last year. And yeah, I'm just going to get ready to enjoy my evening and continue to check on Slack, continually check on the accounts. But otherwise, this is the end. So I will see you guys next Sunday. I swear I'm going to be posting more. It's just been crazy. You know how it goes. I was preparing for Black Friday, so give a girl a break. I will see you guys later. Bye.
