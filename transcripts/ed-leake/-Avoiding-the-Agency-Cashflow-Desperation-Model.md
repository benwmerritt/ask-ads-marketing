I'm not going to dance for money. I will take money for stuff I enjoy. The problem is too many people are selling that dream, aren't they? But you just need the money, you just got to get the revenue in, you just got to grow it. Your business is starting, you do need to get money through the door even if they're on the right clients. Oh yeah, it is the cash flow desperation model. But I've already shared stuff in Forge that will get you leads super quick. One of the things Mike shared as well, if you actually apply just one thing, like the stealth lead gem thing, the productising thing, that's why I'm doing the cohort thing on the, I need to stop saying thing, productising something. Because that's a great foot in the door. That is one way to differentiate so easily, because everyone's coming at you at your prospects with, we do Google ads, we do PBC, we can do this. And you can cut to the front of the queue by saying, no, no, no, we don't need to go and commit into all that. By the way, we do this thing in the middle, that's really important, otherwise the thing at the end doesn't work. That's how you build confidence, that's how you can charge more, because you do that, you sound different. Even if your ultimate delivery is the same bloody thing, you are still... You're going to package it as the new opportunity, as Russell Brunson would say. I mean, it's a little cheesy, but it's true. Who? But the values in the eye of the behold are not the actual outcome at the end of the day. It's the perceived value over the actual value. Like for a lot of times with clients, they could get the same thing, paying someone $10 on upwork versus paying someone $1,000 as a consultant. Like sometimes realistically, it's like an 80-20 thing, but like, if that 20% is required, you're not going to get it from the $10 person. But when you need that 20%, you need it. But a lot of people, the values and the perception. And there are certain types of clients that are really sensitive to that, and it's the high communication clients. So I've always found them to be the most price sensitive. So if they're expected to be on a call regularly, if they email you a lot, they're normally the ones that are really sensitive to pricing and what you're doing for the money. The ones that are quite hands-off are normally like, look, if it's working, we're paying. That's why I like our ROWAS model. Does that make us cheap or expensive? It probably makes us expensive, quite frankly.
