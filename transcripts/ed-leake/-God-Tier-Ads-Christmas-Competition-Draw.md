Hello, I'm Ed. This is a quick video of me drawing random numbers for the God Tier Ads competition. Essentially, customers who left me a review at any point in time get added to a pot to win a thousand dollars. So just a little Christmas gift to say thank you. On with the show. So I'm going to draw three random numbers. What I've done, and I can't show you because it's got everyone's email on it. So I've put everyone's name in the spreadsheet. Anyone that left a video review, I've added them 10 times. So essentially, if you've left a review, your name or the row that corresponds to your name is the number, your entry number, essentially. So now I'm just going to go to Google. Told you this is not very exciting. And load a random number generator, which I prepared earlier. So there are just to tell you 242 rows. Is that right 242 rows. So first prize is $500. Second and third prize $250 each. And if you hear your name, I'm going to email you, but you can also email me if you beat me to it. So let's go for it. Let's click the button. Need some sound effects or something drum roll. 134. 134 row 134. Feel like I'm a bingo caller. Larry Collinac. Well done, Larry. You've won $500. Let me just write that down so I don't forget. 134. So yeah, Larry didn't want to leave a video review by the sounds of it. I think you struggled to record a video. Don't we all look at this crap, but it's just won in $500. That's brilliant. Larry, I will contact you. Okay, next number 147. Chris Taylor. Well done, Chris. You've got $250. Put that against your name. And then we've got more than 68. Luke Stocking, who also left a video review. Congratulations, Luke. $250. So that's $1,000. Oh, fuck it. It's Christmas. Let's do two more. Let's do two more. It's Christmas. So 7777. Who's 7? Desi. Desi, oh. Congratulations, Desi. You've got $250. And finally, 74. 74. Who's 74? Ross McDaniel. Another video review. So we've got two texts and three video reviews. I think. So Ross, well done. $250. So that's Larry winning the top 500. Chris Taylor, $250. Luke Stocking, who left a video review. So that's $250. So that's $250. So that's $250. So that's $250. So that's $250. Chris Taylor, $250. Luke Stocking, $250. Desi, $250. And Ross, $250. So there you go. Well done, guys. So that's a bit of a sausage fest. Sorry, girls. But I'm going to email everyone out now. And yeah, thank you for leaving the review. Even if you didn't win, it means a lot to me, even if I bribed you. So thanks again. Merry Christmas. I hope you have a wonderful holiday period, even if you don't celebrate Santa's coming. Merry, merry, happy holiday season. I hope you have a wonderful new year. Cheers.
