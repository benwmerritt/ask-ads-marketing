## Transcript
In this section of the training to illustrate the different attribution models we will look at example diagrams for each. I'm also going to give you the main pros and cons for each model, the idea being that with the previous chapters under your belt and further understanding of what models come out of the box with analytics you'll be able to use one going forwards or at the very least use one to benchmark against the default model. Or, if you're feeling really wild, I'll be showing you how to create a custom attribution model for yourself. We've already touched on a few models in the previous chapter but we've skirted around the edges a little. Let's go deeper on those last, first and non-direct last click models we've discussed but we'll also cover the more interesting linear, positional and time decay based models and of course going entirely bespoke. First up is the last non-direct click. So the last non-direct click model ignores direct traffic and attributes 100% of the conversion value to the last channel that the customer clicked through before buying or converting. And remember that Google Analytics uses this model by default when attributing conversion value in non-multi-channel funnel reports. This model is similar to last click except for cases when the last click is in fact a direct visit. In which case this model finds the latest click that isn't a direct visit and attributes 100% of the revenue to that channel instead. If the previous visit was also direct it keeps going until it finds a different channel source. The rationale behind this model is that once a visitor comes directly to your website they've already made the decision to buy from you. Therefore the cause of that purchase is not the direct visit itself but the one that preempted the direct visit. So pros and cons because the last non-direct click model is the default model, it's familiar territory and it provides a useful benchmark to compare your results with other models. If you consider direct traffic to be from customers who have already been won over through a different channel then you may wish to focus on the last marketing channel before conversion. The cons is that it's biased and imprecise, you're discounting the value of all other touchpoints in the customer journey. The last non-direct visit will receive all the credit. It ignores brand value and recognition that's built typically earlier in the customer journey and over time. And you also have to ask why under value direct traffic to the point that you're saying it's worthless. And as I've mentioned several times now a big caveat to be aware of is this model is also the irritating reason why none of your standard Google Analytics reports match your multi-channel funnel reports. It's not a tracking fault, it's a conflicting model in the default setup. Yep, that's irritating. Last click is commonly used in Analytics and one of the most inaccurate models too. Yay! The last click model assigns 100% of revenue generated to the last converting touchpoint. It does the same for any conversion not just transactions. It's not very exciting and the pros and cons are quite straightforward really. It's familiar, it's simple to set up, it works for marketers who are solely focused on driving conversions and if non-converting actions hold little to no value at all for your business then a last touch model can be effective when it comes to an attribution strategy. Against last click is that it completely ignores influencers on the path to conversion. It means that direct traffic gets most of the fame in essence and it reduces the value of other channels and essentially blinds you to their worth and their value. If your conversion paths are very short i.e. most people convert on first touch which let's face it's quite rare then you could argue that the case is there for last click but the emphasis should be you could argue not that you should. First click, a bit like last click but in reverse or upside down which way you look at it it's the polar opposite. 100% of the conversion value goes to the very first visit to your website prior to any conversion. This is like nominating a band your favourite of all time after hearing their first ever b side track. It's a bit ridiculous really. At least with last click attribution there is a level of certainty that something about that campaign, that website visit, resulted in a conversion. With first click however you just have a gut feel. Now in favour is it simplicity, again similar to last click, it's simple. It assumes that if someone has ever heard of you their first click is therefore their driver to eventually converting even if that happens to be a long way down the road. It's perfect if you only ever did one campaign ever but that again that's a weird world for most people. So the cons are similar issues with last click in that it completely ignores other influences along the path to conversion. And first click assumes that your marketing should focus on driving that first touch when in reality the consumer journey is much more complex. It reduces the value of other channels. It's hard to optimise without the ability to determine what ultimately drove the conversion. You will have a hard time justifying the impact to your company's bottom line. Now here's a weird one, the last ad words click model which attributes 100% of the conversion value to the most recent ad words ad that the customer clicked before converting. Come on Google what the hell is this? In all seriousness there are no real pros and cons here. This is not a model that you would use day to day. There is one key reason for this model to exist and that's to isolate your Google paid search to identify and credit the ad words ad that close the most conversions. Consider it an extra layer of ad words diagnosis. But even then even then you have the ad words type option in the model report which is it arguably does a better job than the last ad word click report anyway.
