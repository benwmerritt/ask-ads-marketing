Time-based segments are super simple and are like wildfire for conversions. That's because your best visitors are the busiest browsers. My favourite is a simple 4 or 5 minute and upwards segment deployed as an RLSA audience with a strong bid modifier and by strong I mean a up to a 50 or even a 100% bid increase. Let's create the segment and apply it. Then you can see the conversion rate and average order differences and so on in your own account. So we already used this segment so I'm just going to copy one that we've made earlier and then preview it so if you burn me a second. I'm just going to do the 4 minute and upwards here. Let's drop down to channels to compare the headline metrics such as conversion rates and so on. You can see the contrast between the site average of 4.8% and the average of this segment which is 22.5% and also this segment of 4 minutes up is just 17% of all traffic but 82% of revenue which is pretty cool. So it might sound simple but sometimes the simple ideas are the best and yet ironically the ones that are often missed. So let's just do this one roll down. It's an easy win.
