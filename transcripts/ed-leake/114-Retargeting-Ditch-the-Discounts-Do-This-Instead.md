Ditch the discounts. Do this instead. So it annoys me that so many retailers default to just discounting, they're literally throwing money down the toilet. Don't be like them and don't assume that you have to give everything or anything away or slap a discount code on something so people come back to you and buy. Using the distracted buyers audience, aka checkout abandoners, you can test an alternative idea. So we created this segment a couple of videos back, people who left your checkout, but now we can create a specific campaign for this audience. One that takes people back to your site but to a more pertinent page such as your customer services area. Be sure to include the person's last viewed items on those pages that you send people to. So using your knowledge of why people do and don't purchase, think about customer service phone and email conversations. Create an advert and specific customer focused call out and cycling extensions that support the purchase and reflect your discussions and conversations that you've had with customers in the past. What do I mean by this exactly? Well, here's a bad example. Sorry Hugo Boss. I was looking for a jacket, a men's jacket and happened to find myself on Hugo Boss's website. I spent some time on there and this is what I get when I search for Hugo Boss again, a generic brand ad. You can do way better than that. Instead think delivery options, return and warranties, a store finder if you have a physical store, adding value including your content. You might have a buyer's guide or a fitting guide or a comparison guide or whatever it may be. Showcase your differentiator. It also helps to show your phone number, your opening hours and you know what? If you've got a live chat, I rarely see this but you can suggest that in the advert. Chat was really simple but sometimes the human touch goes a long way. Here's an idea I put together for Hugo Boss. Because I'm not an elegant woman, the previous branded ad didn't work for me. I'm a man looking at jackets. I didn't change the top ad, I just created these four sight links to give you a bit of inspiration. I've made some assumptions here for the example but it's a premium brand so perhaps people ask about fabrics and fit. They might also want to try the item on in the store for that personal touch or failing that they might want to discuss their purchase. Again, premium products often warrant some more personal service which can be lost to a certain degree online. Hopefully that gives you a bit of idea, especially if you sell clothing. Now I did find a real example that is better and it's Harley Davidson. So Harley's pretty good, schedule a test drive, find a store, look at payment options. Heck, they even offer classes to ride the bloody thing. That's pretty cool. Ticking lots of boxes here and look, no special offers or discounts needed. It's all about reassurance and answering any questions that potential customers have. Because these questions left unanswered will turn into doubt and make buyers stumble at that last moment. That's critical to your bottom line, the checkout. I was trying to find more good examples but the sad thing is, aside from Harley Davidson and my sort of Hugo Boss mock-up, there aren't really many out there. That means there's a big opportunity for you and your business. I also wonder how many of your competitors are not doing this type of ad. So don't click their ads please. Just visit their websites today, look around and search for them again tomorrow. How are they retargeting you? It's an easy and effective tactic. Put the customer first when retargeting them. Don't just ram discounts down their throats. They'll thank you and your bottom line will thank you.
