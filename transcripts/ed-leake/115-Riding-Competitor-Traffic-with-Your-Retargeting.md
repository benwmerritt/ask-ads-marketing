## Transcript
Riding on your competitor's coattails can be quite fun and it's one area that I'd advocate being a little more free and easy with your audience. You create a remarketing campaign for Google search for this, where your ads are shown to anyone who previously visited your website but who are now searching for a competitor's brand or product. Because you know these people have been to your website already, you can even just use broad match keywords for your competitors to target them. So it's very loose and yes your quality scores will be rubbish but these people are aware of you and they're still in shopping mode so I think it's worth and from my experience I know it's worth going broad on your competitor keywords. You can use similar techniques in your ads as the previous example but tailored to your competitor's products instead if you so wish. You can go a step further, you can actually create granular campaigns with adverts and specific landing pages focused on each of your main competitors. You could even do a product comparison page specific to that particular competitor. Just make sure it's not libelous and it's all above board. Yes that's cheeky perhaps but that's also a really potent tactic.
