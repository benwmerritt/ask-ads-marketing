Email open reinforcement. If you're running on online stores, there's a good chance you're sending promotional emails. Well wouldn't it be a good idea to reinforce the email message that you send with a few well placed bang on target display ads? You bet. Before your next big promotional email, jump across to AdWords and create a specific remarketing list for your email. So you copy out the image portion of the code and then you make sure that you place that in your email source code before you send it. So this is kind of stepping away from analytics a little bit but I really like this tactic so I'm going to make an exception or two here. So here's how to do it. You jump into your AdWords account and then let's head over to shared library and we view audiences. Then create a new remarketing list from your website visitors. Then who to add to your list is visitors of a page with a specific tag. Then create a new tag and give it whatever name you see fit. On the next screen scroll through the tag code and grab the image HTML as highlighted here and that's it. Now you're ready. Let's say you're launching a new product or product line. While on opening your email, your newsletter subscriber would trigger the tracking code and then you can show the corresponding ad that showcases this new product and support the email content that you're sending. Clever stuff and again it's pretty simple to do. It just means an extra line of code in your email. You can of course include your retargeting pixel code from say Facebook and other platforms that you use. So you can extend again beyond Google. Oh and I love my caveats don't I? Well here's another. As far as I'm aware this tactic only works with people on browser based emails, not desktop applications such as Microsoft Outlook. Without getting too technical it's because the remarketing code wants to drop a cookie on your browser and Outlook whilst it can render the HTML content in the email it's not a web browser. That said you will still find a good portion of your email openers on webmail particularly when using their mobile devices. So this can work well and it can really extend your promotional email efforts.
