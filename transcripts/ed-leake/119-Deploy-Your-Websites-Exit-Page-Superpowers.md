Okay, time to deploy your exit page superpowers. This tactic considers why someone might be abandoning your checkout and enables you to position your message appropriately. Let's head over to analytics to see what's happening here. We can use the behavior reports to see the second step at the basket and checkout pages, but also refine this report with the system segment of non-converters. Let's apply that now. Now we can search by basket or cart and the checkout pages. So whatever your page URLs are, you can search for them here. There are two secondary dimension options that make sense here. So we've got exit page and second page. When we apply these, what we're looking for is a pattern of people who don't convert and who are leaving or worse getting stuck on a certain page. In other words, what detour did they take on your website instead of converting? What we'll see here is people looking at your delivery pages and also ditching you at registration pages instead of checking out. This is never going to be a large audience, I hope, because that would suggest that there's something really wrong with your checkout, but it's going to be a highly specific list of people who got very close to making a purchase. Once you identify the pattern, you can create an audience to suit. You can use page sequences here, but for now, let's keep it simple with a condition of page contains and I'm going to use delivery with no transactions. So this is essentially all those people that got to the checkout delivery page and didn't check out because there's no transaction assigned to them. So remarketing lists, targeting the Google Display Network must have a minimum of 100 active visitors or users within the last 30 days for your ads to be shown. In the example here, we've got enough, which is good. Now the deal clincher. You will know from your customers what pain they have with this page topic. Here we're talking delivery. Is it the cost, speed or specific requirements such as a delivery for a certain time of the day? This is one of the key times I would consider giving a discount, a free shipping discount in this example, not a discount on the total order value. Your advert then should highlight the solution, be it a same day dispatch, 24 hour recorded delivery weekend delivery or delivered at a specific time, whatever it may be, get this right. And it's a superpower. It not only brings the back lost customers, but converts them exceptionally well to just fixes that little tweak that they had in their head before converting.
