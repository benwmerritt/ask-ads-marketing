Your site search supercharges sales, that's a bit of a tongue twister. People who search for something are three to four times more likely to make a purchase from you. That means those who visit your website do a search but don't check out, make a strong case for being retargeted the product or brand they were looking to buy. In order for this to work and be less labour intensive for you, combine this audience with dynamic ads. Now dynamic remarking enables you to show previous visitors ads that contain products that they viewed on your website. It uses your shopping feed to create those ads. You might need the assistance of your developer or your ad agency to ensure you have the right code on your site. A quick Google search and you'll find instructions to give them or at least for them to check and verify your site is tagged correctly for DSA. Now with that in place and all working, we create a custom segment with the following two parameters. Firstly, under advanced and conditions we want to use the transaction of zero to exclude people who've purchased already. And then there's a second step which is the site search status. That's another tongue twister. The site search status is visits with site search. That will give you a percentage of users and sessions as seen here. Now if you consider on the site people who search convert at 11% and spend more to then we've got a potential thousand or so sales sat waiting to be nurtured back to the site. That's pretty cool. And in my experience, dynamic remarking ads on their own are a bit hit and miss. However, when you layer them with this audience who have searched, they become super charged. Just be sure to keep your feeds up to date so your out of stock products don't show. After all, that might have been the reason why they searched and left your website in the first place.
