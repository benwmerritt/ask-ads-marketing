Double tap re-engagement aka We miss you or alternatively the Do you miss us advert and email combo. It's likely you have old visitors with no recent activity who are still crooked and perhaps you have their email addresses too. This is where a double tap re-engagement plan comes into play. So you fire off your promotional email and you target them with supporting adverts at the same time. You can approach this with re-targeting in a number of different ways. You can simply create a segment of all visitors in analytics and then exclude those that did visit in the past say 50 days or whatever you would consider to be a long enough time for them to be disengaged. You can create an audience inside adverts for people who visited between before or after a specific date. You can also create a segment using the days since last visit metric with inside analytics and you can then send it over to AdWords or you can just upload your unengaged email list to Google and Facebook. Other platforms are available using those audiences that you've uploaded. Sorry those emails that you've uploaded to create an audience for re-targeting your message in combination with the email that you will be sending. So let's look at a good example. Pinkberry were trying to bring back loyalty card users who have gone quiet. They sent this very simple We Miss You email. Now here's what makes the Pinkberry example really effective. It's got a great visual. I mean I want to eat some of that. I've never had it. In fact I don't even know if I've ever had frozen yogurt. Anyway it's short, it's concise and the copy gets to the point which is good. There's no nonsense call to action. You don't need to enter a discount code. You don't need to print anything. You don't even need to show it to anyone. You just rock up to the store and you grab your ice cream. Yogurt sorry. And the reward expires in a week so there's a sense of urgency too. Simple, simple, simple. But they could have improved this another step by using the double tap method. So they got the first step right. Brilliant email gets to the point but they didn't support it with the retargeting so they could have extended the life of this and improved it considerably. Now remember this segment of your audience has been quiet for some time so you might need to give them a nudge with a reminder email too so resending to people that didn't open it essentially. Other ideas that you could use to get them back. Perhaps you could run a competition giving away either your products or branded merchandise. A flash sale, yes a discount but for end of life products so to shift old stock. In reverse of that offer exclusive early access to a new line of products or ask them if they prefer to hear from you on social media. So essentially you're sending an email not to sell anything. You're just trying to reposition how they communicate and you communicate with them so you get them to opt into their favorite social media channel. And if you have a loyalty or referral scheme invite them in and entice them with a free B or an upsell. Give them a bit of an incentive. This tactic can breathe new life into old subscribers and it helps you remind them of why they bought from you in the first place. So give it a try. Go for the double tap.
