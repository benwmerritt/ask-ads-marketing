## Transcript
Hey, it's Ashwin and Ed. Welcome to another episode. This time, number five of over budget. Today's guest is Chris Cabanas. He's the co-founder of Falcon Digital Marketing and the online advertising academy. He's also a contributor to Search Engine Land and quite a prolific poster on LinkedIn. Great follow if you haven't already done that. Chris is here to talk to us today about the gen advertising and how to feed good data back into the system. How to make sure that you're using all the data at your disposal to show Google Ads what a good lead looks like for you, for your business so that you can minimize the amount of junk that comes through. So there's a bunch of stuff that he's going to be talking to us about and also a couple of things that he's going to be showing us. I hope you enjoy today's episode. Chris, welcome to the show. Thank you for coming on and I'm super excited to have you on as a career Legion marketer myself. Yeah, thanks for having me on. I really appreciate it. I'm excited to share some of this. It was originally inspired by Ed actually, just a conversation a while back just kind of, hey, this is where your agency should be going. This is where it's going with AI and automation and just, maybe that must have been a year ago, but kind of took that and ran with it as a bunch of agency owners and career PPC professionals, you know, people that are 15, 20 years of experience. The conversation came up there in a group and we were just saying, like, yeah, this, we really need to go this direction. So I went all in with my agency, with my agency on this and now it's just like, okay, this is what we have to do moving forward. Just running ads isn't enough. Kind of like the landing page thing at first like, oh, we're going to charge for it and upsells like, no, no, no, you have to build landing pages if you're running PPC services. So now it's like, I think you have to, and a lot of people in the industry think you have to track all the lead quality and feed it back into all this automated bidding, or you're going to feed it hundreds of calls of job seekers and spams and solicitors and Google's getting bad data and it's going to get you more of that or Facebook or whatever. So you have to feed the algorithm to make this automated stuff work. And it was probably over a year ago, Chris. So Chris has been on the channel before, but this is the official podcast, Chris. So you've been promoted. Yeah. Number five, episode five. Yeah, it's the same really good content. Just keep rebranding it and redoing it, you know, Ed's the go-to and whatever his current project is. It's like, yeah, I'm all about that. Now we got the podcast that's going up and following the YouTube, your other communities for a while. Yeah, and just keep on, keep contributing to the community. Yeah, you made a really good point, Chris, about the scope of Google ads changing and how this is becoming something that's that's part of the work that Google ads specialists and paid media specialists do. A lot of people talk about, OK, we need to feed data back in and stuff like that, but not enough people get into the specifics of how that works. So I know you've got a couple of slides and you have a couple of things you want to talk about. So let's start with your recommendations. What are the tactical application based recommendations that you have for anybody who's doing Legion Google ads? You're an actual show and tell on a podcast. This is going to be amazing for the non podcast podcast listeners. OK, so I have this chart here that chat GPT graphics made, not a graphics person. So anyone listening, it just has three steps. And this is on our website. It's extremely simple to pitch to potential clients, existing clients or just a summary. You know, now ad agencies, it's one, ad management, two, lead tracking, which I have broken down into call tracking and form tracking. And then three, lead quality and profit trafficking from the ads. And that all that all circles back. I'll probably draw an arrow on this later for the graphics. But you you run the ads, you track all the leads, and then you track the lead quality and then feed it all the way back to the ads. So that's my super fancy graph there. But I think that's the shift now where before you used to run ads and you do the conversion tracking or pixel tracking, that was a standard. But that's that's kind of where it ended. And then call tracking was well, it's not that new. But I mean, I've been in it for 16 years. So I don't know, maybe that's eight or nine years old. You just track, did you get a call or Google had one and there's there's third party one now it's you have to track the quality because it's it's bombarded with job seekers and spam calls and solicitations and two second calls that are instant hang ups. I don't know if those are bots, but now you have you have so much feeding back into the algorithm. You can't have it go and get more of those. You get you get 10, two second calls in one day. Google said, oh, this is good. Put more money into that search term or put more money into search partners. It's great. Look at all these phone calls. But if you go back and say, well, these are instant hang ups or these are the wrong company, you have to track that lead quality and feed it back into. You know, Google ads, meta ads, I almost said Facebook ads. It's been doing it too long. Microsoft ads or Bing ads in old school, what we call it, you, you have to feed it back into so much as shifting to automated bidding. It's like, well, what were the leads good or bad? You have to tell the system because it doesn't know. Can I ask what tools you I mean, this is no, obviously any any tools we mentioned were not affiliated with or anything. But what are you using to track these things? Are you what converts, for example, or. That's a good one. I mean, we go high level is a really easy one. Kind of industry standard. I I actually like call tracking metrics better than their call tracking that's built in. That's just kind of a preference. We've used that forever. Some people like call rail and there's 10 other variations of it. You just need something that can track the calls and connect back to Google analytics, Google ads, Facebook, Microsoft ads. They have the import the offline conversion. So most of that will natively integrate or you can do a Zapier to connect it. Or some of them we had to hire an API programmer. They just wouldn't connect. So we manually did something to go all the way to a CRM of some form of call tracking saying, OK, we need a good call, which I'll get to what's a good call. It's marked as a good call in one system. We need to go all the way back to Google analytics, Google ads. Meta, whatever that takes. Some of them you click it's connected. Like I said, the other one we had to hire an API programmer is a huge hassle. But we need that good qualified lead to go back into the ad system. So it understands. And that that's the ultimate purpose of all of this is to to feed the good leads into Google ads. So you know where to put your money, which is now more and more of the optimization is not being over finicky about all the little details and actually getting quality data in your first party data and getting budget into what drives those quality leads. That's a much bigger lever than fiddling around for weeks on end inside the ad to count. Unless the ad to count crap, I always have to copy that. If you copy out that, if you've got a really bad ad account, then tweak it. But if you if it's stable and doing its job, this is the next level. You've got a bolt on on top. Yeah, definitely. And this is coming up more and more of the industry. I mean, we originally talked about a year ago, other agencies talking about it. I think this is what and this is where. You know, Google pushes a lot of garbage that doesn't make any sense. And and and Meta and Microsoft are following suit. They have reps now that call you, which everyone's really excited about and pushing the same crap. And it's like, you know, if if you can take their suggestions, but put common sense and third party tracking and all these all this other stuff on top of it, you know, for example, automated bidding with Broadmatch, if you're doing all of this, we have seen it work very well. And the CPA is much lower. The CPC is much lower if you do all of this. If you do it straight out of the box with Google, you know, automated bidding, Broadmatch and their basic conversion tracking, it'll run it into the ground. But if you're tracking minimum call length or you make your form a lot longer or your CRM is feeding bad lead, good lead or sorry, only good lead back into Google, then yes, that can work. So so Google is pushing that anyway. But as PPC professionals, we always have to come back and say, OK, I'm going to take Google's suggestion, but modify it a bunch with guardrails and our own customization and common sense. And then yes, I'll do some Broadmatch. And just again, just for because obviously there's lots of different levels of experience that listen to these videos. Just for clarification, that data coming back in, that good data, it's marked as a conversion, isn't it? So you're you're essentially are you still tracking the original Google ads conversion of a form fill a call and you're you're adding this qualified lead on top? Or are you only now bidding against the qualified lead? I guess it depends on the size of the account. It depends with with calls. It's a standard. We make them a minimum and that depends on the industry. I mean, a lot of companies will say, oh, a 10 minute call. It's like not necessarily. I mean, you could do one minute. You can do two minutes. You know, we work with a lot of home services. You could book a plumber in two minutes. It's you know, this thing's broken. Can you be here today? Yes, we'll see it too. I mean, you just want some kind of threshold. Say, you know, if a call is under two minutes, don't even track it as a conversion at all. And Google has that built in their calls from ads. Their default actually has a time on it. You could put it it's in seconds. So 60 60 seconds, 120 seconds. And then you're using call tracking. Do the same thing, say two minutes or don't even count it in the Google dashboard at all. Yeah. And again, caveat that. Listen to your own call logs and see how long your minimum should be. Because there are some people like me who are really impatient and bring up and go, can you do this? How much tomorrow? Goodbye. Yeah. And qualified lead. But I don't like to sit on the phone for two more. Yeah, I'll usually do one minute as a minimum. So that'll kind of, you know, are you hiring right now? Or, you know, just a total spam bot call. Those are five and 10 seconds. So it's like, OK, let's just say one minute. So we at least get rid of the worst of the worst so we're not feeding the algorithm, you know, bad data. Not a lot of good can happen in under a minute. Well, there are exceptions. I mean, again, going back to dating, but moving on. Ashwin, you've got some actual questions that I've interrupted. I wanted to touch on one thing. You know, Chris used the word hassle to describe like Regan and API developer to do the initial legwork. I know business owners, CMOs, people leading marketing teams for businesses and brands. You might be listening to this or you might even just experience that firsthand. And you might say, oh, we'll just take the shortcut. We'll do Google ads and we'll manage without it. I can tell you as somebody who has led marketing teams and who's made the mistake of saying, well, let's just take the shortcut. It's not going to work for you. And this was like two and a half, three years ago, a year from now. Today, it just it doesn't fly. So if you think bringing an API developer, doing all the work to set up the connection between Google ads and your CRM, whatever other database, if you think that's a hassle, wait until you burn thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of dollars on Google ads. And it just keeps bringing you more spam, more junk and thinks that it's doing a good job. And then on top of that, as it brings this junk in, not only are you burning cash, you're setting the account up for long term failure because you're teaching Google that this is what works. And then Google's out thinking it's doing a good job for you. The amount of work you then have to do to undo that teaching and learning is even more painful than many times you can't undo it. Yeah, that's a really good point that for example, you set up a conversion incorrectly and every single click that comes through is classed as a conversion, a primary conversion. Then you're essentially telling that accounts, building a foundation on on noise and nonsense. And it's true for leads as well. It's like not every lead is a lead. And if you've got a particularly busy account, you get hundreds of leads conversions a month, then if you're only converting 20% of them and only a third of them are actually qualified, all that other data is false signal to the bidding system. And also the API thing, Ashwin, I built a not specifically for Google ads, but I used Manus. Again, I'm not affiliated at the AI tool to program a mini connector between two APIs and it worked. So you might not even want to do people out of a job. You might even be able to use AI to do that work that Chris previously had to hire for and isn't dealing with people so painful. Why don't you just log on to an AI and ask that to do it? There's no HR, run it 24 seven doesn't get sick. But yeah, you can theoretically start today and be done by the end of the week. It took me two hours. Literally, I had the thought and I got it done and it isn't Google ads related, but it is API and it works. And it's just like, wow, I would have been on Fiverr for a week trying to find the right person to do that. Yeah. Scary. And and noise, you know, speaking of signal and noise, I can't believe we have to see this in 2025. And I'm talking to business owners and it shouldn't involve CMOs, but talking to business owners who don't know better, but also unscrupulous media agencies. If you're using conversions like page views and button clicks, you're just. I don't know, like you don't have the future and Google ads, not a successful one. You know, so like in addition to tracking the right types of leads, like make sure fundamentally your conversion actions are things that actually matter to the business that shows some kind of interest. Yeah. And I still see that auditing accounts. You say viewed the contact us page. It's like that's not a lead or get directions, which is the default that Google will throw in there. If you do smart campaigns, which just for being there, it's just don't ever do a smart campaign. It's garbage. It has pretty much no controls. If you're going to do five bucks a day and never look at it, a very, very small local shop, that's fine. It's better than absolutely nothing. But anything beyond that, just don't do a smart campaign because that's one of the one it defaults get directions. It's counted and we see people, they'll count all of it and say, well, look, we got 50 conversions. It's like, well, 49 of those are get directions and you're, you know, a plumber. Are people really showing up to your shop? It's no, that doesn't even make sense. That doesn't sound real that people click get directions to somewhere without a physical location or not one that serves clients. And you know, it's just an address. Remember to smile.

Beginner to and veterans people, you know, with brand new accounts. It's like, well, how do I, how do I train it? How do I get into it? This just came up the other day. I, I still think for brand new accounts to manual bidding at first. Google's advice, one of the only things I agree with probably their documentation. It's usually 30 conversions and 30 days to make the automation work. You can start automated bidding immediately if it's a much older account. You know, it's, it's a couple of years old and you're launching a new campaign. But I still think brand new out of the gate, small, medium budget. You just don't have enough money to burn through a couple of thousand dollars to help Google learn. You can launch with manual bidding and manually train the algorithm, kind of this bid works, this keyword, kind of move it up and down and change it. And then later, you know, maybe two months, maybe six months with phrase and exact match with manual bidding, you're going to train it because it does need a ton of conversions for automation to work. If you're a really small shop with 10 or 15 conversions a month, maximize conversions won't work. It will, it will take a really long time and it will burn your budget. Most small and medium companies, $2,000 with zero conversions. They can't say, Oh, well, the algorithm's just learning. Let's give it a few more months. They already paused it. They shut it down. They said Google ads doesn't work agency or freelancer. You're fired in house team. Turn off Google. It doesn't work. So I just wanted to put that there's a little bit separate from it, just from the bidding, I think you can go manual for a while before you can really for small and mid-sized budgets, you know, a thousand to 3000 a month kind of thing. Agreed. You don't have enough money. Like, yeah, agreed. Still start on manual. There's nothing wrong with manual just to send, you know, get your foundation and get your footing and the 30 and 30 days, it does depend on industry. But it's a little flexible. Yeah, but yeah, it can work on 15, 15 conversions. It gets very spot. It depends again, this is the problem. It depends. It depends how spotty those conversions are. If you've got five campaigns on a small budget and one of them gets a conversion a month, that's where you create your problem for yourself. You're better off focusing on the campaign that's converting, sticking all your budget in that and just getting a better conversion value out of that one and just prioritizing it and it might be a certain region, it might be a certain service. And I know some businesses don't like that because they're like, well, I do these three things and I want all three things like, well, okay, but if we can maximize that one service first in this area, it's still business. Is that all right? And it's like, yeah, but I'm missing out on business in that area. It's like, well, okay, but you don't have the budget. So you have to have the budget. Yeah. I think that's where Google breaks, you know, and their advice and the account or the advice from Google reps is kind of, hey, you have a thousand dollars a month. The average cost per click is $10. Yeah, that will definitely work. Just launch a brand new campaign, maximize conversions and the algorithm will figure it out. It's like it most likely won't. It will spend about $1,000, get one or two conversions, maybe. And then this whole system breaks. It's like, okay, check all your calls and then go to your CRM and use an API. It's like, there's not even enough data to do anything with that. You're not going to analyze two or three leads. So I just wanted to preface that and some of them, I have it in some later slides, but if you're a very small shop, just bring it down to Excel. Look at your 10 leads. Were they good or were they bad? Where did they come from? And you can manually look at it. When you're feeding in APIs and algorithms and all that, we're talking at least $5,000 a month. If not, we get into $30,000, $50,000 a month. This is all automated. It's feeding algorithms for people that are in-house or freelancer or running it yourself. And you've got $500. You'll have to do it manually and just look at one thing to another. Sorry, but none of this really applies. Look at your CRM and listen to your phone calls manually, and then eventually you could work up to all this automated data and AI stuff. And your CRM could be a spreadsheet. It could be as simple as a Zapier pulling in the data and you literally have a drop down of good or bad, and that gets sent back to Google Ads as offline data. Don't overthink it unless you're spending a lot of money. A sheet is okay. If you do it once a week, checking a sheet, and it takes you five minutes to to say if it's a qualified lead or not, that's a good enough CRM to improve your performance. Yeah, I just wanted to say that for small budgets. You could do a lot of this manually, and that's fine too. Larger budgets, yeah. This is where you can test BroadMatch and test different related terms in a different test campaign or BroadMatch. Now it takes into consideration the other keywords in the same ad group to help kind of keep it in check a little bit more. It still shows for some random stuff, but the newer things supposedly looks at intent and past searches and other keywords that are in the ad group to kind of put some guardrails on there. It's still not the best, but you can with larger budgets say, okay, let's do maximize conversions or target CPA. Let's try a handful of BroadMatch, see what comes back, and then that's when you go look at your calls, the length of them, how many changed or the forms coming in, how many of them are good or bad leads. That's when it's say, okay, I will test what Google says. Can't believe I said that, but sometimes you're forced to. I think a lot of this stuff will just keep changing and changing, and you have to figure out how to make automation and all this AI stuff work. You can't just say, no, I'm doing manual bidding and scags, which are single keyword ad groups. They're dead. Don't ever use them, by the way. You can't just stick to that and not adjust. You're forced to. And one thing as well, speaking of trusting Google, not implicitly, but and touching on this with setup and bidding, if you get a sufficient amount of data where Google has a level of confidence about you moving to smart bidding from manual bidding, automated bidding, whatever you want to call it from manual, it will actually bring that up as a recommendation and it will give you a suggested target cost per conversion because we're talking about local service. So it will tell you when it thinks it's ready and also what it thinks it can achieve. And that suggestion is probably one of the better ones that Google gives you because it's normally about in the ballpark. And I've seen that in smaller accounts where you're like, I'm never, I can't use automated bidding. But Google will literally say, you know what, I can do it for this account. But again, you've got to make sure that conversion data is solid for it to work. But that is one recommendation that's actually quite useful for a young or a smaller account to take it to the next level away from manual bidding. Yeah, which I'm glad they put that in there because 90 percent of them you hit dismiss. That one, it'll say, you know, you should switch to a maximized conversion with the target CPA of $47. It's like, well, that's very specific. And you look at it, it's like my average is about 40 to 50. It's like, okay, you know what I will. And it gives you that, you know, don't do $5. Don't do no target CPA. Don't do a hundred. It's like, we think we can get 47 or some very specific number. And you put that and it does. So that's actually a very good Google pop up. One of the few that's like you said, it'll tell you when you're ready to switch, which ironically switching, you have to start the campaign and set it all up as paused and then go back in the settings. During the setup, it forces you to maximize conversions, maximize clicks. And then you have to later change the settings, which I still say do because maximize conversions with no data doesn't make any sense. Let's go. So, oh, going into non-search. Again, there's no graphs on the chart or anything. I'm just reading off with keep me in check. So when you're, when you want to look at, should I test display or YouTube performance max demand gen, I think with a larger budget, you can go beyond the most obvious bottom of the funnel keywords. I think you're going to really max out your search for a while with going with very specific terms, bottom of the funnel, and then maybe middle and top of the funnel broader terms. And then I think this is a much later choice where you're like, okay, I'm going to do some YouTube now or something like that. And with these, it's critical, especially with performance max to, you know, set the minimum call length two or three minutes or something like that and then evaluate all the forms, everything that's coming through or if it's SAS, you know, how many free trials actually upgrade and don't just disappear or how many demos from a sales person turn into a sale evaluating all the lead quality, then yeah, we run tons of display in YouTube. I'd say those occasionally performance max into mansion, but yeah, tons of them in market audiences, custom audiences, they work great with automated bidding with feeding all the data back into it for lead quality. We have plenty of display in YouTube that get tons of great leads expanding beyond search. Just pause that for a second. Yeah. And my chickens are going fucking mental. He means actual chickens. Oh yeah, I think it's all picture. I like what you, I don't disagree with the idea of using page search to address some of those upper funnel and middle funnel searches and queries. I know when we talk about the gen, we tend to focus more on like the services and stuff like that, but the gen being such a broad category or bucket, you know, if you're doing something like SAS where there's a lot of informational search or even where there's overlap with DIY stuff, like if you do really high end audio setups, there's a lot of people looking for how to do their own type of audio setup, right? Like a home studio, whatever it might be. You want to make sure that you're very clear about not just the intent, but even the conversion that come through. You don't want people downloading an ebook or a resource to get fed back in as yeah, that's the type of action that we want, just because there's absolutely no correlation between whether somebody wants an ebook and whether they want to subscribe to your service or hire you for a high end service or whatever else it is. So that's one thing that I would caveat if you are doing some of the upper funnel stuff, like really be dialed into search intent, whether it's informational, whether there's any like scope for a transactional event in the future, because many times it will just be informational and over there. But if you're tracking enough in your CRM or whatever database, you should be able to find those leads that eventually did go on to become, you know, have some monetary value. Yeah, I think that's a big budget thing for sure. There's not necessarily a right way and a wrong way. It depends. That's what SEOs say. That's what PPCs say. It depends. I think that's a good very large budget, large company, you know, you mentioned high end audio stuff, and it can be a DIY, a guide, a video that's actually a really good step by step ebook. And then you drop them in your CRM, they get an email once a week, here's a coupon, we're doing a Black Friday deal, half off this week only and see, okay, those people that downloaded, we just told them how to do everything six months later, are they buying? I think small companies doing that, that's a terrible idea because it's a very long term branded play and you need a different type of professional or if you want to try to do it yourself to set up this really long email funnel, you know, with webinars and samples and other books and Black Friday, come back, you know, the person that downloaded it a year ago. It's a good plan, but it has to be the right type of large company with a large budget that can do that for that long. I think it's a distraction as well to smaller advertisers and smaller, I'd say, any local service because unless you're at a point where you can't spend any more money on Google Ads, you're literally, you're doing that well, you're getting enough leads, qualified leads, and you cannot spend any more budget, you try to allocate it and it's just not enough search volume, then you might consider going down the content route. And I know service-based businesses that have done it before, but it does become a distraction, particularly for the business owner, and it becomes something about, you know, how many conversions of the PDF are we getting and what, you know, how does that look down the pipeline? And it adds a whole nother layer of tracking and information and we know how fallible tracking is these days. So it just adds a so much complexity and it's just like, look, if you can't maximize your Google Ads because you've got other problems, fix them before you start getting fancy. And it comes down to Pmax as well, it's like, can you use Pmax for lead gen? Yeah. But don't start with it, you know, use it as an expansion tactic, you know, if you flat out on search and you're like, I want more, or the client says I want more, the business owner or whatever, it's like, okay, we'll put 10, 20% into Pmax and the budget and see what happens. But that's where lead qualifying is really important because Pmax is a bit of a hot potato when it comes to lead quality at times. Yeah. And you have a Pmax video that explains this kind of plugging your channel. Go watch here. I'm kidding, there's no box. Is there still a suggestion box? It's here. That's it. I don't know. I don't know, YouTube, that one can do that. But no, you have the Pmax one in it. It is talking about this, go to your CRM and you need to feed it quality leads and not how many demos turned into a sale or appointments or whatever it is, you have to feed that back to performance max. Otherwise, you're going to get hundreds and hundreds of, you know, it's just numbers and letters and fake numbers. I don't know, or fake phone numbers. I don't know why performance max gets bombarded with spam. It just does. And phone calls, put them at five minutes long and then put your CRM, make the form longer or, you know, tag it. Was it good? Was it bad? That has to go to performance max or don't even run it. Whereas you have a little more wiggle room and the other ones, performance max is just, it's notorious for getting spam. So if you don't have all this connected and your API's and all that, don't don't even waste the money. And your video covered that for like an hour. The other performance max, eating data back. Yeah. And if you, I mean, if you really, really want to try and control perform Pmax performance max, and you can handle the call volume, then just only track calls as a primary conversion and don't even consider the form completions. But that requires a bit more, a bit more tinkering and for the business to be able to take the calls and not be too fussed about the lead forms. But yeah, the, the amount of crap that Pmax can attract, Pmax is brilliant at filling in forms is what I like to think. There's probably, there's probably some kind of AI behind Pmax that goes, right, he's had 272 clicks time for a nice form completion. Yeah. Yeah. When we use it about, I use it about two and a half, three years ago, it was still like right at the moment where it became publicly available. I called it for, then this was for SAS. I called it the world's best data entry employee, because you could be 100% sure it would fill out every single field. And you'd get variety, but there was no quality to speak of. It has become better now, but it just requires so many guardrails. It's like, unless you, like Ed said, unless you fully tapped out search, and even before Pmax for Legion, I would go to YouTube. Yeah. You know, it just, it's cool Facebook. It's not there yet for Legion. Yeah, I'd go to Facebook. I'd even go to TikTok if it's more of a entertainment consumer. I mean, that's younger people. It's fun products. It's not B2B, but if it's the right type of product or, well, I guess it's more so product. And Bing. I don't really want to mention that too much. Fitness. I guess fitness could be that, that could be a Legion thing for TikTok. But yeah, Facebook, still some B2B Legion. Yeah, don't forget about Bing, Microsoft ads. It's cheaper. There's barely anybody on it. It's exactly the same as Google search. You just, you just kind of import it and then optimize it from there for sure. But yeah, I would, I would go to, sorry to jump around the slides here. No, it doesn't matter where it was. And talking about expanding beyond search. Oh, there it was. I did find the right one. Going beyond search. Yeah, we have YouTube, which YouTube, they kind of shoved it into DemandGen. If you're doing the maximize conversions for YouTube, it's now technically a DemandGen, but DemandGen lets you check where is it showing. And you could say YouTube only. So it's, it's the same thing. It just looks different. And we have that maximize conversions for leads. You have all your tracking in place. And, you know, it's, it's great for, for software or home services, like remodeling where it's, or a pool builder where you shop for a very long time and you look at a lot of different platforms for picking stuff. Yeah, you can definitely do lead gen with YouTube. And you don't even need a professionally made video. You can use the cheesy one that's built into YouTube itself or Google ads or Canva, or you can outsource it anywhere from 500 to 10,000 if you want a really good professional commercial. Or a lot of people have a commercial. It's like, go get the file, take that same commercial that's on TV or streaming ads are very popular. And I'll go grab that, throw it on YouTube. And it usually does very well even with automation. If you're feeding back good and badly. I know a pool company who literally bought a cheap DJI DJI drone for this thing. It was 300 quid, $300 or whatever. And literally to create their YouTube ads, they fly the drone over the house and do low shots of the pool and stuff like that, the different jobs they did. And when they had enough, they literally got a narrator and just use that as B roll. And it worked. It worked really just because it's just showing off the pool. And of course, some of these houses are quite nice and large and plesial. And they're aspirational and it's like, well, I want to pull. So my neighbors can see me bathing in it and know how much money I've got. That's why I've got a stream in my garden. Those drone shots, everybody's using those. Those are huge in real estate remodeling, roofers, everyone's using those. It's like, you probably have it lying around somewhere. Anyway, smash it together or get a freelancer to do it. I think people are scared of YouTube. It's like, well, I don't have this professionally made video where there's multiple cameras, walking around my office and interviewing the owner with all the lighting. It's like you, if you want to, you can. But I mean, we've made stuff in Canva and just thrown it together. It has templates, AI sometimes makes good videos. I mean, you don't necessarily need a big budget to do it. These slideshow things work well if you can't get a professionally made video done. And sometimes the less, the lower production value stuff works better because it feels regular and less polished. And as a viewer and a potential customer, you feel less like you're being pitched to and more like, hey, just look at this stuff that we did, essentially like my work. Yeah, the owner with the phone. Yeah. The owner with the phone. I don't know who's coaching that, but that's been the thing for years. I don't think you should pull over and record it in your car. I don't know why that's the thing, but the ones where they're actually, I've seen it, you know, talking about pool builders, the owner will just walk around and talk about the project. Here's this pool we put in, it looks great. And they're just walking around with it. They go back to them, they go back to the pool. It's like, if you're looking at a pool, you don't necessarily need a drone shy. You can say, well, that looks really good. And, you know, Ashwin, you were saying it, people won't hit skip immediately because they're like, this is a YouTube video. It's like, wait, no, no, no, no, it's not. Wait, okay, there's a skip button. What am I watching it? It takes some, you know, one minute in like, oh, this was an ad. Okay. Whoops. So same thing with Facebook. There's the UGC content, which user generated content. You either, it's literally that or you mimic it. You make it look like someone's unboxing it or trying it or saying, I tried this product and I loved it. And whether that's, that's paid or it's a real testimonial, those unpolished videos, a lot of times will do better because people will watch the whole thing, not realizing it's an ad or they're on YouTube or Facebook or Instagram or whatever. So yeah, we mentioned about some leads or higher quality than others or a phone call or an appointment or downloading a free ebook. You can use lead values and they could all be marked as primary when you're setting up its primary or secondary. Primary is feeding the bidding and this is done when you set it up. It's the checkboxes at the top. I don't have a screenshot for that, but primary you're telling it, get more of these. Secondary, it will show, but you have to dig it up. You're not, you're not feeding the algorithm, get more of these. So when you put in lead values, that's when you're saying, well, phone calls are good, but appointments are better. That's where, now here's a screenshot. It shows the event type, what the name is. There it is. Okay, action optimization, primary action. And you could put in use the same value for each conversion. You say an appointment, that's a hundred. You're just coming up with a static number or a ballpark based on what your leads are worth. And maybe a phone call you can put in 20 saying a lot of those are questions, they're price shoppers, they're not very good. So $20 as a primary conversion for a phone call, $100 for an appointment for a demo or whatever your higher quality one is, and maybe $2 for an ebook download. Like those are still good. And if you have something like that or some other type of download or join our newsletter, $1. So you're telling Google, these aren't that valuable, a hundred or 200, some very high number saying get more of these. And then you could say maximize conversion value bidding, which a lot of people think that's reserved for e-commerce. You can do that with leads if you assign a value to all the leads. And then that's when it really takes off with a much higher budget and a lot of conversions. You're telling it, this is the most important, the most valuable lead. These other leads are okay, but I'm telling you they're not nearly as valuable to us. So that's a huge one to train it. Small budgets. Sorry, Chris. You can only do that if you again, qualify leads, use your own first party data, pulling back into Google ads, because you can't tell me if I'm wrong. I mean, you can do it, but I don't think you should set a generic value for Google ads conversions. In your example, is this an offline conversion, i.e., a qualified, you said it's an appointment. So let's call it an actual. An appointment. Let's say you'd set it for that and then you have the form that's booked as an appointment, connected maybe to Calendly or something like that. It's an actual person that booked an appointment in person for something locally or a demo for SaaS. They're like, yes, I want to talk to a salesperson, walk me through your entire software. I'm interested in buying it. Whereas the ebook or the demo or free trial, you can feed it back and say, that's not nearly as valuable. And in your CRM, I don't have a screenshot of this because there's hundreds of CRMs, but they all have pretty much a status. It will flip to something. There's closed a deal or became a sale or qualified lead. Anything will connect to if the status flipped to qualified lead or sale, then you trigger it goes in and Zapier can do this. Most of them are direct. Say, give me active campaign, sales forces direct, a lot of them will just connect it. If a lead flipped to a sale or a qualified lead, trigger a Google Analytics goal or sorry, a key event and it'll trigger. I'll just jump to that slide. So you can say send it all the way back and all these call tracking metrics does it first time caller, repeat caller, like work ease is a home service one, their service Titan, they all have their very specific CRMs or even HubSpot. That's a direct and it'll go straight to Google Analytics saying if a lead turns into a client, that it's just something that HubSpot does, you can flip it say send it to Google Analytics as a client or a sale. And then it'll pop up. These are key events. It just sends it over and you say, okay, there it is activity sale first time meaning not a repeat like a activity sale first time it fed it over that take that exact same thing and throw it over to Google ads. Facebook ads is something similar offline conversion. So all most of this connects, it's just built in Zapier has a lot of connections just type it in like I use active campaign, I'm trying to connect it to Google Analytics, they have a click click click. There you go. All of a sudden the the key event is in there and then connect your Google ads and your Google Analytics just the basic feed the two together. When there isn't you click a couple of buttons. Yes, you have to hire an API person and make this software talk to that software but the majority of them, especially Zapier, you're saying I'm using active campaign, I want it to connect to Google Analytics and as what do you want to do that's a really good one for non programmers. Most of them are already built in to where when a lead turns into a sale or a customer or whatever, it's just in Google Analytics and there you go. It's ready to go. Yeah, another tip as well. Google Sheets. So if Zapier or whatever APIs don't talk, Google supports Google Sheets, sorry Google ads support Sheets. So if you can get the data to a sheet, you can normally get it back into ads as well. So it's your ultimate goal here when you've got this data coming into either Google ads or analytics, is that to pull in for example the analytics ads primary conversions. And let's use an example where there might be a lead form here and then a qualified lead, whatever they may be, would you then not bid against Google ads lead conversion, or would you just give that a lower value? It depends on the volume, usually a lower value and your numbers are going to be a little bit off but this is higher budgets and things like that. Here's how many leads, here's how many qualified leads and you can split that out when you do the segment conversion name inside of Google ads. It doesn't just give you 100 conversions. It'll show you the names of each conversions and tracking software will do this too, reporting software or you could just break it out and you see here's how many leads, here's how many qualified leads. If you're having a lot of issues with lead quality, that's when you can say okay, only qualified leads, don't even bring it into Google ads if it's not a qualified lead and then that'll fix that or don't even bring it in if the phone call is over under two minutes and you could just instantly walk it out. You can bring in both to just look at the two or you can just say qualified only or don't even show it in conversions at all. So that would be how you connect everything. I put it in manually, this is call tracking metrics. It has a little button in there or you can use Excel, was it a good call, was it a bad call, how long was it, has a little star rating, it was spam. You could mark this all, it showed where the call came from. You don't necessarily need all this enterprise level software. You can just mark it that was a lead, that was a lead or qualified lead, that's an existing customer. You can just click on these phone calls in most of the systems or Google sheets if you don't have the bigger budgets. Tracking everything automatically would be ideal and then it's just all, most of these systems will connect if you just dig into the integrations button and you'll see it'll just pop up in Google Analytics and you could track whatever you want and then feed it back in and say I want to do qualified leads only or I want leads and qualified leads to evaluate the two and then your ads will perform much, much better because you're not just counting literally every single phone call or form fill that comes in which will break your ads pretty quick. Yeah and I think there's a major value add that other agencies and freelancers can do is that if the client's too busy, if they're a small business and they're too busy to qualify all this, we do it for them using AI automation, literally manually listening to the calls, checking the form completions and going in there and tackling it or outsourcing it to someone else to do for you like a VA or whatever. It's such a major value add if the client is busy and struggling to do it because it improves your performance ultimately. And that's where it's going in the next year, this higher level with automation, with feeding it back in, with every platform forcing you to do auto bidding and all this, I think that's where the future of it and people can use AI. It's not going to replace their job. It's like, hey AI, go look at all these calls and see which good or which aren't and they could listen to the transcripts and read them. Are they good or they bad? Did they book it? Was it a sale? And then it could go all the way back. I think that's really the future. Use all of this with AI and the platforms are forcing you a certain direction. Get more data, feed it back in so that automated bidding and things like this can work because they're forcing us into it. We just have to adjust to make it work. The extra value add that agencies or freelancers or if you're in-house and this is your job, getting all this data and looking at the leads, kind of taking it to that next level, there's so many things the company can do and these are all specific examples we've used with our clients. The first one, you can use the call data for hiring and expansion decisions. We had one is a very large company. We're bringing in a ton of calls. This was a home service and they kept saying, we're getting a lot of calls but we're not getting a lot of appointments. The leads are no good. They're not turning into appointments. I'm looking at search terms and ads and what's the problem? Looking at everything inside of Google Ads but jumping inside of call tracking metrics or call rail, whatever you use. Looking at the calls, we started listening to them because they're all recorded and we found that what kept happening, they were good leads like, hey, we need a repair. Can you come out today? It's like we could be at the earliest. We could be out there is two weeks. So people say, I can't wait that long and hang up and just call after call after call. So we found out there's nothing wrong with Google Ads. The problem is, and the leads aren't trash. The problem is you don't have enough people. Your call service tells everyone two weeks out and everyone hangs up. That doesn't work. So they use that to hire people. So that's a really good example. It's like the leads aren't bad. If you have the offline data, you can see you just need to hire more people. That's why your phone calls aren't turning into more book jobs for you. Yeah, that's a very good point. I mean, you could be strategic with that Chris as well. You could on I know it's a phone call, but if it was a form, you could ask a leading question. When do you need this to maybe not even bring? It really sounds really crappy, though, isn't it? But essentially, people are wasting the time of the administrative staff who can't help them because there's no pre calendar slots. So you kind of don't want them people contacting you. So having some kind of conversion tracking for people that to segment these people that are looking for immediate assistance, i.e. two day, and then I mean, really, you need to remove them from the bidding in a way unless this company then fixes the problem. But this is obviously a bigger company problem because we're talking about volume here. So again, we're getting a bit more nuanced. But sometimes you sort of have to filter this stuff out or push people away and say, it's not for you. Don't even waste your time or hours getting in touch, even though you've paid for the click. And I know it might sound counterintuitive, but yeah. Yeah. And we had another one with a small client that we looked at it tracks ring time too. And the ring time was about a minute to a minute and a half. And they're saying, I'm not getting any calls. It's like you take forever to answer your phone because it's a small company, where the owner answers the phone or they're not near it. They're not in the office. It's a voicemail. And people kept hanging up. It's like, I see you're getting calls. I see them in Google. Why are you not getting any more customers out of it? So that's, that's the kind of talk for a small company. You need to hire someone or there's answering services. And there are anywhere from $100 to $1,000 a month depending on volume. You know, if you're spending 2000 a month on Google ads or whatever it is, you can pay 200 a month to get one of those answering services and you give them a script they write or maybe they just transfer they say, okay, thanks for calling. Yeah, please hold even that alone so that the owner, you know, they're away from their desk or, you know, a lot of home services, they're literally on a job. They don't pick up their phone. That can't be the same phone that your ads go to where otherwise it will fail. 100%. And this is the experience. In fact, I remember operating before call tracking and when we first installed call tracking for a number of service, I remember event hire company and a plumbing company and listening to the calls. I was just like, how the hell are these people getting work? One of them, and I hope they never listened to these videos, but because they probably know who I'm talking about. But one of the event hire company, his wife, so it was a husband and wife team and the wife would answer the phone. And she was not very patient. And I just just like, good God. So they're complaining about lead quality, but it was actually their quality issue. And they they then outsourced it to a call handler who, even though they didn't know the business, were a bit more receptive. And it worked out. So yeah, it can be a business issue. Saying Google ads doesn't work, I think is what it does work. It's normally if Google ads isn't working, it's normally an issue with the business. I know that sounds a little bit harsh, but it typically is. It usually is. And you know, in house teams or people running it themselves, they have all this data agencies, I think they all need to have this data. This is the future. Because otherwise you just get fired and say, well, the leads are no good. It's like, I brought you 100 a day, they say, well, they're no good. It's like, well, what, how are you handling them? You know, monitoring the call answering service or the sales team, you know, we had another one that a lot of times for Google ads, you show for competitors names, they click, they call, they thought they were talking to the other competitor. And one of them, they were picking up and saying, no, no, no, you've got the wrong company. Hold on, let me get you their number. And we'll call them. It's like, you don't have to lie, but you could say, oh, you're calling that other plumber. We're not them, but we'll beat their price. Let me connect you to one of our people, right? We could be there right now and we could do it for cheaper, you know, just write down some script because, or especially a salesperson, I'm looking for this software. Oh, you called the wrong company. Let me connect you. It's like, just transfer it saying we're not them, but, you know, let's, let's talk. Don't don't Google the number of the other company. And they had so many of those. It's like you show for the wrong clients, the wrong, you know, companies, it's like, just handle the calls better and you can listen to them and see what's actually going on. Or like you said, they were very rude. It's like, okay, you shouldn't be answering the phone. That's why you're not getting this. It sounds obvious. It sounds obvious. But if you are not monitoring these things, you'd have no idea and you'd be sat there churning through all the data and looking at the location reports and this that the other and they'll be pulling your hair out going. But surely these are good leads, you know, and yeah, and the the whole thing with competitors calling, this is why I've always been a fan of competitor campaigns in many, particularly service-based, for many businesses, because if something's urgent, like plumbing or emergency, people don't care. Like if they ring up and say, oh, is that Tim's plumbing? You're like, no, it's 10 years. It's like, have you got an emergency? Is it urgent? Yeah, I do. Okay, we can help. It's like, if something's urgent, if they miss call or they get through to someone else, it's not normally an issue. This is true in insurance as well, where it's quite a market where most people are selling the same bloody thing. Let's let's face it. So people are price sensitive and they just want to quote. So it doesn't really matter. Some people are brand sensitive. But yeah, I mean, it's so critical. You should be monitoring your clients. You should have internal KPIs for them as well. Like how long does it take them to answer the call? What's what, you know, how will they qualify in the lead? Are they doing a good job and hold them accountable? They might hate you for it. If it's a a business that employs a few people, the boss will probably be very happy that you're holding them accountable because he or she are not taking the call. So they're not to blame anyway. It's always a bit prickly when it's the business owner and you're like, dude, you need to hire for this, you're shit at it. Yeah, there's a lot of those that are like that. It's like you miss so many calls and you call them back hours later, which in some businesses you come back four hours later, they're long gone for the next day or something. Yeah. So you finish your days work that you're like this lead was crap. So you rang them at quarter eight in the evening. Yeah, 17 children, they're trying to feed them. Why are they going to take your call? Yeah, some of these just, you have to look at that or a lot of them, I didn't get to mention it before, but forms, run ads 24 seven or not. And we did that, I was an attorney and saying everyone that fills out a form at 2am, I called them first thing in the morning, they never pick up and looking at that lead quality. Yeah, they're cheaper, lower cost per click, lower cost per lead is like, I never reach these people when it comes around to the morning. It's like, okay, well, then that's, that's a waste of time or other ones you do. And they're really cheap leads, you call it a to N, they pick up, they're like, yeah, you know, I work late, this was the only time I had to fill out the form, I need some type of service, you know, and that works, you just, you have to look at it, because I don't always block overnight, it's like it depends, maybe that's good, it's usually cheaper, or maybe it's crap, you never get a hold of them. So they don't think call if it's a voicemail, obviously, but do you reach them the next day? And that's what you have to look at. Yeah, and you've got to track because it is a very much it depends, you can't say all calls are past midnight or drunks and drug addicts. You can't say that some people work shifts and work late and stuff. So it depends and you can only answer that if you actually review this stuff. It's like for some industries, prioritizing your budget for the morning is better than the afternoon because people are keener in the morning, they need that service, again, thinking urgent kind of services. And you could literally have a campaigns, your campaigns budget dedicated to run flat out for the first four or five hours, six hours of the day, and then if they run out of juice or shut them off, so be it. But you don't even know that by reviewing this data. Yeah. Yeah. And I had another client, they were doing a voice menu tested to live answering. And it was shocking because we're getting so many calls and it's like, we're not getting appointments, what's going on? And we looked at that voice menu started and people hated it. They're like, you have reached this company, press one for something. And 80% of them hung up. It was an extremely high number. And it's like, what's wrong with the ads? What's wrong with the keywords? And we finally looked at, okay, switch it to a live person, whether it's there or it's somewhere else. And that cut out nearly all of the dropped calls. It just people hated that voice menu. Maybe it sounded like a voicemail like they're not there. It's corporate. Yeah, something. It's so corporate. If you're multinational, you have to have interactive and IVR interactive voice menu, whatever. But yeah, small businesses, you should be at worst, if you are busy and on the phone, put them on, put them on hold and tell them you're on hold, you're next in line or whatever. But making forcing people through different menus is just yeah, we all hate it. And it just feels so, it feels like you're just going to go into the mill in some big corporate. And if that's the kind of product or service, then fair enough. But if you're a small business trying to act big, I think act small because a lot of people appreciate that. Yeah, and people don't calculate, you know, okay, you can't hire a full time person to sit there in the office and answer. But there's tons of answering services, whether you want it in your country, or you don't care if it's overseas, that's a business decision that's up to you. But you know, they look at, oh, it's $500 a month for someone with the call volume we're getting. It's like, but you spend $20,000 a month on ads. How many calls are you losing to this voice menu? Or if it's $2,000 a month for a call center, but you're spending $50,000 a month on ads, it's like, you have to look at how many jobs you're losing because of the voice menu or because of the call recording or whatever else it is. You can't just look at the one cost and say, well, we'll just do a voice menu, they're cheap. And if you have all this lead data, you can literally calculate it because you know how many leads come in, you know how many are qualified and you know what the average order is off the back of them. So you can literally calculate the loss of having that problem, which is why the first party data is so difficult. So difficult, so important, not difficult. It's important when it's difficult, but it's not even that difficult anymore, actually. Well, the good news is you have got a couple of videos coming up from God tier community members who are going to show how to set it up. And then we've got server side tracking, then we've got the whole end to end of offline conversion tracking. So there will be no excuses for anyone not to be able to do it. Yeah, really technical deep dive. Yeah, that'll be good for the technical people that are going to do it all themselves. Yeah, definitely, definitely watch that. Or hire it out if you just you don't know you don't have the time, maybe it's $1,000 just pay for it. It's worth the money to get somebody to do that. And no life is short. And in my early years, I would literally learn everything and try it myself and do it myself. So I knew how it worked. And that, and I know, like I just said, life's short, people like, well, can't I automate it or use AI? You can, but I think there's still a lot of merit in understanding. How does this thing work? And just trying it once or try set something up once. And if you struggle, outsource it. I'm not saying do it every single time, but just understanding like this key component to what I do as a job. Like how does it work? Do I care? Like tag manager, it's not my favorite thing, but I have I have used it sufficiently that I know how it works, what it does. I'm no tag manager expert, but I needed for my own sanity, I needed to get a base level understanding to go, Oh, right. So we are relying on this thing. What does it do? I will try it. Instead of just going, yeah, we use these things. I don't know what they do, but it seems to work. It's kind of, I don't know. What I'm saying is don't be lazy. Do try it a bit, particularly if you're a freelancer or an agency. If you're a business owner, I understand. Probably because you're not going to do this as a profession. You don't need to do it outsource it. But for marketing pros like ourselves, then get a get a foundation. Yes, I might replace it all in a year. It doesn't matter. Just understand what it's doing today. What the obvious thing? Where can people find you? LinkedIn, that's actually me if you want to talk to me or online advertising Academy is our YouTube channel content that just like yours kind of how to do stuff in Google ads, kind of deep dives or beginner stuff. And then of course our agency Falcon Digital Marketing.com. So yeah, Falcon Digital, I'll stick, we'll stick some links in the description. So go and follow Chris, go and find him. And if you think if you're a business owner out there that doesn't have all this stuff in place, definitely talk to Chris. He knows what he's up to. So thank you, everyone. Thank you for listening. I say everyone is a mistake. See, I've only been doing YouTube for about 10 years, Chris. I should say thank you for listening because there's only one person that we're talking to right now. So yeah, leave a comment if there's any questions off the back of what we've been discussing, leave a comment and we'll get back to them. I always get back to them if I can drop a like and do subscribe if you want more. Because not enough people subscribe and apparently I need to ask you to do that. So we get more views and stuff, which is great. Means we can make more videos. Brilliant. Thank you, everyone. This has been the fifth episode of the over budget podcast that isn't a podcast that eventually might become a podcast. Chris, thank you very much. Everyone else. Cheers.
