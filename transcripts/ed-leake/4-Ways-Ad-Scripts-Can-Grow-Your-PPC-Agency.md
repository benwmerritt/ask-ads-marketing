If you educate some of the senior members with scripting skills, they become more loyal team members and they stay longer because of simply interested in that. There's basically four reasons why I think PPC agency owners should consider running scripts. The main objective of course is to simply grow the business and skill map profit, right? Skill revenue, skill map profits. And we need new clients, better clients. And one of the advantages of running scripts is that you can sort of like reposition yourself as an innovative PPC agency that embraces automation and AI without using the buzzwords and actually delivering on the promise. If you start using scripts, you'll probably notice that very early on you'll get ideas that sort of require some third-party API integrations, maybe some AI algorithms to help you optimize performance. Or maybe use GPT to create scripts for you or optimize headlines. So yeah, I think from a positioning statement, it makes sense to start using scripts because it's a way to differentiate yourself from competitors. But then on the operations side of course, once you take on new clients, you don't want to grow the team too much. You want to serve more clients but not necessarily hire more people to do the work for you. And especially not reduce the quality of the work that you deliver. So I use scripts to basically automate and love the work that my competitors are doing manually. But most of my scripts actually do some analysis of the data in the account and then semi-automated tasks by prefilling some Google Sheets with the tasks that my team members need to do and then monitor the quality of their work. So for instance, if the team members need to create new ad copy, the scripts will actually monitor if these new ads get approved, if there are still ads enabled in each and every ad group. If new products enter our shopping campaigns, if these products are still hosted on landing pages that are mobile friendly, stuff like that. So quality assurance and reducing manual labor are the two other advantages. And then the third is what I see happening with especially the bigger agencies with a lot of seniors. There's a big churn in the team members, right? People just leaving the team because they're bored with the work. And what I've seen is that if you educate some of the senior members with scripting skills, they become more loyal team members and they stay longer because of simply understanding that. So these are the biggest advantages for PPC agencies on scripts. Yeah, that's interesting because these topics come up about retaining not clients, but the team. They work with a lot of local businesses and they do quite templated account structures. And obviously that can be boring for the PPC manager. So and he's got this fear that people will leave as quickly as they turn up to do the work. But I mean, my argument was, well, if there's a process and it's templated, it's very easy to high-fall. So if people leave quickly, but obviously you don't want that. So I think that's very interesting. You mentioned, I know you say for seniors, but still having some automation to support the role. Yeah, that's more in line with that. So that's yeah, that's that's a good addition actually, because one of the services I offer is like the script selection service where we go into the details of the current operations and I then I will point you to some of the free scripts that are out there that will create the most value for your current operation. And one of the questions I ask is what tasks took you the most time and what tasks frustrated you the most? And the answer to the latter question is sometimes it provides feedback to the manager and there's a letter. Oh, okay. I didn't know they really hated this job that much. But yeah, some of the things that are pretty obvious, like for instance, skimming through search terms, I think it's fun because, you know, it shows the quirky thoughts in the end users of Google. But, you know, it can be boring if you have to do it every day. So we automate that. Yeah, unless you have a tool like Adovol, which is the bloody reason I built the thing, it makes dealing with search terms like fun, not fun, quick, efficient. Right. I really should market it a bit better.
