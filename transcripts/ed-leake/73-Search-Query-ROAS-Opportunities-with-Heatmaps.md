Okay, so I appreciate some of you will have a lot of search data. So I wanted to do a quick video on how to use Excel to find your top and bottom performers to optimize your bids within AdWords. So I'm currently looking at the search queries report. And what we want to do here is click on customize and essentially create our version of the search queries report. That looks like this. So we get rid of all the excess that we don't need. What I like here is clicks cost CPC per session value. So we get rid of this lot. Econ most conversion rates, all right, we can use that to I'll show you why we keep that in when we go to the spreadsheet. We don't necessarily transactions and we don't need cold conversion rate. What we do want is to add the per session value for e commerce. And I would put that we can rearrange it in Excel, of course, but put in there. So because we're editing the search query report, we get all the filters and secondary dimension drill downs that we that we need. So we can literally give this a name. So we'll just call it quickly. Well, whatever, you give it a better name. Wait for it to load. And so we've now got all the search queries data that we had on the standard report, but with our columns, for example, take 50 rows of data. Then if we go to the top and export, and you can do Google sheet, I use Excel. So Excel file. Let's open this up. Apologies if you can hear my mouse clicking. It's very loud. OK, so we have a spreadsheet. And what we can do in here is let me just sort these columns on like a little bit of space, a bit of breathing room to see where I'm going. And what we'll do is fix the freeze the top row. And then I'm going to put a little equation in a return on ad spend equation at the end of the page. So this is the revenue divided by cost. So equals some revenue column divided by cost column. Double click to send that downstream. So this is revenue divided by cost, essentially. And this will give your ratio. So three to one, five to one, 100 to one, wherever it may be. And that directly correlates to a percentage of cost. So three to one is a 300% return on investment. So what I would do is turn this into a table so we can easily and quickly sort it. So insert table. Should automatically select the data because it's clever like that. I prefer gray on gray. I mean, you choose whatever table format you like, but some of the colors are garish. And we also want to put conditional formatting on, which will help us see. We want that to be the priority. So let's put some conditional formatting on the cost per click column. And we want an inverse low being green, red being high on CPC. We want to do the same, but a standard green high, red low on per session value. And then finally, the column that we added in the ROAS, the return on ad spend, we want to do that as well. Put a nice green to red column in there. So what can we see here? Well, let's sort by cost first and foremost, where are we spending the most money and getting the best return or worst on ad spend? Now you can see straight away because we've added some color coded opinions here, a bit of conditional formatting and the ROAS column. The biggest spending keyword or should I say search query in this account is actually underperforming. This account should be in the region of five to one. So we can see straight away, we've got some problems here. So how would I tackle this? Well, first of all, I would probably avoid spending so much money on that search term, or I would try and bid it down to see if it's still responsive. So drop the bid here, it's 31 pence, drop it down to early 20s, which should, by my very quick calculation looking at the screen, bring it into the sort of five to one range in terms of ROI. But it's not all bad news. We've got a high per session value, fifth down, which is considerably higher than most of the cells around it. And its ROI is 7.94, which is comfortably above and beyond where we need it to be. So first of all, it's easy to keyword in the account. And secondly, can it be given more budget to be given more freedom to spend money and generate that positive ROI? And the same can be said, as we scroll further down, you'll see some heavy red items. They need to be squashed, essentially, those search terms simply aren't performing. So they should be negative keywords in these campaigns that they're in. Again it's a business decision. So you look at these search terms relative to your business and see where are they important or are they not. But at this point in time, they're spending money and not generating any return for you. There are lots of lower spending keywords down here that aren't necessarily long tail either. So we've got a good selection of keywords here in these lower regions that are delivering ROI from 5, 10 up to 40, even 80 times ROI there. Oh, crikey, there's one that's 137 times ROI. So it's not spent a lot of money, but that needs looking at and given some budget. I mean, look at how low the cost per click is. So that immediately tells me that that search query could be released if it was given a higher bid and spent more money. And ultimately, with such a strong return on ad spend number, even with a higher bid, you'll highly likely stay within a profitable window with that one. So scrolling back up, like I said before, people who optimize to conversion rates are missing a trick and potentially costing themselves money. So the very top keyword in this list has a what you'd consider a very handsome conversion rate of 8.72%. That's really good conversion rates. But because of the nature of the product, the return on ad spend is pretty rubbish. So if you were just optimizing on conversion rates alone, you'd probably be focusing a bit more attention on that particular search query and you'd be wrong to do so. Hence, we like to look at these other numbers. So I hope that's really helped. Obviously to keep a bit of sanity in this, you can tailor your reports per campaign or ad group if you've got larger accounts to pull off your entire search query list for the past three, six months or whatever it may be would be quite cumbersome. So do it campaign on campaign, but you will absolutely find some benefits in doing so, especially with the simple conditional formatting. It just helps you highlight potential pitfalls and potential profitable areas. So yeah, apply that to your own metrics and search queries and happy digging for gold.
