Cold feet aka confidence issues. How many people leave your checkout who otherwise would have purchased with you if it weren't for some simple sticking point? Well here's how to find out. So if we drop into behavior, site content and all pages, here you want to search for the name of your checkout page and in addition you want to add a secondary dimension for the exit page. I'd also edit and exclude your confirmation pages so we can, we're only going to be seeing those people that started the checkout process but left. Bear in mind these people are in the commit mode, they've hit proceed at the checkout and now something is making them quit. If you see a lot of people escaping via the home page, are you forcing people to sign up? A common reaction for cold feet is to hit your logo, top left of the website and go back to your home page and then scarper. So instead of forcing people to sign up straight away before they've checked out, why not ask for their email as part of the checkout process which commonly people do and then offer to create an account at the end of the process once they've committed. They've already added their information so it's slow pressure and there's a high probability that they'll create accounts. Also, were those cold feet because of your shipping? 6% here said yes. If you're seeing similar numbers ask yourself is your shipping and delivery information obvious and is it in plain sight during the checkout? You need to tell your potential customers what they're getting and how quickly. For example here in the UK, free delivery is a common thing but it can mean anything from next day guaranteed to three to five working days delivery. So which is it? You've got to tell the customer keep their feet warm and here's another thing. Over 1% here are hitting the contact page and then leaving the website. Again, why is that? Do they have the appropriate contact information on the checkout? A problem phone number and opening hours can satisfy this urge to click away. It's little things like that, simple things that if they aren't prominent information on the checkout then they can deter potential customers. What other pages do people leave your checkout to read? You'll find them here and it's your chance to resolve these cold feet issues because the potential uplift in revenue is considerable. This is one of the simplest reports you can run to dramatically improve your sales with let's face it the least amount of effort. So happy hunting for those cold feet. Let's warm them up.
