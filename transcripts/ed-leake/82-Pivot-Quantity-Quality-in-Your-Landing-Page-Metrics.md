where there's parity there's performance which means where there is no parity there lies your opportunity. I'm now going to navigate to the behavior site content landing page report and we're going to pivot against the medium. What we're looking at here is how people entered your website where they came from and the quantity and quality metrics for each. Now we'll slice this data up using a metric that's important to us. So for example here's bounce rates sorted by total sessions so we're looking at the top landing pages in order of traffic. You can of course apply custom segments that you've built we'll leave it on all users for this example and if you prefer to work in spreadsheets you can add more rows and export as a spreadsheet apply some conditional formatting to quickly identify with heatmaps where problems exist but for now we'll keep it simple we'll remain in analytics and look at the top 10 pages and identify those issues. Instantly looking at this report I'd be looking at the SEO guys in the room and asking why is the top paid landing page not seeing any organic traffic. If it's a dedicated pay-per-click landing page that isn't indexed then should it be reproduced on the website and indexed in Google? But the question expands possibilities beyond SEO it can raise tactical decisions for marketing such as can we write and produce content that supports this landing page? Are we sharing it on social media? Is it part of our email strategy? Are we highlighting it is a great destination for our affiliate marketers to be sending their traffic? Also looking further down we can see a page that exhibits high bounce across all channels. Why? Look at those email clicks too. 700 odd hitting this page which in hindsight isn't showing great numbers in terms of the user experience. Let's isolate it and pivot against some commercial metrics. Firstly conversion rate. Ouch not great. We can of course switch to the e-commerce tab and then pivot by AOV, average order value and per session value. So let's look at the per session value. Again it's not looking great is it? That page needs some work and I suggest until it's fixed it's not pushed in the marketing campaigns. Particularly email campaigns where it's failing miserably. Why do I like this report then? Because you can identify which channel and page needs optimizing and what areas are falling behind others. You can also answer the question is my traffic going to waste? In the example above you would have answered yes. So in short if you can't find insights here in this pivot report you're not looking hard enough. Apply it to your own data and see what you can find.
