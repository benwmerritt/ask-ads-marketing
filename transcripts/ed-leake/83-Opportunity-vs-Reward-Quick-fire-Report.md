OK, this really is a quick fire report. This is what I term the opportunity versus reward report. If I jump straight into the customisation screen and create a report, essentially what we're looking at here is a report with the following metrics. Impressions, click-through rate, bounce rate, cost per click, cost, return on ad spend and the dimension drill downs of keyword and search query. You can actually duplicate this tab and remove the keyword dimension from the second tab, so then you can really quickly switch between the two, i.e. keywords versus search terms or just drill down by each keyword on the first tab. If I save that and actually take a look at this report, so the opportunities is in reference to the impressions and the click-through rate on the left hand side versus the reward of return on ad spend on the right hand side. What you're looking for is high impressions but low click-through rate with a decent return on ad spend. As you find that simple correlation, you need to jump on those keywords to improve the click-through rate and get them spending. Furthermore, keyword research can be a little tricky. Trying to second guess what the market is looking for is never simple. Here is a raft of ideas for you to base your keyword research on based on demand and your level of fulfilment in the market, a.k.a. your click-through rate and ROI. This data can of course be exported to a sheet and you can apply additional formatting to help you quickly see these opportunities. Simple, effective, another quick report I love.
