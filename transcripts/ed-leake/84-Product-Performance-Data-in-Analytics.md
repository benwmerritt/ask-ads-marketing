This is how to take your product performance data with analytics to another level. With this report we can move quickly from analysis to taking action, with a focus on your product page's success rate. The key metric here is the buy to detail rate. In other words, how well the product page converts. So let's build the report. Again jumping across to customization and we're going to start off with your products SKUs or you can use the name. You can also deploy this report on categories and product brands later down the line. But now we'll focus on individual products. The metric set looks like this. So we're going to have product detail views, essentially how many times the product page was visited. Product adds to basket, buy to detail rate, how well this product converts, quantity, product revenue, average quantity, i.e. how many people buy more than just one, unique purchases, average price and product refund amount. If you're feeding this data back into analytics, it's good to know which products people return and obviously you want to avoid that happening to your top performance. So save this report and let's take a look at what this view is telling us. Okay, top to bottom. This is not just about the products you may know about already, i.e. your best sellers, but finding the products which could have made the most money. That's an important distinction to consider. What could have made the most money, not what did. So we're going to spot opportunities, those high product page views to checkouts, make them more visible. Just like these. So these products need to be pushed. Are they on your homepage? Are you spending enough on pay per click to drive traffic to these products? Is there a social media campaign around these products? Are they featured in your newsletter and so on? Get tactical. What about when there's something wrong like these products? When you see a low product page success rate, you need to identify the poor performance. So do you have a low stock issue? Is the product photo bad? Out of date or worse is it missing? If you're sending paid traffic to these products, does the advert represent the product in question? Is the product description poor, thin on content or missing vital details about the product? Are there distractions on the product page? Perhaps you're recommending similar products and a cheaper alternative is taking potential revenue away from this product? Or is the product price too high or just wrong? Is there a shipping, delivery, time disparity with the product type? Once there's a technical problem on this product page, there's loads of questions you can ask about these poor performance to get them shifting up because they're getting enough visibility but they're not converting. The beauty of this kind of report as well is that it can be given to your merchandise team and not necessarily just the marketing team. So get tactical and see your revenue climb with the product performance V2 report. It's brilliant.
