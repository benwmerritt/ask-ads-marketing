And just to confuse matters a little bit further, so that was analytics, conversion, attribution, and then a bit about the UTM. Now AdWords conversion tracking, which by default is, well, it's a greedy attribution model. It's not a real model, by the way. There isn't a greedy attribution model in quotation marks, that's just its behavior. So why is this? Because if an advert is present and a conversion happens, regardless of the final traffic source of the conversion, AdWords will measure a conversion. So for example, if a user clicks on your ad and then later returns to your site via organic search and completes a goal, then AdWords will give a credit for the conversion to the last AdWords click, whereas analytics will give the credit for the conversion to organic search. Obviously this can be problematic, especially if you're operating multiple campaigns. You might have instances where certain channels, campaigns, or keywords are either taking too much credit, or worse still, not getting enough credit, and you might be optimizing them incorrectly based off the mix of various channels and how they work together. I'm not saying this to scare you. I want to make you aware and reinforce the importance of learning about the different attribution types. Thankfully, we can fix the whole GA and AdWords disagreement. I personally recommend setting your conversion tracking in analytics and importing your conversion data to AdWords from analytics. In fact, I enforce this across all of our accounts at my agency. None of our customers have AdWords conversion tracking. It's all driven by analytics. This is both quicker, easier, and it irons out a few kinks in discrepancies. It's never going to be 100%, but it's a damn sight more accurate than independent AdWords independent analytics. It also means you don't have to maintain two separate bits of code. At least, there could be multiple conversion codes for both platforms. As I've said previously in this training, you shouldn't be over-focused on the tiny details what you're looking for are trends and guidance in this information. If the discrepancies between your conversion data are extreme and unnatural, then yes, there's a problem. It should be resolved. But otherwise, when we're looking at these models and this data, we have to accept that 100% accuracy is unlikely and just move on. Okay, that's the default last-click attribution in a nutshell. Now we're going to ask questions of your data that help us understand how we can use attribution for our own specific business needs.
