Okay, this section is about the modern buyer's journey. So understanding the modern consumer's behaviour, which is easier said than done, because let's face it, modern consumers are both unpredictable, and technology has enabled them to literally shop wherever and however they see fit. So there are lots of digital dots floating around the ether. These dots, thankfully, can be joined by attribution. I'm just going to show you the example Google benchmarks found at this website address here. These map the customer journey to online purchase. So this simple visualisation is described by 42,000 e-commerce analytics properties, and can be used to give you an understanding, a benchmark, of what your industry and company size looks like in terms of attribution, and all the multi-touch points before a conversion. In the example below, medium-sized retailers in the US typically have early touch points that are from social media, organic search, and then moving on to referral traffic, generic paid search, and email sits in the middle, where direct traffic is closer to purchase. So lots of touch points. And bear in mind, this is an average benchmark of a mid-size US retailer. So lots and lots of touch points here. Yours could be shorter, yours could be longer. So these studies and benchmarks are all well and good, but what about your business? This is where attribution really comes into play. So we can start asking questions of your data and answering a few pertinent questions. These will help you understand how attribution can help your business, and you can discover your own paths to conversion. So the first question is, how many touches on average do your customers have before they convert? Secondly, how long is in general, is it between the first visit and the final conversion, and how many channels are involved in your conversions? So let's use analytics to answer these questions.
