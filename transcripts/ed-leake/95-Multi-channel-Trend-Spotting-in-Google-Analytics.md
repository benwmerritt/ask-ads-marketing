To get a broader understanding, we're now heading to the conversion tab in analytics and looking at the multi-channel funnel section. A quick caveat ahoy. All the multi-channel funnels reports I'm about to walk through use a linear attribution model. These reports simply split credit and share everything equally through all your traffic sources. So what that means is if you had three channels that were present before a user converted, each one of those channels would get an equal 33% split of the credit. So it's quite important to remember at this stage that just to add a layer of complexity, sorry, multi-channel funnels use a linear attribution model. So it keeps everything quite clean but it's also another reason why multi-channel reports don't always agree with other reports. Ah analytics, a little bit tricky but anyway we'll suss it don't worry. To use multi-channel funnels you have to have goals or e-commerce tracking setup. If you've not done that already refer back to the first chapter of this course and stop skipping ahead. Right so we're in the overview tab and we're looking at a Venn diagram on how each channel intersects in a very top level view. Make sure you choose the relevant conversions in the top left corner and we'll keep the look back window at the default 30 days for now. Extending it too far can reduce accuracy and for most people a month is a decent slice of time for reference. This report is useful for your business to get an idea of feel for how your channels are performing together. I know on this e-commerce store in particular they need to up their social media game and also start driving more budget into display advertising. To prove this let's add the fourth channel in. Then if we hover over the two channels in questions to social media we don't have to add them in we can get a tool tip on how frequently they occur in the multi-touch world prior to sale. Ouch. Neither of them appear. Very rarely should that be true of these two channels. So if you find similar in this view it can give you a quick kick to suggest where more effort is required in your marketing. These channels should be supporting your top channels but here they're not unfortunately. Other interesting opinions can be drawn from hovering over the Venn diagram itself and the intersections highlight how customers really do travel around the houses before committing to a purchase. A lot of them in fact. This is also telling you the percentage of channel traffic that forms part of the end conversion. A relatively simple technique is to take each month and track the percentage changes over time. You'll need to chart this in a spreadsheet outside of analytics unfortunately but it will enable you to spot sea changes in traffic habits and also highlight any channel shortfalls. This simple top level view can help answer broader business performance questions such as when you have a weaker or stronger period. You know what impact did your multi-channel makeup have on those. Again this section is about trend spotting. You can refine this by looking at time lag and conversion path reports next.
