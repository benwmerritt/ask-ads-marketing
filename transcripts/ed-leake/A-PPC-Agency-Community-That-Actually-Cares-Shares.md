The other members are fantastic. Everyone's active. And I've been a member of a few of these different groups where you're apparently giving access to this network. And when you comment, nobody gets back to you or people are unwilling to share, but it's completely different in force. Everyone's been very forthcoming. Everyone's honest. I'm Taylor. I run Bolt DMS. We are a lead gen agency focusing in the trade and construction niche, but we serve all different services. I am a recent new member to Ford fan of Ed Stuff for a while, but I've never never made the plunge. And I would say my biggest hesitation before joining is that I get a lot of different ads and a lot of different gurus as they're referred to. Running ads to me, promising me things that I don't know if they're true. So the my biggest hesitation was, what is this going to be? Another one of those things where I spend a lot of money and actually I don't end up doing it. I don't end up completing the course. I've got loads of courses piled up, loads of documents, PDFs that I never actually completed because I thought they were great at the start and they did a very good job of selling it, but never actually got my teeth into it. For me, it was joining the barrier that got me over the line was actually just chatting with Ed himself on LinkedIn and continuing to see the value that he was giving away for free. So a lot of the time people are advertising to me in written ads and they can say whatever they want, but Ed's videos and releases of different clips of the webinars and the live sessions and the coaching sessions. He hosts, you can't fake a video. So I could see genuinely that what he was saying was true in that his perspective on things was very similar to mine. The number one thing I get out of the framework is a trusted one source solution. So one of my resolutions this year is to shut off a lot of the noise that gets through to me on social media, email marketing, that kind of thing. And I unsubscribe for a lot of it. And I ban myself from a lot of these channels. And I know that I can trust Ed's framework as one source solution. So I'm using that and a couple of other trusted sources is the only place that I go to take the truth now. So I have a clear understanding of what needs to happen next and in what order as well. It's genuine and it's authentic. It's not overselling or over promising. There's no panicking you into taking certain actions. And it is a realistic outlook on the next steps and how to take them. Rather than you can get to this amount by this day. You just need to do these two things. There's none of that, which I really, really like. It's about applying the knowledge of what it's gone through to your own business. So it feels personalized. The other members are fantastic. Everyone's active and comments. I've been a member of a few of these different groups where you're apparently given access to this network. And when you comment, nobody gets back to you or people are unwilling to share, but it's completely different in force. Everyone's been very forthcoming. Everyone's honest and really, I mean, I suppose most of us in there are competitors of one another, but nobody holds back. And yeah, we're moving together in the right direction. I think the term that they use in business is farming, not hunting. So we're helping to cultivate between one another. The thing that sets forge apart from others, I would say, is that willingness to share from the other members that you don't get elsewhere. Yeah, it's been fantastic. I've really enjoyed it and probably about 60%. I think through the framework, but I know once you get through that, I've got loads of extra videos to watch and the value of it is seems to be never ending. So that's why I signed up and I am a skeptic and I don't join very many things. And the things that I do join, it's been hard to get me over the line and I've been stuck with them over and over again, but with Ed's framework over the moon. So thank you very much to Ed and his team.
