technical skills can be trained values. Yeah, I mean, I'm going to disagree with you on one thing, sure, which values you can't yeah, you can't teach someone they are you know, we are emotional beings we are who we are technical yes, through process, but critical thinking is such an important there's a critical component. It's very important. And it's the one thing I see lacking the most, it's not that the someone doesn't know which button to press. Yeah, they don't know why they're pressing it. And I don't know if it's just because the people are lazy. And by the way, I don't mean people in the group, because I'm a grumpy old man, and people always ask questions that I think, well, I've already answered that, why can't you use the search? That's true of the Facebook group. So don't and no one take offense. But I sometimes do think I have to ask a question, I do this quite often. If someone asks a question, I do it the Facebook group, I do it on email, I do it with my own team. So no one take offense, just to reassure you. I often ask a question in reply to false you to think, right, you've asked the question, but what's the underlying critical thinking of that question? You know, what's the outcome? What are you trying to achieve? Why? Why? Why always ask why? Should I raise my bid? Well, why? What's, you know, because learning the functionality in Google is one thing. And it's not just Google, it's everything. But getting someone to be critical with their thinking, I have found is very, very difficult to learn. And if someone isn't that way, isn't wired that way, I found that often it won't, it doesn't matter what I let me teach them, it doesn't matter what processes I give them. And yeah, you can follow a process. But if there's a chink or detour, a problem, that's when it rears its head. And that's when a process can go out the window. Yes, that's certainly true. And I do think critical thinking skills are the last thing that come. I think the way you get that way is mostly through repetition and through mentorship. I think a lot of people are trained, even from the time they're in school, to think that if the answer is an obvious, they should ask someone because they don't want to do it wrong. And one of the things that I really try to push on my team is like this idea that there's some kind of perfect optimal answer that you can definitely land on, it's mostly fiction. And most of the people that teach online market is one of the reasons I like the God tier stuff and most of the stuff that you do is you don't go down this. You give people the tools to use what you do in an intelligent way, right? There's no one size fits all answer for every question.
