Sarah also asks how many keywords should I have per ad group because I'm reading conflicting information. Yeah, I feel for you, Sarah. Even Google gives you the wrong information. 20 odd keywords per ad group is not highly targeted, especially when you consider that Google will closely match your even your exacts with plurals. So typically what I suggest is keep you keep your ad groups as thin on keywords as you possibly can. If that means you've got one keyword in one ad group, that's absolutely fine. In doing so, you can tailor the advert copy and the landing page perfectly to your keyword. So don't be afraid to go to granular. It's more effective. Yes, it's it's more work to manage and I appreciate on large spends large accounts. This is not quite so straightforward. But you know, it is the most effective. So it's about it's a trade between performance and time management on this front, but always tightly match your keywords. And you know, if you must have a rule of thumb, keep it under 10 because beyond that, you're going to struggle to keep all your keywords related.
