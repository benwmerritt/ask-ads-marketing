Essentially, getting leads, running ads, who's your current ad on Reddit focused at and why? Yes, I guess that's kind of interesting because that was it started as a test. I started engaging and maybe this is a good, you know, this is a good discussion about leads in general too, because I started engaging in Reddit fairly recently about a year ago and it was insane the responses I got. We landed our biggest ever client from Reddit. Yes, and it blew me away and it was a good early win that made me want to keep double down and so I have. Yeah, even internally they have discussions of like, how did we find you guys on Reddit? That's so weird. But the other extremely large Canadian company which people have probably heard of and probably have the products in their house. We run like they spend millions and millions on ads. It's ridiculous. I have an approach with Reddit, which is I'm not anonymous. I'm very polite. And I try to be helpful, which is the emphasis of Reddit, right? That should be how people live their lives, but unfortunately, social media is kind of screwed that up. But Reddit seems pretty anonymous and asked most times. So but it's easy to stand out. And so I, we've gotten quite a few, like, ridiculous leads from Reddit. So I started running ads just, just posts and I don't link to a website. I'm not even trying to sell anything. I started a subreddit. I linked to that in the ads. And I'm getting currently getting a under $1 cost like CPC. But the CPM is about, which is really what I care about. I can get easily several thousand views on an ad for like five bucks. It's ridiculous. And you say it's a Reddit post, isn't it? It's just a Reddit post. I boost basically. Reddit has a really crude ad platform. It is super crude. You can target subreddits. I can target subreddits. So I did target, you know, R slash PPC, R slash Google ads, you know, stuff like that. And a lot of the comments on the post, you know, I get my fair share of like, I had one guy last week say, F your agency. And I'm like, okay, cool. Thanks. But yeah, but plenty of people are like, wow, I didn't even realize this was an ad. This is so cool. Yes, I read the comments. They were very positive for the main part. Probably because I've deleted all the negative ones. But there are plenty of C bombs out there. Facebook is particularly awful for this. When I ran Facebook ads last year for my training product, my God, it put me literally, I'm not an anxious person, it made me anxious to wake up and check what comments have been left. It's like, I'm not a bad person. I'm just trying to help but make a bit of money as well. I yeah, it's funny you say that because it made me anxious. This guy was I woke up and this guy was posting he was like, Gil Gildner is lying about his clients, the clients on their website are not real. I called the CEO and they said they don't work with Disco Sloth. And I'm just sitting there thinking like, Oh, my gosh, why are you saying this? Like, like, what is driving you to attack me like this? So this insanity. When I first my first ever advert on Facebook, a long time ago, God 2012 13, I got swan ring my office phone at midnight. It's actually rambling about me. And they try to ring over and over again because of the advert on Facebook. I was just like, crazy bastards. Well, they know where the bloody office is. I hope they're not in the UK. I don't want someone bloke to turn up with an axe. Yeah, he's gonna fell a tree but not me. So there are plenty of mental people out there. Well, we know that again, just media. Sad. But to to not lose sight of the question, has he run ads to attract clients? Yes. So and you could combine this with your niche, couldn't you? You could target it doesn't even have to be Reddit. But Reddit's an example. If there's a sub Reddit or three for a niche, or a type of thing, you could write an informative post in the show notes. I don't know if this is a show, I'm not that professional. In the video notes at the end, I'll link to Gills post which he's promoted. So it's an ad. So you can get an idea. So essentially, it's free information. It's detailed. It doesn't sell anything doesn't pitch. And he uses his proper name. So why can you not use that strategy and you could write out five or six really decent posts and cycle them, you know, do one a week for six weeks and see if you get anyone knock on your door. Yeah, because people will look for you once they see a name. You don't have to spend a lot of money. I mean, how much are you spending a day on Reddit? Let's see, I spend about 150 a month. So hardly anything. I think it's like five bucks a day. Crazy. And you've landed your biggest client. Yes, that has made, I think 10,000 X Well, I'm trying to think I know we got a client that is around 60,000 a year from that. And then we got one that's well into six figures for us revenue. Nice. Since the beginning, I have maybe spent $2,000 on Reddit ads. You can see a flood of Reddit ads coming.
