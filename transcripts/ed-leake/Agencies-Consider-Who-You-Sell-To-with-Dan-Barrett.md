## Transcript
Well, actually, it's interesting. I was talking to an agency owner the other day, and he was saying he had started his own agency and then kind of gone out of business, gotten a job at an agency, he's trying to come back, but he's like, you know, it's real scary. He tried to, it was during the pandemic and everything, it was tough times, right? And he was like, I'm trying to reach, I don't know, it's like three K a month SEO service or whatever he's trying to reach is like really big companies, and he's doing direct outreach like over LinkedIn. And he was like, it never worked. And I know everyone tells me that it works. Every coach I've ever had told me to do direct outreach, and it just never figured out how to make it work. And I was like, you're selling to really sophisticated savvy buyers, really smart people who know marketing. When was the last time anybody of those bought something off a cold email? I haven't watched a webinar in like five years, right? Your sales process, which is maybe buy it, maybe don't, you know, I like it. That actually, to me, is perfect because I'm like, that attracts me as sophisticated buyer who spends money on educational stuff. But like the harder you try to pitch me, the more I pull back, right? Like I'm not signing up for your 14 piece email honor respond. Just not. But I'm the same clients. And this is the, I think, I think this is what I teach. I am the same. I am not Blase, but I am taking or leave it. So here's the factual position. What I think it could do for you. But I certainly don't want your money unless you're convinced yourself. Exactly. And it's not in those words in total. Sometimes I pitched literally like that. Very successful, which is why I avoid like the plague doing a follow up or a pitch to a prospect that I know isn't a good fit. Because it seems to amplify the situation because they know what's coming when you start the conversation on the second call or whatever. And you're like, don't think it's going to work for this reason for that reason. And they're like, they don't want to take no for an answer. And then if you like me a bit soft, you start feeling bad and decisions because you're like, oh, maybe we can help this person. But website shy and the product's wrong. And there's something that it's like, yeah, but we're good at Google ads. It's yeah, it doesn't it fixes so much until it doesn't right and then screwed.
