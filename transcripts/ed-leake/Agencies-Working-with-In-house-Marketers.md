Your job as an agency is to make that marketing manager or marketing director look good in his business or her business. So the important thing about in-house staff as an agency like us working with in-house staff is only one thing they need. It's not communications. It's not what it's they need to look good. Your job as an agency is to make that marketing manager or marketing director look good in his business or her business in their company. I hired this agency because they got whatever. Don't make them look shit. Essentially, that's the job. I've wanted to make that pretty clear. You've got to make them look good. In the perfect world, you'd have your technical person, your Google ads specialist talking directly to the client. Because they're on the account. They know the account. The client will get the direct response. Downside is what happens with that person sick or they leave. So you can blend the work and I would always I would always blend the work. Essentially do the cohort thing where people swap jobs or they audit each of us account every month or two or whatever. Or you get two people on a call or get a bit of a job share going on. Because if someone leaves, they can they might pill for the client or the client leaves because they like that person. So there are downsides to that, which is why I fall back to the a good senior person who's going to stick around because you treat them well. The clients like them. They like the client comms. They know the technical stuff. They are steering so they they don't manage a hundred accounts, but they are in the hundred accounts or 10 or 50, whatever you've got. But finding that person I know is easier said than done, but they are they do exist. Awesome. Thanks. Yeah, obviously, that's just what I'm going through at the moment. So just thought I'd ask the group here. So I appreciate all that journey. My one super interested in that. Yeah, this is the power of the groups. Not, you know, I'm just a talking head as people go through these journeys and experiences, then you got to share it because it helps everyone else. And you are helped in turn by people sharing their thing. So that's the power of these groups.
