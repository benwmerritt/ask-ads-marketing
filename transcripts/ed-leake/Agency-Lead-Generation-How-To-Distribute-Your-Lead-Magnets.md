If you think about when what triggers you to click on something, it will often be a case study, particularly numbers. You know, if someone shows you before and after, it's that juicy after, isn't it? My experience after we did the actual creating better ads, I think that was definitely not the right move. So what I was looking at was rebuilding it as kind of the whole strategy. And breaking it down into phases, you know, what do you do if you're spending less than 10k? What do you do if you're trying to scale? What do you do at each step? And how do you implement that? Putting that into a big kind of like strategy thing. Giving it away for for using that as a lead magnet and then seeing if we can convert better people from that. Yeah, I yes, if I was in the opposition, I'd do the the tiering is a good idea of of bucket your prospects by spending or that sort of thing and give away the strategy as lead gen. You're going to get a lot of volume through that. I would have thought you get hundreds, if not more. But I don't know sometimes putting up a fee, a price on a lead magnet, even people with money, it just stops them because it's another step. And if your time stopped, it doesn't matter if it's $20 or $200. It's something that's just like, I just want to get it and have a look at it and see if it's right. Because if you get someone to have a look at it and it's right, and that little step saves you save them having to check out. And I know you're trying to pay for your ads. I know you try to sort of cover off cover off the acquisition costs. But I would yeah, I would be tempted to throw some money at it when it's free and see, see if any quality drips through. Yeah, before doing the $27, it's not like it's $200. And I was a madman, I spent $70,000 on Facebook selling God tier ads for $99 a couple of years ago. And I made that work just about it wasn't that profitable. But some mad people are selling cheap products on Facebook. I've stopped doing it now. Give me a heart attack anyway. You're doing what you shared anyway previously that I've put in. We can run through some numbers like, let's go last full month. Yeah, I think the number would be interesting because you're going aggressive at this. I think I'd say that you're at the top level of you're getting hundreds. So it's interesting to see that perspective. So spending about $3,000 a month on TikTok ads, cost per click is sitting about $2.61 averaged over a full month. About 748 clicks, about a 35 or 34% conversion rate, depending on the day. Cospo leads sitting at about $10, $10.26 ending out at about 190 or so leads. And that's the last kind of full month that I've done. And it just really depends on where the business is at. Like I will scale it up, scale it down some months. I'm like, I'm like right now I'm bugged for work. I've had people that have come back from months previously and they've signed on for big packages. And so I'm like, okay, cool. That's half the ad spend at the moment. I just pull it right back down because I don't want to overwork the guys or any of the staff or anything along those lines. And that's just, is that just going an advert to your lead magnet or are you essentially boosting content as well? So all my organic stuff, I would never do a call to action on it. It's just that top of funnel, hey, this is what I do, becoming a face on the platform. Here's how to do this. Here's how to do that. Just going ahead and giving information out there. And then I would do the right hooks on ads. You know what I mean? Hey, I've gotten this results more case study kind of based. Hey, I've gotten these kind of results for these kinds of people. As you can see here, as you can see here, as you can see here doing that kind of stuff. And then say, if you want to download our six bullet proof strategy so you can get results like this, hit the link below. Boom. And it just kind of generates leads left front and center. But that is going specifically very broad. I'm just saying my qualifying in the ad is, hey, are you running Google ads? I'm not saying, hey, are you running Google ads and you're spending over $10,000 or hey, are you an e-commerce saw that's spending $10,000 on e-commerce on Google ads? Something I'm just going extremely broad. So I can just get as many leads as possible, build out that email newsletter. And then I've got the options of building out the community down the line to come a bit more of an authority to go back in the day when I was doing content marketing. The first thing I started doing 2012, whatever, but I rarely shared actual case study. So I get the farm away, I get all the strategies and everything. But the case I didn't then back it up with what did you call it? The right hook? Is that a Gary V term? Oh, yeah, whatever. Yeah. So I'm sorry, it is. He does use that. Yeah. Yes. So it's like give, give, give, but then proof, give, give, give, then proof. So it's not the case study is not necessarily called to actions, but they are the, it's the bait on the end of the hook, isn't it? It's just giving some something to nibble on. Otherwise, it's purely informational. And if you think about when what triggers you to click on something, it will often be a case study, particularly numbers. You know, if someone shows you before and after, it's that juicy after, isn't it? So that's just a me reminding myself and everyone, if you do prospect this way, you do content marketing, you do share, don't forget to drop in the old case study, or even just a before and after.
