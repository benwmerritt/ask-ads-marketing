Are you overworking your Google Ads account? And this is in the context of an agency or freelance, or perhaps you're in house and managing a Google Ads account. So I've always preached, or I think I've always preached, to keep it simple. Because I think most people overwork their Google Ads account in a way that they're trying to find something to fix. So they're trying to find that 1% edge, which might exist, but it's diminishing returns. So you could put the same amount of hours into 90% of the performance as you could that final 1%. And is it really worth it? Is it really worth putting in the same amount of energy and resources to try and polish that very final little bit? Perhaps if you're bored, you've got nothing else to do. But this is the problem. I've seen this firsthand that PPC managers and Google Ad managers, marketers, they turn up to a Google Ads account and they look at it and they analyze it in quotation marks. And they're looking for stuff. They're looking for things. This is not the way. I mean, I'm biased because I obviously produce a big framework, a big checklist that you can rock up to and follow and systematically work through every week on each account. So instead of being stuck in that analysis paralysis mode, you're actually being a bit more proactive working through your optimizations. But is that actually proactive, truly proactive? Or is it more reactive? It's kind of in the middle. And I think most people are too reactive to their ads account. Oh, we've overspent. Oh, we're underspending. Oh, our cost conversions gone up. And you're reacting to the metrics constantly. You're not looking ahead at how you can improve going forwards. And the proactive approach would be to say, we have this fundamental concern, this category of products or this specific service that we offer, it is underperforming against the rest of the account. Instead of just going through your checklist every week, how about putting a test or theory in place? So it's like, okay, we need to increase the performance by X. So we are going to try something. We're going to try something on the website. We're going to try something with our client, with the pricing or with the offer or some different angle. We're going to do something different that isn't just following the motions each and every week through going through the Google ads account, because that's not going to get you very far. So you have to think ahead and you have to think about testing something. There's got to be a hypothesis as well. It's like, here's the idea. What do we expect to happen? It's in a positive result of this test. We hypothesize that this is the outcome and that's a proactive response to performance, not reacting and firefighting all the time. So straightforward, you identify the problem, you come up with a solution, your hypothesis that you want to test and guess what? You test it. Three simple steps. If your test proves to be positive, then you implement. Rinse, repeat.
