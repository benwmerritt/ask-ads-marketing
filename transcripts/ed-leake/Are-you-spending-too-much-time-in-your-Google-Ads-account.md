I'll give you an anecdotal story from start the year. I've stopped taking on consulting clients the lucrative But they're pain in the arse and I the very last one I took on I refunded because It was in the what do you call it? It's American aesthetics essentially like dental and that sort of thing but sort of mid high end so the jobs are a few grand upwards and I won't mention any names, but the chat came to me with the account Pucker the account was sweet Well structured really tight On top of the negatives add copy really good keyword selection obvious but smart Not overly large count pretty you know modest, but the right you know compact account for the right spend And it wasn't working just wasn't hitting CPA target, but I think it was double And if you look to that account you go through it and go Honestly, I don't know what more you could do, but then We looked the very last thing we look stop looking at the landing pages no dedicated landing pages and the website was very Generic dental practice kind of yeah, yeah big tail It was a it was a relatively new practice. I think it'd been going six months or something No case studies or examples that I think was one down buried down the page no Google reviews No, all the trust signals not there and then literally I was like right name one competitor in the area We jumped straight across page full of before and after page full of testimonials and case studies and reviews and quotes and Google review logo prominent this that the other I said doesn't matter about the price mate. Yeah, doesn't matter how good It doesn't matter if those guys are twice the price They're gonna beat the crap out of you because they've done the work. They've got the trust that can prove it You've got this immaculate Google ads account the website the client is letting you down with that website, but you you should know As an expert that that ain't good enough But the problem is he's an expert in the Google ads and the Google ads are really good But the Google ads. Yeah, it's a vehicle to get to the destination But the destinations off the side of a cliff. You're just buying traffic Yeah, Google ads is just you're buying traffic. You're not buying results even e-commerce We think you can optimize it. You're buying traffic to go to a website Our Google ads Facebook a Microsoft ads It's there to get traffic not to get leads and not to get sales the website the landing page the lead page Whatever it is that's where the conversion comes from people don't see that people don't really understand that Google ads is not Google ads anymore It's all saying this to Corey Lindt home how I do my podcast with is I go How much of your time do you spend in the account versus outside the account? I said 20% in 80% out. He's like 10% in 90% out Most of really good high effective advertising is not in the account And if you want to be a really powerful advertiser, you've got to be looking at Google ads Facebook ads Microsoft ads Google analytics Google tag manager feed optimization merchant center You've got to know like funnels and conversions conversion at optimization. You've got to know so many things that a Third-party software or like tool is not going to have that intelligence It's really about having the intelligence of what the business is where their gap is Understanding the human issue as well and then mixing it with the technology as well So when people come looking for a Google ads expert, they're looking for someone to help them get leads or someone to get sales But they think the medium of Google ads is that but it's not it's only one step in that journey and this day and age You don't like man five ten years ago. You could get away with it Yeah, now you just get slaughtered if you just get a Google ad specialist Who's the master of Google ads and that's it you'll be slaughtered because you just will not get the results Hey, ten years ago. It was me. I didn't we barely did landing pages didn't really worry But there was less competition 14 years ago should I say it was less competition. Yeah, it was a bit easier It just seemed to be easier. I don't know why but Yeah, so if you'll start here and you're all in on your Google ads account and you can't you're thinking Where's that next five percent coming from? Forget about it Look outside the account because five percent is normally 25 percent You know tweaks to landing pages or helping the client with the offer or just doing a bit of recon and looking what's out there Properly the competitors and so what do they got? What have we got? You know, what are we saying that they're not and you know, just join the bloody dots and finding something To break through the noise And we're you know with econ that often means that you're just me too. You're just competing with them on price Sadly, but that's that's a product problem. That's not a Google ads problem You know, if you'll compete some people have messaged me and said how how do I compete with Amazon? I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? You know, it's just that is the wrong fight Like fancy that. Yeah, yeah, I bought a a board a container full of these products that I know sell really well on Amazon How do I now compete with? Yeah, like well, I mean, I guess you could rewind 30 40 years start from when the internet started and Go from there. Yes You know pick the pick the right fights
