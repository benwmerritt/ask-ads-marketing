## Transcript
I think in the past two months we've had our biggest growth yet, implementing a lot of the strategies from within the material within the forge. Hey, this is Sam from Atomic Marketing and just want to share my experience with the Agency Forge. So before joining Agency Forge, there was really no online community for Google Ads agencies, and it was really hard to find information specific to running a Google Ads agency. There's a lot of stuff out there on Facebook agencies and how to grow your own social media marketing agency, but nothing as specialist as there is with the forge. So what I've learned from within the forge is a whole bunch of different tactics, strategies and just general ideas of how to grow your Google Ads agency. I've learned a heck of a lot from all the different members inside, not only from Ed, but all the other members within the community are so knowledgeable, they've been there before and they share, they really openly share all their strategies that they're using to grow their agency, whether that be pricing, their own marketing, their doing proposals, pretty much everything to do with building up your agency and being able to grow it. The best thing is that it really is specific to Google Ads agencies. I really just want to thank the community because I've been learning so much and in the past, I think in the past two months, we've had our biggest growth yet, implementing a lot of the strategies from within the material within the forge. So thank you Ed, thanks to the community, it's been really great and look forward to continuing.
