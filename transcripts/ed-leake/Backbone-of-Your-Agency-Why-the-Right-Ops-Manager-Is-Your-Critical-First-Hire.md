It's a massive trust builder, if just being reliable, boring and reliable is good. Because if they're really good, you want them to stick around because this will be a pivotal role. First full time hire, if you have your time again, was she the right, was that the right role to hire for? Or would you do something different? Well, yes, ultimately, yes. And whenever I meet up with my other agency friends, some of them who don't have a strong ops person, they say, hey, Tom, you're lucky just because I have to deal with this stuff. So I would say that it does require a specific type of person with specific type of maybe capabilities and character traits. Her background is in finance and accounting. So she's got bachelors in finance, masters in accounting. Also, she's super direct, which is good because you have to be direct with people to solve problems. Most clients like it, most people like being told directly. She doesn't deal with clients though. She does with some. And the main reason is that we actually have lost one account manager who and we just had to maintain the relationship. She she picked over, just the account manager was reporting to her. But that's going to change as soon as we have a new team member on board it. But technically, based on her role, doesn't. But at the same time, she needs to act as a buffer. You know, somebody leaves, you know, she needs to cover for that until the person is, you know, until a new hire is in place. Can she do Google ads? Yeah. Yeah. So brilliant. So she's like, she was an analyst, you know, in corporate America. So she does that. And also she was great on Google ads. But the perfect first hire, I believe. I mean, trained her on Google ads, essentially. Yeah. And an operation ahead of operations, even if it's not in name. But I think that's the perfect hire, someone who handles operations, even if that's just handling the Google ads accounts, the reporting and some of the client comms. You have to have someone who's very methodical and who's process driven. It's almost like someone's like, not like a sports car, but someone's like freight train. Once they get, you know, you know, pretty much like their momentum, like they move no matter what, what the roadblocks is. Because, you know, clients will leave, you know, team members will leave, you know, there will be problems, you know, all kinds of, but like moving and, you know, going further. So, so, so overall, you know, I'm very, very, happy that she joined my team because, yeah, because of those qualities, because, you know, that's a consistency and making sure that pretty much like things are working the way they're supposed to work. One client said, Scoob is run like a well-oiled machine. And that was a more of a compliment to her, which was like, got done on time. And it was just like, you know, the way the, you know, the way the client, you know, expected. So I'd say like, that's the role that you need to have. It's a massive trust builder. If just being reliable, boring and reliable is good. Yes. Yes. And, and, uh, yeah. One thing that maybe was challenging sometimes is that some more technical things, cause I'm always like deep into like more technical issues, but like, like highly technical areas, maybe it's not necessarily her, you know, strength, but I would say like the fundamentals, you know, client communication, you know, making sure that like stuff is done for us, like pretty much like everything is working. That's, I would say is her strength. And I've noticed that, you know, you need more of that, you know, maybe like 80% of that and maybe 20% of that sometimes, but I can always, or other team members, they can help with like some more technical aspects. Yeah. Everyone tries to hire a unicorn. And it's again, thanks to bloody social media where you're told that, you know, you need to hire a unicorn, but we, you hire for the primary role and any, any additional skills or experience is a bonus. Like if you're head of operations, you should be in this context, you should be decent at Google ads, but you shouldn't be the, you don't have to be the best because most likely as the agency grows, there'll be another person under that head of operations or, you know, head of performance, whatever we call them, who is the Google ads pure geek. There might be multiple and ultimately there might be people under those. If you hire someone in this role, which I think is a very good idea, especially when you're at the 20, 25 K a month mark for Google ads agencies, quite similar for SEO agencies. But I think if you hire someone in that position, you need to quickly identify. And when I say quickly, with the period of months, the bits they don't enjoy, because if they're really good, you want them to stick around, because this will be a pivotal role for your agency's growth and your head as well. Because it unlocks so much of your time and mental energy, not doing all the bloody work. But you have to understand what they don't like. So then you can hire for their pains as well. So you're preparing for that next level, because you freed up your time, you go off and do your marketing and it works because you've now got time to do it. And then your head of ops is fatigued or frustrated by these things, where you hire for those because you're now trying to protect your head of operations. So you have to think about that. We divide and conquer. There are certain issues that we do talk a lot about these different issues. And I advise, I help out on certain things, same thing on her. Like sometimes I need to like, hey, we're negotiating a certain deal with the client. We talk, we kind of think things through together to ensure that we come up with the best possible solution, because that's how we grow together. Because you can't know it at all. And you typically just need like a third party perspective to come up with a good decision. Sometimes it won't change the outcome, but at least you have heard like, hey, somebody's thinking maybe in a slightly different way.
