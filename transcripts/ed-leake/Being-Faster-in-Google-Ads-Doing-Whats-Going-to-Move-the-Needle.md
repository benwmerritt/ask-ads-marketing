Hi, my name is Nathan Von Fimetti. I got originally got God Tier ads because it was recommended by Nils Roushman and Kasim Aslam and I really respect those guys. So for me, that was absolutely no brainer. Once I saw that they've taken the course and gotten great results, I figured I would do it as well. And honestly, God Tier ads is probably the best Google ads training I've taken. I've taken numerous trainings. My biggest apprehension before I got the courses is that most trainings are a bit underwhelming. They might just cover theory or some tactics, but maybe not telling you why to do it or the context and why you would or would not. I think what God Tier ads apart is that they have the theory, they have the step-by-step implementation and also case studies on how they view certain techniques and also give you a lot of context and nuance and maybe not want to use certain techniques. And so in my opinion, that's really what I was looking for in the course because I'm most self-taught in Google ads. I've worked both in-house and in an agency, but I thought that it really lacked process. And for me, not having a good process or a good system based off standard operating procedures, I get a bit of anxiety just not being 100% sure, am I getting the best out of the platform? And some of the standard operating procedures in the course that I really like or frameworks, I guess, is the scripts. Well, I use a lot of the scripts to automate repetitive tasks. I like the section on campaign build-outs and the section on optimization for the count, both weekly and monthly, just making sure that you're doing the right amount of optimizations to really move the needle, not necessarily over-optimizing the counter, under-optimizing the count. And so I feel like what I've really improved on is just being fast from the account and doing the real 80-20 on what's going to move the needle. Ed does a great job. The section on how they do audits is great. And so really, I can't recommend the course enough. Again, I'm not a fillet. I just believe in the product. So whether you're new to PPC or you've done it for a long time, I think anyone can learn from the course. So I highly recommend it.
