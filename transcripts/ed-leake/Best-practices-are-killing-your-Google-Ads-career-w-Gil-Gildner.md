When people get too statistical and too caught up in attributing every single click, when they get too locked in to the data, when that data is taken away, they're just like floating at sea lost. Welcome to the first episode of Overbudget, the show that shows you how to avoid screwing up your digital marketing career. Today's guest is the co-owner of Disco Sloth, a Google Ads agency with a relentless focus on creating profit for their clients. He's also the writer of great books, such as Becoming a Digital Marketer and an Orthodoxy, both very good reads that I highly recommend, and a product of the great state of Arkansas. We've somehow convinced him to give us 30 minutes of his time for free. Welcome Gil. I didn't know it was free. Congratulations, you've been scammed by another Indian. Wow. Wow. I don't know how I feel about that. Well, I'm glad to be here. Awkward silence. Hi Gil, thanks Ashwin for doing the intro. What's the name of the show for everyone? Overbudget. Overbudget. I like it. That's obviously not my idea because good. Excellent. Gil, I had a lot of fun reading an Orthodoxy. It felt really cathartic and familiar to me. One of the things that you talk about in the book is that the old internet is dead, and it really does feel that way. Apply that principle to Google Ads. What do people need to do to succeed today? And in terms of skills, abilities, how people think about PPC and campaigns and marketing in general? Yeah, of course the internet's still there and it's growing more than ever, but I use that term. The old internet is dying because it looks so much different. It used to be very decentralized. It used to be distributed. Everyone had their own little blogs, their own little communities, and now it's platform centric. And I think that is literally like echoed in ads, every ad platform. Increasingly, it feels like instead of advertising and reaching customers that are out in the open general internet, we're reaching people within the platform. For Google Ads, which is our specialty, it feels more and more almost like social ads of a few years ago, where you're just reaching everybody within Google's ecosystem. It's harder and harder. It's still very possible. Google, I think, is the best platform to do this, but it's harder to just reach the universal internet. So what that means is basically everything's becoming super platform centric. I find that frustrating. I think a lot of folks who've been on the internet for a while find that frustrating. It feels now that things are very ephemeral. And I think Google Ads folks are having to come to terms with that. For the few people that haven't read your book, Gil, what's the synopsis? What's a two sentence summary of that book? Don't be contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. Add critical thinking into your career and life in general. And that's kind of wrapped in digital marketing, I would say, and put through the lens of digital marketing because that's where I've spent my entire life. But it's more just like, feels like people are being funneled into orthodoxy. The internet is homogenizing. The world is homogenizing. And because of that, we get trapped in best practices, which need a heavy air quote. You can see massive results just by stepping outside of those best practices, being unorthodox. You've led me into a question there. Can you give an example of one of these? Ashwin's read the book and I haven't. And I apologize before we record this. I've read Gil's other book. I bought 47 copies of Gil's other book. That's not a joke or a meme. But I've not bought this one, so I do apologize. So can you give an example? And if I'm putting you on the spot, we can add it this bit out. Putting me on the spot, but let's see best practices. I think my favorite example is we are a very low volume agency. We've gone upmarket, but we have intentionally fewer clients every year. What I do to land these clients is I give them incredibly detailed free advice, free audit, deep dive into their, sometimes into their P&L. It's a lot of work. I put, it's worth hours and hours, if not days of pre-work for free. And I throw it all of them, you know, take it, don't go with us, use this, implement this. That has, for some reason, made people angry because apparently I've been told directly it cheapens the industry. And maybe it does. I don't really care because it gets me clients. That I've been told so many times by probably a dozen people that it's charged for your audits. Like, you know, people tell me, oh, we charged five grand for that kind of audit. We charged eight grand for that. I'm like, yeah, but I made 100K last year from that client. So, and I know that's not a good, that's not a good example because that's not an uncommon thing to do. But it's something that rubs some people the wrong way. And I'm fine with it. That to me is like bucking up best practice, if that makes sense. So the nuance there would be how do you avoid, because you can't, it's a lot of work to do a proper audit. And I don't mean a free audit as in like the checklist I've got. And I'm sort of pissing on my own work there. It's just does a little audit checklist that you can get for free. It's not a proper audit. You're on about digging into the business data and aligning that and obviously consulting with the prospect because it's not yet a paying client. You can't do that at scale. So how do you stop it becoming a issue where you're just burning all your time doing these free audits looking for red flags? I don't do it at scale. I think that the trick there is pre qualifying and being super selective. We don't onboard many people, maybe three or four clients a year. I only want to do three or four audits a year. If we if we do one of these, we probably 100% will get the client. I think they're that good. And they're a lot of work. But I don't do it for people that I'm not interested in. I only do it if I like love these guys. That answers the question. Yeah. You'll be very selective. You're doing what I used to do. It's sort of like a pre checklist to say, do I want to work with these kind of work with them? Are they going to be a good fit? Yadda, yadda, yadda before just doing, turning out free audits because about most people just turn out free audits for the sake of it. So yeah. And this has evolved from the beginning where we were desperate for cash and we just needed to work and we just take anybody if they had money in a pulse like welcome. Yeah. But we have the luxury and not everybody does, but now we can be selective. So but I've been accused of that in the past because people are like, oh, well, I need to make ends meet. I need to make the money. If you're just starting out, you need to cover the bills. Then obviously take on what, you know, more risk in that you take on a wider array of clients potentially. But yeah. So there's just a lot of being selective up front about this. If I could change things that we did in the past, I would have, even if it was rough, I would have been more selective earlier on. I would have made that pivot early on at the time. Just didn't have the experience or and maybe had some fear or maybe I was just poor, you know, like I just didn't want to take that step. When we started doing it, it got better and better and easier and easier. And now it's a no brainer. Yeah. So I think that if I made a straight agreement, I would be way more selective, way more selective and ignore the money. If you're absolutely desperate to put food on the table, then fair enough. I really like that example because it's a perfect illustration of maybe this isn't the right term, but group think, you know, and it's like the herd says, this is what we're going to do for our collective benefit. And I think there's a certain level at which that kind of thinking makes sense. Is this really what's best for the industry? You're both agency owners. I'm very recently into consulting. Prior to this, I was employed in full time work for 14 years of my career. And I've always done the extra work for job interviews. And I'm very selective about which jobs I apply to, but I put a ton of effort into them. And I'll do like prep work. I'll do idea sheets. And I'll show up for the interview or, you know, if I get into like the second or the third round, I might even come in with a document detailing some of my ideas. And that has always helped me nail interviews. I've not done a ton of interviews in my career, but I have a really high close rate because I'm willing to do the work that other people are not willing to do. And I think when it comes to marketing and marketing practice, every part of marketing, you know, SEO or PPC or product marketing, there is this group of it's not always individuals. Sometimes it's organizations that kind of dictate how things are supposed to be done. This is how you're supposed to do inbound marketing. You're supposed to do the articles that target these keywords, even if they have nothing to do with your brand or your business. You pump them out, you go out and you buy backlinks and boost yourself up in the SERP. That's like, why? Why are you doing all of that if it doesn't translate into business? Why are you marketing your product a certain way or building your website a certain way? Is it because there's a hierarchy that makes sense to the psychology of the buyer or is it because everybody else is doing it? You know, and you see on LinkedIn, it's the same advice being regurgitated as these, I've got a hundred tips on how you can position your product comment piece of crap to get the guide. How many people are getting those guides? Like a lot of people don't read them, but if you're assuming that people do actually read them, everybody's implementing the same stuff. Where are you actually thinking for yourself and saying, I'm doing this because here's my logic, here's my rationale. And that insertion of critical thinking back into the process that I think is critical. It's one of the things I lodged onto in the book. Yeah, one thing that kind of made us start pivoting is I realized I don't want to be the best of everyone else. I just want to be the best at whatever I like to do and whatever I'm really good at. If there's a million practitioners of Google ads out there, I don't necessarily want to be the world's best Google ads practitioner. I want to be the world's best midsize to enterprise, you know, e-commerce, you know, Google ads shopping, Merchant Center next practitioner. Or, you know, I could, you could, you could just dig the pit deeper and deeper. I don't want to be the world's best Google ads person. That's same. That's first of all, impossible. Second of all, it's uninteresting. It's boring. I want to be very highly specific at something much easier for me to do because it's probably more what DiscoSauth is. We have a small team. We were flexible, but we don't have the interest or the bandwidth to just be everything for everybody. And I think when people try to do that, they kind of fall flat because nobody can be the best at everything. That's a really interesting thing. You know, when you talk about not being everything to everybody and then you marry it to the concept of thinking for yourself. Let's go a little bit into how people actually make that transition in terms of their mindset. So with Google ads, a lot of it historically has been the numbers, the data, the analytics and marketing in general has trended in that direction where we've forsaken qualitative insights, experience, gut feeling based on that experience. And I think some of that does need to come back a little bit. I'm not saying don't look at the numbers, don't look at the data, but basing your decisions strictly on what the analytics tell you without interpreting what it potentially means. That seems to be a roadblock that comes up a lot. How does somebody who's been raised in that mindset or that way of doing business, how do they kind of break out of that diet of numbers? I don't think there's anything wrong with that diet of numbers. Historically, that is what made paid search, for example. So it's set apart from other platforms, the attribution, the granularity. So that's still important. It still sets it apart. But I think what I've seen is when people get too statistical and too caught up in attributing every single click, you know, when they get too locked in to the data, when that data is taken away, they're just like floating at sea lost. They haven't fostered that creativity and the kind of critical thinking of like, well, what if brand and awareness is OK? Like what if it is important? Because they've been so like for the past 10 years, they've just been dialed in on triple whale, just like, oh, where did this click come from? Well, Google pulls a little bit from you and then they're just, they're handicapped by indecision. They're just, I have no idea what to do now. But, you know, the thing is, when a platform adds new features, if Google ads adds a new feature, there's not going to be any new data that comes along with that feature. You got to test, you got to experiment, you got to try things out. So it feels like a lot of those folks who are too in the, you know, buried in the spreadsheets, they're not earlier early adopters on some of the newest things you can do because they're kind of afraid of it. It's back to basics, like very, very basic marketing, I think. And I wish more people kind of took the risk. If you look at like luxury products, a Birkenbag or a Rolex or something like that, like they don't have to use a lot of like PPC because they've built that brand over 100 years as marketers and PPC folks. We see this every day when we're working with some brands or more well known than others, guess which is easier to sell on Google ads? A lot of folks have, I think, suffered because they're just too caught up in the numbers. Some of it is gut and some of it is, I just think, good taste. You have to, but yeah, I don't know how tangible it is. The issue is there are a lot of the new features coming out compound this problem because they strip Google features, they strip data. So if you're heavily reliant on the data, you need to see how we converge on every single search query. Well, it's already being stripped out and you get a new platform function come up like performance max. You don't get the search queries. I know they start to ease them in over time. But I'm going off pieced a little bit because then we jumped to brand and I immediately know the pushback from most PPC managers because most PPC managers don't deal with enterprise or particularly large businesses because most businesses are small, small to medium. And they will be saying, well, my bomber down the road doesn't have a brand presence. So how does this make sense to them? So sorry, God, you answer that. I have a great example. You brought up plumber small businesses have very tight budgets and I understand that. But there is a plumber in my town who drives around in his van and on the side of the driver door, he has like his butt sitting on the toilet. So it looks like he's driving around town with his pants down and he's sitting on a commode and there's several different vans. All his people drive him around. It's hilarious. And everybody knows about this plumber. He he has mastered brand in Fayetteville. And if I have to call a plumber, I'm only thinking of him. Regardless of how small your budget is, if brand is not important to you, I think you're failing. I just think it there is there is a disconnect. It doesn't matter how small you are. This guy probably spends a thousand dollars a month in Google ads. Doesn't matter. And he spent a one off thousand dollars per truck to have the vinyl laid up and that's it and that will pay him back forever. But that is top tier brand marketing and not everyone could be a top tier come up with creative ideas like that. Let's say you're average and you know, you know, you try and but maybe you've only been doing it six months. You are going to hide yourself in the Google ads account because it's the safest thing to do. You're going to sit there every day, log in and look at the numbers because it's the safest thing to do. And I don't need to belittle people. I used to do it and I cheated. I built a personal brand, which is cheating in the in the world of branding because it's just using my stupid face. Let's touch on the bit in the book. I mean, this is after his question that I'm stealing, but I do want to ask you a question about stupid. Go ahead. I think it'll sound brilliant coming from you. Gil, you say that most people are stupid. Is there a difference between being stupid and realizing that you're stupid and taking steps to fix it? What's the context in the book for that question to be asked? Yeah, that's that makes me sound a little misanthropic. So I actually think the question sort of answers itself, which is if if you realize you're stupid, you're not stupidity to me is inflexibility or having your your head so far in the sand that you have no idea what's going on. Guarantee you if you wake up and you're like, I'm not getting this, something's something's something's there that I'm not getting. You're not stupid. You're not stupid. You're actually probably much smarter than the vast majority of folks because you know how stupid you are because we're all stupid. I'll just own this and alienate the rest of the PPC world. But a lot of really intelligent people, even, you know, in Google ads are technically smart and practically stupid because they're inflexible and they're handicapped by their own ego. And I think that a truly adept smart person will always be a little curious, you know, if they have preconceptions, they'll change them when they're proven wrong. The test and ideas, a lot of folks get hung up on the fact that GA4 doesn't have, you know, graphs that are as pretty as universal analytics. And it's true. It's true. I hate GA4, but I can't get hung up on that. There's people out there like thinking in 2021 Google ads terms. These are some smartest people I know, but they're not helping themselves or their clients. And because of that, practically stupid. We're dealt a certain hand. You got to play the cards. I can't go in and change GA4. You know, I think it's just that flexibility. Yeah, it's not. It's complaining to put barriers up in the way, which is what smart people do. I know I used to do it. You put you create barriers because you don't like the reality. You want a different answer, right, which won't come. So you put a barrier in your way. It's all well and good beating someone around the head saying, you're stupid. Do you realize you're stupid? And if they wake up and go, yeah, I realize I'm stupid. Brilliant. They're a woke, but not woke. Don't mix those two things up. Well, it's giving them something practical, though. So let's say they're going back to the plumber thing. If you're not good at branding, you can't. I can't force someone to be good at branding like creative and this and the other. But they could do other things, right? I mean, if you've got, you must have worked with someone that you know, PPC marketer, they've had a weakness and you just think, well, I can beat them over the head with this and try and make them better at it. Or I can send them off in this direction. I mean, what would be the practical again, pivoting from your book, but the practical advice? Be the best at what you are, not the best at everything. Just double down. If you are really good at one thing, do a lot more of it and get way better. It's, you know, as big as the world of PPC is, it's actually pretty small. It's not hard. It would be almost impossible to be the best in the world at PPC, but the PPC world is big, but it's not so big that you can't be in the top 10 of Merchant Center next. There are things you can find or, you know, maybe not just technology, but you probably, someone could be the best, the best Google ads person for veterinarians. You know, like it's not that hard. There's not that many people specialized in that, but there's enough veterinarians running Google ads that it could make you a million bucks. You know, like there's, so I think you just double down on what you're good at. If you know a lot about dogs and you love dogs and you love Google ads. Pets. Yeah, you're the pets Google ads person. If you're picking up that institutional and industry knowledge, safe to say that, like Gilda's with his audits and goes into the PNL and all these little details, like you could probably influence that business in ways that are not strictly limited to a Google ads account. I ran this landing page. I tried this kind of imagery. You should try this on your website. You should try this on social media and you can go back to your client and make other parts of their business equally valuable. Once we have a client there, I think our average client has been with us for over four years, so they stay with us, but that's because we're, we become part of the team and we don't just do Google ads anymore. We are essentially, we've got email addresses at most of these folks domains because we're that integrated into their team. Now we fly to their annual conferences and talk to their, you know, their staff getting to that point where you become an integral part of their team. It's just, that's what we're good at. We're good at the business part of it. We're good at understanding their financials. You know, financials, it's, yeah, Google ads is part of it. That's the service we provide, but everything else keeps us there. So, and it gets us great referrals. That's become the primary, you know, driver revenue for us. We're so integrated into folks because we're good at it and we like it that it's kind of like a no brainer that they're like, here's this other, you know, I'm moving to this business. I'm taking you along. Here's our new P and L go through this. Here's our margins. Tell us what we should be doing. And it, this is not something that an entry level PPC person could just drop into and do this, but not that long ago, I was an entry level PPC person. You know, like it's, you know, in 10 years, you could probably get into that, you know, as long as someone wants to do that, you find what you're good at and just double down and triple down. I think this also comes into the, you've got to stay curious and keen. You got to want it, haven't you? Because I know another question that's the obvious one that would come up off the back of this conversation is, well, AI is going to replace me. So I can't just focus on Google ads because AI is going to replace me. Insert platform name AI is going to replace me. And I've talked about million bloody times, but it's a loser's mindset, isn't it? We're not talking about stupidity now. We're talking about giving up. You've got to be honest with yourself. It's like, you've got to be keen and want to do it. You've got to want to learn. You've got to want to get, you know, if you would use the plumber as an example, the dogs is an example. And if you're, you know, if you want to do Google ads for dog walkers, you've got to be into the landing pages. You've got to be into the business metrics. You've got to understand how those businesses operate. Do you care? And if you don't, well, are you in the right job? I mean, screw AI and what's going to happen with that. Because that could be next week, it could be 10 years down the bloody line. So, yeah, you've got to be hungry for it. I was really hungry when I first started out. I just wanted to know everything there was to know about Google ads. And I think it does change the way you do business, if you actually like what you're doing. And if you fed up with, you say, you're going on a PPC manager of four years and fed up of freelancing and doing Google ads. Well, you'd probably scared to scrap the job because you're like, well, that's my bloody experience. It's like, OK, well, can you shift it to meta? You know, is there is there a world there that you can definitely translate those skills? Would you enjoy it more? You know, you can be a bit more creative. So, yeah, I think this does there's also that element of this, which comes into Ashwin's part about interviews as well. People putting effort in pre-interview, essentially fluffing them. You know, it's a pre fluff, isn't it? Or peacocking before you even get into the room. And it makes such a difference, makes such a difference. And a lot of it ties back to Ed's ultimate solution for Google ads professionals, which is thinking about all of this. And there's there's a card somewhere here right now that will take you to that video. OK, so we've called people stupid enough. I want to talk a little bit about Disco Sloth, because I think a lot of the principles you apply to build Disco Sloth into what it is today. You're very principled, Gil. What are those like one or two values that you hold dear that you expect Disco Sloths to uphold the things that help you stand out in this new internet and stay curious and stay hungry? You said you hated the word authenticity earlier, so I can't use that word. I found it was pretty important to. To not fake anything. Um, it's very tempting to fit into the preconceived notion of what, you know, what your agency is supposed to do and stand for and be. And you just look like every other successful agency. You know, you you you want to kind of want to. To keep, you know, keep on your guard and just play it safe. That burned me out for I did that for the first three years. I'll write the same articles for the same, you know, you know, PPC magazines, I'll I'll I'll go to the same, you know, podcast and say the same things and I'll just, you know, repeat the parrot, the talking points. And it burned me out. And I realized I was just doing a worse job of it than anyone else was. And so I kind of I had a pivotal moment. I had written an article about some I forget what it is, some boring, like universal analytics, something. Um, and I I used this term, I said, yeah, it's not very sexy. And I basically got canceled for that. Apparently that was misogynistic and all these people started piling on. And I was like, oh, no, like I'm I'm new in this industry. What did I say? What did I do? Like, is everyone going to hate me for calling like something unsexy? What's the cake? That's what I and then I just kind of realized this is so silly. If I can't use like and then I just started using the word sexy and everything. And it was very cathartic. It made me feel so good. You still do it. I still do it. Yeah. And I but that was kind of the thing of like, you know what, like this is silly. What a rat race. Like I don't need to like this was pre GPT. I am literally an AI, you know, like if if I'm just if I'm just regurgitating this nonsense, I'm helping no one else. I'm not helping myself. Disco sloth is no different. I'm just going to be opinionated. And yeah, I am, you know, I love PMAX. I still get, you know, dumped on for liking PMAX for some reason. I like it. It works for our clients, you know, for the vast majority of them. There's a lot of other things I can't mention that I'm a fan of. But that's not Google ads related. It's it's not Google ads related. No. You've got to be yourself. The problem is confidence cells and being yourself cells and it's also true to yourself. It's also it's a revelation when you can just say what you want within reason. I mean, I'm not going out like suggesting you go postal on people, but you have to do that from a position of power. Did you find that that happened when your agency was stable enough that you were like, well, you know, if I offend a few people, it's not that I'm still going to put my bread on the plate. I hate that about myself because, yes, I kind of realized like, oh, I wasn't I didn't have the balls to do this when I was struggling. You know, now we're doing fine. Our revenue could go to a third of what it is. I'd still be fine. OK, well, I should have grown those grown that pair a lot earlier and then I'd actually be principled, right? You were you told the line. So you became vanilla and essentially you were doing you weren't being true to yourself, which is 99 percent of people. I was the same. I remember the first first promotional video I did for our agency. My God, it's like there was a rod up my arse, like so formal and followed the pros and crap. And I was looking like an agency. And I will be honest, you know, once I hit a certain point, when I started to get hundreds of emails a month, people asking me for advice. I'm like, it's just me. Yeah, it gave me the confidence to say, you know what, fuck it, I'll say what I like and I'll do what I want. And if people don't like it, well, what what are they going to do? So the first newsletter, Ed Bytes, that got sent out because Ashwin assisted me with this. I think he wrote it, actually. So any time Ashwin does a piece of work, I say he assisted me. Horrible man that I am. I did the the image at the top saying yet another newsletter that you will not read or something to that effect. And it's just a newsletter and someone sent back a response that was essentially I love it. Essentially, you don't give a toss when you're winning because it's sort of like such a nonchalant email. It's like, oh, here's the shit I've been up to. It wasn't, you know, professional, particularly. It was just a bit of fun. And the fact that someone responded to that and acknowledged it. And so he wouldn't have been the only person. A lot of people would have seen that gone. It's just having fun. He's just being himself. And I think that's so important. So important. If I go back to the old versions of our website or homepage and I look at the copy we use and it's just cringy, so cringy. It's just like we use data driven, you know, data driven approaches to increase Google ads. It's like, OK, what bullshit? What bullshit? And now I have something about snowballs. The whole the whole like the homepage is just about rolling up snowballs. I it's just it's silly, but I don't care anymore. So I think it's better. It's I think also there's a little bit of safety in, you know, keeping your options open. So it's like if I keep everybody happy, everyone's a potential lead. Everyone's a potential client. And that bigger addressable market gives you a false. But very real feeling sense of security. The moment you realize what I'm offering is legitimate. People like it. I can get results and I can replicate those results. And those people are willing to go to bed for me. And I don't have to do all the talking. You get that business market fit, so to speak. That gives you a lot of confidence to say, all right, I no longer need to please everybody. And now I can focus on doubling down on what I really am at my, you know, like in my heart of hearts. I think if you've got a website now, if you're a small agency or a freelancer, not even a website of social media profile, and it's got a headline, it's got an intro, it's got about you. Would you take that and go to any random person in the street and read it to them and feel confident? Because I know that if you all just walked into some random person and start talking about snowballs, they might think he's slightly unhinged or even even a MAGA. But it's a joke. It's a joke. Anyway, well, as I go in with this, oh, yes. So you would go up to the street on the street day or night and you would talk about snowballs. Would you go up to someone and go, hey, I'm a data driven yadda, yadda, yadda. And they would be like, oh, wow, great. No. But would you go up and say, hey, snowballs, if you have a roll one, and they'd be like, I don't do that, nor should you. I think the message is in there somewhere. I don't know. So the show is called Overbudget. Going over budget is a rite of passage in Google Ads. It happens to everybody. You're not a bad marketer. It's just part of the process. But when you go over budget, one of two things happens. You either end up losing a job, you lose a client. There's some kind of consequence. And you either make the same mistake again or you learn from it. Right. And I think everybody has an over budget moment when it comes to their career. So, Gil, what's your moment? We took on a client we should not have. And this was back when we needed the money. And it was well paying, which is why we did it. And there were a lot of red flags, did not like the guy. He was demanding. He was angry. And it was three months of utter pain. You know, emails multiple times a day for three months. And, you know, we asked it was at that time. I think it was probably I think it was our largest client close to it. This was probably six years ago, maybe six or seven years ago now. And we just had to fire him. And it was one of those things where, yeah, like we did everything right, but nothing was attributed to us. All the failings of his business in other ways were dumped on us. I think he just liked the punching bag, but both Anya and Christina hated working with this company. I couldn't do it to him anymore. I couldn't handle emailing this guy. So that was. I think we had a conversation after that client where it's like. Even if we need the money, like we're not doing it. We can't take on someone who's just rude. It's we just can't do it. And once we started saying no to stuff like that, kind of the problem fixed itself. It's kind of incredible. You just say no. Like, it's like, no, no, thank you. Not interested. Sounds like me on speed dating. The other side of the table. Not interested. No, thank you. I completely regale. I've had a million of those over budget scenarios. I think mine are worse, though. Mine are not just taking on shit clients. Mine are allowing that to take over my life and missing one of my really good friends' weddings, wedding and using work as an excuse not to go, which still embarrasses me to this day that I didn't go to their wedding because, yeah, they're nice folk. But so, yeah, there's my over budget. Get your violin. Yeah. And that specific one for us, like personally, it was like overwhelming. It was kind of over. Yeah. And that was that the client wasn't really the problem there. It was that I for three months, I didn't say no and stressed about it. So, yeah, the luxuries of going up market, I guess. But I guess we all have to go through it. This is probably the hardest question, because I don't have an answer to this one. Something positive for 2025 that's going to come out of Google ads or related. Is there anything you are looking forward to? I actually am very optimistic about where Google could go from here. I've talked to a lot of folks working at Google. I've been out there a couple times in the past couple of years. I don't I'm not privy to any especially privileged information. They have a great team, like they're hampered by their bureaucracy. But there are some really smart people working there. And they do listen to people and it is changing. And I think Google ads will continue to be the best platform for a long time. Will I have a job in five years? I don't know. Probably not. I'll maybe be on a beach. I don't know. But until then, I think we'll be OK. So I'm I'm in general, I'm optimistic about Google ads. I'm not worried. It's the most positive way to end it. Ashwin, did you have like a horrible final question? Yeah, the one that I didn't ask is pretty bad. So we'll just leave it. All right, I think we'll call that.
