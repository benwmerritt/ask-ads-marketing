there is a whole kind of concept on what you need to focus on when it comes to form design. Typically nowadays I exclusively use multi-step forms but I'm also in the mindset of hey if it's worked for this long, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Hey I'm Ed Leake, I'm here with Sam O'Brah from Atomic Marketing and he's also a landing page guru inside God Tier Alpha, the lead gen alpha community. Today we're going to be talking about well Sam is, he's going to be doing a smart bit, I'll just contribute some noise. We're going to talk about best practices for landing pages, why they don't work and what actually works today and is performing right now. Hello Sam. Okay so I'm excited to run some stuff and I think a good starting point for us to begin with would be the checklist that we have. It's a pretty extensive checklist that we developed together and it really covers pretty much everything you need to know about building a landing page, what sections you need, what you need to include, what's important in terms of different levels of importance as well. While you could go on for ages on this checklist and it pretty much does, we will focus on a few key things that I feel are most important in terms of the fundamentals, getting a landing page that can work for you right now. Sam's work with my input and it's 93 steps long which is a lot how to essentially optimize, create and optimize the ultimate landing page. It's part of God Tier Ads, you can buy it separately, it's a bonus inside God Tier Ads but we'll share some elements of it in this video and many videos to come but yes let's jump in. Welcome to the start of the checklist, as you can see we've got a section about foundations and these are really just the core things that you should have in place before launching your page such as mobile responsiveness and many of these are so obvious and basic but it's always good to run through them because what you'll find and me included, I don't often retest my page load speeds. Sometimes I speak with a lot of people and they don't test their landing page load speeds, they have great looking pages but they load really slowly and that is one of the key contributors to people clicking the back button and not giving the page a chance so you could have the best page in the world but if it's loading slow and the rendering of the images is taking ages then it's not going to put you in an ideal position. And so we've got a bunch of different things included in this general housekeeping section and we've got above the fold content, clear messaging in the hero section and we go into a lot more depth on these as we go down section by section on all the key elements that we need to include within the landing page but these really are the things that you need to be looking at just in terms of you've published the page run through these things in general housekeeping and make sure you're all okay to then stop sending traffic to your landing page. Any of these jump out to you Ed from your experience? The mobile responsiveness just check your pages after you've made changes to them because it's the simplest thing you can do is make changes and update a landing page and then forget to actually recheck how that looks in mobile. Page load speeds are the obvious one but we kind of farm that out now don't we if you use something like unbounce then it's down to them and it's down to your landing page provider to provide the performance and generally most of them are good. I think where you see issues or can see issues is WordPress depending on how below to the WordPress install is with 50 gazillion plugins and just people not using CDN so you can get is it cloud flare I can't remember the name but it's like five dollars a month and you can get distributed their website content which dramatically improves the speed of your website so if you're self-hosting a landing page like WordPress just use a CDN they are so cheap to bumping page speed and it makes such a difference. Yeah absolutely so and I think as well what and I've put this this particular one in here production quality and professionalism I think there are a lot of ugly pages that convert really well but for pages to really perform well I like this checklist item here because there does need to be a certain level of professionalism and it's one of the hardest things to measure in terms of a landing page because when you run like five tech second tests and ask people certain questions such as I would would you move forward with this company for example and when they don't quite trust the page that can often come down to the fact that the page just doesn't feel professional or trustworthy enough and it's something that a lot of people can't really communicate because it's down to the design and when the design doesn't look conventional to typical sort of what websites and landing pages should look like or if like the design looks slightly off or the icons are kind of like out of whack in terms of alignments with text it is these small details that can really play a big part in terms of whether people feel that you can trust the page or not but as you go down this checklist is pretty extensive we've got everything marked in terms of priority in terms of like how important this is so we have these preset to optional normal and high in terms of you know how how how you should prioritize all these different things and our 80 20 isn't it hey exactly that so not everything you don't have to kind of go through absolutely everything there are certain things that you'll see like within the hero section which of course they should be our priority high but then as you come down the page there's a lot of normal stuff and these are just kind of like the bonus extras that would be you know give you a little bit of a boost when it comes to improving your landing page and ultimately your conversion rates but where we should focus today for the topic of this video is what really makes a good landing page and it really does begin in the hero section as that will include what the landing page is about and is about capturing people's attention and interest within that first five seconds so what I'm going to do now is show a real life example from one of our agency clients landing pages this is a page we designed probably seven or eight years ago and has consistently performed extremely well so here you can see the landing page hopefully it's very clear what they do within the first five seconds and I'm going to break down exactly what we have done on this page and also reveal what landing page framework we use to do this page and the one thing about frameworks or landing page framework works is that you can't just apply them to every single niche or every single business every business is going to be different their prospects are going to have different challenges and so you really need to understand how to apply certain frameworks and understand what sections within landing page frameworks you need for the particular business in this case we're talking VanLock installation so our audience here are trades business owners who drive vans and they want to protect the contents of their vans with vans when you buy them new or you're leasing them they typically come with a certain level of security and they're quite easy to break into which is weird as you'd think the manufacturers would kind of like build something a little bit more robust to protect the contents but anyway there is a whole market around improving your van security and this is what this whole page is about so immediately what we want to do within the first five seconds is establish clarity what is the page about who we're targeting up here you can see we've got our conventional logo in the top left we've got our cta phone number in the top right and then what I like to do is include all of our key benefit points either below the navigation or sometimes I will stick them right below the hero and this is just so it doesn't overcrowd the contents of the hero sometimes I will put them in the hero there's no set rule but this is one of the I suppose signature designs that I like to use and I've seen a lot of people use it from when I started posting more on youtube as we come down we've got the eyebrow text and this is really the first bit of text that we introduce in the hero section and this is really just calling out who the audience is so van owners of west Yorkshire and you can do this using any kind of whoever that audience is it could be homeowners of location name it could just be straight up homeowners and this is great here because sometimes what you don't want to do is try and call that person out in the headline too much because it can just make the headline drag on so you can see if we try to like include this all directly within the headline itself it's just going to make it really long and cumbersome whereas it's already pretty long at the moment then as we come down we've got the the hero headline van lock installation then that secures your van your tools and protects your livelihood so it's a very clear value proposition and explains exactly what they do and also gives some kind of emotional response or evokes some emotion to the reader because what we're saying here is it's going to protect your livelihood which is the goal of it that's the goal the whole goal of getting these van locks installed then we've got our subheading which is really just to continue the process of educating the person of like how we do this or what's kind of like how we continue from that headline into explaining a bit more information and context to it so find out what locks and security your van needs to keep you sleeping peacefully knowing your van is fully secure and you'll wake up to earn an honest day's work and these are all kind of copywriting that we did years ago based on research in forums Facebook groups and kind of really truly understanding what is important to this audience and then we've just got a very conventional get your instant free quote which you click here it will bring up a pop-up box and then we ask a few qualification questions and this has always worked and you can see here like I'll dive into this in a moment but there is a whole kind of concept on what you need to focus on when it comes to form design typically nowadays I exclusively use multi-step forms but I'm also in the mindset of hey if it's worked for this long if it ain't broke don't fix it so give you a bit of idea there but there's a whole kind of mentality of how you should approach form design and especially multi-step forms sorry so what's the conversion rate on this page you know I believe it's around 15 yeah consistently 15 percent consistently 15 percent and we're using broad match keywords as well oh nice okay and essentially you're operating in easy mode now oh yeah it's it's fully matured after the seven years and it always works which is the great thing and there's a great example to show as we come come to the right hand side of the page we've got a really simple hero image just showing the installation and the actual installed new locks because the vans don't come with this it just adds that additional level of security we have the picture of the installer putting it on so it's super clear and this audience knows what they're looking for because they're either searching for a particular type of lock which sometimes it can be product searches that hit this page as well so I'm sure if we were able to exclude all product based searches the conversion rate would be even higher but with Google we're kind of happy with our KPIs at the moment and there's not really anything you can do to get the same level of volume and ensure the target audience is exactly who they need to be and then as we come down the page we have to also now consider what sections do we need and this is the thing for all different landing pages that people are designing so I see them the number one thing where people get stuck is what what sections do I need and the annoying answer is yes it does depend but there are a few key sections that every landing page will need that is going to be a hero section it's going to be social proof and you can see I'm not using this in any particular order I'm free I always build a page based on what I feel is logical in terms of the structure and normally I would include more social proof up here but it's been so long I don't think I realized social proof was a thing at the time seven years ago and it's still performing quite well so that's the reason why I'm not changing anything but with Google the it's a little bit different to Facebook ads when it comes to landing pages as typically what you'll find with Google they already know what they're looking for and so you have to show them exactly what you're what they're looking for so rather than kind of giving the reason of why you should have these different products installed which we include later down here we are just listing all the different things because I know from the search terms within Google ads people are searching for deadlocks slam locks armor plates surface mounted deadlocks pikey locks so what do I do I want to make sure that this is covered pretty early on in our design and right above that we've just showed the key kind of van manufacturers that they typically work with and these are all the kind of main ones here in the UK and then you've got additional kind of services as well so I'd say this is more like a conventional services section so if we we head back to the checklist you can see here like in terms of the hero section we can check off we've got the main headline yes we've got a subheading benefit points we actually put those right below and now so we'd mark that off as yes hero image or video and this this is cool because it makes you think hey maybe a video showcasing the installation might actually perform better again we've just ran this image for so long and it's worked for so long that I'm not changing it because sometimes if you're too focused on testing loads of things and you just don't appreciate what you have which is actually working right now and it's hitting the KPIs so you know don't don't try to be a master landing page tester if you know everything is is actually okay I don't know Ed what do you think about that yeah well I was so there's two things and I love just pop back to the page a second so simple this section but I love it because you've extracted the the search intent and you've included them here so like dead locks armor plates slam locks high key locks surface mountain dead locks all the stuff that people are searching for that would which is appropriate to this service and you've included them in the in the visual here and that's something so simple to overlook and it's not keyword stuffing or any nonsense like that you are literally calling out these different search intents that are all relevant and I love that it's it's simple but really effective and potentially you know you can easily overlook this now in terms of testing we're all guilty of this so you've had this client for seven years that that client is obviously very happy and this is working for them and they're getting high conversion rate cost per lead way under what they need it to be to be profitable so everyone's happy and that stability is a good thing the problem is introducing a test will upset stability it could be positive or negative as well you could you could do a video with them put that in the hero section and it flop like many videos in the hero section I don't know why the screen just switched us around so videos are not always effective and it's how comfortable the client is and the relationship is to say look this is going really well do you need more because that client by the looks of it it's got a mobile number in the UK so he's probably a solo business owner is he so if you're keeping him busy he's more than likely going to say don't rock the car I'm happy it's performing well however if he got bigger and he's like right I've got another guy on now I need more work you might be tempted to go right let's try some new things with the page let's bring some case studies up to the four and move that social proof higher or produce a video but the thing with the visuals that service page I can see why it converts so well the visual is perfect if you own a van and I've owned a van for the fairest reasons but if you if you've ever owned a van you know that they are made the locks are pathetic and Sam you called it outside it's the most weird thing these vans are made for work and they don't protect their tools it's crazy and tools cost a fortune the visual of these these heavy deadlocks and the guy installing the driver side and passenger side I can't remember what you call them the flush lock but immediately so I'm just wondering and comparing and the guy who's got a van knows what the lock looks like they know how weak they are so that immediately seeing that installation is like bing that's what I need that's what I want so I can see why that page works really well and then you did the research to call out sleep at night protect your investment protect your honest days work because that's what these people consider you know tradesmen's doing an honest days work it's it's an old saying it's like I'm out for an honest days work well if you like this section you're going to like where we go with it even further down okay so would I test it depends and I think in this situation unless this chap who owns this company says right Sam we've just doubled I've got another guy working for me then I might consider testing but to be honest with you the easiest thing we for you guys to do would be to bump the budget which could be a test into itself you know a change of budget dramatic change is a test into itself so sometimes these pages just rock and roll for so long that you don't need to be fiddling same with Google ads you don't need to fiddle if it's working so yeah it depends an annoying answer I completely agree and often like when I think about introducing test whether that's to Google ads or even with landing pages like you said it can just introduce a test that isn't necessarily going to be beneficial and over the course of that test you actually get less leads it works as like a double-edged sword and usually depending on what you're testing it I find it when you found like a winning formula just kind of stick with it and find other ways to kind of improve it as we come down the the rest of the page so you can kind of see here we've got our navigation which I do include as a section I think it's really important that you utilize the navigation we've got the kind of short benefit points up here right below that we've got the hero section we've got the I suppose this would be relevant to kind of not necessarily social proof or accreditations but just kind of like the major brands that they install with and gives people a feeling of oh yeah they they do it for Ford they do it for Mercedes whatever it is we do it at a service overview which is important for the Google based campaign or Google ad space campaign and then we come down to the benefit section and this is typical I would say on most landing pages maybe like 95 percent of typical landing pages will include something called a benefit section and this is where you always see that saying features sell no what features tell benefit sell and this is very much the case here where and we've been very careful with the type of copy that we've been using on the page but you can see here you've been just invested thousands on your van and tools take action and invest in safeguarding your most valuable business assets so it's really important as well that you you consider the copy around the different sections and how to effectively use the sections because people know like yeah I'm going to get increased security of course like they know this sort of thing and this is going to be harder to break into but using copy this is where you can now be quite clever with it so instead of just saying like make it harder to break into we're saying double your van security lock power that's one and then we've got a little bit of copy of below that but like the key things we're trying to highlight here are these titles and some light images in the background to kind of showcase that the best insurance is an intimidating deterrent so you can see what we've got here is thieves pick easy targets your van will not be one of them they'll be intimidated by the presence of deadlocks and we'll move on quickly to find an easier van and then ultimately it's peace of mind knowing your van is covered so we want to include that as a key point too knowing your van is safe and guarded at the highest level that's usually easy knowing your van and tools we ready for you tomorrow morning so everything in this page has been very well considered down to the all the specific pain points that these business owners have and now as we come down the page this is very typical of what we call a problem agitate solve framework and I mentioned this now it doesn't necessarily apply to every single type of landing page and I'll say this I say this one all the time to the members in alpha you can't apply this framework to something like rubbish removal because at the end of the day like they just want a piston mattress to be taken away from the house like we're not looking to agitate a further problem of having all this junking out in the front yards and how great it's going to feel when it's removed like sometimes it just doesn't apply very well and you've got to stick to a more conventional framework but if we dive back into what I'm explaining here this is a very good example where it works so this of course is the problem section of that framework so you can see our van had been done never again and for all the people watching in the UK you probably know that getting done is like you know how I don't know how would you describe that you know what it means right getting done over yeah getting screwed getting essentially so this section I right I'll let you continue but if I was to test I've already got a test that I would run on this section and I would move this higher up but but before you would test this you'd need to see the scroll map to see if people come down how many people come down this far but yeah so this this is annoying me seeing scumbags ripping vans apart to nick people's stuff so I and I'm not even a tradesman if I'm a tradesman sat there and I've just spent five grand on all my new tools and I'm looking at these pictures I'm seething I literally want to get these blokes and cut the hands off you know this is seething you hate it and you hear stories about this and it's rife you know all these scumbags when around nicking people's stuff who are you know exactly how people in these Facebook groups and forums refer to these people and it's know your audience exactly know your audience so I so this is why and because I know this audience I would have leaned in with the tests calling out like literally calling them scumbags and I I would put some CCTV video footage on here showing a quick snip of a van getting broken into like really agitated and I know it's horrible but really agitated stick the like the knife in well I think that's a horrible metaphor but because then if you're a tradesman you come in you see that happening you'll be like yeah I need to get this sword yeah and I think as well when you do have something as good as this to to use where it makes sense to use a framework like problem agitate solve this does exactly that like you said it does make you see if you see these threatening CCTV images of fans being broken into you can see that door of that middle one's just been peeled right open and like how we then agitate that is by calling these things out the red dot which kind of looked like a bit of a kind of important alert your livelihood has been taken from you the police are doing little to nothing to help dealing with the stress of insurance companies like these are all the key problems that we researched years ago that is still very much true today and I think if you do your research well and you're able to put it into a landing page design that just works and it makes you feel a certain way then it will last you for a very long time and perform very very well for you as you then use you can use chat gpt claude groc etc jem and i blah blah blah to do this research for you but I would say you are missing out if you only rely on them you need to get into these forums facebook groups and so on to see how these people actually speak and what they're up to which the ai doesn't do yes speed it up using ai but do go that extra mile to actually have a look yourself because it pays dividends like this this page is literally paid out for seven years that's how good it is absolutely just because doing the research upfront and this is before anything like chat gpt even existed and if you're not a copywriter it makes it so much easier to write if you know the audience if you know the pain points if you know the issues you like it makes it so much easier to write and if you even then if you that bad like struggle with copywriting then you could get gpt or one of the others to to write your research for you yeah but I would still do a lot of you know some manual process and it's important as well because if you're solely relying on what chat gpt spits out and you don't truly understand it yourself then you're never going to be able to critically look at the output of what it's giving you to then decide hey is that something we should test in the hero or how important is that do my keywords make sense do my ads make sense this is this is what separates a google a ppc manager from a really good ppc manager these extra steps so there's one thing to set up a google ads account and doing google ads these extra steps elevate you massively to literally top 1% stuff we can all do it so as we come down to this next section so we've kind of introduced the problem here agitated it which it can be within the same section there's no set rules if you need an agitation section on the page but you can see that kind of covers the p and the a element of that framework and then it's solved how do we solve it and this is our core kind of offer i mean the core offer is essentially the instant free quote but what we introduce here is your free van security assessment and then here is how we're going to solve that problem that we just saw there how to safeguard your specific vans models weak spots and break in points a comprehensive breakdown of van lock installation options recommendations and no obligation pricing most common and advanced thief tactics and what you need to do to have saying this van's not for me which is kind of what we've seen and picked out from the forums of you know what people are saying or what the thieves say and they want to just pass on by a van which looks way too armored up to even bother with because they don't have much time to break into these vans they're at risk of getting caught and like we mentioned above here the best insurance is an intimidating deterrent so that really ties in nicely of what this core offer is and if we wanted to test we could change this to get a free van security assessment but at the end of the day i know that these tradespeople they want to know how much it's going to cost like they they're pretty set on getting this they they're not too fast for the van security assessment they just want like an understanding of what the installation cost is going to be and then to cap off the rest of the page we've got a section here which shows the he's an authorized and accredited installer of all these different products we've got some social proof down here at the end which includes some aggregated ratings for and then a final cta section with protective van is your most important asset so we don't reveal any specific prices on this page as it really depends what people are looking for but i thought this would just be a really good example of how you can apply a landing page framework such as problem agitate solve and develop a very compelling looking page that can work for you for a very long time so this is just come to me um a test idea for me would be a picture of a mad max vehicle like your van doesn't have to look like this as you said are you said armored up so you don't put armored up to the teeth you know you don't want like it to look like a tank and be these guys want a nice like wrapped vehicle with their branding design on they they're very conscious how they're going to look so and so that's so immediately that review is also a pushback that's a reason why someone would leave because they think it might look ugly so you can literally do a a call out of that how neat it looks with that testimonial the mad max van and then actual here's a neat little installation of the deadlock system and what have you so that's just one of the slides could be a good way to visualize that yeah so it's really very visual and also the whole mad max thing of it being one extreme to the other so that's another test idea that just came to me yeah no i like that a lot it's a really good idea not that we will test it because it's going well but that yeah absolutely by reviewing pages that even have performed well and you've not come back to them in terms of like a critical review in a long time you can start to really pick out stuff like ed mentioned the stuff that you could potentially start testing and and and seeing where you can improve it what's more important to people is it the visual aspect is it the security is a combination of both but we perhaps need to try and make more apparent in the hero image for example i'd say that kind of concludes how we how we've used like the problem agitate solve framework for that particular landing page but if we come back to this checklist here it really does go through all the different possible sections that you could use on a page i mean this form design here this is a pretty large section really important because you can get someone to engage completely with the pay like you can get someone to engage with the landing page you know they get all the way through to the process at the end and then they're trying to fill in the form but if you've got certain things within the form which are just holding people back from converting then it's important to actually really analyze and look at your form because sometimes it's not the page it's your form and i actually did publish a recent video on that and the more analytics you can have with form completion rates and analytics the better you can optimize the last most important phase of conversion i think we should ask people who are watching this video to leave a comment if they'd like us to do follow-up videos working through the the whole checklist essentially you can get this checklist inside god tier alpha and god tier ads so but yeah if you if you've enjoyed this and you want more please do leave a comment comment like and subscribe as they say but yes leave a comment let us know and we can do do some follow-ups and work through the list because i always learn from these calls with you sam it even brings ideas to the like the idea i just have it just brings ideas to the to the fore because you're bouncing ideas around seeing your work and then thinking about it it's uh i i do always find it interesting absolutely and if if anyone watching does like or is a aficionado or someone who enjoys designing landing pages getting better at them and having a bunch of other people look at it with you then you may want to consider checking out the lead gen alpha group where we do that weekly so every week and it's more than that dale's there as well who's your co-founder and he's doing google ads calls every tuesday you're taking the landing page calls every thursday there are blueprints galore for all these different landing pages and ad campaigns and that you can rock up with your problematic google ads account or even a google ads account that's working well and you just want a better landing page and we will diagnose and help you do that on the call with follow-ups if needed and the testament is the case studies for this group like people turning up with five percent conversion rates and we're walking away a week later 15 20 percent as high as 40 percent and it's happening all the time it's amazing so if you implement what's inside god tier lead gen alpha it's a it's a mouthful but if you google lead gen alpha it is the thing that comes up yeah it comes up god tier alpha or lead it's on the page so apply to that if you are working with a b2c service-based businesses lead gen not e-commerce it's a dedicated lead gen group so do apply to that there will be a link in the comments i'll pin the first uh comment sorry and the description and yeah do leave us a comment if you want us to do some follow-ups to this because i think it's been pretty good i agree i definitely want the advice brilliant thank you very much sam until the next time i will see you uh i'll see you on first day's call but everyone else i hope you've enjoyed and yeah i'll say it again leave a comment and like the video thank you very much cheers everyone
