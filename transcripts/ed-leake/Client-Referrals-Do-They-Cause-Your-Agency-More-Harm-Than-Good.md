these agencies come into you saying, oh, well, we've got this and you're like, we don't want it. It's very difficult to say no to those referrals because then that agency is going to go, well, we don't want to work with you in the future then because you're going to cherry pick. I don't know if you still take on referrals. No. Oh, referral or white label. Two different things. Yeah, they are. So my concern, my issue with referrals full stop, they're great as a sticky plaster to get some money in early, but you can't control them. And I don't mean the rate that they come in, but the quality of the leads. And what I've found is it's really very hard to say no to an agency referring you to work because you feel like you're letting them down because they've got let's say it's an SEO agency. They're working with a specific client that you've got no experience of or you don't want to work with that type of client. In your case, it would be Legion. So you've got these agencies come into you saying, oh, well, we've got this and you're like, we don't want to. It's very difficult to say no to them to those referrals because then that agency is going to go, well, we don't want to work with you in the future then because you're going to cherry pick. And that's my big concern with referrals. And I just got into a few issues over the years trying to deal with referrals because I was trying to get them into specific niches that I wanted to work with because we had the experience in the case studies for them. Similar experience. So one was that we're strategic in terms of which agencies we align with. So not just like some random agents. Initially it was just anyone local, anyone with potential clients. Because at the same time, we did not have a clear picture in terms of let's say who our ideal client is and all of these things. But we've gotten more selective, but I agree with you. It was hard. And also, and maybe I'd like to differentiate like overall referrals versus white label. So white label is essentially we do work under their umbrella. So we have tried that for years and it was somewhat successful. But then later, after deeper analysis and after we have significantly improved our own client base, we reduced that more and more. And now I think maybe like actually now we don't take white label, but I would say like it started in maybe 2010 or so. When budgets got cut, guess who got cut first from those agencies? We did. Yeah. So that was bad. And the other thing is that it was harder to raise rates and ask for essentially what you're worth. The agency, the other side has to pass it on. So it's a double step to get that rate to go up. Yeah. Exactly. And the other thing is that we have noticed that when you have this type of relationship, like white label relationship is that you don't control the client flow to your point. So we've gotten some bad clients, needy clients that we had to serve just because we had a really, you know, pre, you know, pregusting relationship and we had a commitment to support that agency. So it was tough because like you had to take pretty much like everything under that agency because otherwise you were kind of like risking damaging the relationship. So I would say that and maybe like the final thing is that, you know, maybe we're expectation management, some agencies were good, some agencies were pretty bad on this. And then, you know, it would get like too many questions or maybe questions that, you know, maybe that we should have been discussed or maybe even like goals that should have been maybe realigned and so on to make sure that what's communicated to the end client is correct. And at the same time, you know, the kind of there's no scope creep from the account management side. Yeah, I think if you do right label all referrals, you've, you've got the the PPC side of things, I think you've got to control so much of it right, right up into the point of sale. And I'd even argue before the sale, because I've got a pre onboarding checklist, not an onboarding, a pre onboarding, and it's essentially a risk assessment of the client. And you run through all these checks to make sure if there's any red flags before you take money. So I think if you've got something like that down, and then you've got a very strict process, how you work, communicate, who does what and really structure it, then white labeling works, but you still have to be specialist. I think a white label that term, well, I know that white labels who are PPC agencies really struggle, because they have everything thrown at them. Whereas someone like Justin Rondeau did a video with me, invisible PPC, and their lead gen, and mainly local service businesses, some national stuff, but you know, your roofers, your plumbers, that sort of stuff. And ultimately, they're all very similar from a Google ads perspective, the lead gen flow, landing pages, the CRMs, the tracking. So they can have a very structured approach. But if you started throwing insurance companies into the mix and E-com, it would just, it would be hell to run that white label agency.
