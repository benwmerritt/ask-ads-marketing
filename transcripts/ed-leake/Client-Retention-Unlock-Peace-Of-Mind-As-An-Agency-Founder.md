We haven't lost a client since COVID. What year are we on? So we're like 100% retention for nearly three years. My life is so much easier because retention is high. Walk into other places and you can literally say look what I did for them and you only pay based on results. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, that's pretty fucking good. Oh, by the way, it's 8% And oh, okay, we could afford that next one you go to oh, by the way, it's 12% Oh, okay. We got the next one. Do you understand and then the next one you get the point where you lie it's 15% And they go no and then you find your ceiling Yeah, the first one's cheap But yeah, you know baby steps make sense Uh, micky nats you've got your hand waving Yeah, so just in terms of like pricing psychology. I think this is a really Uh difficult area when I speak to people Everyone kind of just says like charge more or charge your worth and all that stuff now I feel like that's kind of being programmed in our mind from like Sales courses and programs which are really marketed towards traditionally One off sales being at like a car or a house So they can charge people that Over value and all that stuff and try to squeeze as much out of them But we're selling our recurring revenue Service so it's sometimes better to give people a better deal And they'll stay longer and when they stay longer You'll make more money and if you actually give them a better deal. They'll be easy to deal with The other thing is they'll refer you people as well So sometimes by making a little less money you end up making more money because they stay longer. They refer other businesses So I just wanted to share that because that's been something I've been mulling over recently because I know a lot of people who Tell me that I should be charging so much because they are but they lose clients really fast Their retention doesn't last long or they're in a different industry where they're selling a one-off service or one-off product That doesn't have a recurring element to it because there's no point getting a client Doing all this time it's trying to sell them and then they leave two or three months later because it's like it's too much for them When realistically if you charge them a bit less they would have been comfortable And then they just would have kept paying that for maybe a year or two years So Yeah, that's a thing. So that's how I just think about now is like give them a better deal Not to not as a discount but that actually is like a As a strategy knowing that they'll stay longer you'll make more and you'll get referrals from it Yeah Retention is so important, isn't it? Like if you can't Doesn't matter what you charge you somewhere if you can't retain it. There's no like the think about the the brain Work that mads is doing just to get this deal through the frigging door And then if he loses them after two months all that energy fucking gone for an extra one or two percent It's not worth it. It's a I completely agree Michael. We haven't lost a client since covid. What year are we on? So we're like 100 retention for nearly three years We're running businesses at the end of the day. And so what michael says is entirely true too many people say you got a Lamb whale kind of I never say it or you go after whales and all this shit You know, you've got to go after coca-cola and a bollocks. You can make perfectly decent money reasonable money And not being And not having that attitude like my life is so much easier because retention is high
