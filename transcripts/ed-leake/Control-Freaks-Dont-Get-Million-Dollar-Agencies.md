And then you're fully unlocked to do leads and sales, like pretty much it leads and sales, leads and sales, till you are blue in the face and you've perfected it to the point where you're not even worried about what you're paying them. It's just another bag of what Marco was saying initially with his success run my business guy. I haven't been through all of forge content yet to know have you put something together for this stage? We like I'm now at the stage where I want someone to run my fricking agency and I can just pull away and my focus on that pillar over there. Like you both were just saying, you know, in a random way, you know, what sort of things you would want to go into, you know, when you bring it to the table with that person, what should sort of expectations you would want out of that person, what sort of monetary things you've got the 5x rule that you've just mentioned, you know, this would, is that the best thing to be doing? Just wondering if you know, you had something that goes into more depth around that within the forge content. No, but I can do a, I think that requires more of a summary because it comes down to personal situation and what you want to do. But I think the direction and the guidance would be do you want to remove yourself from the situation? Okay, what do you need to do in order to do that? For most of that, for pretty much all of us, that means getting someone that can do the ads, do the PPC work, that normally is the first step and get someone that's more than capable so they don't really all day. And then progressing them, if you can't hire them immediately, progressing them to manage clients, you sit in for a period of time, you make sure there's a process in place and then you're confident that they can do that. And then you're fully unlocked to do leads and sales, like pretty much it leads and sales, leads and sales till you are blue in the face. And you've perfected it to the point where you're not even worried about what you're paying them. And then you hire another one and you keep doing leads and sales till you can't anymore and get to a point then where you've probably got more people on board. And Michael touching on retention, that's another big thing. So yeah, I think I can do a summary video that literally like I did for the lead gen, the five rules, is I think about these things and keep it really simple because I think it's all nuanced, everyone's different, every situation's different. And I think if you try and describe every situation, I just produce these sort of sometimes verbose, four part videos on stuff and it's not as helpful as a 30 minute bang, bang, bang, use this as a thought experiment, use this to guide you, but ultimately you are individual and tweak it to suit. Same sales process, you don't have to use it bang on, but it's always worked for me, but everyone has their tweaks. So I've just written down the timestamp for your question Tim. So yeah, I can do something like that. A piece of content is there for reference that you can go back to and like, right, I got stuck again. Where the hell am I meant to be at this point? Go back, review that and go, right, yeah. Okay, does that suit my situation? Pull the trigger, hire that person. Are they retaining clients? Good, I've got confidence. Because you need to be doing your lead gen.
