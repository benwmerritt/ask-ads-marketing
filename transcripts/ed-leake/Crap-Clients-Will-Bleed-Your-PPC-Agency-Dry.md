But I didn't fire them for months on end because I was like, I got to the point where it was really, really difficult to serve them. And then I was like, I can't fire them because it's such a big chunk of money. I mean, six figures a year. But it's the wrong way to look at it. I've lost the most horrible clients by myself. Like they, they are like, okay, like they pay like, I don't know, a thousand bucks a month or so. And something like that. And you manage like their business or their ads. But the thing is, they think that you are a full time worker for the business. And it's not like that. And like, that's, that's the problem. And then when those clients actually left, I felt like, like, like, like as a weight has been lifted. But like, I don't care about the money. I just think about my own like well-being because like, it's not. They weren't the money's not worth. You only care about the money when it's there in front of you and they're paying you and you think you need it. But then you realize that actually the crap clients are not worth that extra couple of grand, five grand. I remember we, I fired our biggest client at the time, big retailer in the UK, privately owned, but they were a nightmare. And they were paying a lot of money. And I just got to the point where I'm like, we just can't deal with these people. And I fired them. It was like nearly 10 grand a month at the time, which is a decent chunk of revenue. And I was just like, but it's not worth the pain. And the amount of headspace that that opened up for me to then go and find new clients. But also, more importantly, the feeling in the team, particularly my lead guy, like he was a different person about a week later. I didn't realize how bad that client was weighing him down emotionally, because you're constantly fighting this bloody massive account and a very demanding, very demanding client. This was, for seven years ago, six years ago. But I didn't, but I didn't fire them for months on end. Because I was like, I got to the point where it was really, really difficult to serve them. And then I was like, I can't fire them because it's such a big chunk of money. Six figures a year. But it's the wrong way to look at it, which is a lot of these learnings is why I put the profit fix four minutes ago, but because it's that mental framework of working through your clients and literally ranking them in order of how you like, you know, do you like working with them? So it's so important. Yeah, but like, you don't get the lesson before you actually go through that on your own. No, people think it's overrated firing clients. People think that, you know, saying no is difficult and a problem. And it's like, now it's a superpower. But yeah, it's, it's part of the job, isn't it? You know, you sounds like you've had a tough period, but you've also taken, it sounds like you've taken your foot off the off the pedal, you know, the accelerator, you're taking a bit of a breather, which is perfectly fine. We can't expect it to be going like that 24 seven, three, six, five, you know, when we're only human. When the robots come, obviously they can, you know, run our agencies like that. We won't be required, but we're a way off that. So you still have to listen to your human body and mind.
