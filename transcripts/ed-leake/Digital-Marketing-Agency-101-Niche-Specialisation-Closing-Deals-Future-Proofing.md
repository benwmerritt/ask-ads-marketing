A big agency can afford a $5,000 per customer acquisition. They don't really care. You cannot. You peak around $1,000 to $1,500 and you can't bid with them. You'll run out of money. Everything works until it doesn't. You have to be able to pivot. We originally did SEO and I knew SEO as my background. 15 years ago, I used to do websites SEO and PPC and then I specialized in PPC after. But I knew SEO and I did a lot of SEO for our website and it did well in the beginning. And it was making those niche pages. I'd make Google ads for plumbers or something and do heavy optimization on it. It actually ranked years ago. It made so many updates. I don't have time to keep up with it. So I needed to hire an SEO or go a different direction. And then we did just straight Google ads for our own business. And a very long time ago, PPC management company, PPC ad agency, we bid on that phrase match. Did it really hard. Maybe $100 per lead and you close one out of four. So the numbers were crazy and they were good. They were really good. And then it was $30 CPC, $80 CPC, $200 CPC. I think the big agencies just turned on their impression chair bidding or whatever. And they have an infinite budget. So, you know, we are getting $500 leads, $1,500 leads. And again, I'd advise anybody to talk to someone a lot more successful for you than you and other business owners. And a friend of mine said, look, a big agency can afford a $5,000 per customer acquisition. They don't really care. You cannot. You, you, you peak around a thousand to $1,500 and you can't bid with them. You can't have $5,000 per new client. You'll run out of money. So that strategy stopped working, but it did work for about two years. We just bid on PPC ad agency. It just printed money. And then a bunch of other things that didn't work. But at the moment, YouTube's been really good. And this was Alex from Ozy thing actually, is it originally came from him or not? Some of it brings in new leads. The other things help you close. So now I've taken the course and put it all over Falcon. You know, we founded the online advertising academy, you know, biggest, one of the biggest YouTube channels in the industry. Look at all these experts where it's sort of like speaking at a conference. You can help close. Like, look, I published the book. I have a YouTube. I'm, I have all these awards. I've done all these things. That's why you should hire me. It's a closer in addition to sometimes you get new clients from it. So YouTube has helped with that. It's kind of like, who are you compared to every other agency? It's what it is. Massive YouTube channel and someone else can't quickly make a massive YouTube channel and compete head to head. It's a lot of work. So that's, that's what's working now. Focusing on a niche is working well. And that was a, that's another thing that's, that's enforced. That's that. And I've seen these ads. I just haven't done one. It's kind of like, are you a, do you want a plumbing company? We can get you more plumbing appointments now. Hey, plumbers call us and the landing pages for plumbers and then we help plumbers just narrowing it down. That works extremely well. And I thought that was kind of guru nonsense. We haven't run that since probably last fall. And it's like, okay, I'll do a pilot and I'll run it in that. That highly targeted thing works surprisingly well. Going all in on it. I mean, technically HVAC and plumber and every other thing are the same, just different keywords. But it's like, well, I could grab a bunch more plumbers that makes an ad that says, hey plumbers, we help plumbers. And it's like, that actually works very well. Yeah. And to, to really accelerate it, you need to layer on top of a couple of things like your positioning a better offer than a free order. And also the, this is in Cyborg, the proactive mindset. So putting together something that is a proactive value ad or strategy. So most people are reactive. And of course, if everyone went down the niche route, there would be no niches, but no one's not everyone's going to do that. But what I discussed inside for just going mile. So you fill in all the, all the blanks for that business. So you mentioned plumbers. So what can you do to make their life easier? So it's not just Google ads anymore. It's not just the landing page. You've got to fill in all the gaps up to the point where they make the sale. And if that means tracking all the phone call recording, it means listening to phone calls as well and vetting what they're doing and vetting the quality of the leads that come from your work. The follow ups, like even getting involved in doing email follow ups or SMS follow ups. And beyond. So I think we used to be, I used to call myself a PPC specialist agency 10 years ago because we did PPC. Then we started doing niches and quarter of a specialist. I think actually to be really specialist, you've got to hone in on that offer and say we work with this industry and we do all these things that orbit that industry. Google ads is at the heart of it of driving the traffic and leads. But we do these things that mean what we do is so valuable to your business. You're not going to leave us because you'll go to another agency that just does Google ads. They all know they do landing pages like, yeah, is that it? Well, try and compete with us. So that's the next level of value add and positioning. And then it starts at the niche, but you're adding all these layers on top of it. So it definitely works. Definitely works. It's a bit more effort, but it sounds like you're going down that route and you're digesting some of the stuff inside Porge, which is brill. Yeah, it does work.
