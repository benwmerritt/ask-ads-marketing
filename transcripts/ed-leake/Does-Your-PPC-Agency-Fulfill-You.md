But I'm like, where's the fun again? Like when was like fun put secondary before like, oh, I've got to pick up this client who they're already a red flag before I'm even working with them. Over the break and over the last few months, what I've been thinking about is like this year, I want to really enjoy it. And not like, like I'm going on holidays overseas and all that stuff, but that's not the thing. It's like, I want to enjoy it every day, every moment. But I'm like, where's the fun again? Like when was like fun put secondary before like, oh, I've got to pick up this client who they're already a red flag before I'm even working with them. To be fair, you need to get to the point where you can pick up a client and that is devoid of those red flags. So there is that you've got to get a foundation in it, haven't you? But then it should be about multiplying the fun factor, as you say. There's a guy called Kirk Williams. He's like a PVC dude. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he just he's done a TEDx TED talk and he just released a book called Stop the Scale and I haven't finished it, but I watched his TEDx talk about the audio book. But I think I just think we're so programmed for constant growth that I know you say things like you're very different. Most people like, look, I do want to grow and I'm going to take on clients and I'm going to eat shit. But I see friends ahead of me who would keep eating shit, even though they're making great money and not just keep eating shit because there's just like some like never ending goal of like, no matter how much money you make or how many clients there's always more and this is like delusion of more that that will bring you more fulfillment, but it doesn't. I don't want to scare a lot of people say to me, oh, have you given up then? I'm like, what the fuck makes me a fortune? I don't know. People think that if you're not focusing on acquiring your customers, you're not running your business. I think there's a whole point of it. Does everyone else agree with that on the call? Would you say? Absolutely. The whole point of the business is so you can live a life that you actually enjoy is that you can't build a business that then is is you because then what have you got? The way you are and like the business is in the right place. Like why do you want to change? And another thing I'll go if anyone sits there going, oh, I can't wait from a holiday. Then that to me is a red flag. It's like why are you trying to escape and but this is most people. I don't give a fuck about holiday drives my wife mad. I'm not unhappy in my own skin and where I'm at where I'm at where we're moving to I'll be a lot more happy because it's about what it is a bit mindfulness. It's about being it in the countryside, which is what I want to go back. That's how I grew up. But aside from that, it's not a material thing. But that's the only thing is the only thing I've got to accomplish this year to be properly happy. That doesn't involve growth scale. How many this how many that? You know, did a grown extra inch to the shrinkage. It's not none of this. It's am I fulfilled? Am I happy? And can I just be like turn it all off if I need to. So it's super important and I don't need a holiday to feel better. Fuck because that used to be the case six, seven years ago. I went on a holiday and it, you know, because I needed one. Shouldn't actually had a similar thoughts like a few days ago where I was thinking about like going on a holiday. Like in the first quarter, like in February or March and I was like, fuck this year has started so good. I don't want to go to holiday. I just want to fucking hustle and work because like it's going so fucking well and like about happiness, Michael. Like I've decided like if you intentionally decide to be happy about your life, I think like you can make a huge change like in your mindset.
