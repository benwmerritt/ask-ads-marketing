If you actually put higher price products first, then you can actually raise average order sizes just because people are, their filtering is, well, here's the expensive stuff and you, you scroll down from there as opposed to go the opposite way. But, but often we have to ask them, okay, what will you advertise on the website? Is it like, if you have a black Friday stuff, we need to ask them before because otherwise we get the content of the offers like three days before. So it's both for them and for comfort that we ask as early as possible. And we try to give them also market insights. So the priority thing for e-commerce off the back of that is discussing what's coming up in terms of offers, new products, new product lines, that sort of thing and how that fits in with the with Google ads. But I'd also extend that to the website. So one of the things I was looking at one of our checklists, I didn't realize how big it was actually, but one of the things we do is specifically around the homepage. So helping the client optimize the homepage homepage gets a lot of traffic, even if you don't send ads there. So one of the pieces of work we often do is a an optimization with them based on what we see in the data. So what products should be on the homepage, what categories and essentially see if we can help them improve their overall sales, not just Google ad sales, just by improving the homepage, by positioning the seasonal products, best sellers, upcoming promotions and so on. Different categories as well, different categories of products. Another test we've done is category pages. Most people put best sellers, but there are depends on this depends widely on the product range, but having the order go from price highest to lowest instead of a best seller. Because the your intuition tells you that you should present the best sellers because most people will buy best sellers. But what we've seen, especially with them, like more luxurious brands, is that if you actually put higher price products first, then you can actually raise average order sizes just because people are there filtering is well, here's the expensive stuff. And you you scroll down from there as opposed to go in the opposite way. Because I've seen a lot of people do it the other way where you start with the cheapest, which I think is weird. Let yeah, price anchor in Michael, that's the word I needed. If a user wants to go cheapest to highest, let them do that. I wouldn't start a page that way. So those are a couple of additional things. So seasonality, let's do this very quickly. What we would do proactively is look at past performance across all traffic channels and make sure that we're in a position. And again, comes back to the homepage that we are going to be putting pushing those products. But also this could come back to category pages by actually manually putting the more seasonal responsive, shall we say, the stuff that sells more in this this coming season, higher up on the category pages or even manually sorting it to be them. So sort like a seasonal bestseller kind of following the e-commerce. I really get into the product selection because not all products are going to be profitable without advertising, making sure that you're only spending money on products instead of just fucking spending money on the whole catalog, making sure you're only spending money on the products that actually have the margin to support. And then they're actually getting to rise, you know, putting more budget behind products that are, you know, super, super profitable for you, make sure that they're not running out of budget or anything along those lines. Anything that's over that, you know, that profit point, that profit margin, you know, giving as much budget as possible, anything that's close, those are the ones that you really focus on. And then from that point on, after you kind of figure out all the product selection, you start to move on to product page, CRO, that's my biggest one. And then from that move on to check out flow, doing things like your one click up sells blah, blah, blah. And then from that point on, it kind of sets the business up to do an upsell for e-commerce email or text message marketing. And that can be a really profitable upsell for most agencies, you know, because that's recurring revenue. LTV increases the LTV of clients.
