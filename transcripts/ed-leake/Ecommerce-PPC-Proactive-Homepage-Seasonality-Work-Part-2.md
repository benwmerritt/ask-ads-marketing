we would go out and look at the competitors and see essentially layouts, videos, are we missing particular information that they're sharing? So essentially bringing the client up to spec. So this is why I said I feel like e-com can be more complicated. We can build landing pages for lead gen easy, chuck them out on a subdomain bang for product pages because we obviously don't control the website in most cases. It gets a bit more complicated, doesn't it? So do you prescribe, essentially do you prescribe what to do or make recommendations an experiment to run? Yeah, so essentially how I would do it is out of the first thing you're doing your product selection and I'm kind of grouping them into a few different buckets. So my buckets are like pretty much anything that's above your profit line. So and it like it doesn't necessarily have to be ROAS or you know you can set your ROAS goal anything above that and then 20% above that. These are like kind of my golden products and what I would do is focus in on those particular product pages first because what you see on 99% of websites you do have those hero products, you know Pareto principle, 20% of the products are generating 80% of the revenue but they've still got fucking shitty bloody product pages. It's just the normal Shopify description, click the add to cart and there's no enticing, there's no selling, there's no gifts of showing the product off or anything like that. You want a super detailed product page to increase that conversion rate on that particular page, but you don't want to spend the time if you've got a thousand different product lines because it's just not going to work. No, so it's 80-20 isn't it? Another one for Econ that we've seen very well and it's relatively straightforward, use generated content. So taking a testimony or a review for the product and actually making that part of the page where someone has essentially it fixed or it's a solution or it did this for me whatever the product may be and really making use of the user content far more. I don't need just sticking fucking Instagram images on there like some of these widgets do. I mean actually using that content as part of the sales page in the description or as even a component on the page but like you say it depends on how big the story is on how granular you can go and therefore if it's a much larger store looking at my checklist we would go out and look at the competitors and see essentially layouts, videos like you mentioned are people showing off the product in a different way or better way? Are we missing particular information that they're sharing in the descriptions, in the features and so on and so forth? So essentially bringing the client up to spec if it's a much broader shop because if they've got 10,000 products we're not doing one page at the time. Max asked a good question so for on page CRO and I guess this is it can be asked for both lead, general e-commerce do we upsell or do we consider this falls into the contract? I will answer that immediately it's part of our job because we charge for performance so for us it makes sense. We don't do a huge amount of it because these are normally tests that are run for months on you know we make a recommendation but for me it's we charge for performance.
