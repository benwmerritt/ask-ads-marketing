Hi guys, I'm Ed Leake from Midus Media. Today we're going to run through store homepage optimization using your site search and your best performing products. So it's really easy for store owners to take a broad or worse, throw the kitchen sink at it mentality for their website homepage. So just cram everything on there and people will find the right thing. Wrong. Seeing more options does indeed attract attention and it makes people excited but often results in failure to actually make a choice. Here's a little case study using Jam. Yep, jars of Jam. So this behavior was demonstrated in the Jam experiment by Sheena, Iyengar and Mark Lepper back in year 2000 in which a tasting booth for exotic jams was set up at a grocery store. As customers passed by the tasting booth they encountered a display of either six or 24 different flavored jams. So what did Iyengar and Lepper find? They discovered that 3% of people purchased from the 24 Jam display, which is okay, whereas 30% purchased from the six Jam display. That's a tenfold increase in sales. So what's my point? Well, you need to remove excessive Jam from your store's homepage pun intended. How do we do this? We start with the website's search facility. So let's dive into Google Analytics and quickly find out which product should populate the homepage. I'm now in the Behaviors report and we need to click on the site search drop down and then usage and let's refine this with e-commerce data. This report identifies the power of site search. Note the conversion rate of those people searching being over double that of people who don't search. Also, their session value is over twice the value of non-searches. So now we can see the importance of site search. Let's take a look at the overview tab. This gives us a quick health check on how well our search is performing. Pay close attention to search exits. This number should be as low as possible. So if people search and don't find what they're looking for, they'll leave and you just missed an opportunity to convert. The 17% exits in this example is really low, so that's good. But still, there's always room to improve. Secondly, understand how many people refine their search. If this number is high, it could suggest your search facility isn't performing or isn't optimised. For example, does it understand misspellings and related terms? Now, only 21% of people refine their search. So that's not too shabby. But then again, there's room to improve here. Adding filters to the search results page could help reduce this somewhat because at the end of the day, the search results is another shopping page. So there should be filtering and categorisation on there. Time after search is telling. Did they find the thing they were looking for? A good few minutes or more would suggest that they did. You've kept them on the site. And this example has three minutes and 32 seconds on average, which is a good job. So site search tells you what your customers want. So if people who search convert really well, the logic would suggest that get more people to search, right? That's not entirely true. What we actually want to do is make the products that people search for easier to find in the first place. That's the logical conclusion. And considering your homepage is typically the most frequented page on your website, then it makes sense to optimise your homepage to display your most popular products and not just your sale items and special offers. Therefore, let's combine your site search data with top performing product data. This can be found in your conversion data, which is under the shopping analysis drop down and product performance. Now, depending on what you sell, you can use product revenue or perhaps unique purchases to sort this data. Unique purchase numbers work well for tightly priced product ranges, whereas revenue, well, it's pretty self explanatory. When you have a low unique purchase number, keep a close eye on your conversions on this view. And that's described as buy to detail rate. In other words, how many or what percentage of people purchased after looking at the product page. So again, this can highlight high demand products that could convert potentially better if the product page was better. So you don't have to stuff your top 10 products on your homepage, the top three to five could be more than enough to start with. And of course, complement these with the site search data. So the key store homepage optimisation takeaways are as a bit of a mouthful, optimise your site search, in other words, make sure it works well, ensure that it matches misspelled and related terms, and that you offer sorting and filtering on search results. This is a shopping page after all. So aim for a low exit rate after search. And you know, the results should keep them on the site. It should convert them to of course, and use the site search information to showcase the most popular products on your homepage. And of course, you can show them throughout the website in promotional areas if you if you have that facility. And that's it. I mean, that'll help you improve your homepage drastically, put stuff in front of people that they want, but don't overdo it. Hope you enjoyed the video. If you did, I'd appreciate your like and any shares. And of course, if you have any questions, please leave them in the comments below. And until next time, good luck and cheers.
