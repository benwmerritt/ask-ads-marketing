Hey, how's it going? I'm gonna be taking a moment to share with you guys my experience with God Tier Ads by Adleek. You experienced a time where you managed to Google Ads campaign but didn't really get the results that you wanted. Kept putting money into the campaign, weren't really getting conversions and thought maybe I'll just pause this campaign, start a new one and be better, you know, luckier next time. Well, that's really not a good strategy for Google Ads. You want to approach it systematically and have specific steps to follow. I began using God Tier Ads not too long ago and implementing some of the recommendations and have seen improvements. As of right now, me and my team are continually going through the recommendations by Adleek with God Tier Ads to further improve the account. As of right now, we are seeing conversions take place and we are looking closer to make sure that we can further improve that. If you are actively working on Google Ads, I would strongly recommend that you look into God Tier Ads as a method to further enhance your campaign structure and approach. And if you feel that you already know a lot about Google Ads, it's still good because there are certain things there that are listed as routine maintenance items that can very easily be overlooked. And just taking care of a couple of those routine maintenance items will very quickly have God Tier Ads paying for itself. A quick example could be, you know, white listing the IP addresses. You really want to make or black listing the IP addresses so they are excluded from your internal teams, you know, from clicking on those ads. Something that we all know about, but do we really actually go in and remember to go in when a new campaign is made to update those settings? With God Tier Ads, you don't have to worry about that because you will just very systematically follow the checklist and that will ensure that the needed items and points of optimization are indeed done for each campaign regarding items that you know about, but also some items that you may not have been familiar with and can really go deeper and learn more about. I definitely give God Tier Ads five stars thumbs up and I think it's a great product. I'm looking forward to more information and knowledge from Ed League with God Tier Ads. Thank you.
