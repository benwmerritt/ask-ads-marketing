If you can hit all the avenues, yeah, you're going to get sales. The problem is it's how much the sales cost you. Here's a question for you, Ed. So you smashed the result for a client. You want to get more clients of that industry. What would you do as an agency to go after more? I don't know. You did a lot of boiler stuff at Onepoint, didn't you? Fair amount. How did you go after your boiler guys with the... Or did they come to you? What was your strategy to get? So we did dedicated campaigns, Google Ads. We did for boilers. We had a mini site, Midas Clicks, forward slash boiler type and service or something. It'll be on archive.org. But essentially, run ads because they're looking. Like I say, I've never... Those kind of people are not really on LinkedIn. But I've never reached out. I've never phoned because I think if you're a busy small business, I just think phone calls are so disruptive. Hey, let me try and sell you something. It's like, yeah. I'm looking with trades and home improvement people. They're like, fuck off, mate. Someone could be ringing me. Do you want a roof? Do you want a roof with 50 grand and you're trying to get me to spend five of you? Piss off. It depends who you're targeting, trade. Yeah, not so much. How else if I had time and resources, and let's say I've got three decent case studies for the roofers because you're talking about roofers, I do like lumpy mail. If you could put them in a letter, like a postcard with information, like a case study, a little booklet, like an offer, like these bits. And the only reason I say this, and I've never done it, perhaps I should have done, is because I had an agency software company. I can only remember the bloody name now because it's so long ago. But it was like 2015. They sent me a green envelope with bits in it like that. Not the shit, like a pen, but just an introductory letter to say, this is why we've sent you this information. And then a booklet and then case studies and just bits. I think they gave me a checklist or a flowchart as well for some operational stuff. Essentially it was like a project management tool, which is boring as fuck. But they gave me all this information. I kept that on my desk for years because I just liked, I referenced it and I looked at it and it was just interesting and never worked with them. But... How even the respect they'll have for you just doing that in an old-fashioned kind of way. But imagine how many people felt the same as me and it was a positive, cold approach. If they'd rang me, I would have told them I'm not taking the call. If they'd sent me an email, I would not have looked at it. The fact they sent me a lumpy bit of mail, I opened it and read it, but it takes more effort than a phone call. You've got to put it all together. Because I think if you did that and then you did follow-up email, then your response rate would be much, much higher. In Facebook ads, which you're already doing, if you can hit all the avenues, yeah, you're going to get sales. The problem is it's how much the sales cost you. But again, I sort of come full circle to... On the path you called, you've been asking about more approaches to this. And... Is that because you feel like your Facebook ads are not working? It's just the quality is so hit and miss. Maybe it's just more qualification, slightly different offer. Yeah, I think you'd... Yeah, don't... Overthink it. I think you might be overthinking it. I would just try the landing page offer. I take one step at a time, because that could be the thing that takes you to the next level. It could be as simple as that. And then think about the more complicated stuff. And radio ads. Radio ads, yeah. Well, never say never.
