Hi guys, Ed Leake here. Today I'm going to show you quickly and simply how to refine your Facebook audience with Google Analytics data. So when you start advertising on Facebook, one of the first things you see is your audience profile and gender. And unfortunately this is where a lot of people come unstuck. So do you ever stare at these options and either select the defaults or worst you just guess? Well let me show you how using your actual visitor data you can hone your audience targeting to get in front of the right people who are more likely to buy from you. Let's jump into Google Analytics and selecting the past three months date range. Navigate your way down to audience, demographics and then age. So this is an online store. This example will look at the e-commerce data. Immediately several things become apparent here. So driving the most traffic or sessions are the 25 to 44 year olds. However the 25 to 34 segment is not only converting more, they are spending nearly twice as much. Also note whilst the younger audience of 18 to 24 is spending on average more, they also unfortunately convert quite poorly. You can dig a little deeper by clicking the age range. So let's have a look at our best performing group here of 25 to 34. Now this is telling, so whilst women account for 11% of traffic, they actually account for 20% of the revenue in this range. And look at that per session value, that's nice. If you weren't aware the per session value simply a divisible sum, so total revenue divided by total sessions. It's for online stores in particular, it's a good indicator of sales performance. You can use it on any traffic channel or demographic and so on. So let's take a step back. Now using the comparison visualization tool, which is really handy. We use the sessions as a baseline, but now you can assess the age ranges based on conversion rate and order value. So this will highlight how above or below the average each range is. For example, hey, we need to show some love to the 55 to 64 year olds, they convert the best here. You can do the same for gender too, of course. So we know that women spend more. That tells me that there needs to be more female orientated ads and copy to drive up those female visitor sessions. But in addition, there needs to be more focus on the 25 to 30 year olds full stop as they convert and spend really well. And that is it. So now you know, use your own data, stop guessing and improve your ad targeting. Good luck.
