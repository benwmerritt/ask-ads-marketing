he was on his own doing it and he lost every single client on Covid-19. I think the thing with the niche as well, for me, and I completely agree with Michael, like if something happens in that niche, like you're doing events and with Covid-19, you are Fed. Like I know a Facebook agency and who's only doing events, he was on his own doing it and he lost every single client on Covid-19. Like you are truly, like there's not a lot of security if something happens in the industry. So we will still take on other work that we know we can deliver on, but for the purpose of going out and marketing, it makes it a lot easier to be the specialist. And if you've kind of got that productised service, it's templated, it's, you know, copy and paste like you said, Ed. You have great case studies which your former clients can rely on or which they think, wow, okay, this is exactly me. You only need one good case study as well. This is the other thing that people worry about. They're like, well, I've only got one case study. It's like, is it a good one? Yeah. It's like dress it up, show it, literally show the work.

They'll be annoying you and it's a red flag and that's great. So I love clients that call out that they're like, oh, well, that kind of money I could do X, Y and Z. Okay. Bye. Yeah, it's like a blessing when they say that. You're like, sweet, I'm glad I heard this before I started.
