If you can't punctuate, if you don't put full stops, if you don't use capital letters, if you don't do what you're told to do, BAM! And I just became so ruthless in the process. Who just said terrible? Me. Fucking Alvalinda, you're like my biggest critic. Every time I do something you're like, shit. No! Hey, it's me. Well, I did your recruitment process. Yes. Very interesting. So I'm going to write some little feedback. We need to give people the heads up as to like, it's excellent, but give people the heads up as just how long it takes. And like, I don't profess to have a huge amount of experience at all of this stuff, full stop. But I, oh, look, it's a very funny sort of sad long story. I did a LinkedIn ad and I had forgotten that I had turned off my LinkedIn notifications because they drive me crazy. And evidently, when you do an ad, it's linked to that, like, they're all in together notifications. So I, and I had another website sending applications to the Google form. So I was still getting applications on the Google form thinking, oh, there's not many, this LinkedIn ad's not working very well, but obviously it's still working. I need to find out that it was working all right. I just wasn't getting the notifications. So of course, it ran over a weekend. And I came in on the Monday to like, I don't know, 56 applications or something. And I was like, shit, we have to turn that ad off. And then I was in the middle of moving house and had to shortlist. And one thing, you know, you said how good you are out of like five, one to five. I also added in partway through the process, how many years have you done? Because I know years doesn't equate to goodness, but you can also have the reverse. You can have someone who's done a year's worth of Google ads and say that there are five. So I ended up asking both those questions in relation to conversion tracking and Google ads. And it was interesting. And oh my God, the crap that I got, like, instead of asking comedian, I asked TV show. And one person, one guy wrote, not applicable. Instead of, I read books, I would have loved it if he said that. It was not applicable. I'm like, where are you going? If you can't punctuate, if you don't put full stops, if you don't use capital letters, if you don't do what you're told to do, bam. And I just became so ruthless in the process. Good. Yeah, it is designed to be ruthless. And yeah, it's to call people out who are lazy on their applications. Because I don't know why people don't think, oh, I'm going to be scrutinized if I can't be asked to punctuate or use shorthand or something. It's weird. But it does, it works to help you filter out your 50-odd or God forbid. Yeah, so when I asked him to send me one guy, when I asked them to send the resume onto Google Drive, no word of a lie. I reckon he went into LinkedIn and did some sort of weird extract and saved the screen as a PDF. And it kind of truncated it all into like half an A4 and just went all the way down the page and just went file save as and sent that to me as an appropriate resume. I'm like, yeah, nah, that's not going to cut it. But then how's what happened at the very end? I picked a lady who I thought was going to like was my winner. And I'd said to her, she was, Tommy had available dates and we saw, I hadn't definitely said yes, but we were heading in that direction. She emails me like 48 hours later and goes, I'm really sorry, I'm going to pull out of the race. I'm like, no. So she didn't tell me, she didn't tell me, I asked her why. She didn't tell me. I had a second place getter and I was just like, file quickly, they'll move on. So I went to my second place getter, had a subsequent conversation, asked some more questions and she literally started working yesterday. Well, that's quick. It's been a success so far. Yeah. Everyone can present well in an interview and everyone's on their best behavior for the first little while and we'll see. But already she's articulate, she's answering questions correctly. She's asking me questions. She's pushing back. She's using her head. So let's just see how it rolls. Good. Okay. Yeah. Well, I'm interested to hear your feedback on the bits that weren't quite right or weren't clear. I think the time frame allowed even like a couple of months because if you're trying, if you're like, if you're like Mr. Fancy Pants and have a really good manager and can sit there not working in your agency, then yes, you have all the time in the world to be picking people. But if you're in the weeds, like most of us are trying to do the doing and be the thing. And especially if it's a first hire, it's not my first time, but I'm only a tiny agency, then you're trying to do all the stuff and try and recruit and it's massively time consuming. So I would say take longer, like a month or probably, yeah, I probably did it in a few couple of weeks, but it definitely doesn't take days. And then the only other one was that question about years and how good they think they are because you can kind of match it up. Yeah. I did do the personality test because I actually was asked to do that by somebody in my like broader network and they are a friend of mine. So I actually had a source of person that I could go back to and say, hey, what about, like I didn't abuse the friendship, but I said, hey, what about these three? What do you reckon? How will they work with me? Will it work? And that was really interesting. And then I worked through, you know, your questions and it was fascinating to the ones that stood out that I remember were the ones about what's good and bad about your boss. That was fascinating because there was one where I was like all the bad things, unlike I'm that person. Yeah. Yeah. Precisely. And isn't it wonderful? People feel, I don't know if you found this, people feel more open about talking about someone else in a negative way than they would themselves. Most people really struggle to talk about themselves negatively or find a weakness. They half heart it. On the technical question, you said one out of five for Google ads. Maybe I should have put a bit more specifics in that. I think you asking about conversion tracking is more appropriate. Oh, I asked both. I asked both because you can have 10 years experience and be good at Google ads, but not have any convert. I wanted somebody who had both skill sets. Something specific. Yeah. And so I asked for a score out of five for both Google ads and conversion tracking. And then halfway through the process, I missed out on the answers for some of the people, but halfway through the process added in years of experience to both so that you could match them match them all up. Yeah. Because no one's going to put that one out of five for their Google ads, I hope, or even two or three. I would have thought all respond. I had people. This is on LinkedIn. I had people apply who had never done Google ads. Yes. Yeah. LinkedIn's the pain in the ass for that. Did you actually hire? Did the person who applied come through LinkedIn though? That you've actually hired? I'll have to go back and double check. I think she might have. Yeah. So you've found the needle in the haystack because LinkedIn is weird. It's like any jobs for people just apply regardless. I don't think people read the job spec. They just apply, apply, apply and shotgun and hope that they get an interview. I assume that's what people are doing because they're just sending out hundreds of applications to hope that one will hit instead of the tedious thing of actually reading a job spec and applying properly. I think people just go. Yeah. I certainly sent them like if I sent them a spear going, you've got to the next stage. Phil, do this, do that. And it was pretty ruthless about how I shortlisted out of there. But yeah, it was the whole process was fascinating.
