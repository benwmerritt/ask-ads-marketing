Hi, Ed here. I get a lot of questions about quality score issues so I'm just going to show you a quite an advanced way of using Google's natural language tool to essentially try and improve your ad relevance. So just on all keywords on this account I've selected the exact match keywords and then ad relevance below average because ad relevance is the easiest thing to fix. I don't really listen too much to expected click-through rate. It's not a huge amount you can do with it. If you fix your ad relevance and the structure of your accounts, your campaigns ad groups is contiguous, topical, so on. That normally does quite a lot to help with quality score. So learning page experience fixing that is more difficult but you can use the same technique to be fair. But let's focus on ad relevance. So I've literally done exact match, ad relevance, below average and then I'm going for the highest cost keyword which is this keyword which I have obfuscated from the screen but I'm just going to open incognito and let's search for this keyword. And what we do is we first of all look at the competition. What are they saying? We look at the organic results but this is pretty basic stuff for now and the next thing we do is we Google the, if I just open it in another tab, try again. There you go, natural language tool. So cloud natural language tool from Google. No, try the demo. That makes sense. Okay. I don't know why it's cutting the box off. Tough, tough T. So what do we do? We put in the winner, the top ranking ad and we get the text, we copy it, we head to the language processor, we literally paste it in and we run it through an analysis. It should ask me if I'm a robot. Great. Works every time. And we're back in the room. There we go. I'm not... And you get this output. So you get entities. Essentially the thing that matters in the entities is the stuff that's highlighted and it gives you the category. So entities can help. When you compare against the organic result and I'll show you that in a second, but sentiment is really important. So sentiment indicator tells you how positive negative the language is in the advert and you can literally look at scores from, it shows you at the bottom, up to one is essentially perfectly happy. And what we might find is if we look at the bottom of the page at another advert that doesn't rank as high, we might find it has a lower sentiment score. Yeah. And also there's less specifically categorized entities. Also note, it's quite good for finding audience categories. This is, but it's actually better if we go to the top organic search result. Okay. And then we can pull in like loads of the content. If it's got a long landing page, don't worry too much about it. Just paste it in and away you go and look for entities of significance. I'm not sure if you want to mention the C word in your adverts, but we've got things like people, partner, unemployment, accident, heart attack, and then sentiment. So what we're doing here, so this is the top ranking search, organic search result. And this, this shows you all the positive and negative language with inside that page. So you can start to essentially scalp positive sentiment. So you can see, I mean, literally open a notepad and start taking notes. So what's positive? What's negative? That's positive. Oh my God. Click the bloody mouse. And what else? There you go. What else? All right. So building up a picture of positive sentiment. And I didn't tell you this would be easy. If you want to win, it's not easy. But do this with the ads. So let's just go back to the, don't click your competitors ads, hover over the link. And in the bottom of the screen, as you can see, it tells you where the page is. So just type it in. Don't click click on their ads. And I know it takes more effort, but you don't want them doing it to use. Don't do it to them. But again, copy and you can do this for headlines, but here's the thing that stands out. Sorry, is numbers. Notice that numbers are a recurring theme. And again, sentiment, compare the best quotes, take that and go back to your notepad and say, hey, voila. And do the same. These are quite skinny, skinny ads. Essentially, location, another one that will crop up in the entities. So mentioning location is a good thing. So this has got a good score, immediate cover, pretty positive. But what's really positive is this line, great value cover, widest choice. You get the idea. And if we go back to the account, we can look at the hour ad, do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do and copy some of our ad copy and see. Notice how there's no no major entities. And it's not actually that positive. There is one positive high sentiment. So yeah, you can use the entities a little bit and sentiment and also categories. How is it categorizing? If you notice any weird categorization, it probably means that there's a misunderstanding in the language. But Google's using the the natural language engine to understand ads just in the way it understands organic. So you can use this on the organic results because they are ranking at the top for a reason. Google trusts them, it likes them, it thinks they're relevant. In fact, they're probably arguably often more relevant than the ads because they're not paid for people can mess the ads up. So a few key takeaways find and major entities that you're not mentioning we saw there something like that the numbers and location make quite a difference to the entities and sentiment the that there's positive sentiment in there that you can take away and reuse yourself obviously tweak and change to suit your adverts and do the same for the organic search results as well. So essentially take the best bits and create an even better version for yourself.
