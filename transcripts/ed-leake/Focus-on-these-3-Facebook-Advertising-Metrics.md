Hi guys, I'm Edly. Today we're going to discuss cutting the crap and focusing on the three Facebook ad metrics that actually matter. Are you advertising on Facebook or looking to get started? Then you're probably staring at a wall of ad performance numbers. So let's cut through the noise. In this video I'll show you the three metrics that matter the most. But first, here's a really quick rundown of the Facebook ad metrics. So firstly we have impressions. This is literally how many times someone sees your ad. Reach. This is the unique impressions, hence that will be lower than your total impressions. Next is social impressions that are ad impressions that include social context. By that I mean if you target friends of people who like your page then those people will see their friend's name in the advert. Now depending on what you do and sell, this can trigger heightened engagement but it certainly won't work for all markets and industries. Next we have frequency. This is how many times a person on average has seen your advert. And cost, of course, should go without saying your total spend for this period. Clicks all is the total number of clicks on your ad. So these could be likes, shares, link clicks or mere clicks on the actual advert itself. There's also a click through rate, CTR, which is split between all and link. So Facebook has a CTR all, CTR link. There's an important difference here. If your goal is to get engagement then the all measurement for CTR is relevant. If you're looking for link clicks then ignore the CTR all as it's going to over read and skew what you're actually gunning for. Then CPC or cost per click is how much you spend per interaction with your ad. Again, this might not be a link click. Sometimes people will just like your ad and move on. I don't know why but they do. There's also a CPC measurement for link clicks which is probably more useful to be honest. CPM which is cost per meal is your cost per 1000 ad impressions. So link clicks is next and that represents the total clicks that take people off Facebook. And then there's engagement metrics which again these are pretty self-explanatory so they come in the form of post likes, comments and shares. In the addition you will get page likes off the back of ads which you can measure too here in your Facebook ad manager. And our people taking action is the number of unique actions per person. So for example a single person liking a post and clicking the link is considered one person taking action. And finally relevancy a simple metric. It's a bit like the Google ad words quality score that signifies from 1 to 10 how engaged your audience is with your ad. Now it might be last on this list of metrics but it's important to remember an above average relevancy score directly correlates to spending less on ads. So consider that when Facebook ads has to decide which ad to display to a specific user the algorithm will have a preference to the more relevant ad being shown first. If that ad isn't yours it quickly becomes more expensive to advertise and this effect unfortunately snowballs over time. So relevance is the most important metric then. Well actually no let me explain. You set a goal for your ad so let's say you want to capture a lead for your offer you're an online retailer. You will hopefully know your conversion rate and therefore how much that lead is worth to your business. Therefore you can calculate your CPA your cost per acquisition so it doesn't matter if you spend a hundred dollars or ten thousand. If your ad delivers leads for or less than your target CPA then you're winning. So that's an ideal world but there are two other priority metrics I'd use to hone and fine tune your ads and these are click-through rate and frequency. So firstly why CTR why click-through rate because click-through rate tells you how well your ad is performing and how many people care to click. So consider that under two percent click-through is poor particularly one percent or less which is diabolical. If you got a click-through rate of one percent or less you need to change your ad your copy or probably the audience you're targeting. So therefore if two percent is considered average it's okay I mean if it's falling within your cost parameters then it's okay but you should really be aiming for three to four percent or more and to be honest if you start hitting five to ten percent and beyond you know your message to your audience match is really strong. That in turn will drive down your cost per click and engagement over time so click-through rate really is important and frequency which I mentioned earlier this is the third important metric so frequency is the gauge for understanding if you're about to burn your bridges and piss people off. For that simple reason it's a really good performance metric so if your frequency is under five which means on average people have seen your ad five times then you're in the safe zone you're still in the friend zone so a frequency of sort of five to ten is acceptable but less than optimal and will typically mean your click-through rate drops with time. Over ten on the frequency metric and you're in the danger zone you're starting to hit saturation which isn't attractive to people they potentially will tune out or worse mark your ads as junk and you'll be lost to them forever well on Facebook at least which is 1.6 billion potential people that's significant so cutting through all the noise the three critical metrics that I pay attention to is cost per acquisition your CPA you click-through rate your CTR and the frequency that people see your ads. I hope that's been really helpful if you have any questions please leave them in in the comments below and keep an eye out for my next video which is discussing Facebook ad audiences cheers
