Most people were stuck on the traffic pillar and that's where, but you see there's like five pillars. If you're even doing, let's just say it's 2020, 2020, well, those six pillars, but the ones after the first pillar, if you're just focusing on traffic, that's not enough anymore. Like traffic, like who's looking after the other pillars very rarely and no one is. So then you're not going to get results. You need to look at the capture pillar and then like the nurture pillar and then the pillars afterwards. So, you know, that was a beautiful representation of like what we were speaking about earlier because it really is like this is what's required now. But this is actually what will get you result. It'll get you paid and it will get like clients to be happy and then you get referrals, you retain clients and then your business grows because then you're delivering what is needed. Two pushbacks as well. So freelance are watching this will be like, I'm just one person. How the hell do I do all that? And the other pushback is, well, I can't get the leads in the first place. Well, to answer the freelancer. Yeah. If you want to be the top 1%, then and this is top 1% stuff, then yeah, you've got to push yourself over that initial hurdle of doing these things. Yeah. But once they're in place, the Google ads account is not an expertise. It's a template. It's not difficult. It really is not difficult. You can't protect that. That's it. You can't protect that. There's no, there's no fight there. So if someone else turns up and says, Oh, I can audit this and I can do that. They can do the same thing. But it's this that you just in this year in a sea of sharks get good at the landing page, find a template that works, roll it out across. You might have three of these accounts. Find what works, keep tweaking it, improve it. And you get through to this process and and towards the end of this process, should I say, going through these pillars, you build out these beautiful case studies for this very specific audience. No one else is producing because you're doing all these additional steps. Yeah. And I could say that if you especially if you hate sales like me, if you rock up to a call or pitching someone called this, a lot of years or tweak and go, this is too good to be true. And you'll be like, I know, I know, but it's let me show you how good this is. I'm really proud of the work I do. It's not just Google ads. I'm good at Google ads, but look at all this other shit. I'm really proud of this. Put this together.
