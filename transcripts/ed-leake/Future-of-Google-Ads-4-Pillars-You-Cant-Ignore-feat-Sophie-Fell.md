Hey, it's Ashwin and Ed again with another episode of Over Budget, the show that tells you how to avoid expensive mistakes in your digital marketing career. Before we get into the introduction and today's show, please remember to like and subscribe. That's going to help us get more excellent guests and bring you excellent content that's going to help you further your Google ads and digital marketing career. So with no further ado, please welcome Sophie Fel. Today's guest, she is the head of paid search at Liberty Marketing Group, sorry, head of paid media at Liberty Marketing Group. And Sophie is here to talk to us today about integrated search and how PPC and SEO can work together to improve the web experience, improve search results, improve business results, and generally make things much more pleasant in a world where search is starting to become more and more fragmented. So let's do whatever we can do to control the experience for our customers, our clients, and work with the constraints that Google put us in. Sophie, thank you so much for joining us. Excited to have you on for this topic. Thank you for having me. I was really excited when I got the invite. So yeah, thank you so much. And apparently I'm the first woman on the podcast, the podcast, the video so far. So I'm happy to represent. And I'm also so glad that I don't have to do well, Ashwin's kindly doing the intros because because he fluffed it slightly, which is good because I would fluff it all the way. He got your head of paid media, not a head of search, head of paid media, which is which is telling because you know, the whole thing we're talking about is fewer silos. And I fluffed that important bit. It's all right. I'm only pulling his leg. I prefer to keep it unprofessional. That's where the fun is. All right, well, let's jump in. So Sophie, first, before we get into like, you know, what you're here to talk to us about and educate people on, let's start from the end, right? So we're talking about paid search and paid media, organic search and paid search working together specifically. What does that end result look like? And I know you've got four pillars that you base everything on, but if you had to sum it up in like one or two sentences, what does the ideal integrated search setup look like? That is a great question. I think ideally the ultimate goal is to have those really custom and personalized experiences. Obviously, we want that omnichannel experience regardless. So that's nothing new. But again, I think we're going to see that come more into the fore in the next couple of years, certainly the next kind of five years as well. So for me, that truly integrated strategy is one where the two are kind of really working together rather than cannibalizing each other and things like that. And again, the ultimate goal of that is to offer those really personalized experiences to users, but ultimately impact the businesses we work for and their bottom line. I feel like the mean girl's gun lady who's like she wants to bake a cake full of like rainbows and stars or whatever. That's how I feel about kind of PPC and SEO teams working together. I think we've been siloed and kind of fragmented as you said Ashwin for too long. And yeah, it's all it's all coming together now, I think. Yeah, I like the cake analogy because years ago, if I got my SEO PPC team to work together, I'm not sure what the cake would come out like. Probably have like a dog's leg in it, some sawdust, some sweepings, some like hate mail to each other. You won't want to eat it. But I think things have improved, things have to improve. But also I'm blindsided because I haven't been in SEO for a long time. So this is why I think the conversation is going to be really interesting because I'm completely blind to that. I'm like Mr. PPC. Oh, that sounds awful. Mr. PPC. This is where I have to put the t-shirt in. There you go. Did it? Got it. Sorry, carry on. I've done my bit now. All right. So walk us through your four pillars. What does the future of paid search look like? Fab. So yeah, four pillars as we said. So I think, again, really interestingly, we had Google Marketing Live very recently. And again, a lot of this has kind of come out of there as well. But I think, again, that continued and growing integration between PPC and SEO is something, again, particularly paid search, but also paid media as a whole, is going to kind of continue. And we're talking a little bit about what that kind of integration looks like in practice and how we can kind of work better with organic teams and stuff. But I think in times of search, again, some of the levers that we have today will disappear. I think anyone that's been in Google Ads for 10, 20 years, again, I was kind of speaking to Ashwin before this as well. Our jobs have really evolved from just having keywords and bidding aggressively to drive traffic. And I think our role today and again in the future is more about really impacting the bottom line for businesses that we work with and understanding paid search and paid media's role in the wider ecosystem of a business. So I think, again, we've seen the shifts from the practical side, but also from the kind of strategic side of paid media. So I think we can expect some of the levers we have today to continue to disappear. In terms of what I mean when I say that, I think some of the inputs we have currently of inputting ad copy, inputting creative, again, we can kind of see those shifts the last couple of years with some of the inventions we've seen in the new ad formats and the new ad types. But also even interestingly hearing Mark Zuckerberg's recent comment about how he kind of expects businesses of the future to hand over their bank details or their credit card details and tell them what result they want and kind of sit back and listen to it and kind of receive the results. So I think what's really interesting there is we're seeing this shift across paid media as a whole and reducing that manual input. And I think, and again, we'll talk about it later, but we need to now pivot, right? We need to pivot away from having the manual inputs as our levers to optimize and consider what that looks like in the future and how we can influence and optimize that too. I think that the third pillar, again, that understanding of data and data utilization. So again, I mean, I've been a paid media and paid search for nearly 10 years now. And again, for me, once it used to be click through rate was the be all and end all CPC was the be all and end all. And again, we're so, so far beyond that now. So not only understanding the data, but really learning how to use it. And again, as those levers and those manual inputs get reduced, I think that using, you know, conversion data and offline conversion data and customer lifetime value data and all that stuff again, is going to be our levers. That's that's what we're going to need. So again, I think the role of a PPC practitioner is changing, but also the platforms are changing and what we're able to do is changing. I think finally, and again, we're seeing signs of this and we've seen again, some kind of announcements along these lines with Google marketing live is that dynamically generated content. We already know with our essays that there's I think up to 30,000 combinations, I believe it is. But I can really see us getting to a position where again, paid search and organic working really closely together. And we're seeing that kind of ad copy being taken from the website from the landing pages with a with a sprinkle of AI in there, not sure how much of a sprinkle or a fistful of AI there is coming, but really seeing that tailored messaging for everyone and even having, you know, even more of those signals and audience insights than we have now. So I think as a whole, and I'm not trying to scare Munger, but I do think our role is, is, you know, continuing to shift and continuing to change. So those are my kind of four pillars of where I think search is kind of going. Can I ask a question? Just a quick one to take it off piece as I always do on the first pillar and not to sorry, Ashwin, and not to fear Munger because I hate fear Munger in because literally I opened it's the day after Google marketing live. I literally went on Twitter and LinkedIn and I just saw it's the end of the world or end of search as you know it and it's like, I don't sound like a dinosaur yet search is changing but it's gradual shift. I looked for something this morning, I searched it I didn't ask AI because AI is it's slow I can just thumb it in and get my result from Google. I don't know why that would need to change if I'm trying to fix a car maybe I will talk to the AI or if I'm lonely. Little mini violin but I digress well I'm wondering not to fear Munger but do we think talking about PPC and SEO sort of combining but or working more together do we think that SEO is really on the back foot now because for years people have pronounced the death of SEO. It's literally been happening since I've been in marketing I think 2010 I think the first person SEO is dead and it's been doing quite well since then but now I do feel like the room for SEO is getting compressed and compressed. It's a it's your I know your page as well but you work with SEO teams I don't. Did your gut or what you're experiencing do you see that fear in the SEO team and I hate to use the word fear? Honestly no I actually think these changes empower organic teams more honestly because I think as pay media people again we're going to have to again personally I think we're going to have to rely on them more you know and really rely on them too again when we're talking about the levers of creative and messaging I think a lot of that's going to come from what's there organically personally again with those inputs that we have so I almost think this empowers organic teams a little bit more than maybe they have been. Yeah trying to optimise the the AI responses because I've noticed that that I don't know now I'm going to sound really sad but I was talking to chat GPT about myself briefly just to see what it knew about me and it's kind of weird that it was it was citing sources that were me so I was sort of my own SEO in AI because it was telling me how amazing I was and I'm like yeah I wrote that bit and then something else you know what I mean and I'm like ah okay so this is how SEOs get ahead in the in the new world um by optimising what the AI's essentially crawl or digest and present uh so there's a whole yeah it's a whole new ball game so it's just switched up don't need to be scared sorry Ashwin uh carry on yeah the the old way used to be you would create a piece of content you'd put in the effort or spend a lot of money acquiring backlinks of course we nobody pays for backlinks you know if google's watching this it's not a thing that we do at all they used to just get a bunch of backlinks to a page and as long as they were semi-relevant to your domain and they were decent enough quality it would signal to google's crawlers and algorithms that this was something worth surfacing when people search right now what you want to end up doing is it's it's the non-brand mentions like it's really not that I it frustrates me when I hear SEOs talk about LLM optimization or anything like that it's literally just brand marketing the more people talk about you the more likely you are to show up in an LLM query or an AI overview it's it's that simple the other thing that's happening is a lot of the upper funnel traffic where let's say for example if you had a software company they would create pages like what is a CRM what is a sales rep and that's the kind of stuff that used to get a lot of traffic and it would get you say like 10 000 views a month out of which maybe a hundred views are relevant to your business now an LLM can answer those questions AI overviews can answer those questions what you need to focus on is that problem-solving layer in the middle of the funnel and then the consideration and purchase related content at the bottom of the funnel which a lot of people simply ignored and now you have to do that and even even if you go outside the business space something like travel an LLM I used chat gpt to find out what the best hotels were the last time I traveled to southeast asia I didn't need to look up articles or anything like that but once I had the shortlist I didn't go looking for stuff on google search I went straight to youtube and I looked for reviews of those specific hotels I looked for travel logs going to those particular places right that's the kind of research that people are doing now so you have to get hyper specific at the middle and lower end of the funnel you have to show people evidence you have to show them that you've done this thing before so if it's a subject matter related query like you have to show that the article has to be written by or influenced by somebody who's done that thing and they have to be able to show their work it's it's all about trust at this point and I think I think that opens up a great opportunity for organic content teams to focus on the stuff that's going to build trust increase trust and get business well thank you very I mean that was from the heart thank you Ash and you've been a stellar guest uh yeah that's good I know I like that that's good I think uh on the soapbox for a minute there what have I done with my questions uh yeah great I've learned something there and to be fair I don't think either of you are scare mongering I think it is the role of the paid search or ppc specialist is changing it's becoming less and less about ads themselves and more about broader core marketing um and I was telling Sophie this I think the the demographic most at risk today is the person whose main skill set is managing a google ads account if that's what you say you're best at you need to upskill or you're going to be in trouble hello if you enjoyed the video please hit the like button consider subscribing as well potentially better than that head over to edleague.com stick your email in and every two days I'll send you free bs free tools and lots of google ads advice thanks back to the video very quick message cheers um so ppc and SEO integration we talk about what this could look like uh what the end result is so if you walk us through the specifics yeah of course so I wanted to give some kind of more practical tips I think it's very easy for us all to say like ppc and SEO team should work more closely together but people rarely actually say how and what that looks like so I've put together six little little tips for for us paid media pros uh paid search pros um to kind of work a bit more closely with our with our organic friends because they are our friends they are our friends so and this is kind of how we work in practice at the agency I'm at at the moment lib so focus on keyword clusters to prioritize with both paid search and organic activity so this is what we do with our clients um so again I think again it's really common that actually ppc and SEO teams actually are going after two completely separate lists of you know keyword priorities and again that can kind of come out from having two different keyword research processes and different tools and things like that so we really try um as much as possible to kind of sing from the same hymn sheet as much as possible um and what we can do with that again is like we're not just saying okay we'll bid on all of these and organic will push you know content to all of these pages or keywords at the same time the goal really is to you know for us as paid search experts where can we pull back you know where do we not have to bid as aggressively how can we prop up organic's efforts so a lot of these strategies when we are really integrated actually SEO led strategies with paid media supporting um I always say to clients and I don't actually mean this because I obviously don't want to ever be redundant in my role but my job with my clients is to make you know the paid media a little bit redundant I think a lot of clients when they when they come to us and a lot of businesses actually rely and have you know 70 80 90 percent of their traffic coming from paid media so our goal really again with that integration between paid search and and organic is to reduce that reliance it doesn't mean you'll never need paid media like you know like I said I don't want to you know be out of the job but the goal really is to you know have your your organic rankings being as strong as physically possible and then paid media supporting and propping that up rather than you know if your paid media ads turn off overnight your traffic drops to zero so that's kind of the the main kind of ultimate goal with that um and again in the second one so scaling back paid media spends where we can on keywords that are already ranking really well really consistently and are converting crucially as well um and then I think something that we probably don't do enough is as paid search experts is again sharing those insights from a b tests and creative and landing page tests and things like that um we have to remember on a really simple level our ad headlines and descriptions are organics meta titles and meta descriptions right and I think again we we miss that we miss that kind of collaboration between the two um so for me I think that's something that's really important how can we share what's working really well for us and can that influence you know organic strategy and what it is they're doing as well um again testing new organic content and learning pages as we know when you create a brand new learning page or you know strip it back and start again um it's really difficult to kind of get that traffic from the get go especially now so I think again how can paid media support that well we can send traffic to that page we can send relevant traffic to that page and and help those tests kind of occur a bit quicker um and again for us to kind of in paid media paid search I think it's really important that we do familiarize ourselves with the kind of ecosystem of of organic as a whole so not just um SEO and I know we're talking about SEO here but also like how content impacts that how did gpr um impacts that how the technical side kind of impacts that um because again I think as we were kind of speaking about that importance for us to understand how it works so we can help influence the levers that we'll have in future to to optimize our ads is going to be really important so really again the ultimate goal is about you know saving money when we can for for our clients and the businesses we work for but also propping up that kind of unicorn strategy where all traffic comes from from organic and you never have to do paid ads I think just to touch on your first point about um the what was I going to say oh for god's sake brain dead uh I'll try again to touch on your no it's your first and last point about uh trying to move away from a reliance on paid traffic I think this is where versus the SEO uh teams we've in paid we've probably got an easier future because paid ads pay for the internet so ads are not going so this is a get like the anti-fear mongering ads ain't going nowhere so if you are a google ads professional um obviously skill up into multiple things a bit more but but ads will stay in some shape or form because it's how we pay for the internet and that's where I think organic might be on the back foot a little bit with AI but AI will and it already is having AI AI already having ads put inside AI so yeah ads are just going to take a different shape or form um but they they're here to stay so um but I do that yeah I appreciate your take on trying to get more organic traffic because essentially it's cheaper but I do wonder if that dichotomy is going to uh exist because if you're if you're google or meta or apple or whoever um microsoft I think you're going to be desperate to get some ad revenue from AI aren't you so it's yeah it's it's going to shift the ad game again at some point and then again the organic game is going to change up as well so it's it's disconcerting but then there are still dinosaurs like me that still use google today it still exists it's still a great search engine for some things uh and if I'm looking for a pair of shoes or a plumber I go to google I don't ask the AI maybe I'm getting old I'm 43 this year I'm out of touch but uh but also people of my age typically got the the income to spend so it's all well and good saying well all the kids are using AI it's like yeah but they're not buying as much stuff as as old gits because as old gits has got a bit more money um I'm not that old but you know what I mean yeah and I think what's really interesting um your point there as well is like when I'm talking about this ppc and seo integration you're right it is based on how the SERP is right now and how to optimize towards the SERP right now and again we're absolutely going to see that that evolution and again you know what do these paid ads um look like within within chat gpt or whatever kind of AI people are using um and again how do we influence that you know are we taking that from what we're already running in google ads to google google's version of chat gpt and what that looks like or is it something again that's going to be that's going to stem from what's there organically you know so I think it is that really interesting it's something for us all to kind of keep an eye on definitely but like you said I think that evolution in the way that the paid ads are right now and what that's going to look like in the next five years is absolutely going to shift um and again the best practices for integration between paid media and organically going to shift with it for sure but we've got time as well we've got time for the shift and that that's another sort of reassuring point I want to make to people because I fear that everyone's a bit scared about the future but the the technology shifts are quick but people have to catch up to that so it's not like google or whoever will release something overnight then all of a sudden the world's changed to using it so there is time so for example I know someone who's in god here ads and they don't use AI at all and you think oh out of touch backwards he's absolutely killing it he's like 30 conversion rates 25 conversion rates for lead gen amazing and he's just sticking to the fundamentals and doing a good job a good landing page is good tracking solid tight google ads and he's just thought he's like well I don't need the AI until my performance tanks and I'm like yeah fair enough um you know living the dream I guess he doesn't have to talk to a fake version of himself pretending to be friends but anyway I don't know where that came from but yeah so it yeah it's essentially you don't have to worry today because what works today works it's just it's always having to have a near to the ground and looking a little bit ahead but these things will shift in time not overnight I don't think I'm absolutely no and I think again when we have things like google marketing live I think you know you see all the hot takes on you know every single platform but again we have to remember a lot of this is coming soon or coming next year or again like you said none of this is happening right now today um you know so like you said we absolutely have time nothing nothing's changing immediately and do you know what even when these things do change and these ad formats do change user behavior needs to shift to right that's what we're we're working towards so it's all very well having different ad formats and new ad formats but we really need the the data and the users to catch up with that I suppose in a way for us to then get in the position where we need to optimize towards those things so that yeah there's absolutely time yeah and one thing I want to call out specifically is the scare tactics that that make it out to be as though using llms or ai and using traditional search it's some kind of binary thing like there was a study that showed um more than 40 percent of american adults or americans over the age of 16 have used chat gpt for search related queries that doesn't mean that those 40 percent are using only chat gpt I mean I use chat gpt and google I'm sure there are many many others like me just because adoption of one particular platform increases doesn't mean that it's necessarily going to uh reduce the the relevance of something else it might I think what'll end up happening is people will use these things for different reasons but I don't know that well certainly today an lm is not at the point where it can help you throughout the purchase journey there's just too much made up stuff in there I think people still want some kind of trust so they're still going to go to your website they're still going to look you up they're still going to read your reviews and stuff like that and they're going to want to see that on the web where they can believe it 100 percent I think these are two not opposite but two complementary skills right so being literate in data is one thing and knowing how to use that interpretation and those numbers is another thing before you get into like the how to how would you define these two things so I think data literacy again is just about you know when you're looking at your campaign report in google ads do you understand what's there do you understand what metrics there are and kind of knowing in the back of your mind those benchmarks which of course comes with time as well and you get to that point where you can look at a CTR of a campaign and go that's good that's bad and I know why you know so I think that's kind of the fundamentals of of data literacy understanding again what's important being able to have that kind of background knowledge of that that's what's good is and that's what bad is I think data utilization is kind of again it's on the I guess it's in the same vein it's the knowledge of how to use data but and where we're looking in within google search and kind of google ads itself it's more now about making sure we have the right conversion data and we're like giving the right stuff to google basically to kind of train the algorithm on algorithm sorry and optimize towards the actions that we want people to take so I think again before data utilization might have been like oh can you set up basic conversion tracking on a thank you page and and you know make sure that you are telling google to optimize towards that conversion action whereas now there's you know enhanced conversions and offline conversion imports and we're you know optimizing towards customer lifetime value rather than one-off purchases and things like that so you know using customer match data using abandoned cart data and all those kinds of things so again I think the use of both of these things and the and the emphasis on both of these things has really shifted again in the last 10 years but the last five years more specifically so that was how I would kind of split out the two and then define the two and like I guess the dumb dumb take is data literacy is what you know and utilization is what you want the machine to know I guess that's sort of a really simple way of looking at it I like that yeah yeah so what what's working for you what what are you recommending to people yeah I think that's a really it's a really interesting topic because again I think the paid media practitioners of of yesteryear again it was all about data literacy and again it's what we teach juniors it's what we teach execs like to understand what to look out for and what it means but I think and again you know data utilization has evolved massively and I think again this is another part of of our roles that's evolving and you know how do we get this data and how do we also like share and I'm talking from an agency background I have it how do we share with the clients as well the importance of having that data and why we need it and I think that's the other kind of skill that comes with the data utilization as well like is it from a CRM or you know your back end of your website what does it look like how accurate is it and all those kinds of things so you know it's like data cleaning and all this kind of stuff that we that we need to do so again I think the data utilization in particular is something that's really shifted and it is again a key part of a kind of paid media practitioners role these days and some of it is people not knowing better some of it is unsavory behavior but just making sure that you and your your client or your boss if you're in house whatever it might be that you're all on the same page in terms of what success looks like so I know like Ed spoken about this many times you know when he was talking to prospects he would want them to give him one KPI that defines success and it's really tempting I see a lot of people still do this where you would put in your main conversion action as page views or something like that to make your row ass look absolutely phenomenal and I think if you do that without knowing better you should educate yourself and move to a better place if you do it intentionally you're a bit of a scumbag if somebody's trusting you with their budget it could be a business owner a client it could be somebody who employs you I think you have an obligation to do the best you possibly can with that budget so even when you are thinking about literacy and utilization like focus on those few metrics that really make a difference right so you what you see in the platform should be a measure to getting good business results but you don't necessarily want to say okay my CTR went from 3% to 8% I have succeeded if your CTR is going up but it's not also translating to more people signing up making the purchase whatever it might be and more money flowing into the client's bank account like have you really done your job because then you can go back and you can this is the other part of literacy is saying okay this has gone up but this other business metric has not gone up now I know what the gap is and how to fix it that's then the next level of being able to read and apply the data and I will say I mean we've had this problem at Liberty and I think a lot of agencies find it where we take a brief or we're doing pitches and a client's like I want traffic and I want sales and I want this and I want that and I'm focused on new customer acquisition but I want the ROAS to be this and like there is that balancing act a lot of the time and I think we've got really we've got really good now at again when we're saying you want traffic or you want impressions like why you know what does that mean yes it's lovely when three million people see your ad but like what's the impact of that you know what do you want to happen and and more often than not you know it is revenue you know at the end of the day um you know we talk about brand awareness we talk about consideration but really it's all feeding into you know the conversion action at the end and the ultimate sale or lead or whatever that kind of looks like so I think it's something like if you're a you know if you're listening to this like watching this in your you know a business that works in marketing and maybe has outsourced work to agencies and kind of things like that or you've got teams that you work with I think it's really important to be super super clear with those KPIs because like you said Ashwin there's no point driving you know a thousand or 10,000 more people to a website again on paper it looks good and you'll click the rates up and your your traffic's really good but if those people aren't converting there's a problem right when we're wasting money so I think like you said that's the next level of of data literacy and I'm not really honestly kind of separates people that are maybe you know a couple of years into those real strategic thinkers it's the tactics versus strategy and I think again that's another really important part here. Yeah I'm just going to add on top of that the just thinking about this the data literacy now actually it's it shouldn't be platform dependent it's to elevate yourself it should be business data and business KPIs so I was a bullet in the china shop with this I remember going to a pitch in a boardroom full of people looking back at me and I just swore a lot and I was demanding that they get me their north star KPI I'm like how many leads do you bloody want just tell me and they're like well we don't really know and I was just like for god's sake it was quite a big company but I was really like bullish with it and they did say afterwards you're the only one trying to force us to commit to a target something specific but prior to that I'd gone in well I did it with every prospect I literally want all the business data I want to pre-onboard you by knowing all your back-end data the your margins the value of something how well you convert if it's lead gen you know how many sales how many leads does it take to to get that sale none of this is Google ads because it but it impacts the Google ads directly so it's better than knowing hello mr or mrs prospect what's your budget and this kind of thing it's like that comes later it's like hold on a minute how many calls do you want how many calls do you need what do you mean you don't know it's your bloody business you know that's that's how I was quite combative with it and I think going forwards if you are like that and you don't have to be as class as me but imagine if this I don't know three of you pitching for a job I know with a client and only one of them one of you is asking for all these business metrics and really pushing them and the other two are talking about you know what click-through rate they can get how many you know cost per click but you know how fancy the landing page is blah blah blah talking about the the tools but not their business and maybe that comes of experience but that's another way so the data literacy elevate it to business metrics not just bloody ad metrics yeah absolutely and I think again this is something we're finding a lot is that surprising thing when you work with in-house marketing departments that they actually don't know and they don't have that and again I think again the role of even us as a paid search practitioner is to push that you know and push them as a team because again it can be very easy for marketing departments that are in house to have again these goals are oh we'll get x amount of traffic to the website will increase traffic to the website by 20% from social and things like that and those are all lovely kpis but again what does that mean what's the impact of that what's that going to do and I think we can spend a lot of time energy and effort on these things that sound fancy and look great it maybe even win awards you know but it's like if that's not impacting your bottom line and your business level and again that's where we've kind of again shifted from just paid search practitioners to again business advisors in a way and marketing advisors in a way because it's all linked up and again I think that separates a lot of people in the in the industry being able to have those those bigger conversations so phi most obvious thing before we jump off how do people follow you stay in touch learn more oh you can just find me on linkedin I'm not a huge social media girly in my professional life so follow me on linkedin see what I see what I'm up to just so if you fail yeah we'll put the link in the description as well as the links to uh got your ads if you want to pick up a copy of that remember again to like and subscribe you know keep us in business keep the lights on remember to leave a comment if there's anything here you have questions about or anything that we didn't get into that you might have questions about we'll try to get Sophie to answer your questions please let us know what else you'd like to learn or if you'd want to hear from any particular type of experts or subjects again let us know in the comments and again thank you for watching
