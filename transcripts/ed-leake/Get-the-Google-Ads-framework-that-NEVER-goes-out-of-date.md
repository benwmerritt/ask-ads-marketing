Hey everyone, this is David from Vienna. I'm working for an online marketing consultancy and I've been using the God Tier Ads framework for about six months, maybe a little longer. And basically I chose the God Tier Ads framework because Ed just has a certain authenticity about him and he really sticks out. There's a lot of scam artists out there and I just went with my gut feeling and didn't regret it one bit because God Tier Ads basically doesn't just provide a collection of videos, articles, white papers, etc. But it's an actual framework and most of all it just gives me peace of mind that I'm always up to date with the current best practices because the Google Ads universe is changing rapidly every day. And it's just good to know that someone's out there keeping the pace and always keeping the framework up to date. So yeah, highly recommended. Five stars. Go get it now.
