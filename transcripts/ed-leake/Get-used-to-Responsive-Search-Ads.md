Get used to responsive search ads Because from July 2022 you'll not be able to create extended text ads or edit existing ones Those bastards So what do we do with our ETAs now? Not a lot Your existing extended text ads will continue working You'll still see reports on their performance And you'll be able to pause or Re-enable extended text ads as and when you need to So when it comes to responsive search ads, here are the things you need to know Ad strength is not used in the auction. So don't obsess over it Ad strength can be confusing because it's not a measure of success. It's not part of quality score It's not a quality metric and therefore it doesn't impact ad ranking There's a caveat to that though. My experience suggests it increments impression share So what is ad strength and if it's Well, it's a simple score designed to help you improve the relevance potential relevance of your ad Before it hits the search engine So you can use it as a guide for relevancy and diversity of your ad copy ad strength offers no certainty over improved conversion metrics Pinning a headline or a description will in most cases Reduce your ad strength, but ad strength is relevant to the auction So if in doubt or you worry about what combination of headlines Google's going to serve pin your most important headline in the first position Easy and don't forget you can pin more than one headline to the same position You can have multiple h ones and google will simply rotate them ish Avoid semantically similar text in your rsa headlines. So don't reword the same thing For example, don't say get a free trial and then free trial today Use one or the other and if you can't say something new or different Don't add it to your rsa ignore the ad strength But what if google doesn't report anything meaningful for your rsa's because they haven't hit the impression requirement? How do you understand and report on them? How do you understand the impact of your rsa's? number one review your time segments Looking for impression gains also consider teaming your rsa's with broad match keywords Or smart bidding or both in doing so you should see or expect to see an incremental gain in impression share using rsa's If all else fails pin every fucking position
