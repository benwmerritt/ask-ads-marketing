The people who don't tend to have a weak point of view or none and they tend to like share things that people agree with already They tend to not challenge the studies going any way she performed and therefore they come across as why the fuck are you here? You hear a lot about personal brand I don't really know how that's defined of what what it means But might kind of challenge with it. So we have a Google ads agency. We work with trades home improvement businesses Yeah, what's the best way to get started from scratch? With developing your own personal brand and like how do you find your unique personal brand in an area where? So saturated with marketing companies. Everyone's kind of doing the same sort of thing Yeah, that's that's I'd say is the main kind of question and challenge Okay, great start. So I fucking hate the term personal branding Ed made me use it. No, it's it's it's one of the things where you don't start from scratch You have one already whether you like it or not, right? So you have a brand already a brand to speak about Scientifically, it's just a collection of nodes in people's Brain on the associated with some certain stuff, right? So you already are projecting that if you have a LinkedIn if you're like if you have clients you already have a brand So the key is not to create it from scratch the key is not to like create a avatar that doesn't look like you or Or try to create something out of nothing It's ready to lean on what is already good what people like and like triple down on it almost caricature yourself because people are You know, they they might not they don't really care about about you They care about themselves and so they only have you know, if they discover you they have might have three seconds to see what you're up to So caricaturing yourself so that they understand what you're about very quickly is kind of where it's at Does it make sense of our in terms of the difference between yeah, so then let me try to give you some practical stuff so the reason why it's important to lean on you as a person is because Again scientifically speaking cognitively Humans connect to humans, right? I'm not gonna go into the cliche. You know that so it's also helpful because your Personality who you are what you project online mostly Is something that's gonna stay with you. So even if the business fails, which I don't wish You that but you know or it you change career, whatever it will stay with you, right? Which is also very interesting. So I'm not a personal branding guru in fact And it's only recently them starting to use the term because I've realized that people like us are using that term more than positioning or differentiation Practically if I had to pick one very specific thing to do is To create a Point of view now before you roll your eye I don't mean it in a very fucking bullshit the way that most LinkedIn expert will say I again I mean it scientifically cognitively so a strong point of view is there to say I'm here for my specific segment I'm here to protect them This is how they're being fucked over by whoever or whatever and I'm here to like protect them for that reason, right and It's it works because it's basically sending Long-term signals to your audience by saying hey, you can trust me. I'm on your side I'm willing to take some heat in the short term in order to be trusted in the long term right in in evolutionary biology is called continuous probability and It's like the more the more you're showing signals to the long term the more likely you are to be trusted And this is why you would give stuff for free because you're taking a heat in the short term to be trusted in the long term So sharing your point of view is not just a fucking a A trend or something that linked in expert talk about and then they'll stop talking about in two years. It's genuinely something that is I believe this is the difference between People who stand out when they talk and when they share stuff and people who don't the people who don't tend to have a weak point of view or none and they tend to like share things that people agree with already they tend to not challenge the studies going any way she performed and Therefore they come across as why the fuck are you here, right? Like it's like why are you here, right? And so this is this is what you know if I had to select the one specific thing right now to be practical is this try Really voice that point of view so that it's there to protect your segment and show the long-term signal that you can be trusted I Think you just actually described the Or is it you know when people say ah give the advice of share value I think you just broke it down exactly Yeah, fucking head that is a share value and be different and be yourself and be authentic So yeah, so the like the what is very important about a point of view I'm actually share my screen and if you don't mind because there's a bit more details on this one I'm realizing that this specific ingredients of You know the way I teach the concept is is probably the most impactful and I probably need to double down a little bit more but I Just wanted to say I think this applies this question applies to everyone here. Oh, absolutely I don't want to take you off on a different tangent What but what would you say if people are scared of? Showing themselves up. Yeah by taking a different Like angle to the masses So you're terrified of being the front-faced of the business you probably wonder what will others think of me will they approve? What if I say something stupid? So it's about switching that to say you need to be scared of being invisible not visible right because Without visibility without being seen you don't get businesses right you don't get you don't get customers So it's it's normal to be afraid But do things afraid, you know It's like I think to know that the butterfly in your stomach and this fear of like what if that happens whatever that's normal I still get it everyone gets it right so do it but scared And the second point is you know, you probably think I don't want to make enemies like that sounds like very aggressive I don't want to be aggressive like you that's not what I'm saying So a point of view is there to protect your segment It's a very generous and empathetic way to say I'm here for you the most specific your segment The easy idea is to have a strong point of view right and so and if you don't want to make enemies That's not the point I I could count on one Hand the number of times I got hit made or anything like that right because at the end of the day Everyone hates marketers standing the fuck out all of those ideas are there to help people like us, right? They're not there to shit on other people. So If you really speak to your segment and have a valid point of view you have nothing to worry about so the key is to fear indifference not obscurity and It's just to to be consistent like Ed mentioned my daily email I you know, it took me seven years to get to the point of being able to do that right so it's about Doing things seeing what sticks do it all over again And then you start to develop this sense of like what is spicy what is not like when I say that is it something that lands or it doesn't Beautiful, thank you. I'll shut up now
