So much of the impact that PPC marketers create today happens outside of the Google ads account. You can't just ignore the ad account. There's a huge amount of confusion in the marketplace. Hi everyone, it's Ed. I've got a stupid smile on my face because I've tried to do this about 20 times. Today I'm introducing Ashwin. Not gonna say his surname, it's hard to say them mine, mine's really simple. Anyway, Ashwin's been working with me on God Tier Out for a couple of years now, but in the background, in quiet. And today we are revealing him, not in that way, just on the camera, to bring him into the team. So if you've been in the industry for more than five minutes, you will have seen Ashwin posting on LinkedIn, on Twitter, and contributing to many websites and podcasts and so on, even in that hat. Which is on backwards by the way, so he gets a little negative point for that. Ashwin's gonna be full-time with God Tier Ads, I'm proud to say, because he's very clever. And I've pilfered him from Optimizer, sorry Fred. Ashwin, what have you been doing for the past few years and why are you here today? Thanks Ed. Yeah, so I'm joining God Tier Ads as a fractional marketer. I've been working with you for, damn it's gonna be two years next month. Glad you remembered. Yeah. But yeah, we've been working together for two years and it just feels like the next step of an existing good relationship. And last year when we spoke towards the end of the year, we both realized there's a big opportunity to grow God Tier Ads. And I think the beautiful thing is that we're both aligned in terms of why we want that to happen. For the past five years, I've been working on a PPC SaaS tool. And I've seen firsthand how so much of the impact that PPC marketers create today happens outside of the Google Ads account. And I know that God Tier offers people a way to create some kind of order and logic and a systematic approach to how they manage their ad accounts. Because you can't just ignore that just because you're doing landing pages and research and all this other important critical stuff. You can't just ignore the ad account. But we want to go out and we want to help Google Ads marketers who forgive me for generalizing tend to skew more analytical than creative. We want to help them build a skill set that's going to help them over the next three, five years or even in the shorter term over the next 12 months to get better results. Because over the last five years speaking to PPC marketers, there's two categories. There's the smaller portion of people who are able to think strategically. They're able to think multifunctionally. The people who don't know how to package the strategic side and the landing page side and build on those skills. I think they're the ones who benefit the most from what we're going to do over the next 12 months. Because they have the skills that they just kind of need that little nudge on how to move in that direction. The more Google automates their platform, the less you can trust them. So I think it's really important they have somebody in their corner who's going to give them the kind of advice that they can actually take out, apply and turn into good results. So I'm really happy to bring my talents over to the dot-tier side. Ashwin, you call yourself fractional. I call you master of ceremonies. That'll do. If you're watching this and you've read one of my LinkedIn updates, there's a good chance that Ashwin's probably ridden it. So he's got me down to an art, but his job's more critical than that now. Like I say, optimizes loss, our win. So we're working behind the scenes. Essentially this video is a bit of a state of the nation for god-tier ads. So if you're a customer, this is just to tell you where we're headed, what Ashwin and I are working on and why. And if you're new and you've just stumbled across this video, god-tier ads is a Google ads training product essentially. But it's not a course. It's a framework. There's a difference. But anyway, it's super important because we're on this inflection point of fundamentals versus AI, platform versus human, automations versus manual work. And there's a huge amount of confusion in the marketplace. Professionals and business owners and agency owners, a huge amount of confusion. I don't understand why because we're all confused about AI. So we'll talk about it and touch on it in a little bit. But I'm still, I don't want to sound like a dinosaur, but I'm one of these marketers that is still very much of the mind that if you get the fundamentals right, you will still outperform most people. If you're really good at the fundamentals, you really understand your client or the business you work for. Yes, you can use AI and automations to get shortcuts and to get to the outcome a bit quicker, but they don't do the other bits for you. So that a lot of that is inside god-tier ads. And so hallmark, I believe, we've got to add to this framework is the foundation to most things you will do inside of Google Ads account. And we're branching out and stuff. So I may be biased at this point, but I highly recommend if you haven't already bought God-tier ads, grab it today or put it on your list because there's going to be a bunch of stuff in addition to the value that's already there, a bunch of stuff that's coming up that will only be available to people who have access to God-tier. Another important thing that actually has to get a whip made to shape with is updates. We can have a proper cadence of updates, a proper schedule, regular bi-monthly, quarterly, annual updates because God-tier ads is free updates for life. And I'm going to stand by that. And I think that's such a unique position for us. And I think that value people appreciate. And I really want to follow through with it. This year you can expect, like I said, regular product updates. So we want to bring some order and some predictability to when you can expect updates in God-tier. So we'll share a little bit more with all the customers once we lock that in. But you'll have different periods of updates for things like the framework checklist and the landing page checklist and all this other stuff. So I look forward to that. Definitely look forward to a lot more Google Ads focused content on YouTube, not just educational content, but just, you know, state of the industry interviews with people, just stuff where we want to bring as many smart people together to teach you the things that come best from experience, you know. And everybody's got a different area that they're particularly talented at. So we want to find those people, bring them onto the channel. And make sure that that knowledge gets transferred over to everybody who's watching. So make sure you subscribe and stay tuned for all the other stuff that's coming up. And look for more announcements from us soon.
