Welcome to God Tier Ads Performance Max. You might not like the name, you might not like my face, but stick around because I'm going to give you everything. I'm going to walk you through how to set up conversion tracking correctly so you feed the machine good data. I'm going to walk you through all the campaign and asset group structures for lead gen and e-commerce that are working and will continue to work. I'm going to walk you through the level one optimizations so you can produce reliable consistent results. Then I'm going to show you the level two advanced optimization so you can scale on those good results to grow revenue and conversion volume. Let's jump in. It's going to be a long one. Okay, very quickly. Why should you trust me? Because you might not be familiar with who I am. My name is Ed Leake and I've run an agency, digital agency for over 12 years now, managed over 250 million ad spend, keeps going up. Got God Tier Ads pretty highly rated training product invested in ad tech yada yada yada and with good lighting and actual reality. Also, you may have seen me on some of these notable websites. That's it. So get the basics right. What are we going to do? We're firstly going to ask ourselves this question. So are your search campaigns performing? If they're not, then I recommend you stop here and you fix that first before even attempting performance max. If you can't get the fundamentals right, performance max is probably not going to work for you. What about B2B? Well, again, performance max is not some kind of magic bullet. In fact, it's more like a 50 barrel shotgun that you aim blindfolded with one arm tied behind your back. So if you're into B2B and your search volumes are pretty low, Pmax is just going to blow through your budget. Be mindful of that. I would suggest that B2B is not ideal. Good, bad and ugly, not a lot of bad, mainly ugly. So what's the good stuff with Pmax before we kick it in the nether regions? Well, it can perform well, especially in an existing account. You've got data, you've got conversions. It's simplified. There's not a lot to do, particularly for lead gen allows you to cover a wider inventory so you get yourself on display, Gmail, discovery and so on. The bad bits are the reporting is pretty awful. There's no reporting on that inventory. So the split between the networks, I mean, I want to know how much is being spent on YouTube, but you can't do that. It gobbles up brand search, which is annoying, but Smart Shopping did that as well. In terms of leads, so not e-commerce, there's an issue with the quality of the leads. I'm going to cover that in a bit. It can overspend like a bastard because displays a big network, for example, and you can have spikes because this is a machine and sometimes it can chase a rabbit down the hole. There is a learning phase, Google calls it the ramping phase. So there's a lot of chop initially, particularly on a newer campaign or younger accounts. And essentially, if you've got a low amount of data, it doesn't perform very well. It's quite simple. So if you've got five conversions a month, Pmax probably won't work for you. Smart Shopping is dead. So very quickly, you can pause here if you want to review this, but that's the difference. Pretty much you get more coverage with Pmax. What do you need? Well, Google recommends it doesn't make it a prerequisite that you need conversion tracking. I would suggest that if you don't have conversion tracking, you don't go anywhere near Pmax. So obviously for shopping accounts, you need a merchant feed, bare minimum, a few text ads, a few images, and Google will create you an awful video. We'll talk about that later. Oh, yeah, technically for e-commerce, you actually don't need anything more than the feed and conversion tracking. But again, we'll touch on naked e-commerce in a bit. So how does Pmax impact other campaigns? Well, it's really simple. For search campaigns, exact match still rules, still rules the roost, and that will de facto take over the search. Broadened phrase a little bit different. It's based on ad rank. So if Pmax can outrank your broadened phrase matches, it will appear. Standard shopping, well, Pmax will eat standard shopping, sadly. YouTube in stream. So again, it's ad rank display Pmax by default. And then discovery, it's based on ad rank. So it's mixed bag. But generally speaking, half the time performance max is given priority. But good to see keywords are still holding their own. So no, they're not dead. Right, another thing to note, because some people don't realize this, but if you're in e-commerce, then there is a static versus dynamic product ads. So essentially, this is Google tailoring the adverts dynamic remarketing ads to people who visit your website. So what they can do with the assets that you provide as well is either show like a category level image or advert, or they'll show the specific products that people browse. So it depends on cookies, tracking and the buyer's behavior. So it's just something that you may have seen out in the wild and thought, how come I'm not getting dynamic product ads, I'm getting a static ad or whatever. It's because it's based on behavior and tracking. So performance max is a prediction engine, pretty much like smart bidding is, you have to feed feed it good information. So it's only as good as the inputs that it's given. So we're going to touch on conversion tracking in a minute, but essentially give it good data. So accurate conversion tracking, first party and third party data, give it some money, lots of money. Then the complex bit in the middle happens, which isn't the ads and you profit. If only it were that simple. So talk about conversions. What is good data? So we have macro conversions, micro conversions, macro being the end goal. So traditionally, we would run a macro conversion as the front end goal that we see in Google. So a phone call or a form submission, for example, technically, that's not the macro. It might have been historically from an ad perspective, but the macro, the true macro is the sale off the back of that lead that came through the form phone call, but easier for e-commerce. It's the transaction itself. So to improve conversions with lead gen lead quality measurement, i.e. your data, your clients data, first party data is crucial. Again, we'll talk more on that shortly. Adding a value is optional. Remembering that values will impact the bidding behavior, particularly for performance max. Do add where you can enhance conversions. We'll touch on that in a bit. E-commerce, your macro versus micro. So your macro are again transactions, micro are things like basket ads. And even an individual page view or product view or category view would be considered a micro conversion or a micro step. So enhancing that data would be considerations around lifetime value, which you can now use in the bidding systems and big part. And you could use it in smart shopping actually previously, but also things like new versus return customer. So that's top level stuff. But when is a conversion not a conversion? Well, I just touched on it. So when it's a lead and now it's not a crap joke, the traditional sense of a conversion, you know, if we talk about cost conversion or CPA, in the traditional sense, we were talking about a phone call or a form being submitted on a website or a quote. But this assumes that all forms and calls are the same value to the business, which we know isn't true. But let's, let's jump through a more specific example of qualifying leads and how we can have layers to it. So this is a finance industry example. So we have the traditional conversion, which is a completed quote. So someone signs up for something. The actual conversion is that quotation being taken into the system and being essentially turned into an application. So the junk gets filtered out. And then the final macro conversion, the actual sale is the policy gets approved and the customer, who is now a customer, makes a payment. So there's actually three steps there. So there's three conversion steps and you can feed this data back into Google. So why is this important? Well, here's exhibit A. So this is a performance max campaign spending 16,000 euros a month. And as you can see on the screen, it's segmented by conversion action. So we've got the application, we've got the policy, and we've got all the different quotes and calls in between. So remember, the thing at the top, the app is the middle step, all the stuff in between is the first step and the bottom bit on the screen, the policy is the final step. So there's lots of leads in the middle. One thing that performance max is doing, and this is where lead quality becomes a concern, is it's driving a lot of phone calls. In fact, it's driving double the average for this account compared to search campaigns. But the client wants quotes because they convert better. So around 75% of those quotes should turn into applications. But with performance max, if you run the numbers on the screen on the all conversion column on the right, it's more like 20% of these leads turning into applications. That means the value of the leads coming from performance max are really low in comparison to other campaigns in the account. So when I mention lead quality, conversion quality, good data, this is what I'm talking about, understanding this hidden layer, the data's in the business, you've got to get it back inside Google Ads. Yeah, performance max leads are cheaper. Yeah, here's an argument sometimes people will give you, it's well, I'm paying less for those leads. So that's a win. Well, no, because more leads equals more calls to the business. It means more emails, it means more administrative work. So that equates to more cost for the business, it might even require them to hire people to cover this additional burden. The only thing that this does is inflate your ad ego and you think you're doing a great job of performance max and all you're doing is slowly draining the business of cash. Yeah, so in fact, in a larger business, the impact of this is worse because the issue is in plain sight and it's very easy to miss this. So how do we improve the conversion data? We have different layers that we can use and levels of complexity here. So the simplest one is validating calls. So they're simply marked as, and this is for lead gen really not e-commerce, but marking the call as junk or qualified. Did they want the thing, even if they didn't buy, did they want the thing or did they not? And then what you do is that's offline data. So your call tracking software, your IVR system, whatever your business or your client has got, you need to have an export of that data might be in a CRM and you need to tally. So good, bad, good, bad, and then you export that or pass that through to Google ads. And so optionally, you can have two conversion actions, one being the qualified lead and you can add a value to that based on expected conversion rate of a lead to a qualified lead, sorry, to a sale, and you could give it a value. But then you could also introduce the other junk lead, but mark it as a secondary conversion and never target it, but use it for analysis, but you don't have to. But essentially your front end data in Google ads will tell you a certain number of conversions, but then you re-import these qualified leads and you'll see the reality of those conversions. And those are the conversions that you would then bid against. So you start off getting traditional conversions in quotation marks. And then once you've got the data, get it back in the account and then move bidding over to that level. So most CRMs, if you're using one, do support exports to Google ads now. If your client doesn't have a CRM, then you can use something like Zapier, you can handball it, excuse the hand job, you know, manually in sheets, so export the customer's data to sheets and manually do it. And it's a pain in the backside, but my experience tells me that clients aren't very good at doing this themselves. You can get someone, you can hire someone to listen to phone calls and literally tally them good or bad on a sheet and then put that back into Google ads. If you're more sophisticated, API. So if you've got in-house business intelligence or data that's accessible and you want to get that back into API, sorry, get that back into Google ads, then the API is probably the best route, to be honest, fully automated. And what do you do once you've got your improved conversion data back inside Google ads? Well, please be careful with it because first of all, you need conversion volume for this setting to be at the account level. So what I mean is the converted leads in our previous example, let's say you get 30 conversions a month and of those only three are converted leads. If you then import that data to Google and you set this as your default goal, you've essentially stripped 30 conversion signals from the bidding system and you've given it three in place of those 30 conversions. So you've drastically reduced the amount of data available to the bidding system and this will obviously hamper it. So do be careful when you use this checkbox and yes, even Google doesn't have the answer. Thank you Google. What you can do instead is use primary and secondary. So again, this is a lead gen example looking at the finance example and we've got the quotes, we've got the applications, we've got the final policy. Notice how the quotes, so that's the first touch, that's the quote form or the phone call that is a primary. So that's the conversion that the bidding engine is optimizing against currently. So you can have this set up and then you've got your secondaries in there. Essentially, you're monitoring the secondaries. So you're counting them but you're not using them for bidding yet. So you gather the data, you wait, you review and you see if you've got enough data to make a decision on how to proceed. Now, you might look at this and say, actually, there is sufficient application data here. It's not the 2000 conversions that we wanted, but it's close to 15, 1600, which is a good chunk of data. And those are essentially qualified leads. A test would be to run the application conversion as a primary against the campaign. So you could run it against the PMAX campaign, for example, as a test. I wouldn't recommend just dumping it across the whole account and hoping for the best, which is what I just said. So yeah, this slide. So Google is going to ask you to update your conversion actions. And again, just don't set it to the account level at this stage. Obviously, your primary goal that you use your primary conversion action, you can set that as the account default. But don't just throw the rest at it because that's a recipe for disaster. And yeah, as I just said, you can test your new qualified lead or qualified conversion at the campaign level. So you could use that on PMAX to try and improve the quality of the leads. And here is a, in this instance, this is a campaign setting. So for PMAX, and this is the goals where you can select, and you may already know this, but you can select the default account goals, or you can select a campaign specific, and then you could run, here's our qualified lead, we could stick that in that PMAX campaign. And we could go, yeah, we'll have campaign specific goal, we'll tick that box, and then we'll add our newly added qualified lead, it's got whatever it was, 1500 conversions in it, yummy. That's improving the quality of the conversion data, going back into the machine. And you can also enhance your data with enhanced conversions. I'm not going to tell you how to do this. It's different for different websites. You might require a developer to be fair, the Google support files are pretty helpful. This essentially enhance conversions, matches name, email, and any other information you can provide it to the data that Google has on that person. So it enhances that lead, just improves the quality of tracking. Is it optional? Yeah, but I would definitely try and get it implemented, especially if you've got more than a few hundred leads a month, it will give you an uplift in accuracy. So it's worth investigating at the least. Okay, now let's talk specifically about e-commerce. So e-commerce conversions, essentially, but this time preparing for profit, because many e-com advertisers use a fixed target ROAS, which is fine, so long as you're feeding back profit margins into your products. So essentially, labeling the feed. Let's take a prime example here. So we've got three categories. We're assuming we've spent 10, so it could be 10 pounds, 10 dollars, euros, whatever, to get one conversion. And we've got the margins here, which we'll touch on in the next slide. So category one, one conversion, the conversion value is 100, spent 10,000% ROI, or 10 times ROAS. Category two, again, 10 spent 50 conversion value, 500%, as you can see. So keeping it simple, category three has a ROAS of 400%, and therefore it's the loser here. And you'd probably reduce the bidding, or you might even pause it off or give it less budget, because your ideal target in this example is 500%. However, when you consider margins, the story completely changes. So note now that our losing category three, all of a sudden, is actually more profitable than the higher ROAS category two. So the ROI, the actual return on the investment, not just the ad spend, but when the margin is considered is higher. So how would you deal with this? Well, as I just said, you would label your product categories or even your products in your feed based on margin, and then you would adjust your target ROAS per category where possible to suit the actual end ROI to suit the margin levels. So this is something people will often miss or skip by. But this is one of the reasons why you would segment a Pmax campaign, because you can't control currently the bidding or set bidding at asset group level. So you'd have to split out by category if you have varying margins and profitability. So it's a good reason to split if this is the case. If this is you, you put pen to paper, you see the same situation happening, good sign you should be splitting. But we'll get into splitting Pmax asset groups and campaigns later in this training. But whilst we're here, let's touch on a couple of best practices just to summarize. So we want accurate conversion data. So no more analytics imports for now, until we see how good GA4 can become. But analytics imports have lost their edge over time. You want the Google tag, you want enhanced conversions, you want your primary and secondary conversions, primary that you're bidding against secondary for essentially monitoring and analysis, you may migrate over to some of those secondaries, moving them to primaries, for example, you may just be testing them on certain campaigns. But for now, let's keep it simple. Yes, it's a black box. So performance max your big levers are the data, which is what we've just covered. So what you're feeding into the system, which is generally speaking, money and conversion data. And then your other big levers are that money, the budget, the bidding, the way you group things. And to a much lesser degree, audiences, I put audiences there and we'll go over why they do have and don't have much of an impact later. On the other thing whilst we're touching on it, don't replace your existing campaigns with performance max if they're working. So with the exception of smart shopping, which has gone away and we now have to use performance max, if you've got search campaigns that are delivering you value, they are gravy, then why would you pause them to replace them with P max? It's not in my opinion, it's not designed to replace search campaigns, particularly in small accounts and with small budgets. And if you can't hit minimum conversion thresholds like 30 a month or whatever, then, yeah, you shouldn't be going all in on P max, you should be trusting your tried and true search campaigns. So let's talk about the juicy bit, the structure, how to structure your P max. Again, some sort of best practices or prerequisites. So for lead gen, if you're getting less than 30 conversions per month, do not start with P max. In fact, if you've got a brand new account, you're quite ballsy if you start with P max, if you're asking me. But that's entirely up to you. I'm recommending you do not do that. If you've got an existing account and you're over the sort of 30 ish conversions per month threshold, then you can use your existing audiences and I put it in quotation marks here, because it's not true remarketing, they are used as signals to give it a kickstart, then you can use your, for example, existing website visitors or converters customers, you know what I'm saying, your existing audience as a signal for your new performance max campaign, e-commerce, similar sort of thing you need around about 50 conversions, to be honest, you probably need more. And if you can't get more than that, you probably shouldn't be splitting your P max campaigns, because the data will be that thin that it will just struggle. I've seen this firsthand that if you don't give it enough conversion data, it really, really does struggle. I don't know who gets less than 50 conversions a month, though. I mean, the instance that I've seen is very, very high ticket products, where conversion volume is not that high. P max was a bit of a pile of cake for it, to be honest with you, standard shopping worked perfectly fine. E-commerce, as ever, nothing has changed, feed optimization is your 80-20, so don't neglect it. It's the thing that can turn a average campaign performance into a much better performing campaign by tweaking and improving the feed. So yeah, long and short of it, in my honest opinion, I do not think that P max is a good fit for small budgets, and it just doesn't like low conversion volumes. Oh yeah, and remarketing with P max is not true remarketing. Your audiences are essentially seeds and Google quickly expands past them. So yeah, you can't do dedicated remarketing with P max. So top level for Lee Jen, a campaign per service category, even if that means you're just going to have one asset group. So for example, let's say you're a plumber and you do 24 seven plumbing, emergency plumbing, and then you also do boiler installation, you probably want to split those out. The reason being, you get better reporting and it's easier to optimize. So you can only control currently bidding at the campaign level, obviously budget, and you don't get cross-platform reporting at the asset group level, but you obviously do the campaign. So there are pros and cons. There's also going to be no cross pollination. If you want to keep it simple, you start with one campaign split out by asset group, see if one spends and the other doesn't, and then split into two campaigns, like keep it straightforward if you really want to. And again, abiding by the minimum conversions logic that we spoke about in the previous slides. And obviously, don't do it if you don't get conversions for each category should make sense. So here's an example of a layout with URL expansion turned off. So it doesn't drag in all the pages that you don't want it to. So campaign structure looks something like this very straightforward service, and then a another service or an unrelated service or a campaign for something with a different goal. And then you might have a dedicated remarketing campaign, which is not performance max. That's traditional in quotation marks campaign might be search, YouTube, DSA, display, whatever. Yeah, your options are pretty limited with Pmax in terms of structure. You set your bidding, it's most likely going to be target CPA and we'll go into bidding in more detail later. And then it's either a service or two or three, or if you've got 30, you split depending on the goals and how you want to budget things. So yeah, is that it? Well, for Legion, it can be stupidly simple. You might have a specific specific need for a different campaigns such as different types of conversions that you want to go after. And of course, you can go after new customers again, you need volume. So you need to be a bit like my finance example earlier where there was 2000 conversions in that month for that one Pmax campaign that could certainly be split out into more of a new customer versus existing customer setup. Yeah, your prospecting essentially would be a different audience. You'd have different different assets and budget for it. So this is essentially top of funnel, a use case for it, then you can drive traffic. So build up your audiences and then you can essentially use those audiences in another campaign that's more bottom of funnel, actually trying to drive the end lead, the end conversion, or you can use it to layer the audience that you've created over another asset groups audiences, and we'll go into layering audiences later. So these are a bit more nuanced. Most people watching this in the agenda probably won't need to go to this level of detail. So you've got an easy life. Okay, e-commerce, bit more complicated. Sorry, e-commerce people, but also more fun because more things we can do from a very top level perspective, you can have a campaign per top level product category, you then split your asset groups per sub category of that product, and that product might be Pambags. And then optionally, you can have a campaign for new customers. So new customer acquisition, or it comes down to your lifetime value, and your return customer rate. If they're sufficiently good, then new customer campaigns are usually a good idea, particularly around promotional periods or peak seasons like Christmas and Black Friday, going after new customers can be a good idea because they pay you dividends into the new year. And then you can have a dedicated remarketing campaign. This is very top level, but there's an overview. And again, dedicated remarketing would not be performance max. Don't skip the feed optimization. Here's my crappy emoji ranking system. So if you didn't know, feed optimization, the critical things are product title and pricing. The category does have an impact. And if you don't add categories to products, Google will auto categorize it does an okay job, but I wouldn't rely on it entirely. So yeah, product titles, keyword centric, not brand centric, unless you are selling specific brands, I see people make this mistake. Quite often they stick their own brand at the start of a product title. I don't know why, somewhere in the product title, and all of a sudden wonder why they're getting so much brand traffic to their products pricing. Well, it's a pricing engine, essentially, it's a comparison shopping engine. And most people do or are price sensitive. So pricing will directly impact auctions and therefore your impression share. So from a customer's perspective, it will attract more clicks, essentially, or a potential customer's perspective, shall I say, so pricing is your lever in a competitive market to essentially gain more market share or reduce your market share. If that's what you need to do, whatever reason, that's why margins start becoming a bit more important if you do have different product margins. So the single category strategy, you might need to split your campaigns by region or state for a large country like the United States. So you might have international setup going on. And therefore, obviously, you really want a location per campaign, you might even have accounts per location, geographically, or internationally. It's an entirely different thing. But start simple, particularly if you are a low conversion volume, low ad spend, or you've got a small product range, or of course, if you're a single category store, if all you sell is a lampshade, then you don't need to overthink this, you can get away one simple campaign. And I put here a dedicated remarketing campaign that can be dynamic remarketing. Unfortunately, Pmax does take precedence over dynamic remarketing over dynamic remarketing, but that doesn't mean that it won't work. So it's always a good idea to have, I'd say, in the region 10, 20% for remarketing, again, comes down to your, your customer base, buying behavior and attribution and time lag and so on. So those are rule of thumb numbers. Remarketing bidding, so that depends on the platform you're running and the budget. So max conversions can work, but then target ROAS and even target CPA can work. It depends what you're doing with your remarketing. So you could start with max conversions, set a low budget, and see how it performs quite frankly. It's a simple test to do. So then you've got a split example. So here's an example with best sellers or high sales volume products. One thing I would recommend if you're going to do this is to look at your all channel data or your backend data for your best sellers and so on, because Google ads can skew this data. A lot of people will click an advert but buy something else. So it can, it can skew. So I would often use all channel data in analytics, for example, to see what the best sellers are. And then this would probably suit a max conversion value bidding strategy where you use the budget to control the bidding essentially. So you set it at a level you're comfortable with and then see how much value it can drive. Whereas your next category or next 20 categories, how many you may have in each of your campaigns would probably be target ROAS and a unlimited budget. And you might be thinking, what do you mean unlimited budget? Well, it's not literal. Well, it sort of is. You control your budget with target ROAS or target CPA. So for e-commerce, we're typically using target ROAS. So that controls the budget. But you control your max conversions with budget not bid. So an unlimited budget is essentially safer on target ROAS because you're then saying to Google, if you can spend the money and hit my target ROAS, well, spend the money, it then comes down to stock availability. So it's common sense. If you've got the stock and you need to make the sales, you shouldn't be limiting your budget. You should be giving it some headroom. So here's price and prospecting. So this is for buying habits for bigger, more expensive products. Or you've got mixed products. So example being, let's say you sell barbecues, but you also sell garden cabins. These items have a 20 to 100 times price difference. They shouldn't be living in the same campaign, probably, because of bidding, because of budget. And also remember, because of bidding signals, they'll be different because different types of people will be buying a cabin versus a barbecue. Now, I'm not saying that someone who buys a cabin wouldn't also buy barbecue, but the other way around, that's a bit less likely. You don't stumble onto a website looking for a webber to chuck your sausages on and then walk out with a 10 grand log cabin. So in this example, we've got varying profit margins, price points, and essentially, we're controlling the high margin product with a low target ROAS. We've got our other categories with a mid to high target ROAS. And then we've got a prospecting campaign because we've got some big value, high priced items that need a bit of nurture. So we've got a new customer, low target ROAS campaign running there to drive volume into this account. And then when I put expand in these examples, of course, that's just to say, this is not set in stone, you can expand out, you could add two more categories, i.e. two more campaigns, or you could add 200. God help you if you do, but the option is there. And we have the on sale. So something that people forget to do is split discounted versus not discounted products. And you have a typically a higher ROAS target for the items on sale with a lower target for the items that are on sale. And again, this one includes a new customer campaign as well. And you can be really fancy, you could split your new customer campaigns into discounted versus not discounted as well. So you've got an additional layer of budget control and bidding control for new customers. And you might be looking at this going, hold on a minute, you put a higher target ROAS on the discounted products. Or yeah, because discounted products will typically increase your conversion rates and often significantly. And therefore, you can go for a higher ROAS, you might not have to, you might find that a level ROAS with your non sale products is fine. But this is why I've asterisked it because it's a stock level player as well. So if you've got a very high stock of an item, then you could go the opposite route. So you could go for a lower ROAS to ship to sell those discounted products, especially if it's an end of line item. So you might be trying to get rid of those products. That's why they're on sale. So you would be inverse, you'd go for a low target ROAS and just get the stuff bloody sold. So yeah, items on sale, it's a balancing act you might want to test. If you've got limited stock, you might want to actually try and go for higher ROAS. So you don't lose out as much on the discount of the item. So it's a balance, but it's I want to mention it because it's something that again, I don't see everyone doing. Loliva just dump the discount products in the same feed and therefore campaign as the ordinary products and also not touch the budget and bidding or they might just give it more budget, which is completely suboptimal. This is the better way to go. So is standard shopping dead? Well, no. If you've got a really complex inventory, then it can still work. Okay. If you've got more budget to play with, then you can play with it. So you can split your feeds and your big inventory and your big budgets between Pmax and standard shopping. And you can play and test. You could do essentially a branded campaign as well. So a blended strategy where your standard shopping is brand focused. You could do like a bottom feeder where you do a low bid, manual bid, catch all campaign. And also if priorities are really important to you, then you can't use Pmax because it's not an option. For most people, standard shopping isn't really the option because if you're not actively managing, optimizing and improving and really honing your standard shopping, then don't try and beat performance max. I mean, I shouldn't have to say this, but if you're not going to put the work in, then just roll over, let Pmax do its thing. So be honest with yourself and yeah, let Pmax do its thing. Can we still do naked shopping? What the hell is naked shopping? No, it's not my weekend, Jorns. It is a no asset, no image, no text, no video, no nothing. Essentially, smart shopping converted to performance max campaign. And yes, it still works. And yes, they still perform. So you create a Pmax campaign. You don't add text, ads, you don't add images, you don't add anything. You just create it naked essentially and it will run a bit like a smart shopping campaign would run. If you find that you can't do that because Google won't let you, then you can just pause those assets after you've added them or removed them or do it in Google Ads editor. But yes, it's still available. It's even in, obviously Google doesn't call it naked, but it's in the official Google support docs. They do acknowledge that the sort of stripped back setup is a thing, but Google does not recommend doing it. And generally when Google doesn't recommend something, they will squish it eventually. So can you run a sort of smart shopping campaign in performance max by not adding assets? Yes, you can. Does it work? Yes, it does. Audience signals. Right, let's keep this really simple. When you're starting out, you want a specific customer custom segment. So take your top 15, 20, 30, maybe 40, don't go above 50, but your top 20 to 30 keywords from your search campaigns, squish those into a custom segment. Essentially that's an in market audience. And you apply that as your audience signal. And you can also blend over the top of it. Another segment of competitor URLs, for example, or category terms, but I would stick to start with with the specific search terms that have been working for you. So if you've got a newer account and you don't have that search term data, again, I'd question, should you be doing PMAX at this stage? But if you really want to, then you just have to do the search term research, sorry, keyword research, stick those into custom segment, competitor names, competitor URLs, or service product type key keywords, and keep it relatively simple. So that would be one or two audiences. And it's enough. Is it really? Yes, because I've seen it work. I'm not telling you hearsay or best practices that were pulled from my backside. This is actual based on real stuff, real spend. So can you run with no audiences? Well, I wouldn't recommend it, but yeah, you can. So technically, you don't need an audience. The audiences use as signals, so they steer, they essentially say to Google, can you try going this direction first? But Google quickly moves beyond those. And you will see this in the essentially the reporting tab, the insights area of your asset groups, the count inside the campaign, show you the different audiences that are triggering, and you will see quite quickly that those are not audiences that you necessarily added. But this is keeping it super simple. So one or two audiences, that's enough when you get started. Really simple, done. And obviously, that applies to both lead gen and ecommerce. So again, just touching on splitting, why you might split your campaigns. The obvious one is budgets, bidding, locations, and then, and I'm going to go into more detail with some more ideas for ecommerce, but things like on sale, not on sale, seasonality, remarketing, and experimentation, of course, we've talked about the naked or stripped performance max campaigns, where you could also try pulling out, say, a category of products and running another campaign that isn't stripped that you focus on. Let's have a look at some ideas for why you might split and what you can split for. Well, here you go, take your pick. There are many reasons. And these are mainly for ecommerce. So if you're lead gen, you can skip the next couple of slides. But there are all your essentially zero metric situations. So you've got a category of products that isn't getting impressions. Well, that would be a good reason to split out and see if you can get some impressions driven into that product category. Same with clicks and conversions. You might have bundles that you want to sell separately, not being mixed into the budget and the bidding of your regular singular products. You got things like product launches, price points and seasonality and margins and sales volumes and yada, yada, yada. There's lots, lots of things that you can do. You've got multi buyer, you've got low stock, you've got over stocked. A couple of key points. So product launch and co branding, this is where you work with another company. So one of our clients, for example, they worked recently with the McLaren racing team to do a co branding product. And it was a product launch. So to increase visibility, the ROAS was set really low, pretty much at break even. And this is to drive up that, the impressions for that new product, to give that new product a bit of a chance and a bit of a kick in the backside to do good work. And also, if you're doing co branding, if you want to look good in the eyes of your partner who's doing the co branding review, the co business, then this is a technique you can use, split them out, low ROAS, give it a bit of budget and away you go. Of course, you could do maximize conversions as well, give it a push. And then you've got, as I've mentioned before, sales are for segmenting. So you split your on sale versus not on sale. So you're discounted. And the other forgotten split. So seasonality, it's always a good reason to split. If you're selling garden furniture and you've got a line of Christmas products, don't just dump them in the main campaign. You should definitely have a campaign for your Christmas stuff. Like those jumpers have a different budget and bidding and signals set up. So yeah, what's the best way to throw the bidding engine into a fit? Well, it's just to dump a one off seasonal item into your main campaign. So don't do that. So yeah, I hope that gives you plenty of ideas to mull over. So the best performance max structure is, well, it doesn't exist. But you probably saw that coming. Keep it simple to start, especially if you don't have a lot of data split by campaign. If you need budget and bidding control, and then asset groups, again, just think add groups, think add relevance. Just think these images, these text ads that I'm putting together, or this text information for Google to put the ads together on your behalf, do they make sense for every single thing in this asset group? If that's not a yes, then split the asset group. Like super simple. It's all about relevance. Does the ad fit? Is that the best ad to serve for everything in that asset group? Less audiences is more. Two is fine. It typically beats adding more until Google figures it out and ignores what you tell it to do anyway. And layering audiences really does work if you've got the data. And again, going to touch on that later. So in short, more audiences equals wider targeting. Let's maximize our budget and bidding. For lead gen, you need to avoid taking budget from existing campaigns that are performing well. Again, this should be common sense, but I've seen people do it. Annoyingly, sadly, literally close off or pause a search campaign that we're driving conversions in lieu of a P-Max campaign. So instead, take some budget away from the underperforming areas of the account and stick it in performance max, but then keep an eye on existing campaign performance and spend to see if performance max is essentially cannibalizing it. You can get around this a little bit with some keyword optimization, which I'll show you later in the optimization section. But remember, P-Max is not the end game. It's an option, particularly for lead gen. I'd say for e-commerce, it's pretty much not an option. But for lead gen guys, you don't have to use performance max. Now in terms of bidding, so this assumes you've got conversion data. Otherwise, we shouldn't be having this conversation anyway. Target CPA is pretty much the way you want to go. There's no wrong right answer to be fair, but do test. But if you want stability in spend, then target CPA. If using max conversions, start with a smaller budget than you might normally and just notch it up every week or when the conversion volumes come in. So you're controlling your CPA with the budget and you're just nudging it along gently as it goes. But again, this assumes you've got data. If you don't have data, well, it's a crapshoot. Ecommerce budget, we've touched on this in one of the structure examples. It's the sort of 8020 or 9010. So give a little bit of budget to some dedicated remarketing just to see if it will work for you. It may get eaten up by performance max, but you know, see how you go. If you're running any standard shopping campaigns, assume as soon as you put Pmax in place that it will steal from your standard shopping. So if you're in a situation where you're thinking about migrating, then assume the worst. So I would recommend, particularly if you've got a large account that you take a category that's lower risk, perhaps, and try that on performance max, don't give performance max the crap. Don't expect it to perform if you dump literally your non-converting categories on it and then wonder why it's wasting money, you know, give it a chance, be fair to it. Are the other interesting thing and the reason why I like running a dynamic remarketing or some form of remarketing with performance max is because if it does kill it off, you at least know by how much. So it gives you a sense or an idea of what performance max could be doing in terms of remarketing because it's very hidden and you can't actually specifically report on it. So there is another benefit there. Now, if you are in the eCommerce space, you've got a new account, then you probably want to start with max conversion value and switch to target ROAS a few weeks later, probably a month later. And once you have conversion volume and values coming in, again, common sense, if you sat there for a month and your spend's gone haywire, you're under where your ROAS needs to be, well, you either reduce your budget or you stick a target ROAS in. So you control your ROAS by adding or removing budget. So if your ROAS is positive, you increase your budget gradually. Now, gradually is for me, it's an arbitrary 10, 20%. It's just a safe number. Can you increase your budget by 50% or more? Yes, you can. But it's far more nuanced and you would need to do some calculations and predictions. So if you want to understand the auction, the Google ads auction in more detail, then watch my video, Why You Can't Scale. I'll stick a link somewhere on the screen now if I remember. So do take a look at that. So when migrating from standard shopping in a existing account, use target ROAS and set it a bit higher than current performance. The reason you can do this is because your standard shopping is existing, therefore it has data, and you can go straight to target ROAS. The other reason for increasing your ROAS target is the assumption is that performance max will slightly outperform initially because it's using remarketing and generate a higher ROAS for roughly the same cost. So it gives you a little bit of a bump. It might be a 5% or 10% bump. I don't assume it's going to be a magical bump, but it will also go after branded terms annoyingly. So yeah, make it work a bit harder for you if you migrate from standard to PMAX. New customer acquisition. So as with smart shopping, you can now run new customer acquisition bidding strategies with performance max, which now enables lead gen also to use this bidding strategy. So you can use this feature to instruct PMAX to go after new, in quotation marks, customers only. So the tracking isn't perfect. What Google sees as a new customer might not actually be a new, i.e. their cookies expired or deleted or whatever, it's a tracking issue because tracking is not 100%. So don't expect 100% new customers. It's sometimes miles off. That's not even half, but the bidding strategy is heavily biased towards new customers, new users for your website. So for e-commerce accounts, it makes sense to go after new customers because typically your lifetime values are higher, particularly if you have a good return rate, as in return customer, not returning the product. For many lead gen accounts, it's less important, but mid to large size lead gen, it's certainly worth testing. Smaller lead gen, probably not. If you're selling or sorry, if you're servicing, if you're local plumber servicing the area, probably not that important. You probably don't want to be using PMAX anyway. The campaign has to be separate because it's a new bidding strategy and expect the ROAS to be lower for e-commerce and CPAs to be typically a bit higher for lead gen. So what about the first option? Because in my image, I selected the second. Well, it inflates your ROAS essentially. So I'll show you on the next screen, but it also has a requirement. So you've got to upload a list of at least 1000 active members on that list for any given network. So the first option is essentially a bid higher with an inflated value. So you have to add additional value. That means you see that additional value in your reporting. So if you had a conversion that was worth £100, whatever you add here will be added to your conversion value metrics. So it does inflate them. And obviously that makes the conversion value in the ROAS read high. So do be mindful of that. That's why it's worth testing both the adjusted recommended and also just the pure new customer bidding. And then we get some pretty basic reporting quite frankly. So under your conversion segments, there's a new versus returning. And you can have a look at how Google is tracking these new versus returning customers. Be prepared to see quite a discrepancy. You might be as low as 20, 30% new customers being tracked. And then a big chunk of them unknown. But it's still worth testing. At least you can monitor the incremental gains. Just be sure to keep updating your customer lists that you upload, keep them fresh as new customers come in. Once every week or two is ideal. It depends on the size of the business, but at least every few weeks. And finally, unspent budget. So a higher daily budget gives Pmax some wiggle room to expand. This is particularly important for e-commerce where you might have a bit of flux and bit of seasonality where you want some headroom to spend more. I would also avoid unless you've got a very good reason for it being budget limited. So just when you review your spend, if it's say 80% of your budget currently, just see that excess budget as some room for Pmax to expand into. I wouldn't go overboard because performance max is on display. And there can be some sharp shock spends in that area if you're not too careful. We'll go into bidding, modification and optimization later. Okay, right. Great. Add copy, which is easier said than done. So here's a little offer for you. I hope you don't mind seeing as that you've made it this far through the video. I'm giving this training away for free. It's $5. It's 23 pillars of ad copy. It's literally all the things you need to do to improve your adverts before and after examples, real world examples. And there's also a template for responsive search ads in there, which is compatible with Google ads editor. So yeah, just a little promo. You know the deal. If you want it, you want it. If you don't, don't worry about it. Set up final checks. So let's look at things like minimum spend. So if you're a, again, lead gen account, I would suggest that you don't touch Pmax unless you're spending much more money than a couple of grand a month, smaller econ budgets, then essentially in similar sort of region or less, I would expect a lot of choppiness with Pmax, but you pretty much got to use it unless you're going to be heavily optimizing your standard shopping and B2B. As I mentioned at the start of the video, I'd probably avoid it. If you're in B2B and you're literally tapped out, you can't spend more, you can't get more conversions and you're just struggling to expand. Then if you've got your conversion stages and qualification in place, then I might consider testing Pmax for B2B. Don't forget location options. Just a silly thing. The Google recommended one is probably not ideal for most people because it pulls in people from all over the bloody place. So just remember that hidden setting URL expansion. So Google recommended you leave this on, but not many people realize that with this on, Google can create entirely dynamic ad content and it might not be ideal. So as a bare minimum, exclude your less important pages essentially or pages that simply don't convert. And also remember it will act a bit like DSA. So it's dynamic content, which is pulled from the pages. So just be mindful of this. If you're absolutely not sure, just turn it off to start with and you can always turn it back on. New campaigns. So when you've actually created a new campaign, avoid big changes, keep your bidding and budget tweaks to a minimum. So if you've got less than 30 conversions per month, start with CPA higher. If you've got less than 50 conversions per month, start with your ROAS target lower. So essentially it's not ideal, but it's giving the bidding engine a bit more room to pull in conversions because you want to get that data in and then you can adjust your CPA down. You can adjust your ROAS back up. So you want to get a few weeks data or at least 30 conversions before raising bids. To be honest, you probably want more than two weeks, but again, cadence of an account varies depending on how much volume of impressions, cost, conversions you get. So but expect the first couple of weeks to be a bit choppy. To be fair, the first month can be choppy. If you're lucky, the first week is choppy and then it levels out quite quickly. Don't want to teach you to suck eggs, but do all the things. So add five headlines, descriptions, your logo, videos, if you've got them, images and tailor extensions. Obviously, if you're running naked shopping, then you don't need to do this. I think anyone can write five decent headlines. It's not, it's not like responsive search ads where people are trying to write 15 headlines that don't really make sense, or they're not that unique, but five is doable, same with descriptions. So pretty standard stuff. If you need inspiration, here's a true freebie, you don't have to pay $5 for this. So this will scrape the search results for you. And there's also free competitor reconnaissance training. So bit.ly forward slash competitor, if you go here, Ad Evolvers, my tool, so this is not a sponsored thing. Unless I'm sponsoring myself. But yeah, go here, you get a free report, you get a free template, and you get free training. And I can't say more than that. It'll help you write better ads by reviewing your competitors offers and positioning and so forth. Take a look. Template creativity. So essentially, if you need some inspiration for your imagery, and so on and video, Google has kindly created the creative studio. It's okay to be fair. You know, if you're really in a rut, you can use some of their templates, they're not awful. The video templates are certainly better than the automated things that Google puts together. So you can give that a whirl. It's completely free. That's it. Audiences write super simple. So use your own data to kickstart things. That's customer lists, known good keywords that are converting. One to two custom segments is more than enough. You can test without that's very optional, though. I mean, that's really for bigger budgets, where you just want to go wide and see what comes in. But for most people, a couple of audiences is more than sufficient. So don't overthink it. Oh, yeah, Google's given us the new content suitability management thing. And this allows you to account wide exclude content keyword. So that's not for search. That's for display on YouTube, sensitive content, park domains, YouTube live streams, and so on. By default, I would exclude live streaming and park domains. They're just wasteful. So that's pretty straightforward. And then finally, the specifications. So images, videos and texts, you can find this on the internet if you want to pause here and review. But again, it's pretty straightforward stuff. Your headlines are 30 characters as they are research, and then up to 90 characters as they can be on responsive display. So yeah, pretty straightforward. So that's it. You've created your campaign. You've set your budgets, you've set your bidding, you've got your assets ready, and then you go live, and you stop. It's not time to optimize yet. You've built your campaigns, you've launched. Now what happens? Well, how long do you wait? This is the patience game. So Google recommends six weeks, which is easy when it's not all their money. But they suggest this to allow the machine to learn six weeks of spend. You can't be serious, man. You cannot be serious. Is six weeks accurate? Well, it can be half that it can be more than that. But let's assume it's six weeks. So assume the worst, be a bit cynical, you need to prep yourself for that six weeks. That means you need to reserve that budget. And you need to understand that situation going forward. So there's no point setting up a Pmax campaign and a week and a half in going, oh, it's not converting. It's spending money, pause it, scrap it, game over. You're just wasting your time. So you need to set aside a budget that you can comfortably live with for at least a month, even if it doesn't perform as well as you hoped. Now obviously, if you're like week two or three in, and it's absolutely going tits up, it's overspending, there's zero conversions, then yet new kit and rethink it. But patience is super important. You can try and tweak and overtook, you know, the more you touch it in the early days, the worse it can perform quite frankly. Also, you can artificially delay gratification here by going over complicated with your setup with two little budget. So if you've only got $50, $100 to spend a day, rein it back in, you probably want a single campaign with an asset group or two, particularly something like e-commerce. If you've got a really small budget, you probably get away with just running a single campaign, single asset group, maybe for a specific category that you know sells, and that will get volume through it. So no point trying to stretch a tiny budget across 50 things. So yeah, I put here you won't accumulate enough data to make an informed decision in six months, let alone six weeks. It's a bit tongue-in-cheek, but sort of serious. For lead generation accounts in particular, I strongly argue against using PMAX on a brand new account. The focus really should be on getting your search campaigns working and converting. Going from zero to PMAX is a recipe for disaster in my opinion. But now I'm still going to get questions, but Ed, how long? Okay, time is subjective. Min, two weeks, max, eight weeks, probably somewhere in the middle. Depends on your budget, volume. You can't predict this, don't try. But I can't just leave you hanging. So here's a process to review your performance max. So you go live in week one, then there's the learning and ramp up phase, sort of two to four weeks in. So you're now at a month, then you need to apply your conversion lag when you review this period. So you essentially ignore week one, and then you want at least three, but possibly four weeks of data, plus that conversion lag. So if you go to attribution, path metrics, and then you look for your average day to conversion, that'll tell you your lag. Some people have a few days of conversion lags and people have weeks. So I don't just review an arbitrary month, including that first week, exclude that first week of chop. And you'll be able to see the chop. If it's not that choppy, well, you might be able to include it. But yeah, I'd probably look at removing the chop. And then let's say your conversion lag is a week, a nice round seven days. So essentially you review week two through to five. And then after that, you optimize. Hopefully that makes sense. And also, if you're comparing Pmax to another campaign, bear in mind this chop and learning period as well. So give it a fair comparison. So you might want to cut out that first week or two, when you're comparing against another campaign. So yeah, so just to reiterate, the testing duration depends on volume, but four to five weeks is typical plus your conversion lag, which often comes out on that sort of six week number, it can be more, it can be less. There are dependencies on that. But hopefully this, this sort of review timeline gives you a bit of gives you a simple process to follow. Okay, so we passed the setup phase, we are past the essentially the review phase, the first five, six weeks. We're now in the optimization phase. And I've split this into three sections. So we've got optimizing Pmax, we've got the level one, more basic optimizations, and then we've got the level two more advanced optimizations. So what can we do? Well, we can't add or exclude keywords yet. And I put yet because I'm hoping that Google is going to allow us to exclude keywords at some point. You never know. We can't set manual bids quite frankly, you don't need them. You wouldn't be able to keep up with the machine here. You can't adjust asset group bids, really annoying. Hopefully they do bring that in. So it will help us because otherwise we have to split by campaign if we want to set different bidding strategies, a little bit annoying, quite exclude audiences, absolutely ridiculous. Come on, Google, we need that. So less or more, Pmax doesn't seem to like being fiddled with so less frequent changes, but they can be bigger. Unless you have loads of data, having loads of data, impressions, spend, conversions, clicks, so on and so forth. That's always the get out of jail free card. If you've got thousands of conversions coming in each week, you can make frequent changes. If you've got 10 conversions coming in each week, you probably shouldn't be touching anything other than maybe a tweak to the budget or a tweak to the bids or some of the more basic optimizations that we're about to walk through. So yeah, it's hands off, steer with your feet. Essentially, is Pmax working? Is it hitting your target? Is it spending your budget? Then do you really need to do anything? So don't feel like you have to do the work. The one thing you should do is improve poor assets. But again, there's a right and a wrong way to do that. So let's go through that in a minute. And a reminder about new campaigns. This was in the setup phase. So I'm not going to go over this again, but it's just there as a reminder. Reporting is not great. So you can't see cost per asset group, which is a joke. And you can't see the network splits, which is also a joke. So there is a workaround. You can use the Google analytics attribution report. And then you can handball this reporting. So you can see the splits in performance max, but it's not ideal. Let's face it. The only thing you can really do with that data is then change your split your campaigns out or make some changes that hopefully bias performance max away from some issue, like it's overspending on display, for example. So the data is there. It's just that Google isn't giving it to us inside Google ads, which I think is a bit of a piss take. So hopefully we do get the network split reporting and the metrics at the asset group level eventually. Okay, so why is this really important? So let's take an example. If I knew video placements were spending really hard, they're spending half my bloody budget, then I'd want to focus on video production, right? But those videos might not be converting that well. And also video production isn't a 10 minute job. It's a hell of a lot easier to create text and image based assets. So I'd want to know that and I can't see that at the minute. Like conversely to that, what happens if performance max is not spending on video? Well, I could be wasting my time and money creating video assets that performance max isn't going to use for my account anyway. So it's really quite frustrating. Right, these level one optimizations focus on what you can see because I've just told you about what you pretty much can't. Budget balancing super important. So a higher budget sends Pmax a signal that it has some wiggle room. So even if it's not spending it today, and I did touch on this in the budgeting and bidding section of the training, but essentially you're giving it headroom. And if your budget limited and below your CPA target or you're above your ROAS target, then you really should consider adding budget because that will unlock some volume for you. Or you could just simply reduce your target CPA so small portion, you know, 10%. So then you don't keep hitting your head on that budget ceiling. And the same goes for target ROAS. You can increase it a notch. So you get more for your money, essentially. Ideally, you just add a bit more budget to it to scale it up a bit. But I understand that that's not always the option. Do we care about ad strength? Yeah, we do. But just remember, good is good enough. And the ad strength is quite arbitrary. You can literally toss any old random stuff in. And so long as you fill out every field, you will get a higher score. It's not that smart really. So knowing that you will understand how that score is manipulated and what it actually means for you. So a higher score does not mean better performance. It just means you've given the machine more assets. More assets is good because it is a machine learning system. So give it more things to use. But if you can't say something worthwhile, or you can't add something that's good, I wouldn't give it some thought and come back. What do you test? Three key things that you can test is a different call to action. So and then a different offer with or without price and, of course, benefits versus features. If you want more in depth, if you want everything, essentially, real world examples, and a template, just grab 23 pillars for $5. I won't tell you to do that again. Performance column. So in performance max, you have a column that shows you asset performance. So don't replace low assets unless you're maxed out. Essentially, if you filled every single asset field, you've got all your headlines, descriptions, images, and so on, then start replacing the low performing assets. Once you've tapped out, since you've maxed out everything you can do, and you can add to your asset group. So just replace the crapper ones, the low performing ones first, obviously. But sometimes low performance is due to not being able to get data into performance max. So what you might want to do is copy, paste, and then test a different audience. Or when you paste or duplicate the asset group, you can try different headlines in particular or images. And audiences will have less of an impact, but sometimes they can be a good kick in the ass for performance max. Search term extraction, probably one of the better things in performance max, actually. So you want to take your converting keywords that have got volume and add those two relevant search ad groups as exact match keywords. So really simple. But don't waste your time on the non converters. Don't waste your time on the low search volume keywords. So if you're seeing things in here that have got one conversion, probably not worth your time extracting those out. And how do we optimize search terms in Pmax? Well, if you're seeing subcategories that are not related for the asset group, and you've got enough search volume, that's a strong signal that you should be splitting out your asset groups. And this is certainly more information than we got with smart shopping, for example. So this data isn't too bad. It's, I actually like that it's categorized because it can highlight an optimization route for you, i.e. splitting out to improve, to reduce the cross pollination of these search categories. Brand defense. So how do we protect our brand? Well, you can build out a branded search campaign, of course, with exact match keywords. And then include your brand versus plus the relevant search term like review, product, type, discount, whatever. So use exact match, you can use phrase, but you must use exact match to essentially trump Pmax in the auction. And it forces Google to use your branded search campaign instead of Pmax. If you I know there's few few people that don't like using branded campaigns, but it gives you visibility of your brand's bend. So you should be gunning for 90% impression share, particularly if you've got competitors bidding on your brand. And in defense of brand campaigns, new customers are less brand reliant anyway. So there is a tendency for Pmax to be able to pick scoop loads up more so. At the end of the day, it's hard to really measure. But if you're really worried about brand, you could use a new customer bidding strategy for performance max to really try and remove it from competing with your brand. See this one floating around a lot. Should you negative your branded terms by contacting your Google rep essentially, you can use account level negatives, if you don't want any brand. But then that means your competitors have free reign of those ads lots, which is a bit precarious. So remember that previous smart shopping campaigns leaned heavily on brand search as well. So that means if you negative brand from your Pmax, it's obviously going to her performance, it's going to reduce performance. And Pmax is data driven attribution. So that will have a knock on effect to by all means test it, but you might have to actually unwind this. That's why I always prefer to use a search campaign to defend the brand search terms, because at least you have visibility then so you can see impressions, you can see spend and so on. And if performance max starts to take away from that branded search, you can you can at least see that happening in the branded search campaign. Images pretty straightforward. So Google recommends you don't have text or logo in images, don't have borders, you don't have collages, you don't use filters, don't use many other things. But that's a recommendation. It doesn't actually mean that you can't and it doesn't mean that your images will get disapproved. Your images need to look good on mobile because Pmax serves a lot of mobile traffic. So kind of an obvious one, decent contrast. You know, if it's more zoomed in than normal, so people can actually see what the hell it is, or all the better, you can use text. We've tested text just a couple of words though, at the very most five, but you know, like three words, it's not a problem, they get approved, and they can work okay. Yeah, pretty straightforward. Now e-commerce specific, it's okay to just exclude poor performing products. It's not the most optimal optimization because really you should fix those products. But sometimes there are certain categories or products that simply don't form, you just might not be competitive on pricing, for example. Then you should give your neglected products a chance elsewhere. So say you've got nought impression, or very low impression products, you might want to split those out and give them a different budget bit in strategy, different audience, and so on. And also then they can have different assets. And doing that as well, you can fully populate asset groups with properly tailored assets. So if you're selling hats and handbags, and you've got them in the same asset group, well how are your images that specific? You'd have to include both on the same image, but if I want to buy a handbag, I don't, but I might buy a hat. I'm really not interested in that handbag. And yeah, remember, consider the on sale campaign because it will perform differently. So you don't want to mix your discounts, your sales with your regular priced products. That will hurt your row hours. It'll also screw the bidding up, quite frankly. Product type report, this is quite useful. So what you can do, again, is going based on your row hours, so your conversion value divided by cost. You can do the easy street, you could you could go down the route of excluding a category in an asset group, you can split out and improve the assets for that underperforming category, you can split out and improve the assets for a good performing category because you might be able to get even more out of it. So the other thing that this report helps you identifies those poor categories, so you can move them to a new campaign, give them a bit of love with some better assets and perhaps a higher row as target. So essentially, if they're way under row as like the two examples on the screen, the two red conversion value costs, and you can give them a higher target row as so essentially try and force the bidding engine to do what it can with them. In doing this as well, you're going to give more budget to your better performance if you pull these categories, these subcategories out of the campaign that's performing. Simple budget tweaks that you do each week. So if you're running maximized conversions, and you're above your target rise or you're below your target CPA, then you just give your budget a 10% nibble. And that means even if you're not budget limited. So again, you're giving it a bit of headroom, bit of thinking room to allow it to expand. And obviously, inversely of that, if you're below your target rise or above your desired cost conversion, then just nibble down your budget 10% very simple. And you do that on a weekly basis without hurting the machine too much. And 10% is an arbitrary number, you can be more specific if you actually calculate that. But for now, it's easy, simple, it typically works. And your basic audience optimizations are to start with custom in market, lead gen accounts, possibly start with remarketing in quotation marks to non converters. So that's not a true remarketing audience, but it will give it a kick start. And then you can scale using the insights tab, we'll look at next. Use your Google Analytics Historic Data, which will advise you on the type of in market and affinity audiences, but do start with in market that might be useful to add. And then you can layer in audiences later, which will go into slightly more advanced, it's entirely optional. But remember audiences are to steer that initial trajectory and Google quickly expands past them. So is there any benefit to adding audiences later necessarily, but it is worth testing? Or if you do a duplication with a new audience is probably the better route. So it's a fresh steer as it were. And your audience insights, this is quite useful. So this is where the expansion is shown essentially. So so you might not have added your beachbound travelers for example, but it's an optimized audience here. So what you can do is take these audiences and try them with new asset groups. So you can create a dedicated asset group that speaks directly to that type of customer that is currently converting. So I think that that's quite a useful insight to have. And of course, you can take these audience insights and run them against things like YouTube campaigns, dedicated campaigns. So when do you split? When should asset groups be split? Well, when they're competing. So in the example on this screen, we've got four asset groups that are triggering the same search categories. So they need to be split out because clearly they're in competition. You also want to split when subcategories are not related, when you're struggling to get impressions is another signal that you might want to split out or you put them in a different campaign, different budget and bidding strategy like maximize conversions, for example, to drive some impressions into those unserving or low serving asset groups. And also when reporting simply isn't good enough for you. So if you need to see an asset level spend and all the click, impression, conversion metrics, the only way to do that is run one asset group in one campaign, sort of like dedicated reporting that respect. I wouldn't do this if you've got low data again, because splitting out performance max into small chunks of data will hurt. If you've got sufficient data, you know, you've got 100 conversions in one asset group, 100 in another, so on and so forth, then you can get away with splitting quite frankly, if your entire account does 100 conversions a month, you might be running the risk of crushing that or restricting that performance because of lack of data. Thanks Google. Another crap report placement reports, they're a disgrace, quite frankly. So you only get impressions, which is, you know, ridiculous. So we can't see a placement spend conversions or anything. You can export this filter, play around with it, look at the domains in it. And then you can add it to the exclusions in content suitability, or better yet, you can use add editor. But it doesn't support placement exclusion lists, which I find a bit ridiculous. So yeah, what you will see is Google owned and operated. And that includes Gmail, Play, Discover, and YouTube reporting. So that one line in your placement report is everything. And you only get impression data against it. So it's atrocious, quite frankly, but at least you can exclude some placements. I guess we've got, but you can't do that inside the report, of course, you have to do that manually. And don't forget, if you're losing your marbles over ad copy and competitor reporting, grab the free training template and report as mentioned earlier. Okay, the more advanced level two optimizations. So when do we replace asset groups? This assumes that you've done all the level one optimizations first before you're going to nuke your asset group. So essentially deleting it, or getting rid of it, or replacing it entirely. So you might have audiences that are showing mixed results. You might want to then duplicate and keep the winning audiences or add them as signals, and so on and so forth. But essentially, you need to do the level one optimizations first before you start nuking things. I spoke about it earlier, layering audiences. So you need more data, not assumptions, but you can layer things like your system segments, your own data in market, demographics, whole shebang, and then you have a layered audience. Again, this is a signal. It does work quite well on bigger accounts. I mean, this is a mortgage example. Obviously, that's quite a big market. So there's a lot of data in this account, and it can work with this. But I wouldn't use this setup if you don't have sufficient data, quite frankly. Seasonal balancing. So not all stores enjoy seasonality or promotion periods. That's why you need to think ahead. So set your budgets to capture additional headroom during these promo periods, like Black Friday, or conversely, push your row as up to fend off budget and stock exhaustion if you're not actually in the mood for Black Friday, for example. So start making adjustments a week before you think you need to. This is another thing as well. A lot of people start making adjustments for Black Friday a week before, when actually they should have been doing it many weeks before. Don't start thinking about Christmas in the first week of December. You should be planning in September, if not August, and raising budgets in October, for example. And do remember the new customer bidding. There's an opportunity here to collect new customers in the heightened shopping seasons, pretty much most of Q4, to be honest. Insights, these are helpful. These can trigger your bid and budget changes. So it gives you a bit of a heads up of where you need to be, and if you should be bumping your budgets. Or updating or splitting assets out into new customer campaigns. Or there's an opportunity in the insights to do that, then go after it. But yeah, the insights are okay. And they might give you an opportunity to catch some expansion. And also, there's a bit of a prediction ahead for you as well, to give you insight into how much you should be allocating. Seasonal bid adjustments. So Google supposedly figures these out in automatically in the bidding engine. But you can help it along. So the example on the screen is a Black Friday blowing the doors off seasonal adjustments. So this is previous two years have been 30 to 50% conversion rate increase. So we are telling the bidding engine to expect that during the 21st and 25th of November, and therefore increase the conversion rate 50%. And what does this actually do to the bidding system? Well, if you double your conversion rate in this adjustment, it essentially halves the row as for the bidding engine. That's the way it looks at it. So it's trying to keep the cadence of conversions the same. So it doesn't underspend or overspend. So it's quite arbitrary in that respect. But you can do these things for freak conditions. I don't want to mention the C word. The obvious ones are sales and promotions, obviously, I just said obviously, stock and availability. This is another one if you have a stock issue or supply issue, and therefore your conversion rates can drop through the floor. This is a way to sort of counteract that. Do use this sparingly and you must use it in very short periods, like a week at the very most two weeks. So essentially, this is a mitigating over or underspend and it helps balance your row as out through a potentially choppy period. If you've seen the template automated videos that Google creates for you, it probably scares the pants off you into wanting to create your own videos. They're that pretty awful. But I'm not going to walk you through how to create a video. These are things to think about. So does it grab attention in the first five seconds? Does it call out the target audience in the next five, 10, 15 seconds? Are you qualifying who they are? You want to put a call to action in, typically in the middle or the end depends if it's a short video. If it's a sub 20, 30 second video, you typically only need a call to action towards the end. So you need to demonstrate the value of the offer if it's legion or if it's an actual offer, you can call that out for shopping, for example, etc. I mean, you can read the screen. I don't need to walk you through these bits and pieces. So what can you test in a video though? Because a lot of people get stuck with what do I actually do? What do I put in the video? So I've just chucked on the screen loads of examples, because Google create templated videos from your existing text and image assets and they're not ideal. So here's loads of things you can test different lengths, different call to actions, video unboxing, talking head, screen recordings, so on. There's loads of things you can do and test. And one thing I would say is try and split your video up into the initial hook, so that initial five seconds, and then the body and then the call to action. So record a few different hooks. So you've got three or four hooks, and then the body of content, so you record three or four versions of that. And then the call to action, you might have two or three different call to actions. And then essentially what you do is you've got all these splits, so you can turn all these sections into a multitude of videos. So you can test all the different hooks, you can test all the different bodies and all the combination of call to actions. So it sounds like a lot of work, but actually it's a lot easier than trying to record 50 unique videos. You instead record unique sections that you stitch together. Also expansion planning, so there are suggested trends in performance max. Essentially, are you missing out? So this is far more advanced because this is not always applicable. Should you be advertising on these strategies? Can you even advertise on these strategies? For example, here we've got pajamas and sleepwear, you might be selling shirts and pajamas are completely inappropriate, but it might give you impetus to expand into a certain area based on what you do now. Google will show you typically related category trends. So this is more of an expansion plan. It's more of a thought experiment for you to do. And finally, don't forget the optimizations that are not inside Google ads that are not performance max. So things like landing page content, which helps a huge amount and that includes product pages. If you've got product pages that are not converting, you need to look at why you need to look at what else is in the market and see what you're not saying or what you are saying. Add keywords to pages, no stuffing, but keywords do work. Don't ignore page speed, produce that proper video if it's appropriate for you. A lot of accounts can get away without video quite frankly. Lead Gen, you want to be looking at form optimization and lead qualification. And then finally, e-commerce, test bundles, if you can, and multiplies and subscriptions, they are often boosters for lifetime value and obviously attract return customers. So there are things you can definitely try if you want some quick wins to increase revenue and customer attention. And with that, we are done. Well, you've made it this far, which is the end. So I just want to say thank you. You're better than 99% of people. So thank you for watching and I would really appreciate if you just hit the like button. It helps the algorithm. Any questions or comments, I also appreciate those. So thank you for watching. Do put this to action and remember, you're the 1% that managed to get all the way to the end.
