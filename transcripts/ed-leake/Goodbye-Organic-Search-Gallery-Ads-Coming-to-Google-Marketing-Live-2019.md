Hello, I'm Ed Leake and this is part 3 of my Google Marketing Live 2019 commentary and feedback. If you haven't seen the first part and the second part, you can go and watch them if you so choose. And that's a really quick intro because I just want to crack home. Thanks Prabhakar and good morning everyone. So I've always thought that video games and computers are cool and that love for computer science is what brought me to Google. One of my favorite... I'm not sure that computer games or computer science, come on. It's a fact that I get... Unless it's Quake 3 Arena. ...to work with great teams to build products that will have a tremendous impact on both consumers and businesses. And that means building products for you to be there for your consumers wherever they are on their journey and especially on mobile. We think that starts by helping you get more of your content to the search results page faster. Now our research shows that 75% of smartphone users expect immediate information when they're searching on their phones. I don't think that's a surprise to anyone here. Again, that statistic is that's defending Google keeping more people on Google and not letting them off Google to go to your property, i.e. your website for example. I'm just going to speed this up a little bit. And based on that insight, we wanted to combine the intent of search with a more interactive and visual ad format. Highlight the value of your brand while reducing the work that it takes for people to get the information that they want. And this is why I'm so excited today to introduce Gallery Ads, which is a new ad format that helps you show your offering with compelling images and text. Didn't Bing do image ads a long time ago. So we've had discovery, now we've got gallery. With Gallery Ads, people can swipe through a visual ad that sits at the top of the search results page. And when they tap on the ad, a scrollable image gallery will open featuring a text headline. So this is essentially a Facebook carousel ad. Can you see what I mean though about keeping people on Google? So it depends on the cost point because at the end of the day this is an advert. So that interaction, these impressions are going to cost you money. It's whether or not they are considerably diluted against the click through to your website. Because I can see these working really well for products. You can scroll through all the product imagery, buying a piece of furniture you can see it from all different angles and so on and all the details before having to click through and potentially waste your time going to a website looking at a product that isn't appropriate. So yeah, I can see these being good depending on the price point. At the top and taglines beneath each image. As people browse your image gallery, the headline will remain visible at the top and further taps will take people directly to your site. This makes it easy for you to connect with people who are still researching your brand while providing them all the information they need with fewer taps. It can also tell you fewer taps. Again, what she's saying is fewer clicks away from Google. Help you tell a more holistic brand story like Devourer, which is a premium frozen food brand who can now show off all of their mouthwatering meals in just a single ad. Now I don't know about you but looking at this ad makes me just a little bit hungry. It's food, I look at food, I'm always hungry. These galleries can feature between four to eight images each with 70 character taglines beneath each image. You can also provide up to three headlines so that you can test different calls to action. Now on average, campaigns that have gallery ads in them can perform up to 25% more interactions. That's more paid clicks or swipes at the absolute top of the mobile search results page. You can look for gallery ads to show up later this year. That has just smashed organic shopping, hasn't it? Let's face it. You saw on the preview, the mobile, she was scrolling up, well the preview was scrolling up and down and it was just the whole screen and then some. Now in addition to richer and more informative content, today's consumers expect a much more consistent experience across both mobile web and mobile apps. However, we all know that this journey isn't as seamless as it should be. So let's say that you're me and you're about to give a huge presentation at Moscone. You want to find a nice outfit. So you go to your mobile phone, you start searching and you see an ad for a dress that you like from a brand that you love and in fact you have that brand's app on your phone. So this is going to be deep linking? So I click on that ad and instead of being taken to the app, I get taken to the mobile website. Now the app is where I have all my information stored like my shipping details and my payment details. Now raise your hand if you had an experience like this. Well, lots of hands. So it's a little bit frustrating when that happens, right? So we want you to be there, especially for your loyal customers, however they want to engage with your brand. And this is why over the next few months, we will be offering deep linking capabilities in Google ads. In addition, we'll also offer robust reporting so that you can track the measurement of your performance across both mobile web and apps. This will make it easier for you to measure and optimize the impact of your campaigns across both of those surfaces. Now to get started, you'll need to use Google ads web tracking and have deep linking enabled. We will support both universal links on iOS as well as app links on Android. Once this is enabled, app users who tap on your search, display or shopping ads will be taken directly to the app. Okay, so I was going to say that this is more this kind of tech is more focused around big brands and big budgets, but actually, you know, because if you'd asked me a year or two ago, if you were a medium size or even a small size business, you know, you might be turning over a million or a few million quid, even five million a retail. And if you'd said, Ed, do I need an app? I probably would have said, well, it depends. However, this could actually this could actually force your hand to having an app because if you've got deep linking from ads, you can force people into the app and she's quite right. If they've already logged in, they've got their billing and shipping in there. So actually might amplify the value of an app for even the smaller players in the market, which is if you're advertising is a good thing. And to make it easier for you to measure the impact of deep linking on your business, we're also offering app conversion reporting in the Google Analytics for Firebase software development kit. Good. With this kit, you can easily define some in app events that are equivalent to web conversions and send those events to Google ads. Good. Early tests have been extremely promising. We're seeing results up to two x the conversion rates for those deep linked ads. And this makes sense, right? Customers who have your app tend to be more loyal. They have those payments and shipping credentials. So I think it'll be more. So this, they've obviously done testing of large brands. I think if you're a specialist or quite niche, like for example, we work with a, you know, I work my agents, he works with a niche musical retailer. Their conversion rates are like 10% across the board. And this is a multi million pound business. So they're exceptionally good. I think someone like them with an app would see a much bigger increase than two x because they get a lot of repeat business. So if you get a lot of repeat business, this is a little bit more exciting for repeat business retail. I haven't got an app. This has got potential. I like this board so that their transaction flows are easier. Now brands like Magalu are seeing the benefits of this firsthand. Magalu is one of the biggest retailers in Brazil and decided to notice that their app was gaining traction with their customers, especially the loyal ones. So they decided to implement deep linking and they found an incredible result. They saw an increase of 110% in the number of in app transactions that occurred. And more of this had a fantastic result on their overall business. Their mobile transactions grew by 40%. Like I said, app deep linking is now available in search, display and shopping ads. And with that, thank you. Someone gets it. And with that, I'd like to introduce Anthony Chavez. He's going to tell you all about how we want to help you optimize your performance and reach those consumers wherever they are in their journey. Thank you so much. Okay, that was a nice short one. 10 minutes. So I'm going to finish here before I arrive at town too long. But yeah, that's a nice feature. So we've got past the introduction video. So now these are a bit more short and snappy and shown as the meat in the sandwiches it were. So if you've enjoyed this random sort of commentary of the Google Live event, please hit the like button.
