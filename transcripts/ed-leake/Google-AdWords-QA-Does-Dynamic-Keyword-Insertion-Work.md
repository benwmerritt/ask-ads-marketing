Amit has asked how keyword insertion in ads can boost or reduce campaign performance. So Amit, this is kind of a tale of two halves actually. So when we use DKI, dynamic keyword insertion, we typically only use it in the titles for testing and yeah, it's kind of a quick fix. It can boost click through rate in the short term, but in all honesty, longer term, just very well written adverts that are different to your competitors work much, much better. So DKI is kind of like a quick fix. If you've got a big account, I can, yeah, I can understand why you'd use it, but you've got to be really careful that when you use it, your ad groups are really tightly, tightly packed together with keywords. If you've got quite big ad groups, lots of keywords in them, DKI can start making your ads look a bit rubbish, quite frankly. The better approach would be to use customizations in your adverts. So there's a couple of cool things that we do with clients to keep ads relevant. You can actually pull in the date or the month. So you can make an advert text relevant compared to your competitors just by mentioning the month that we're in. And you can do the same with locations. Definitely do locations if you've got a location based business or even a national business that wants to get a bit more local traffic and local clicks, should I say. There's also things like countdown timers and stop checkers and that sort of thing. So if you've got a sale on, you could put a countdown timer on for a certain end date for your sales. These little things are great automations and they're much better as a dynamic proposition in an advert than a simple keyword insertion. So thanks for your question and I hope that helps.
