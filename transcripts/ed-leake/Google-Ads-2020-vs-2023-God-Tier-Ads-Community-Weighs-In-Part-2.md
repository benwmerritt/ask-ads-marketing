Everyone wants to be a bloody guru. And I was like, I'm going to wait. I'm going to sit back, going to gather the data, the understanding, and then I put out 95 minutes of free training on YouTube because I was like, I wanted to blow all that crap, all the crap I was seeing out the water. Now, Chris Shoot. And Chris, I don't know if that's actually how you say your surname, S-C-H-U-T-E. But I'm going to say shoot. Sounds good. Chris has put war and peace in here. So he thinks a lot has changed in the past three years. So new campaign types, new ad formats, new bid strategies, new keyword match type behavior, new data attribution, new audience signals, et cetera. New campaign types. Well, we've got P-Max. The discovery's been replaced with, what do they call it now? What that awareness type of campaign? Yeah, yeah, that's awesome. It's new, isn't it? Like lead generation? Yeah, I can't remember what it's called. I'm a Google Ads professional, honestly. Yeah. This is the thing. Like something's got a name change and a tweak. I'm not that bothered till I see it in action and working. And I'm not going to pretend to know all about it until I've actually used it for a fair amount of time. So it's like. There's people who will chase the trends, and there's people who just get there to get results. Everyone alive will talk about the new features. Yeah, you mean like us recording at Alex Hormose, video? No, but that's just context about value, mate. It's more about like when there's a new feature and people like acting like it's the bee's knees. And they don't switch all about it. And they haven't used it, or they don't have enough clients, or they've got clients that spend like $500 or $2,000 a month. They don't actually have credible data, and then they're an expert. It took me six months to record my P-Max video. Yeah. Probably more. I waited, and I waited, and I waited, because I saw all these videos coming out, all these comments and things. I'm like, that's wrong. That's a lie. That person doesn't know. That person doesn't know. Like they've put something out. They're smoking at me? No, no, no, no. But I just look like I'm like, that person's putting out information they don't know enough for it to be gospel. And I was like, I'm going to wait. I'm going to sit back, going to gather the data, the understanding, and then I put out 95 minutes of free training on YouTube, because I was like, I wanted to blow all that crap, all the crap I was seeing out the water. And some people creating courses on P-Max that had less in them. Yeah, I just don't. Everyone wants to be a bloody guru. Anyway, new ad formats and new campaign types, I think they're kind of minimal. I know we've had the migration to RSA from ETAs. And there was a lot of poo-pooing about that, but RSAs do the job now. So yeah, new keyword match types, behavior. Yeah, this is probably, look, we can fix it, though, through scripts and negatives. So exact match are very loose now, but we can fix that by applying negatives. But I say that we've got one account where the negative list is now too large. It hit the maximum number of legs for an exact. I've got 5,000. For an exact match ad group, that's how crazy. It's an automated script that adds all the variations in. Essentially, it kills close variations and stuff like that. It's a very specific circumstance, but the fact that there were thousands of variations of the very tight exact matches is hilarious in one way and sort of frustrating in another. So yeah, Chris completely agree. I wish exacts were still tight. And I wish Google just said, look, test the broad, and we'll give you the exacts, but give broad a chance, as opposed to just sort of trying to make exacts broads. Data attribution, well, we've got data driven versus last click now. Are you touched on last click, Michael? There's still plenty of accounts that can run on last click. If you're a small business, you know, spending a grand or whatever, all your data is last click really. So don't worry about that. And if you've got enough data run data driven, it's made your life or our life was Google Ads Manager. It's very simple. We have two choices. And for most people, the choice is data driven and forget about it. I actually think it's better for most clients anyway. Because when you look in the attribution report in Google Ads, you see that maybe 60 to 80% are within the first click. Now, that might be based on that the cookie wasn't available. But I still think data driven is relevant. Just that's my approach. It's good for attributing. Yeah, so data driven is position based. It's just that instead of being equally weighted in the second, third, fourth spot, whatever, Google will add a little bit of weighting. But it's position based, which is fine. We used to use position based a lot for our e-compliance. Google Analytics, import position based. Yeah. Oh, Chris, this is a big one. Let's make this the last one, because I feel like this video has been going for 40 minutes. This is going to be a masterclass by the end of it. I'm very sorry that I'm boring you. Oh, it's great. I just don't want to use up all your valuable time. What hasn't changed? Chris agrees, core principles of running winning ads, account structure, still important. He's put stag, scag, and eye bag. I don't know what an eye bag is. I haven't heard. I don't know what that is. That's hilarious. Negative keywords, very important. Yeah, we all agree on that. Proper conversion tracking. Yeah, that's one-on-one. If you haven't got conversion tracking, what are you doing? Unless you're doing a branding campaign or an uplift campaign, fair enough. Constant search term mining. Yeah, I think we said that we add less keywords than we do. Yeah, keyword mining was a really good way years ago where you'd have a campaign with a broad match or a broad match modifier and whatever, the other phrase, and then you'd exact match the negative out. So if it's just like car insurance, you put that as a broad match, but then you negative out exact match, and then you just mine all the keywords that are not that keyword. Alpha beta. Yeah, cool. Yeah, alpha beta. Yeah, you've got the alpha campaign, then you mine across. Yeah. It's still a viable strategy, but I think for a lot of people, it's too much work. And they... Is it that too much work, the data's not there, or just like sometimes it's just mental masturbation? Ooh, here's a controversial one. Monitoring and optimizing for quality score. I have stopped giving a toss about quality score unless there's a problem, and then I'll use it as a diagnosis tool, but I don't use it as a leading indicator. So long as a keyword... For me, anyway, as long as the keyword's seven or up, essentially Google's telling me you're in the right place. So yeah, I don't... Not for me. I think quality score is really important. I'm only recently getting back into it, really understanding the importance of the CTR, the ads being relevant, and then ultimately the page being relevant. Yeah. I ignored it for years, and most people I know still ignore it. It's like a very, very, very last case, when sometimes if you just look at it from the start, you get higher ranks, lower cost per clicks, which means you add show higher, and it costs you less, more clicks, less money. You don't want to be that person optimizing from like nine to 10. It's like no, you optimize when it's like a three to like five, or five to six or seven. Yeah, anything under seven is a trigger to do something. Seven or above is diminishing returns for your time, most of the time. I guess it's one of those things where you feel like you're on top of the account. You've done a lot of stuff on this account, and it's like, you know what? I'm gonna, this month, I'm gonna analyze quality score and see if I can make some tweaks. He's put search partners and display still suck for lead gen. Yeah, pretty much search partners. Writing good ad copy, yeah. I mean, against 101 and high converting landing pages. Yeah, 101 landing pages. Like if you were starting out in Google ads, what would be the advice and not to make this video go on too long, but it's get the foundations right in Google ads, but then you want to multi-skill yourself. So you want to tack on some automation to speed up the process. But I said also, you really want to be good with landing pages. Yes. Just even knowing the fundamentals of a good performing landing page will put you in the top 10% because most people don't do it or don't even look outside. They don't look outside their Google ads accounts. They don't look at competitor ads. I used to be a bit like that years ago. Don't do any recon. You know, you've got to recon the search on the scale. Well, I recorded another video today exactly about this. And my concept is 50% of success comes from in the account, 50% outside of the account, being it for the lead gen. So 50% of success is from the Google ads, 50% from the landing page. The problem is with people is they'll spend the same amount of time and effort in the account, getting a 1% return. When you put that same time and effort on a landing page, you get a 500% return, 5x. And that's standard. But so many people don't have the skill or it's a developer or somebody's doing the landing page. It's like, just get a landing page software. It's not that hard. People think that needs to be pretty. The best landing pages that work are not pretty. They just have the core elements. Good headline, good offer, good call to action, good hero image, and just being a good business. Simple as that. And actually just make sure that your headlines are lined with what people are searching for. You go to good offers so people contact you. A call to action so people take action. A hero image or images to know that your business or what's being served is actually relevant to what people are looking for. And that's it. Not that hard. And just like, and tweaks like social proof near the call to action button. So your little star rating or whatever, your Google stars or whatever. Some of my landing pages are ugly as sin. And some of my best landing pages will convert incredibly well. Like 40% and it's just a shot image of me offering something. It's a headline. It's a few bullets. It's a clear call to action with the testimonial underneath it. You can't scroll. It leaks exotic services. Exactly. And you can't scroll anywhere. Yeah. Yeah, you're completely right. There's a lot of this outside. And funnily enough, I think it was Chris Xu actually left us that big comment. I think he recorded a video very kindly about landing page optimization for another member. So I'm going to upload that. Inside God Tier framework if you want to purchase. Because he literally went through what makes a great landing page showing off one of his. I think it was before and after. So brilliant. So some of the members are great because they share stuff like this. So Casper says evergreen. So if Google suggests it, do the opposite. I mean, he's kind of got a point. And then, but Nikita, she said, Nikita Mindall. I hope I'm saying your surname right, Nikita. She just said Google support has become utterly useless, which yeah. Yeah. I think that's the tragedy actually. We used to have Google reps that were dedicated to the agency side and Google's, even as premier partner, we don't actually have someone dedicated anymore. And yeah, I think that's a loss for everyone. But that's just Google skimming and trying to make more money and constantly chasing next quarter, isn't it?
