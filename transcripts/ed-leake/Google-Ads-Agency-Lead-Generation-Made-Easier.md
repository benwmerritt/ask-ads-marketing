Yeah, I'd give away the farm because your audience, people like me, I don't understand crass, but I don't have an issue with money. I have an issue with time. I am absolutely time-sarved, so I will throw money at people if they can fix that. We're an ideal client, right? This is kind of where I found we get, I think we put ourselves in too small of a corner. We were going after the experts who sell online courses and digital products. Typically, people who are selling through paid ads have a more expensive program because if they're selling something for less than three or four hundred bucks, they're probably not running ads. There's just no margin there. They're probably like an organic type of creator. So now we're in people who are creating digital products that are selling more higher expensive $500 plus programs. Typically, those people are pretty marketing online business savvy, in which case they're either running their own ads or they've got someone in-house doing it. So then we need to find people who are creating these courses, but also not very marketing savvy because that's kind of our market there. So that's where I think we've kind of gone too small. That course in particular was all about how to create better Facebook ads for information products and courses because you need to have really good ads in order to be able to scale. Everybody who buys it is a marketer. I was just about to say, I know we've talked about this before, but we didn't actually talk about the context of the course. And I was just about to say that's the one bit that I wouldn't want. So the training that would make sense to someone in my position who's sort of your target is all the nuts and bolts required to run before you can run the ad. So at case in point, I had Louis Grenier from Everyone Hates Marketers. I had a paid him for a consultation a couple of weeks ago on my branding and stuff like that. And he was brilliant. Paid him good money for a brilliant hour and a half call. We went through everything. So I've got all these amazing ideas from him and we went through all this great stuff. But I need five different people to be able to implement all this. I need the copyright of the content designer, the web developer, the this that all these different moving parts, which is what I thought your training course would be more around like all the moving parts because you do the ads. And this is where, and I don't know if it's a pain in the ass for you. And I don't know which bits you do or don't do. And I said to Louis, really, he should be productizing that whole thing. So he should do these consults, which he does a lot of. I think he does like 10 or so a month. But at the end of it, we're left holding the baby. I mean, I'm left with this head full of stuff. And I've got nowhere to go. So he should be have a team to implement all this stuff, because that stuff's worth probably five, 10 times what I paid him for the consultation. Is that how you work? Or are you pure ads? Do you do any of the nuts and bolts bits at all? Yeah, we do. That's kind of yeah, we do everything. I mean, we go from, you know, someone comes in, they're spending three, four thousand a month, because they're just kind of stuck and they got some stuff set up, but they don't really know what's working. We set up the tracking with the ads, run all the ads, help them with landing pages, we kind of just do everything to scale that thing up. So that's what I was looking at doing was kind of reshifting this to a, you know, here's the whole strategy to eventually get to the point to where you're running like successful multi platform campaigns that can scale and you can track. And then kind of rebuilding that as like a blueprint and then potentially, you know, hopefully turning that I think I like the idea of having a paid training. I just, you know, we can start it for free and then move it to. Yeah, I'd give away the farm because your audience, people like me, I don't understand crass, but I don't have an issue with money. I have an issue with time. I am absolutely time-saved. So I will throw money at people if they can fix that, which means you do all the work for me, which is what you're doing. So the whole Facebook training thing in hindsight is probably the wrong bit. It's all the bits in the middle. And if it's that detailed and good as a lead magnet, I don't even know if you'd charge for it really, because at the end of the day, what's the $27 signifies that just to sort of pre-qualify people as in you don't want tire kickers because they're getting it for free. But then if you use a application process like Liam's put in place that does the vetting for you anyway, so they don't get to talk to you regardless. If they pay you or they get it for free, you can vet them anyway.
