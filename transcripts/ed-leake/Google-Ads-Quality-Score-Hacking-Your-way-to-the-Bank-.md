Hi guys, Ed Leake here. Today we're going to talk about quality score hacking for Google AdWords. There will be a quick overview of what quality score is, how it's calculated and then more importantly how to hack it to improve your quality score to drive down your costs. Okay, a quick, real quick overview of quality score. Even though it's a decade old, I'm not going to spend 10 years rattling through this because it's quite straightforward. So essentially quality score is designed for a high quality user experience. At the end of the day, people on Google searching for your services, products, answers to their questions, so on and so forth, they are Google's customers. The whole reasoning behind quality score for Google is to ensure that the search experience for their customers is of a high standard. Quality score is a grade of 1 through to 10, 1 being awful, your ads will barely show and 10 being perfect. Your score is calculated every time ads are shown. You can only see your quality score as of today. You can't see any historical quality score, account quality score is on a keyword basis. So there is a tool out there called optimizer. And that's with an MYZR, optimizer.com. I'm not affiliated to them. It is a paid tool. But if you want to capture and record your quality scores over time, that tool allows you to do so. It's quite interesting. It does other things as well. Told you it was a brief overview. Right, straight onto the components of quality score. What is quality score made up of? The fact of the matter is with quality score, a bit like the kernels chicken recipe, Google keeps the exact calculation under close wraps. It's essentially a secret that everyone has to understand and interpret. But that being said, click through rate is the single biggest component of quality score. It's supposedly around 65%. Historically, it was perhaps higher. Some people think it's in the region of sort of 80, 90%. However, as with organic search, Google's algorithms have become even more sophisticated. So actually, they understand the on page experience way more than they previously did. Most experts would suggest it's still around about 65%, which is two thirds of the quality score, just for click through rate alone. And the remaining portion is down to relevance of your keyword to your ad, your account history. So essentially, the expected click through rate versus the actual click through rate, and this is a benchmark against your peers against other people advertising and historical averages, so on and so forth. And as I just said, quality of your landing page is now important. It's perhaps 10% of the actual quality score metric, arguably more important for your end user, to be honest, your customer, but it's still very important for quality score. And that includes page speeds and load times. Again, that's something that's been mentioned for years now by Google. They like mobile optimized where appropriate, they like fast loading pages, and they don't like spammy shit, which is kind of obvious when you think about it. And also ad extensions, it's best practice now, everyone should be using ad extensions. Yes, they'll boost your click through rate. But if other people are using them, it's going to boost those as well. So that isn't a quick win. It used to be when they were first released many years ago, and people just weren't using them. And you could put your call outs on your site links, and you would see a significant gain across the board, to be honest. But it's it's pretty much part of the course. Now, if you don't know what those are, Google them, you should be using them. They've been around a long time now, and they're free to use, they boost your click through rate, you can't, you can't really lose with them. And finally, you've got device and location biasing to quality score. It's a slither of the metric. But essentially, there is a mobile biased measurement and geographical as well. So that's it, the components. Just remember two thirds of which or they're abouts depending on who you ask is click through rate, that's significant to remember. Okay, so if that's the case, what's a good click through rate? It's not 2%. You may have seen that number banded around. It's more like five to 6%. And that's the average remember. So click through rate incredibly important to quality score, you want to be aiming for at least five or 6%. But you want to be much higher if possible. And of course, it goes without saying this will vary from industry to industry. But still, don't look at 2% as a as a good or reasonable click through rate. And of course, I'm talking about search network here, not display, which is considerably lower. Okay, moving swiftly on, not a component of quality score, but ad rank is the final destination for your bids multiplied by your quality score. And it's really simple. The advertiser with the highest ad rank wins the auction. Here's an example. It's in pounds, British pound sterling. But at the end of the day, you could replace the pounds there for dollars, euros, whatever takes your fancy, that's irrelevant. The currencies are relevant here. What is relevant is the numbers. So we've got James, Olivia, Robert and Jason there. They're in a four way battle of bids to get the top four spots in the search results. The assumption is they're all bidding on the same keyword here, of course. So James's quality score is nine versus Olivia at five, so on and so forth. And you can see the ad rank is a multiple of the bid. So one pound 50 times nine is 13.5 as an ad rank. Olivia two times five is 10. And again, so on and so forth. And therefore, because of those ad ranks, the positions are thus and I've done it in order to keep it really straightforward on the screen, but you can see that it's it's quite a straightforward calculation. But you can also see why quality score is such a critical thing to get on top of and to improve. And then the obvious question off the back of that is, what do you pay? How do you work out what you pay for your position? So again, it's slightly more cumbersome, but it's ad rank below you divided by your quality score equals the price you pay, the ad rank below your position divided by your quality score equals the price you pay. So in this example, James divides Olivia's ad rank of 10 by his quality score of nine, which gives 1.12 or thereabouts, Google adds a cent or a penny onto each actual CPC price. So we've looked at the ad rank, which is driven by quality score times bid. And the price significance here because of the quality score difference is very tangible. Jason in the fourth spot, he could be paying as much as 400% more than James in the top spot, three position difference, four times the price because of quality score. That should have sold it to you. If you weren't that bothered about quality score before, hopefully you're now looking at that thinking blimey. Yeah, I need to get on top of that. So let's bust a few myths real quickly just to dispel any untruths about quality score. Yeah, quality score benefiting from higher positions, nonsense. That's wrong. Google factors that in it understands that if you're higher up the page, you're going to get a higher click through rate. So don't be conned into thinking you can just bid more and get a higher quality score as a result. A higher quality score equates to more sales, apparently. No, it doesn't. What it equates to is it improves your CPA because you pay less for your bids. But that's not more sales, that's paying less for sales. And there's a significant difference there. It's a good thing, but it's not the same thing. And the display network does not affect the search network. They both have separate quality scores. Next myth, increasing your bid boosts your quality score. That's another lie. Bid is not part of the quality score calculation, as you saw before. It's part of that rank in that your quality score is times your bid to achieve your ad rank. But your bid is not part of quality score. And another myth, it's kind of a myth. Kind of true. Deleting low quality score areas of the account will increase your quality score. Yes and no. Immediately, no it won't, because Google takes into account historical data on your account. As I've put there, time is a great healer, but don't think that you can delete 90% of your account because it's crap and have a boost in quality score the very next day. It doesn't work like that, I'm afraid. Okay, what's a good quality score? One through three, bottom of the stack, junk. The Google benchmark for the average is around about the five mark. So therefore good is above average seven to eight, 90 to 10, pretty darn perfect, to be honest with you. Okay, first hack on the list is to focus. This is really straightforward, less of a hack, more of an account optimization understanding. If you actually look at your account from a keyword level, you'll find typically that sort of five to 10% of your keyword to spending all your money, and the vast majority aren't. And therefore it's a case of you want to optimize and pay attention to and focus on this top percentile, because that's where you're going to get all your performance games. Hack number two is to sharpen your tool. Quick rule of thumb here is as I briefed over on the quality score scale, one to three, crap, delete them. It's not to say you can't reuse them, but for now, delete them. Four to six, their average, this is where you should optimize first. So I'm going to run through a few tactics to do so. But yeah, focus on your range of four to six, because that's where you can make the biggest impact. Seven to eight, to be honest, that's pretty okay. It's above average, until you fixed every single sort of average quality score issue that you've got in the four to six range, I would leave seven to eight alone. Nine to eight, well, just leave them. Don't fix what ain't, bro. To get yourself from an average of five, just make sure you take out your lower click through rate keywords in ad groups and put them in their own thematically linked ad group. Don't stuff your ad groups, follow keywords, keep them tight, and look to improve click through rate and therefore quality score going forwards, because that in turn will allow you to be confident that you can bid up the newly optimized, nearly thinned out ad groups. So hack three is branching out single keyword ad groups, exactly as it says on the tin. This is one keyword in an ad group with a highly targeted advert and text, and of course, a landing page to suit. Don't rush off and create a million single keyword ad groups and then send them all to the same landing page, because you're kind of defeating the point here. You want to find your really, really high performing keywords that convert that are mixed up with other other keywords in other ad groups and strip them out and give them their own essentially their own budget and their own air to breathe. And this in turn will increase click through it will increase quality score. So if these keywords are performing now, they can get better. A hack four is the easy swing branded keywords. This is something I don't see a lot of people doing and it surprises me, really surprises me. In fact, we we work with quite a large retailer running up to Christmas last year. And they're big enough that a lot of their products people will search for the term plus their brand or brand plus the search term. So by incorporating their brand name and variants of into ad groups, we significantly increase the click through rate. I mean, significantly. And that in turn had a an impact, a positive impact, of course, on quality score. Hack five spruce up. Essentially, what this is, using a very simple methodology to understand which your best adverts. So it's really simple, you take your click through rate, which Google cares about, and quality score cares about, and times it by your conversion rate, which you care about. So if you had three ads in an ad group, you'd literally take their click through rate times conversion rate, it give you a score. And that would tell you from a balanced perspective, which ad is is is working. This is a really quick, simple scoring method for your adverts. Google has just recently introduced a ad split testing, which helps things. So use it in tandem with split testing. Hacksix is the lazy swing. I was a little bit reluctant to put this one in. But I'll be honest with you, if you've got a big account, it's, it's a quick fix, it's a quick win. So DKI dynamic keyword insertion is a sliver of code, well, ad words code you put in your ad headline or description, most people use it in the headline, which inserts where there's appropriate space, inserts the user's search term into your ad. And of course, that increases the relevance and gives you a click through rate a boost. Quick word of caution, though, I wouldn't use this as a lasting tactic. I would use it on a large account where you've got a lot of underperforming keywords to bring them up to speed and then go back to them and rewrite ads in time. And hack number seven is to blossom with remarketing lists for search ads, RLSA. Hopefully you've heard of remarketing, RLSA is essentially search remarketing. So people that have previously clicked on your ad and visited your website, when they search again for the term, your ad will come up again. But this gives you the option to bid it up and also gives you a few of options beyond that so that you can appear again for that search. The reason you want to do that, of course, is because people don't instantly buy typically. And if they're shopping around and they've been to your website once, you may want them to come back. And if you're doing your job right, they may well buy from you. And this essentially increases the odds of them doing so. The beauty of which you get a higher click through rate because of familiarity. So they've already searched, they've already seen you, they've already visited your website. And they are more likely therefore to click on your ad again, this boosts your click through rate. And we've clicked through rate being two thirds of the quality score or thereabouts, it boosts your quality score. So it's good for business. Right, so we've run through quality score, what it is, how it works, how the auction works, some myths and seven hacks that you can employ as of today to boost your quality score, reduce your costs. But I don't want to get too transfixed on quality score. Yes, it's really critical. However, quality score impacts your ad rank, your ad rank impacts your cost per click. But crucially, your cost per click is what impacts your cost per acquisition. And at the end of the day, your cost per acquisition always wins. Yes, we should care about quality score, but ultimately, regardless of what anyone says, CPA wins. And ultimately, is what makes your business either work with AdWords or not. And finally, to simplify all of this, relevancy. That's what Google wants. So they want the search term to be relevant to the ad to the landing page. And therefore, height and click through rates, so they get paid, height and click through rates, so you get rewarded with quality score boosts, and therefore improved ad rank, and therefore a lower CPC. However, from a non algorithmic, non bot computer perspective, continuity is key. Continuity essentially means that there's the person that's looking for your thing, your product, your service, whatever it may be. When they search, they read your ad, and they land on your page that you are providing a seamless experience for them. So they're getting what they want. If you fail to do that, you will lose money, you'll waste money. Final pun of the day, don't be stumped. Join my Facebook page and ask questions on the video. I'll happily answer them or post a comment in the in the comment section below the video. Thanks for taking time to watch the video. Hope you found it useful, and I'll see you again hopefully next week. Cheers.
