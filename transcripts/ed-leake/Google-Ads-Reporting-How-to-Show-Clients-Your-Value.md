They're here to get an outcome for their business. When you start getting to myopic on the account, then you start to step away from that part on the business. That's a more important part. If we're hitting KPIs, how much work should we do? So if we're, let's say you've got a row ass target or a convert, a total conversion target, we need 200 conversions a month or whatever. If you're doing 210, 220, we see you, Liam. We see the hat. Well, then do you put the same amount of effort in because you're hitting your target or do you focus on another account or what, what, what decision do you make in this situation looks like we're hitting the targets, move on to the next account or do you do something different? I think for me, I would focus on another account. However, the biggest question I've got is, is similar to what Mads mentioned there. If you haven't done much in the account, what do you put in your report? How would you justify your fees? So just monitoring. I think that's my biggest question. I always feel like I need to do something, even if it's running, you know, if it's running really well, you don't want to touch it. But what, what have you done this month? I love just watching graphs. You know what I mean? It's I think that's my biggest. Well, I've always think, right, OK, I need to do something. And I'm not writing to do. You do report on the actual physical work because we don't. We don't say, oh, we've created X number of ads and we've done this, that and the other week, we report on essentially performance to sort of get us around the change log issue of, oh, how much work have you done? Kind of a high level. But I've always kind of followed the format as in, you know, this is this is where we're at. This is what we've done and this is what we're going to do next. That's kind of been the report format. Yes. So if there's nothing in that, this is what we've done section. The clients thinking, well, what are you doing for your money? You know, what about it? Ian, it's like, what, what do you see? Because it's like, you still do the checks. And even if you don't do any changes, we report, this is what we're seeing. It all looks good. This is what might come up, which might be a threat to the account, but otherwise all looks good. Like that's, that's what we got on our weekly Google ads notes, docs, which was based off of that thing you had, Ed. So even if it's like no actions taken, it's just like, what are we seeing? Yeah. And you don't have to say that there's no action taken, do you? Because I'm just thinking the way we word things, it's more a case of this is where we're at, this is what we're planning. This is where we're moving towards. Do you have to be very specific about what you're doing? I don't think you have to, unless you've done a piece of work that is worth talking about. I know. I've kind of reworded it. Some, some of it, the report lately, and put significant changes. Hmm. So we're testing a new landing page, for example. That could be a performance as well. So significant change could be in performance as well. Even if you've literally done nothing, you can still report on that positive change. Doesn't mean you have to back it up with, and we did this, that, the other to make, to achieve it. And some people might think that's a bit gray, but at the end of the day, if you built the account and you manage it, it doesn't matter that you didn't touch it for two weeks. If it's performing well, then report the good news regardless of if it was because you clicked a button. Right. Okay. Right. Okay. And then what, what you're doing next. And then it, well, nothing because it's performing well. Well, right. This is the next bit. This is the proactive bit that I wanted to talk about. It's like, what can you put essentially like a menu and pick bits from a menu to give your client say next month, we're going to focus on this, or for the next quarter, or, you know, push it a bit further ahead than a month. Um, so I'm just looking at the chat because Michael's put, uh, yeah, when hitting results, let the client know, then discuss the future. Yeah. I agree, Michael. So you, you can chime in by the way, but, um, do you not, Michael, do you outline what you've actually done as an agency, or do you just talk about results where we're headed as opposed to here's our change log? Um, I would never tell clients like what we're, my like, I don't have any clients who do that. And I just think it's a really bad way to guide the client because they're here to get a outcome for their business. When you start getting to myopic on the account, then you start to step away from that part on the business. That's a more important part, which is the actual goal that they want to achieve. So I think when like, whenever I chat to clients, I'm like, how are things going on your side? It's always like, we talk about Google ads for like one minute and then the next 29 minutes is purely just about like, what's happening in your business? What are you seeing on your side? Are there any gaps at the moment that we can use ads or other things to help assist with? Because usually the ads are the things that are going well. It's everything else in the business that's fucked like the operations, the sales side, the fulfillment side. So when you talk about that more with them, they don't really focus on the ads, but that's just me. Everyone's got a different approach. I just think that if you get too caught up trying to do like what we did this month, like change logs, that's good because it shows you be proactive, but you've got to still bring it back to the bigger picture. Ultimately, like we're doing this because we're trying to hit this result with you. We also recommend that this, we also had insight this month that of this thing. And now we're going to change this thing in the account. It's hard to kind of describe as like, being too mechanical about this. It's a very, when I worked at agencies, it's just a very like a junior approach. When you start moving up, you start to realize like you need to be more consulting about the business and how Google Ads helps assist the business rather than just being like so caught up in the granularities of the account without any of this. Yes, that's how we approach it. It's like another sales call, isn't it? Because you essentially bat off the Google Ads stuff when you're talking about the business. Because if you move the conversation to how the quality of leads, type of leads coming in or sales or whatever, if it's e-commerce, any promotions, any new product lines, any best sellers that are changing, you've got any stop issues coming. Have you got any logistics problems that we need to be aware of? Have you got any blah, blah, blah? All of a sudden, you've moved the conversation ahead and away from the work. And the reason I hate getting too into the weeds of the work, and I really don't think we describe what we do, it's very rare, is because it brings you down to an hourly resource and you need to avoid that, where they're thinking, what am I getting for my money as opposed to are the results, what I expected, what I was promised, where we need to be, there's the value for money. If you start talking about what you've done, it's like, oh, shit, we pay you four grand a month and you've done about 10 hours work, that sounds far too expensive. So yeah, like Microsoft, move the conversation to a more consulting thing about the business.
