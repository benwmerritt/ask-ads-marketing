Hey, it's Ed. I'm not doing the video today. We've got Patrick Sam, who's the founder of Rocketly, the agency, and a God Tier Ads customer. And he's contributed this rather lengthy, offline conversion tracking walkthrough in great detail. So how to capture it, what the GCL ID actually is, and then how to use automation to bring that data back into your Google Ads account. So without further ado, over to Patrick. Hey guys, Patrick Sam here from Rocketly. And welcome to this video, where I'll be covering how to set up offline conversion tracking inside of your Google Ads account. Now offline conversion tracking is a super powerful way to get high quality conversion data into your Google Ads account, especially if you're a lead generation business. But a lot of people never get this set up inside their account because they find it too complicated or they don't really understand how it actually works in practice. So this video is going to teach you everything from understanding what offline conversion tracking is and how it works, and showing you an implementation method that I use that you can copy and paste for your own business or clients. So yeah, let's get started. Okay, so just a quick intro about myself before we kind of dive into the actual video. So I'm Patrick Sam, I'm based in the UK, got around four years of experience in Google Ads, probably closer to five now. And I've been in marketing for around six years, give or take. I run a small boutique agency called Rocketly, where we manage Google Ads for lead generation businesses. And we also create by converting landed pages for them. As far as this video goes, it will be broken down into three different parts. So part one, we're going to be covering what is offline conversion tracking and how does it work. In part two, we will be covering how to capture Google Click ID from a teleform, which is a third party tool, which I will talk a bit about more later on in the video. Then part three is automating the offline conversion tracking with Sapia, which is an automation tool. And again, I will expand on that once we reach that part. So yeah, for right now, we will be covering part one. So let's jump right in to the video. What exactly is offline conversion tracking and how does it actually work? So before we actually dive into what offline conversion tracking actually is, let's first discuss what Google Click Identifier is or GCLID for short. You might have heard the term GCLID frame around here and there. And you might be wondering, well, what the heck is that? Why is it important? And why do I need to know about it? So a Google Click ID is a URL parameter, which is appended to the landing page URL. It's a unique string that Google allocates to every click or every ad click. So when someone clicks on an ad from Google Search that you've listed, Google will assign a random string to that. And it will just be a bunch of random letters and numbers. You don't have control over what value is assigned here. It's always up to Google. Another thing as well is that Google Click IDs are trackable for up to 90 days. So if I give Google an ID that was assigned 100 days ago, so someone clicked on that ad 100 days ago, I give the Google Click ID to Google Ads, they won't be able to find a match stat for us because it will have expired due to the 90 day imitation. And finally, for Google Click IDs to be appended to the landing page URL, auto tagging must be enabled inside of your Google Ads account. It's not really something you need to worry about because auto tagging is always enabled by default. However, if you would like to check yourself inside of your Google Ads account just to be safe, you can go to admin, account settings, and then if you expand the auto tagging box like shown in the screenshot, you just need to make sure that the box is ticked like that. Again, by default, it's always ticked. So unless someone has been missing inside the account settings configuration settings, then you shouldn't need to worry about that. So in short, the Google Click ID is what Google uses and it allows them to attribute the conversion to a specific ads, campaign, ad group, keywords, which led to the click. So if you've ever done a bit of diagnosis inside of the Google Ads UI, you can see the conversion count at the ad level, campaign level, ad group level, and keyword level. And the way that's determined is by how Google matches the Google Click ID to the customer that clicked on the actual ad. So to give you a better visual idea of Google Click IDs or how they work, here's an example of what a Google Click ID will look like. So this is a URL in the browser URL bar. And as you can see in highlighted in red, we have the parameter name slash key, which is Google Click ID, an equal sign, and then in green, we have the parameter value, which is the actual value of the Google Click ID itself. And as you can see, it's just a bunch of random letters and numbers, which doesn't actually make any sense. But it's what Google uses too much in their end, and you don't need to kind of understand it yourself. So for every URL parameter that you see, there will always be a parameter name, which is in red, and a parameter value, which is in green. Okay, so now let's go into what offline conversion tracking actually is now that we've covered Google Click IDs, and you should hopefully have a bit of an understanding as to what those are. So offline conversion tracking is the ability to measure conversions that happen outside of your website. For example, the customer journey in a sales funnel that's lower down from, you know, just a lead form submission or like an inquiry, i.e. when they become a close slash one deal, when someone comes to visit you, your physical locations, so install visits, and finally phone calls as well. So again, to give you a better visual representation of how offline conversion tracking is beneficial for standard conversion tracking, so conversions that happen in real time, Google can only see the conversion data for those actions that happen in real time. So for example, for lead generation businesses, normally the first touch point or the first sales funnel step in your sales funnel will be when they fit out an inquiry form. So when an inquiry form is filled in, we would fire a conversion, and then we would then send that conversion data to Google. So that means that Google scope is that they can see how many leads have come in, and then they can attribute that to the appropriate Google ads campaigns. But that's essentially where their scope ends. They don't, they can't see what happens to the customers after they've become a lead, where they're qualified lead, for example, and has that lead eventually become a sale. Google doesn't have access to that because that's all happened outside of the scope of this online conversion action. So with offline conversion tracking, you could have the ability to send further or additional data back to Google to show them what happens after a customer becomes a lead. So in this example, this business has a four step sales funnel. So they get 100 leads for a certain given month, and 100 of those leads become 50 marked and qualified leads. And those become 25 sales qualified leads. And finally, those become 10 sales for the business. So with a really comprehensive setup, you could actually send all of this data to Google. So there, so Google has this data on hand to further optimize your campaigns. And a great thing as well by having access to this data, you can also get more insights yourself. For example, looking at this graph, we can see that there's a 50% conversion rate from leads to MQL, a 50% conversion rate from MQL to SQL, and then finally a 40% conversion rate for SQL to sales. So that's a great thing to do. And if we combine them together, we understand now that there's a lead to sale rate of 10% from when a person becomes a lead to become a sale, which means we need roughly 10 leads for every sale for this particular lead generation business. Okay, so some considerations that you need to factor in when you are using offline conversion tracking. Now, if you are uploading offline conversion tracking for various stages of your sales funnel, you don't have to upload all of them, you know, you might just want to upload closed deals. But if you are uploading all of them, or several of them, make sure that your campaigns only optimize towards one primary conversion action. While we're sending as much data as we can to Google, we only want it to optimize to one, one type of conversion, we don't want to send multiple mixed signals because it makes optimization just not work as well. So keep the sales funnel step of your choice as primary, as the primary conversion action, so it only optimizes towards that. And then for the other sales funnel steps, keep them as secondary, so you can still use the data as observational, so it won't actually impact your or Google's optimizing. Any exception to this would be if you are using custom goals, custom goals, you can select specific conversions to optimize towards. So you can actually use secondary conversions as primary conversions for that specific campaign. So if you do use custom goals, you can kind of ignore these rules here. But if you're just using the account level settings, i.e. what sets a primary and what sets a secondary, as the driver to optimize your campaigns, then make sure you follow these two key bullet points. Another thing to consider is, should you always use the last step of your sales funnel as the primary conversion action? I will say in most cases, the lower the step of your sales funnel, the better it is to use as the primary conversion action. For example, if you're a lead generation business, the highest quality conversion data will be the customers that actually convert to paying customers. So the people that become closed deals. However, there are some things you do need to consider. For example, if you are using smart bidding strategies like Target Roas or Target CPA, Google recommends around at least a minimum of 15 conversions per month if you are using those smart bidding strategies. So if you're only getting maybe one or two closed deals per month, that might or probably won't be sufficient enough to give Google enough conversion data for it to optimize on because the volume isn't really there. So in that instance, you might want to consider using a sales funnel step that's slightly higher up. Another thing is you need to account for sales funnel steps, like how long it takes for a sales funnel step to be reached. So again, let's talk about closed deals. If closed deals in your business has a longer than average sales cycle of 90 days, then you need to remember that Google Click IDs will expire after 90 days. So let's say it takes six months for your business to get an inquiry and then take that inquiry and finally close that deal. You won't be able to send that data back to Google for when that customer becomes a closed deal because the Google Click ID will have expired by the time the sale has occurred. So in that case, you need to pick a sales funnel step that takes on average less than 90 days to occur. And then the final consideration is if you are uploading leads through offline conversion tracking instead of using the online conversion tracking method, you may run into an error from inside of the Google Ads UI where it says that the conversion date precedes the Click date. Now to fix this, it's quite simple. You just need to offset the conversion time by one day or plus 24 hours to the conversion time. Sometimes when you set the conversion time for leads to the exact time that say the form was submitted, Google often can't match this in the systems because there's a bit of a time lag, you could say. So by offsetting the time by around 24 hours, you can play with the number if you want to, but normally one day works just fine. Then you should not get the conversion date precedes Click date error. Okay, so to summarise the benefits of offline conversion tracking versus real-time conversions for lead gen in particular. So with offline conversion tracking, we can track the whole customer journey. We can send higher quality data signals because Google will now have access to customers that converted into lower stages of our sales funnel. And we also have proactive data control. We can actually control exactly what customer data we send to Google. Whereas with online conversion tracking, it can be a bit of a mixback. So with real-time conversions, we can only track actions that happen on our website in real-time. The quality of data is going to be much lower, which means Google has less quality data to optimize towards. And also it's reactive data control. And what I mean by that is let's say we get 100 leads in leads that happen online. Sometimes you might see really poor quality leads that we don't want to send to Google, but it's already happened and it's already been sent to Google. So in order to remove that, we would have to use something called conversion adjustment, which means we're reacting to bad data that has already been sent to Google. Whereas if we had uploaded it with offline conversion tracking, we could maybe spot that before it's uploaded and we could kind of remove that bit of data before it gets sent to Google, which makes life a lot easier in the long run. So as good as offline conversion tracking is, there are some downsides to using Google Click ID. So the first point is Safari Incognito mode will actually strip out the appended Google Click ID parameter if a user clicks on the ad while within Safari Incognito mode. So what happens is before your page loads, the parameter name and parameter value, Google Click ID, will be deleted basically before your page loads. So it will actually be impossible to track that user if they've then filled out a form and then submit it. Second point is same as the above, Privacy Safe Browsers. Some also have features to strip out the Google Click ID and other parameters. I'm not 100% sure if some of these Privacy Safe Browsers have these as the default behavior or if this has to be specifically set in the browser configurations, but I'm pretty positive for browsers like Brave and stuff that this feature is available. App blockers are also similar. They might also potentially cause the Google Click ID to not be tracked as well. The last point, which is forms embedded via an iFrame. So in the method I'm going to show you on how to set up forms and how to capture Google Click ID and then automate it, I will actually be using an iFrame embed because it's the easiest way for people to copy what I'm doing. And also, a third party form building tools are a lot better than a lot of the native form builders you get on these different website builders. But the problem with iFrames is that sometimes let's say an iFrame is loaded on your landing page and a user navigates to a different page. Maybe they browse other pages of your website before coming back. The problem is the URL will change when they're going from page to page versus the original landing page that they went to. So what actually happens is the Google Click ID will get lost in the process. So if they haven't filled out the form before they start browsing, chances are the Google Click ID won't be then pushed into the iFrame form. The only way it would be saved is let's say a person partially fills in the form and then they start browsing. Some forms like Tally for example have a feature to save their pre-filled forms in. So when they come back, they come back to the form that was already partially filled in. And what should happen is the Google Click ID should actually be saved in the partially saved form. So even if they do browse and then come back and then fill in the rest of the form later, the Google Click ID should still be tracked. Now a way to ensure that you always keep Google Click ID, one way is to make sure that your landing page that contains the iFrame embed is just a single landing page. Which to be honest is what I would normally recommend anyway for anyone running lead generation campaigns. So you just have a single landing page. There's no navigation bar with other links for them to go to. They kind of have all of the information they need to on that one page. That way they won't be browsing to other pages and then the Google Click ID will always be tracked. Second method which is a lot more complicated is to get some custom iFrame codes. So you would likely have to find a some type of web developer or someone very familiar with iFrames. But you would essentially want to take the Google Click ID value, store it in a cookie or in local storage and then make sure that when the iFrame loads again, even if they're browsing different pages, once they go back to the page that has the form, the iFrame can somehow pull the stored Google Click ID value and that's somehow then pushed back again into the iFrame codes. This is getting very complicated and it's not something I'm going to cover but that is a possibility out there to prevent some of the shortcomings of iFrames. Okay so a typical offline conversion tracking workflow might look like this following graph which is pulled from a Google Support document. So a user will click and arrive on your website by clicking on an ad say on Google Search. They then might fill in a form on your website which they eventually then become a lead for your business. That form data is then sent to your customer relationship management system or CRM and then when that user becomes a closed deal for example, we might then send that CRM data directly to Google through an automation tool like SAPI. Now with the method that I'm going to show you, the CRM is going to be replaced with a Google Sheets because CRM's differ from client to client or business to business and with Google Sheets it's just a bit easier for everyone to kind of copy and paste that rather than showing you how to implement this through a specific CRM. It's also a lot cheaper because you want paying for a CRM and Google Sheets is free to use and yeah that's the method I'll be showing you. Okay so now you should have a bit of an understanding of Google Click IDs and how offline conversion tracking actually works and why it's beneficial to use. So how do we actually capture a Google Click ID from a tally form submission? So we've just done part one and now we're going to go into part two where we'll be going over how to set up a form and how to use that to capture the Google Click ID. So first of all what is tally or tally.so? Tally is just a third party form tool that I use. The UI is very similar to Notion if you've ever used that task management tool. The free plan is really generous and it's the plan we're actually going to be using in this video so you don't actually have to pay for it. It's really super simple to set up and yeah you don't have to use a tally by the way for your setup if there's a different third party form tool that you prefer or are already using you can definitely go ahead and use that as long as it has hidden fields which I will be explaining more in a second. But yeah for this example we will be using tally. So what is the secret to capturing the Google Click ID then? So the secret is to use something called a hidden field. So let's say we have a two field form where we have an entry for the person's name and then another entry field for their email address. So in this instance we would add a third field called Google Click ID which is a hidden field. So this means that this field isn't actually visible on the form itself when the user goes to fill it in. It's loaded but it's kind of hidden in the background. So the sole purpose of a hidden field is to simply store the Google Click ID value that Google assigned to that ad clip for that user. So here's some sample data as to what those values might look like. So the Google Click ID would be populated with the random string that Google generates and we would have the typical values that a user would fill in the other fields. So Patrick for the name field and then patrick at gmail.com for the email field. So just a recap and show you again. I remember I showed you the visual representation of what Google Click IDs look like. So the green highlighted value is the value that would get pushed into the hidden fields on a form. Yeah that's how we track the Google Click ID for a given user and then that's the same value that we'll use to send back to Google to inform when a user moves to a different stage of the sales funnel. Okay so with that quick intro to teleforms and how to use hidden fields let's run through an actual setup of creating a teleform, putting it on your website and then seeing if the Google Click ID is actually being pulled through. So yeah let's jump right in. Okay so here we are on the tele webpage. Once you've registered you should be able to jump to the dashboard like so. I'm not going to run through how to register an account it's pretty straightforward you just kind of type in your email and yeah once you've gotten to the dashboard here we can now begin and start creating the form that we're going to use and embed on our website. So the first thing we need to do is to click on new form here in the top right corner and now we need to give the form a name so let's call this offline inversion tracking and you can create a form from scratch or you can even use a pre-built template here to keep things simple. I'm just going to create a form from scratch and then we can now insert a field here. So the first field I'm going to insert is a hidden field which we already discussed in the PowerPoint presentation. So this is what's going to actually capture the Google Click ID and you can see it says here send custom data from your form link to your form submissions via url query string parameters. So we'll insert this and inside this box here you want to type the parameter name which in this case is Google Click ID. You can also add additional hidden fields here if you want to capture other url parameter data. But since we're just interested in capturing the Google Click ID for now we'll keep it as a single hidden field. So once that's done we can insert another block below and I'm going to keep this form very basic so I'm going to insert one short answer and I call this name. I'll insert an email field below that and I'll call this email. And finally I will insert a long answer field and I'll call this message. So if you want to you can preview the form here and this is what your form will roughly look like when you embed it to your website. And I'm happy with this now so I'll click publish in the top right corner here. So when you click publish you'll get a link that you can go to the form directly but we are actually more interested in the embed form options down here. There are also some settings that you can play with in the settings tab so if there's anything you want to change here then you can but I'm going to leave it as is. So I'll jump back into the share section and then I'll go scroll down to the embed form and then I'll go for the standard option. You can try out the other two if you want to but for this video I'm going to stick with standard. And again you'll have some options here on the left hand side like transparent backgrounds. Once you're happy with all of the settings here click get codes then you'll be presented with several options to embed your form. For this video I'm going to go with the iframe option here which is html codes which you copy and paste. This is the option I always go for so just click the copy to clipboard icon here and this code is now copied to my clipboard. Okay so the next step now now that we've got our form created and ready to go the next step is to embed it into our website. Now this might look a bit different depending on what platform you use. I'm using WordPress and I'm using a plugin called Breakdance which is a web builder tool. Again if you don't know how to embed a form I would just do a quick google on whatever platform you are using or alternatively if you have a web developer on hand I would just give him the codes the html codes that you copied from Tali and then they should be able to implement that for you. But to give a demonstration of what I would do for my own website I would simply go to the page that I want to embed the form on. I would click add I would add a code block, drag it to the location I want to and then inside the PHP and HTML codes I would paste in the Tali iframe data here. It doesn't load because it will only load when I go to the front end so I'll click save and then I would jump to the front end. Okay and as you can see the Tali form has loaded it's got our free fields here although there is technically four fields because the google click ID field is actually hidden in the back end. Now we want to test if the google click ID is actually being picked up by the Tali form. So to do this is really simple we're just going to append a test google click ID to our current URL that we are on here. So what we want to do is add question mark, the parameter name which is google click ID and equal sign and then we can add whatever value we want here. So since this is just a test let's just type in something like test one two three, press enter and now the page will reload the form will reload and Tali should now be pulling in the test google click ID value. So to test this properly I'm going to fill this in with some data or add my name or add a test email and then a test message and then click submit. So that's now being submitted now if I jump back into Tali I close this down jump back to the main dashboard. As you can see in the offline conversion tracking there's been one submission which is the submission that I just submitted right now. If I click on this and I can see the responses here I would go to the submission tab to see it in a better way. As you can see here here is the data for the submission I just gave. So you can see the time it was submitted in and in the google click ID column here you can see that the value test one two three was pulled through correctly alongside the other field data. So this shows that the form is working correctly and we are good to go to the next step. Okay so how do we now automate offline conversion tracking with Zapier. So as a quick recap in part one we learned what offline conversion tracking is and how does it work. In part two we learned how to capture google click ID from Tali and how to embed the Tali form into our own website and in part three we're going to learn how to automate offline conversion tracking with Zapier. Okay so for anyone that doesn't know what Zapier is it's an automation tool it's basically a tool that lets you connect different tools to each other. So for example we can connect Tali to a google sheet using Zapier. We can use Zapier to connect a google sheet to another google sheet or a google sheet to google you can connect hundreds of different apps together. There's hundreds of integrations available in Zapier so you can do a lot more than just offline conversion tracking if you really wanted to. For example a lot of people use it to automate other aspects of their business it's super powerful. Now you don't have to use Zapier it's the tool of choice for me because it's the most widely adopted but there are alternatives out there like make.com and various other companies. One downside to Zapier is that unfortunately you will need to use the paid version for this it's an absolute must the free version will not give you the ability to set up offline conversion tracking the way that you need to to ensure that it works properly. So if you need a paid version you can use like the cheapest plan available that should be sufficient but of course it depends on how much usage you're going to be using it for and if you're processing hundreds of leads every month you might need to purchase a slightly more expensive version but for you know smaller businesses normally the lowest or cheapest option available should be sufficient. Now a cheaper alternative to not using Zapier is you could use the Google Sheets integration in Tali it is on the free plan in Tali so essentially when a form is submitted it will get sent to a Google Sheets and then if you wanted to you could use Apps Scripts which is the code that you can have on Google Sheets you could then you know transfer that data to a different Google Sheet for example a offline conversion tracking Google Sheet which you can then upload into Google Ads. The problem is you kind of need to make your own custom code for this and it kind of adds more steps or makes it a lot harder to do but it definitely is possible and it would be essentially a free alternative than using Zapier but because I am using Zapier in this example I'm not going to be covering how to use this free method through a Google Sheet via Tali so I just wanted to put that out there in case anyone couldn't afford Zapier plan and they wanted to find a free alternative to setting offline conversion tracking up. So before I dive into the actual Zapier platform let me just show you the two types of zaps we're going to be working with so think of zaps as just like a workflow so we're going to create two workflows in total within Zapier. So the first one will be for Tali form submissions so what we're going to do is we're going to set up a zap where when a Tali form is submitted it will push the form submission data into our makeshift CRM system in a Google Sheet so we're essentially connecting two apps the Tali Tali form and then the Google Sheet then the second zap will be sending a Google Sheet CRM data to a offline conversion tracking Google Sheet for close slash one deals so when a customer is turned into a paying customer in the CRM Google Sheet we will then trigger or have a trigger set which will then send the row data of that customer to another Google Sheet which is then used to upload directly into Google Ads. So yeah with that quick introduction to Zapier and these apps we're going to be setting up let's jump into the actual walkthrough on how to do this yourself so let's dive in. Okay so before we jump into Zapier something we need to do first and foremost is to actually create our offline conversion inside of the Google Ads UI so if you go to goals and then summary under conversions where all of your conversion actions are listed we need to create a new conversion action here so click on this and then from these four options here we want to go for import and you can see here it says offline lead conversions and then from this drop down here or these four bullets we want to select CRMs files or other data sources and then track conversions from clicks and then for the data source you can connect a data source by clicking this and then we'll have an expansion of options here but for now we're going to skip this step after you've done that click on continue now we need to select a conversion goal this is just a way to categorize the conversion in the conversions UI that we just went past a minute ago so here I'm going to select it as converted leads because I'm going to create a closed deal conversion but you can select it to whatever you want here for example you could even select it as a purchase category well let's go for converted leads and then for conversion name I'm going to call it closed deal now it's important that you take note of how you've spelled the conversion name here because when we upload conversions back to Google we need to reference the conversion name and the conversion name is case sensitive so remember what you've typed here as the conversion name so once that's done click on add and then let's click on settings here and conversion action settings so we'll get some additional options for this conversion I want to keep it as a primary action because I do want Google ads to optimize towards these closed deal conversions because the quality of data is going to be much higher for the value we can keep this as is use different values for each conversion because I'm going to be specifying the revenue tied to each individual google click id now for the count section here I recommend switching this to one and you can see here it says recommended for leads signups and other conversions because only the first interaction is valuable this is going to be completely dependent on your business but normally for lead generation businesses when someone goes through your sales funnel and makes a purchase within the united day window normally it's a one-time purchase so we don't want to accidentally double track the google click id if for some reason there was some bug in your setup or something you overlooked and you accidentally uploaded the same google click id twice and if this was set to every all of those uploads would be counted as a conversion assuming the google click id was still eligible so for lead generation business I normally always recommend setting this to one again unless there's a specific reason why your business needs to track multiple purchases from a same user that came to your website for the same google click id once that's done I would click done here and then save and continue and then click done again now if I scroll down you can see that we have the closed deal here that we just created and you can see here that the conversion source import is website import from clicks which is google click id so now this conversion action is ready to be referenced when we now upload google click id into google ads so we can now jump on to the next step okay so one more step before we jump into creating the actual SAP workflow in Zapier is we now need to set up our CRM google sheet so Patrick's about to walk you through how to do this with automation if you want the templates you can create your own or if you want hours what Patrick's I'm taking credit for then you need to be a god tier ads customer follow the link somewhere around here and you can get them as part of your framework package otherwise you can still follow along with the video you just have to do the bits manually yourself as opposed to cheating and using our templates Patrick's templates back to Patrick so the first thing is all of the columns here on the left hand side of the status column these can be changed to to match your tally form so if you remember on our tally form I made three fields including the google click id so we've got the name fields here email or column sorry name column email message and then there is another column here on the right hand side for google click id so if you have more fields or less fields you can delete these according to that so for example if you have a field or phone number just insert a new field here and you can just type in phone number since I only have four fields in my form I'm going to keep it as what we currently have here the second thing you need to do is to update your status drop down here so this status column currently has four options so it's a two step sales funnel so one for inquiry when a customer fills in a form and one for when a customer becomes a close deal so when the business makes a sale then we've got two statuses here for if the lead is unqualified or if the customer is lost during the sales funnel process so if you have more than a two step sales funnel I would adjust this here so for example if you have a status for marketing qualified lead you can add this here then we might have another one for sales qualified lead so I can add it like that it's done now I've got two additional steps meaning there are four in total but again to keep things as simple as possible we're just going to use what we currently have okay so the next bunch of fields on the right hand side here revenue so revenue is a column you will fill in when a customer becomes a close deal so normally when you get a close deal you will sign a revenue amount to that customer so you would fill it in here this is optional you don't have to send revenue over to google but in most cases if you are optimizing towards close deals then you would send revenue if you're optimizing towards other funnel status then maybe you would leave this blank which is completely fine so the next column the upload column so this will insert a checkbox when this row is ready to be uploaded so explain this more in detail when I show you some codes that we're going to implement but essentially let's say this becomes a close deal and we have revenue here of like a hundred a checkbox here would be inserted and if we take this checkbox that row will then get sent to another google sheet which will then be uploaded to google ads but again I will explain this in more detail in a bit as of right now this row is not eligible because it doesn't meet your requirements so far and then the next column is google click id so this will just be the value that's being pulled from tally and then the inquiry time this will be the time and date as when the tally form was submitted by customer then finally the upload hash this is something we're going to be referencing in zapia it basically generates a number or a random string sorry of numbers and letters when we tick the upload box the reason we have this is because sapia tends to work a bit better when you reference sales with unique numbers so yeah this is what that will do okay so that is all nine of the columns in this crm spreadsheet one more thing is I would keep this sample row here as it is for now the reason being is once we've got the zap workflow set up when it inserts new rows into this spreadsheet it will always reference the row above it so if we ended up deleting this whole row here it would end up taking the formatting of the head of row here and so it would make the spreadsheet look very weird basically so keep this test row for now once you've got proper data coming in you can definitely go ahead and delete this okay so now that you've got a rough breakdown of this crm spreadsheet the next thing to do is we need to set up some triggers in the spreadsheet so what you want to do is you want to go to extensions and then you want to click on appscript okay so once you click on appscript it will open up a new tab with a bunch of codes you don't need to understand all of this code here it's already created for you so it should be working just fine but a few things that we do need to change is in this crm config section here inside this part of the code there are two variables that we need to change so the first one is the closed one status which is currently set to closed deal so the name of this string here needs to match the name of the last stage of your cells funnel inside this status column here so if i had changed this to one for example i would need to jump back into the appscript and change this to match that here but i'm going to keep it as closed deal for now because that's what i want so we'll change this back so there's that the second variable is check for revenue so this is set to true by default but you can set this to false what this does is it basically checks for the revenue cell to see if there is a number inserted in here when it's the last stage of the cells funnel so basically both of these requirements are required for a textbox to be inserted here if it's set to false it will ignore the revenue cell so if you're not interested in uploading revenue to google ads you can just set this to false and then the final thing we need to do inside the appscripts ui is to create some triggers so this is super simple to do all you need to do is to select the setup function here in the drop down and then you just want to click run since this will likely be the first time you're running this script on this google sheet you will get a pop-up to request permissions to run this and you'll just need to accept them in order to run the function as you can see i got a authorization requirement just click on review permissions you'll get a pop-up select the gmail account that you want to run it on click select all and then click continue as you can see in the execution log the change trigger was created successfully and if i go to the trigger section here on the left hand side you can see there is a trigger created here you can even look at the settings here don't change the settings here because they are set as intended so click cancel and now if i just do a quick test so if i set this row to close deal and if i add some revenue numbers in here this upload box should change to a check box like so and if i delete this upload hash when i tick the upload box here an upload hash value will be generated here randomly perfect so now this crm is ready to go and we can now jump into zapia to set up our first zap workflow okay so here we are in the zapia dashboard again i'm not going to show you how to register an account super straightforward just plug in your email and then choose the correct plan for your business or your client's business so once you're in the dashboard the first step is to create our first zap so we'll click this button here which will open up a new page then let's rename this zap to we can call this one inquiry and press enter perfect so the first thing we need to do is to create our trigger so click on trigger and then search for tally because that's the application we need to connect to first click on tally and now you'll get a window pop up here on the right hand side so now we need to select the trigger event there's only one event here that's the one we want to use which is new submission so this will trigger when a new tally form submission is generated you'll need to connect your account as well so this will just be the account that you registered with in tally i want you've done that just click continue next thing we need to do is to pick the tally form that we made so if i open this up i just need to click the offline conversion tracking form like that and now click continue and the final step is to test that the trigger is working so if you click on test trigger it will now find some records from that tally sheet if you remember we did test one form submission earlier and if we click on this it will open up that form submission here and as you can see it's got the google click id test 123 and many other field details that i added earlier so that all looks great once you're happy with that click on continue with selected records okay and now the next step is to add a formata so if we click on formata and in action event if we select date and time click continue and if we select format from here we'll get a bunch of fields appear here so the purpose of this section is we want to reformat the tally submission date that's generated from tally so we need to reformat the date and time to a format that is uh eligible to upload for google ads because when we upload the google click id conversion data for google ads the conversion time needs to be formatted in a specific way so this is what we're going to do right now so inside this input field here if you click on the plus symbol we can insert the values of different fields from tally so the one we are interested in is the submitted at time here which you can see 2025 04 20 and then it's got the time after that so insert that in the to format we can choose how to format the date so if you click on this field here it will open up some free made date formats here from zapia but what we want to do is we actually want to create a custom one so you click on the three dots here on the right hand side and then click on custom close this field here and what we want to type in now is all wise or four capital wise hyphen double capital m hyphen double capital d space double capital h colon uh double lowercase m colon double lowercase s so it should take this date here and format it into this new format given here uh the next thing we want to change is the time zone you don't have to change this um so when you pull the date and time from tally the format of that is in utc so this from time zone field here is already set correctly because the tally date and time is from utc but if you want to convert the time zone into your local time zone for example i'm based in the uk so i'd want to change this to london so if i click on this type in london or europe click on that now this will not only take the date and time from tally and reformat it it will also adjust the time zone to london or europe slash london again if i click on continue and if i now click on test step you can see that it's taken the date and time and it's now formatted it into the eligible format that we need to use for google ads okay so now that's done we need to add one more step so click on the plus and now we want to add a google sheet or the action event we want to set this to create a spreadsheet row so we can type in create click on this one here create spreadsheet row we then want to select the account that has access to the google sheets and once that's connected click on continue so next step is to select the actual google sheet and then to select the worksheet within it so i will fill these out really quick okay so i've selected the correct google sheets which is this crm spreadsheet here so once you've done that you'll get a bunch of fields appearing below here so we can leave this as false you can ignore this field here all of these other fields these are being pulled from the header names of the crm spreadsheet so what we now need to do is we need to populate these fields with the various values from tally so inside the name field here if i click on the plus symbol expand on this tally section here i can insert the name from the name fields which is patrick for the email i can click on the email field do the same with the message for the status we want to type in what the first uh step of our sales funnel is called so if you remember it's called inquiry so if i jump back i will manually type this in inquiry wherever you need to be blank because that's for when we close the actual deal the same if upload upload we leave blank google click id we pull from tally so again finally google click id fields inquiry time so we don't want to use the submitted at time here from tally we want to use the formatter that we created in step two so if you expand that you can see the output here click on that and then for the upload hash that should also remain empty as well because that is generated from the app script in the google sheet so again click on continue now we can test the step so click on test step and this will now send a test row to the crm google sheet so that's completed and now if i jump back you can see here that it's inserted a new row from the data that we had in tally so we got our name email a message it's an inquiry and it's got the google click id here and then the inquiry time so that all looks perfect and that looks like it's functioning as intended so now that's all the steps done for zap workflow one and we can now publish this live so when you click publish this app will now work for actual form submissions from tally so if i was to submit a form again on this page it will actually trigger the zap that we just set up and it should push a new row into the crm here now we will do a full test once we've done the second zap workflow but for now i'm just going to publish it and leave it as is okay so now that we've set up the first zap workflow the next thing we need to do before we set up the second zap workflow is to go through the second google sheet which is the offline conversion tracking google sheet that we will be uploading directly to google lads so again there will be a link to copy this somewhere below um now the first thing you might notice in this google sheet there is a hidden row here on row one and these just simply match the uh headers that are listed in uh row four here the reason why it's like this is when we connect this to zapia zapia will only look at the uh heading values of the first row here since these are technically the header names that google will reference here from row four um we can't force zapia to use them so we add a another uh duplicated uh header row here in row one so keep this as is do not delete this you can just keep it hidden and out of the way the second thing we need to do is to uh set the actual time zone that this google sheet will be using so you can see here there is a parameters time zone equals and then it's got europe slash london and then a semi colon so this should match whatever your time zone is inside of your google ads account if you don't know what the time zone id is then what you can do is there's a link here on this second row if you click on this it will open a new tab and here's a list of all of the eligible time zone ids that you can use so you just need to find and search the one uh for your specific location copy and paste it and then replace the europe slash london here with the one that you need to replace it with don't delete the uh semi colon on the end here because it might break the google sheet and once that's done you've now got the time zone sorted and the google sheet is ready to go i'll just uh briefly explain some of these uh columns here so google click id very self-explanatory this will be the uh google click id of the click from the user board id will be left blank because we won't be using this conversion name conversion name will need to match whatever the conversion name is of the uh offline conversion that you created inside the inside of the google ad ui this is case sensitive so make sure you get the case right here um we did call it closed deal here with capital c and capital d for each of the words conversion time this will be the time of the conversion depending on what stage uh you're uploading so this will be for closed deal in the example we'll be using the ad user data and ad personalization these can be set to either granted or denied so this should ideally reflect if you are serving customers in the ui this should respect the user's commissions that they've given in the cookie banner so ideally if they've declined the cookies this should be set to the nides um since that gets a bit complicated and that's a whole another topic we're just going to be setting these to granted by default and finally we have the conversion value and conversion currency columns so these are optional you don't have to send conversion value and currency um but since we're sending closed deal data we will be sending the conversion value aka the revenue conversion currency this should normally match whatever's in your google ads account but if you are taking payments in various currencies then you want to set whatever it is the currency that the customer paid in if say our google ads account was set to us dollars and we had a conversion currency of great british pounds because that customer might pay than that then google will simply do a currency conversion when this conversion is uploaded and yeah so that is the offline conversion tracking uh google sheet that we will be using to upload directly to google ads so now let's jump in and create our second and last uh zap workflow okay now that our offline conversion tracking google sheet is set up and ready to go we can now create the second zap workflow so here i am again in the zap dashboard so create a zap here by clicking this button new zap and now let's rename this to closed deal a center and now for the trigger this time around we want to set it to google sheets okay so for the trigger event we want to set this to new or updated spreadsheet row there are two options here one for if you're using a team drive and one if you're using your personal drive since i'm using a business account this will be the one i want to click on so click on that again select the account that has access to the uh off uh the crm google sheet and once the account is linked click on continue the next thing we need to do is to connect the crm spreadsheet so this is the spreadsheet i'm talking about not the offline conversion tracking one so this one here so let's jump back into zapia and connect to that one okay so once you've connected to the correct spreadsheet we now want to select the trigger column so this is the column that's going to trigger this zap so for this you want to set this to the upload hash so this hash will be generated again when we tick the box that gets inserted here so when that gets ticked it will generate this random string here which zapia will look out for so again jump back to here and then click on continue so the final step is to test that this trigger is working so click on test trigger and it's pulled in some rows here as you can see this row data is correct this is from the second row in our crm so that all looks good now let's click on continue okay so the next step to add is a filter so click on filter now we want to set what the conditions are so for the fields again we want to select upload hash and for the condition we want to choose if it exists so the reason we set it to this trigger is in the crm spreadsheet here in the upload hash cell here for rows these always remain empty until the upload box is checked when the upload box is checked it will generate an upload hash which means there is a value that exists in this cell so inside zapia it will check for when this cell is updated and it will check if a value has been created if it has then this zap will continue for the further steps ahead so it's important we add this to make sure that it only runs when a hash actually exists in the crm spreadsheet for a given row so once you've done that click on continue as you can see here it says your zap would not have contributed would not have continued for this test data this is because it was putting the data for this row here as the test data and as you can see it's got no upload hash value if we use the first row as the test data it would be valid because a upload hash value does actually exist but i know this will work because i've tested it before so that should be fine now let's click continue again so the next step is to add a formatter so we're going to do some date formatting again but it's going to be slightly different to what we did for the pally date so again in action event we want to select date and time click on continue and then for transform you want to set this to format and then for the input this is going to be set to something called zap meta human now so to insert this we do double curly bracket zap underscore meta underscore human underscore now and then close it with a double curly bracket and it will insert a date and time like so so what this does is this will insert the time that the zap has run so when we set a row to a closed deal and we asked zapio to pull that row data from the crm to our second google sheet which is the offline conversion tracking sheet that we upload directly to google it will set the conversion time to the current time that the zap runs which is what we want the problem with this zap meta human now variable here is the date and time format is incorrect so again we need to reformat this so in the two format fields here we're going to set this to custom again and close this window and again we're going to set it to capital y four times hyphen mm double d space hh colon lowercase m lowercase s which is perfect now for the from and to time zone for this i'm going to clear it because i don't need to change the time zone before the time zone for the zap meta human now this will actually pull the time zone that's listed in your profile on your zp account so my time zone is listed as the london time zone i believe so i would just leave all the fields as unless you want to change it to a different time zone for whatever reason i'll just leave this as utc if i change it to london it will actually mess up the date and time that the zap meta human time zone adds so i'll leave it as is click continue and i've already tested this step i'll retest it one more time so this is the correct date and this is the correct time for the current time zone that i'm in so it is 245 so again this looks great and it looks like i'm ready to move on to the next step okay so for the final step we're going to connect a another google sheet okay so for the action event we want to set this to create spreadsheet row so just type in crates create spreadsheet row click on that again select the email that has access to the spreadsheet then click on continue now for this spreadsheet that we want to connect to it's going to be this spreadsheet here so the one that we're going to be uploading to google so jump in and fill these out okay so once you've connected to the correct spreadsheet you'll get all of these fields appearing here below for this time for this time zone we can just keep this as false now for the google click id we want to pull the values from our crm spreadsheet so if i expand on this and click on google click id order id can stay blank because we are not using that column conversion name here you can use the conversion name from the status but i'm just going to manually type it in so it's closed deal again remember that the conversion name is a sensitive and then for the conversion time we want to use the time that we created or date and time that we created in the formatter so select the output there now for add user data and add personalization we're just going to type in granted for both in capital letters for conversion value we will set this to the revenue from our crm and then for the conversion currency i'm just going to hard code this as usd because we can't see what always be usd for this example click on continue now if i click test step it will send a new row into the second google sheet so a row was sent now for check this spreadsheet you can see here another row was inserted it's got the google click id test 123 conversion name conversion time granted add user data and permission or personalization conversion value is empty because we hadn't actually inserted that here in the crm but the conversion currency is there and that is now good to go so we can now publish the second zap workflow great so now that we've got both zaps up and running we can now test the whole process from start to finish to ensure that things are working as intended okay so with both of our zap workflows created our automated system should be working correctly but of course just to be safe i'm going to run through the whole process from start to finish to see if everything is working as intended so here i am again on the embedded tally form i have changed the google click id value here to a different value so this is more what a google click id would actually look like again it's still just a test value but i've replaced the test 123 so i'm going to fill out this now again with some different values we'll just go with bob this time around and change the message hi i am interested in your services click on submit after you jump over to the crm we should get a row inserted here like that um so if we change this row to a closed deal and let's assign a value of say 500 the upload box should appear like that and now if i take this it should generate an upload hash value here like that so now zapier should pull in that row as a closed deal and insert it into this google sheet here now for the second zap that we created i believe it runs or checks the google sheet every two minutes or so depending on the plan you're on so don't be worried if you don't see the row get inserted straight away here give it a couple of minutes to see if it is functioning correctly so now let's wait a bit and see if the row gets inserted and okay as you can see the row has come through successfully so we've got the google click id conversion name the time that does that run aka the time that we roughly set the conversion as a closed deal got the ad user permissions and personalization we have the conversion value and then finally we have the conversion currency so this row has been formatted correctly and this row is definitely eligible to be uploaded to google ads so this means that our automated system is indeed working correctly and everything is now working as intended okay so the last and final step to complete the whole offline conversion tracking process is to schedule the google sheet to be uploaded around every 24 hours so we're going to take this google sheet here and we're going to make sure it gets uploaded to our google ads account so the first thing you need to do inside of your google ads account is to go to goals and then inside the conversion section click on uploads then you want to jump to the schedules tab here and click on the plus sign here next from the select source we want to select google sheets and you can see here we will get some instructions make sure you've shared your google sheet with this really long email address here so you want to copy this to your dashboard just click copy next you want to go back to the google sheet and you want to click on share and now you want to paste in the email address into the ad people groups and calendars fields here like that and you'll get a few additional fields pop up you can untick notify people and we can just set this to view up and then click share you'll get a pop up like this saying you're trying to to share the google sheet with a business or an email outside of your organization that's fine just click share anyway and now the google sheet should be properly accessible for google ads so the next step is to link or click a link and existing google sheet once you've got the google sheet located to click in it and select insert and now we just need to select the upload frequency so here i normally set this to every 24 hours but you can change it to weekly every monday if you want to all the time i normally set this to midnight but again you can set it to whatever you want here once that's done you can click save and preview okay and now you can see that the schedule has been saved now there are errors being thrown here because the google click ids are not formatted correctly they were just test google click ids so that makes sense but this should now be working as intended so now every time at midnight google will try and upload the offline version tracking spreadsheet here you can also pause this if you want to or edit the schedule settings or even remove it if you need to but i would just leave it as is if you intend to use the actual google sheet going forward and yeah that basically completes the whole offline version tracking process so just to give you an idea of what this looks like in an actual account here is an account that uploads multiple google sheets actually and then one of them is the google click id sheet that we just went through so you can see you'll get some errors and you'll get some successful imports this is completely normal don't worry too much about the errors but you can click on each google sheet upload to get a bit more info and this is what that looks like so you can see here we've got the google click id the conversion name that was being uploaded and then some other information here and on the status column here on the right hand side you can see it will tell you if some of these google click ids being uploaded are too old or if some of them have been successful so these ones that say the clicker is too old that's because the conversion time or sorry the google click id that it's referencing is actually greater than 90 days old so yeah if you ever want to do a bit of diagnosis into your uploads then you can always click on whichever one gets uploaded so you click on these messages here to get a little bit of extra info so yeah that is the end of the video you should now hopefully have a good understanding of how offline conversion tracking works what google click ids are and why they're important in the whole offline conversion tracking system you should now be able to set up zp automation yourself with the two google sheet templates and yeah another reminder is that this is just one way to set up offline conversion tracking there is no one size fits all solution there are very set ups needed for different clients depending on their business but this is a very simple way to kind of get started and yeah if you watched till the end of the video thank you very much for watching and i'll see you guys in another video in the future cheers whoo that was a
