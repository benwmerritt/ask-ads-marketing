Hi guys, I'm Ed Leake, managing director of Midas Media, we're a UK based digital marketing agency here to talk about Google deleting the right side ads on their search result pages. Yeah that's me, should have been smiling in the photo never mind. So what's happened? Don't panic. Right Rail as it's known, the adverts on the right hand side have been removed as of mid-feb of this year. So Google's standpoint on this was they actually came from a position of improving usability for their customers, i.e. you and I and everyone else who uses search engines such as theirs. So their position of usability doesn't really wash with me entirely. Yes it's now replicating and mimicking a mobile search result. However let's face it, AdWords is Google's biggest single point of revenue. So anything they do in this space and any changes they make to AdWords is for one one key reason and that's their revenue, their bottom line and of course excuse me, their advertisers sort of come in at a second pace because they know for a fact that whilst people are using search engines and searching they will have an ad platform and people will spend money to advertise, particularly the big boys. So as I've just said no text ads on the right hand side anymore. Google will now serve four ads at the top as you can see in the example there. So there used to be three ads at the top and a rail to the right of five ads but now we've got four at the top in place of three and three at the bottom. So we've gone from 11 ads top right and bottom in total to now a maximum of seven which is a considerable reduction of course. The right hand side still allows and still will display product listing ads essentially Google shopping and some select knowledge panel ads which are those information type panels on the right hand side. You may see when you search your favourite film star album etc. Okay why don't you think Google have done that now Ed? PPC is mega hot space. PPC is competitive, it's where the money's at, Google Bing, lots of other people, they understand that people want to spend on paid search because search intent is one of the strongest drivers for sales particularly in e-commerce. So Google's also facing fierce competition from many many rivals and as I said AdWords is their single biggest revenue stream so they're out to protect it. Let's not mince words. So another positive for Google is of course less competition of their own ads i.e. the top versus the right so the usability issue less choice less confusion just keeping the ads top bottom by increasing the ad space at the top by a third having four instead of three ads they push organic results down that increases click-through rate for paid ads and therefore more clicks equals more spend equals more revenue to Google brilliant. I think a couple key reasons why they've done this so Microsoft you might be wondering why Microsoft's in that list thinking well Bing's a bit sort of an also-ran. Think about Windows 10 clever move so Microsoft are have been pushing and still are pushing Windows 10 free of charge as a free upgrade. What happens with Windows 10? Default browser, Internet Explorer, Default search engine for Internet Explorer Bing. What does that do to Google? Reduces its share of the market. Very clever from Microsoft wise move it's essentially bringing them further into play. Okay a few percentage points here and there may not seem massive but in this market we're talking billions in revenue and of course Facebook a thorn in the side of well let's face it many companies but particularly Google because Facebook is behavioural based clever algorithmic based advertising but it's super super potent hugely detailed and targetable but more importantly than anything there's over a billion people on Facebook massive audience massive power in terms of advertising and I'm pretty confident that they're pissing Google off. And then there's the also sort of tertiary market as you could call it it's sort of the content and ad delivery network such as you may have seen them outbrain and tabula and so on and so forth so they cut into Google's display network again bit of a pain for Google and yeah not ideal. So looking on the bright side people say bad news first but let's go for the good news and then we'll tackle the bad news. So good news Google's revenue is going to increase off the back of this good news for who not you and I. No mind PLAs and shopping ads they're going to get fresh they're going to get revitalised by this there's less competition on the right hand side now so essentially Google have made the ads shopping ads a bigger problem more productive more effective because there's less decisions to be made at the top there. So top spots of course pushing down organic removing the right hand side you're going to see one thing at the top and that's ads so there's going to be a high click through rate which is a win you know if you're an advertiser in the top one two three maybe fourth position you're going to get more clicks now. And sorry SEOers out there and organic search in general you're getting pushed further and further off the page it's inevitable it was always coming it's only going to get worse. Okay so now the bad news and a lot of people in the industry would disagree with what I'm about to say but I believe there's going to be more pressure on bids for the single reason that as people slowly react to these changes bids will go up so if you would if you strip out over half the advertising positions on the right hand side and you replace it with one then you've got the same number of people trying to compete for less space. Yes you could argue that the right hand side got a lot less clicks than top three spots so it's sort of like a 90 versus 10% rule in that top spots got 90% of the clicks and right hand side got 10% maybe 15 20 at a push so actually by Google adding an extra third to the top then you know it sort of balances it out but I just can't see it I think over time we're going to see pressure it may be five ten percent in bids but the end of the day if you're using AdWords on a low margin product you may feel the pinch and I think particularly smaller advertisers who can't raise their fourth position in you know sorry the traditional fourth positions down the right hand side and beyond if they can't raise now into the new top they're just going to get pushed out their budget's going to going to fail them so you can combat this of course you can be more selective in what you advertise and just go for your your high margin or your your top sellers or if you're a service business just literally focus on the keywords that have brought conversions and forget everything else but that's not really you know not going to be ideal for everyone. The other losers and no disrespect but they're always losers people who just don't manage and optimize their accounts you know pay-per-click is not cheap if you don't optimize you are literally throwing away hundreds thousands tens of thousands of pounds it's you know stupid and this this is an interesting one but people who should I say businesses who rely heavily or only on ad words and why do I say that's bad news for them well this is from a business strategy position um google is in charge they've got the rules any ad platform that you use they write the rule book so if you're only using one you know one strategy one channel for marketing you are at their whim if they change anything it changes your business model overnight so we need to look at tackling that if you're one of these people that's got maybe one two at a push marketing channels then I'm going to be producing a few videos to show you how to tackle that and fix that because that's a dodgy position it's a bit I would be worried so don't do it let's fix it anyway subscribe blah we'll sort that out so how do we fix this how do we combat this situation it's pretty straightforward to say but it's probably more complex to to apply however ad preview and diagnosis so you're probably thinking how does that fix my situation what I mean by this is um you need to be looking and trawling through your ads and making sure that your ads are a in the top three four spots I mean I personally would try and bid three upwards not four I think four is going to be the the new sort of dead zone and you're too close to dropping off to the bottom and quite frankly whoever clicks on the bottom two or three ads no no hands going up so you know looking at your ads now seeing where they where they serve and you need to make sure that all the ad extensions you can use are now being used to things like site links callouts review extensions so on and so forth they essentially extend the the shape and form and size of your ad and if your competitors aren't doing it they will do eventually they make your ad bigger essentially so you need to be doing that you need to be previewing your ads making sure you're you're up there and you're peering and looking good strong got all your your ad extensions running bril attract those clicks that will mean that you don't just have to pay more because one tactic we collectively as advertisers don't want to see is everyone paying more money that only helps one person and sorry one entity and that is google it doesn't help us all if we're all just bidding up to the nines just to get to the top so instead of bidding up improve the one overarching factor that reduces your bids and that's your quality score essentially relevance of the advert to the search term trigger in the ad and to the landing page thereafter so i'm going to do a video on essentially hacking quality score it has a bit of a sort of trendy word hacking isn't it but yeah anyway i'm going to do a video after this about how to get the most out of quality score and essentially how to drive down your cost per click and essentially get rid of all the crap in your account so finally we've got consider other networks as i said on the previous slide if you're relying on google alone um or should i say google search then you need to test some budget elsewhere and the tactic i use with our clients is essentially you slice off a little bit of budget so if you're spending five around a month ten twenty hundred million whatever it may be um just take a sliver you know one to five percent or maybe more obviously it boils down to your current return on investment from google ads and margins etc how much can you afford to test elsewhere so i'd say as a minimum you want to be testing a percent or two and just use it for exploration and don't think it's going to be an immediate win but you're going out here to test on other platforms to make sure that you can actually do business and your your business scales across all the platforms that aren't just ad words because the next time they change the rules it could really screw you so there are loads of platforms out there facebook massive obvious choice uh facebook now integrates their ad platform with instagram and to be honest the the behavioral information and demographic information facebook has on us all is is quite stunning from an advertiser's perspective you can get so granular and place your ads so precisely that facebook's really potent if you do it well um i might do a few videos on that pinterest again it depends on the context of your business but uh you know an interior design company or uh a lot of retailers can do well on pinterest twitter i'd say arguably is better for b2b in terms of lead gen campaigns because they have essentially lead capture card ads it's not i wouldn't say is cost effective as facebook the audience is 20 of the size the targeting is not as rich and as as um useful but it's still worth a punt i haven't actually put linkedin on here which i've just realized um the reason being uh b2c linkedin uh not not easy b2b linkedin decent but my god linkedin expensive christ what you know the the cost per clicks is astronomical when we've done some tests so we actually get better results in terms of um return on investment from facebook and other other platforms yes linkedin converts quite well but in terms of overall cost it's kind of a red herring so you see these decent conversion numbers but then when you realize what you've paid for them uh i don't know i i'm on the fence with linkedin and i hate to be on the fence of anything i like to be you know taking an opinion of a position we need to do more on it anyway i'm rabbiting on there's loads and loads out there display networks um including google's display network of course because it is a separate beast to to search so use it as a separate thing treat it as a separate thing um bing yahoo as i said previously windows 10 the adoption is is going relatively well more people are using bing than ever brilliant so that only helps as advertisers because bing's more cost effective okay the the the search market for them is you know 10 15 percent of what google has but it's still uh it's a decent chunk but um you know there are people making living off of bing don't get me wrong but i wouldn't use it just on its own if it was a a toss up between abwards and being i know which one i'd go for uh and it's the g variety so these ad exchanges as well which i took touched on earlier and content exchanges um outbrains probably the the most well known and cost effective taboo is a bit more expensive but they have better targeting uh anyway i'm not going to go into too much detail because that's a whole new ball game another type of display that doesn't use a network per se is you know direct ad placement on your your target um target market website so thinking about where your your customers hang out online what they read what they look at what what they what they what are they interested in can you get an ad on that website uh be it through google display another display uh network or directly to the to the website itself and then the the list goes on and on for pay per click and pay that's what i'm going to do is um as i said i'm going to do a video very soon on how we tackle the right hand right hand side issue which will sort of focus on quality score mainly um because that's the quickest win drive down your costs so keep an eye out for that please subscribe this is a brand new channel my first video so you're probably looking at it going uh um but i hope i've said a few useful things and i'm sure i can only become more useful with time as i improve because this is my first video anyway please put a few comments in there ask any questions i am going to be actively answering them tweet me at edleek i'm super active on twitter you know just reach out to me i'd appreciate it even just to say ed your video was sh** i didn't like it um that's fine constructive criticism always welcome and also you can hit me up on uh did i just say hit me up oh dear um you can connect with me on linkedin and uh discuss your problems questions you know what do you want me to talk about i'm going to be doing stuff on as i said hacking quality score using the lingo and remarketing behavioral remarketing advanced remarketing tactics for e-commerce business owners and lots and lots of other juicy things so until then if you found this video useful uh i'd really appreciate it if you shared it thank you very much and until the next time thanks for watching stay tuned cheers
