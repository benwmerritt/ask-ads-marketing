Hi guys, Ed Leake here. So yesterday Google's Performance Summit put out a live stream which highlighted innovations and new new ad technology coming to the Google platforms and they also confirmed the shift to mobile has happened. So mobile search and mobile website traffic as a whole globally has now eclipsed desktop traffic. That actually happened at the end of last year in 2015. They also confirmed that there's over two trillion searches per year on Google which is colossal. The equivalent of about four million or nearly four million searches every minute of the day. Crazy numbers, absolutely crazy. So also confirmation that Google certainly still has a very large search audience, a very big customer base for you and I as advertisers and business owners. In this video I want to cover the key takeaways from the summit because there's some really juicy information in there that's going to help business owners, advertisers and marketers going forwards into this year, well the rest of this year, we're already halfway there. But into end of 2016 and 2017 starting with tablet bidding is back. This is brilliant news. So if you're an AdWords advertiser at the minute you'll or you should know that you can only adjust bids on your desktop and mobile devices so you can bid up or bid down. Now if you look at your your ad performance and your analytics you will see that tablet devices are typically a good portion of your traffic and therefore your budget, you know your budget spend on your AdWords. So the ability to now bid up and bid down is critical, really important and gives us more flexibility as advertisers. Next on the list is another kick in the gonads for SEO. If you watch my Google deletes the right side video sort of five six weeks ago I mentioned that you know SEO is getting a bit of a slap. Well this is yet another one so what's happening here is Google's rolling out a new ad format which will have a longer headline and a longer description. Essentially making the advert bigger and pushing down the organic results on the page. So Google's been trialling these ads and they've seen across the board about a 20% uplift in click-through rate which is it's considerable. If you believe the stats of SEO versus PPC in terms of click-through rates most people suggest that organic gets the the lion's share which I do not believe particularly on mobile and this 20% boost in click-through for me and for a lot of our accounts would suggest that actually now on a mobile device paid ads will get the lion's share so it's going to swing further in favour of paid which is which is what Google wants. And here's a really interesting thing again mentioned in my Google deletes right side ads video Facebook. So Facebook's ad platform is very good, it's powerful, it's got great audience targeting which is very important to get your message in front of the right people. So Google's now rolling out similar audiences plus demographic targeting on the search network. So this is in direct response to Facebook's bit of a stranglehold on the demographic marketing facilities and the similar the lookalike audiences that Facebook has because they're both really powerful. So this is great news for business owners and marketers because it means we get more options more targeting. You know we can use Facebook we can use AdWords now in a similar vein so that's great that's good for us bit of com healthy competition between big G and big F. Is that right? Yeah big F. That's good that's good for us. So another really juicy addition is responsive mobile display ads. Now whether or not you're currently on the display network or not you need to prepare for these ads because essentially what these are are dynamically generated adverts that are in line on a display network website. So apart the website you don't have to do any design work you don't have to do any creative work. This is literally providing the information and Google's platform will now dynamically generate the advert to suit the website that it's on and its surroundings. Hence the term native so it looks like it's part of the website. I can see these being really powerful really simple to implement and if you get your targeting right in the context of the website to your you know suit your audience so your placement is on a website that's in context. I can see these performing particularly well and of course these are a counterattack to Facebook because Facebook is a native advertising platform. And another interesting one is that Google's bastardizing its maps because it's been playing and testing with ads on maps for all crikey years now. They've confirmed we're in a mobile first world and of course maps are a pretty central and crucial to the mobile device. I'm sure you've used a map on your mobile to find things to find a place a shop or whatever. So yeah these promoted pinned ads on maps are going to be really potent for particularly bigger retailers admittedly but still you know the search intent when someone's in a location is really strong. So these ads are going to be potent for most people even smaller businesses where it's going to be particularly powerful is if you've got your inventory on Google and you've got local inventories per bricks and mortar store. So you can if someone's searching for a specific product and they're in the locale of that store you can put an ad on the map to sue. You can even invite them in with a discount you know on the spot discount or look at the trends and patterns of your of your existing buyers and their habits and you might find an upsell or a cross-sell opportunity reflected in that product that search. And not an additional functional feature but AdWords is over 15 years old my goodness how time flies. So over the coming 12 to 18 months Google are releasing a redesign. Thankfully this won't affect any functionality because they're adding enough stuff as it is. So this is just a lick of paint this is going to improve the usability. If you're familiar with the AdWords and analytics app for your Android or iOS device which are pretty slick and easy to use and they give you the top level metrics to hand. I think the desktop platform from what I've been shown privately is definitely going in that direction. It gives you snapshots and overviews of digestible information. I think it's the right thing to do. It's looking good from what I've seen. They're going to be rolling out a beta to random advertisers of all shapes and sizes so you know don't you can't plead for access but you may be given access. So I think that's quite interesting. It's certainly long overdue. Right so plan your attack. These changes are coming over the next few months the next two quarters and the interface change in a year or so but that's that's going to have less impact on your immediate performance. What you need to take away from this and understand is that we very much are in a mobile first world so your your website has to be shit hot on a mobile device and to be fair a tablet as well. So if you've got budget for design and development you want to be putting it into your your mobile assets and your mobile offering making sure that your your mobile conversion rates are approaching or in line with desktop. It can be difficult in some industries but you know you got to get on top of that. Also prepare for the tablet bid adjustments which are coming in the next few months. You want to be looking at your historic trends you know traffic and conversion rates for tablet devices and just get ready to to either bid up or bid down. So you take your five ten percent top performers in your your campaigns you know your ad groups your keywords and it's as simple as that really put money in what works and take money away from from what doesn't. If you're not on the display network this will be the time to jump on the bandwagon with the responsive display ads. So you know it's not a heck of a lot of prep you can do for this but again put put something to paper document mini strategy of where you want to place your ads what's going to be in them and just get ready to to be able to place your dynamic content natively on like-minded websites because even testing a little bit of your budget maybe five or ten percent here would be a very wise thing to do. I can see these native responsive ads going particularly well especially in the e-commerce industry. And that's about it really so lots of interesting features coming. I think it's very positive for the Google ad platform in my humble opinion. Lots of features that I'm keen to see and get using. I'd also be keen to hear what you think is there anything you can see there that's positive negative how are you going to implement it. And of course if you've got any any questions about tactics and strategies for this please do let me know. And until the next time thanks for watching and I'll catch you soon. Cheers.
