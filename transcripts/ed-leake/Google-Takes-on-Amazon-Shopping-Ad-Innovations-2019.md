## Transcript
Hello, I'm Ed Leake and I am doing a commentary and review sort of of the Google Marketing Live 2019 Summit and this is video 6 of the set so far so if you haven't seen the others do pop back but that's it quick intro let's jump straight in. Thank you Nikki and good morning everybody here. We at Google and with shopping local and travel in particular want to create useful experiences for our users and more opportunities for all of you to connect with them. Every day hundreds of millions do shopping related searches on Google. They watch videos of users unboxing and reviewing products on YouTube, they look for outfit ideas on Google images and they find the nearest pet store with Google Maps and our mission is to help them find the best products wherever they are on Google by making all of these properties shoppable and that way retailers like you can connect with these users throughout their entire shopping journey. If you watch unboxing videos I'm curious just to comment below and tell me why. I'm intrigued I don't it's not I'm just intrigued unboxing videos I don't I don't I know they're massively popular. I guess it's psychology of well if I can't have it or can't afford it I'd like to see it anyway maybe and I don't know I don't know or new things in drawing it's a shiny new thing I want to see it but yeah I'd be interested in it. We want to help users decide what to buy and where to buy it and today announcing a new Google shopping experience on Google. Let me guess buy in the search. Com slash shopping. Users can compare and discover millions of products from thousands of stores all in one place and when they're ready to buy they can choose to purchase either online or in a nearby local store and coming soon purchase directly from retailers on Google. Which sounds amazing and it is but this is this harks back to probably three videos earlier where I said Google is all about insulating protecting its platform its product its thing keeping users on Google not going to your property which is your website app and so on and so forth. Yes they are creating as we saw two videos back the deep linking app ads which look great but Google's delivering so much now on Google and that's only going to become more and more thing it's habit building it's like Google this that everything you know maps apps buy search email it's quite daunting. Let me show you what I mean it starts with a new Google shopping homepage on that page I get personalized recommendations they are based on my past purchases my shopping list and recently viewed items so for me this typically shows a whole bunch of hair products but as you can see I'm also currently in the market for a number of travel accessories and of course I can still search. I think that was a joke I said this at the end of the other video this audience is pin quiet. Let's say on top of these accessories I also need a new pair of wireless noise cancelling headphones so I'd search for that I can filter based on features for example or brands I prefer in my case that's wireless and both. So it's Amazon so this is you know this is to compete with Amazon isn't it let's face it bring all the bring the marketplace onto Google i.e. all the retailers yeah and on the new product page I will have all the information that I need to make a decision including reading product reviews or watching videos of people unboxing and using the item and then when I've decided which item to buy I can choose the buying option that works best for me. Just clicking through it to a retailer's website or going to a nearby local store that has the item available and now I can also purchase it directly from a retailer on Google. This shopping cart icon tells me that I can shop worry free with simple returns and a fantastic customer service and all of that transaction is backed up by a Google guarantee. So it's a Google product. It's particularly simple and easy to because it uses the shipping and payment information that is already stored in my Google profile. And with this new experience we're merging the best of Google Express with Google shopping. You can use this in France already today and we're rolling this out in the US in the coming months. It's scary how powerful Google has become. I'm not suggesting boycott them. Christ I'll be out of a job. I mean it's what I do. Excuse me. I run an ad agency. I build ad products but yeah I mean this is sort of like and that shopping. Thank you. There's a narcissist clapping in the audience. The only reason I'm saying is because in I think it was video to where we've got where if you're looking for a hotel or whatever now all the aggregation is done on Google. Essentially Google's aggregating everything. So it's taking on Amazon and more is taking on all the aggregators as well. And it will just become an aggregator of the data. And you can do everything. You know. Use Google Pay for example. Wait until you hear this. This shopping cart functionality will actually extend beyond Google shopping. The bringing. So he's cheered up now because he's had some response from the audience. Don't blame him. To Google's largest properties. The assistant. This is in parts life already today with more functionality coming. Users can buy using their voice or the touch screen. Interaction with that device. And in Google search where users will be able to purchase directly in search when it's relevant to that query. And Google images where users can find entire outfit ideas and then directly purchase. Let's say these awesome shoes. And finally and I'm really excited about this one on YouTube. Users can buy the products shown in the video that currently watching while the video continues playing. All of this will come later this year. That's good. Excited about. And you are. So if you want to sell your products on the surfaces what you need to do is sign up for our shopping actions program. Thousands of retailers have done this already and are participating in this program. And they're also going to be doing a video. And if you're one of them you can appear on all of these surfaces as we wrote them out. And that brings me to my second shopping announcement for today. We want to help users when they're looking. Just before he talks about this. So obviously there are shopping ads on YouTube already. So this is essentially a one click checkout whilst you're watching the video. You don't even leave the video like you would now with the shopping feeds on on the YouTube videos. So yeah that's mega. It's just it just gives people that snap decision you know purchase. Yeah crazy. I can see this working very well for you know sub hundred dollar sub hundred pound purchases. Scary more debt people are going to rack up. Sorry. That's cynical. And we all know shopping very often is a very visual experience. Images and videos inspire users to purchase. And exactly because of that last year we introduced showcase shopping ads. It's a more visual heavy ad format that helps you reach users when those users are looking for inspiration and for ideas. And if you haven't seen a couple of videos back there's now gallery ads which are sort of. I don't know an evolution of these ads. A gallery ad is literally like the Facebook carousel ads full full screen on a mobile swipe swipe swipe. So yeah check that other video out that I've narrated sort of a like I say revolution or evolution of this. And we see users engaging with these ads very well and we also hear very positive feedback from our advertisers. In fact let me share the statistic with you over 80 percent of the traffic from showcase shopping ads to retailer sites are new visitors. And building on that success very happy to announce that extending showcase shopping ads to even more places of inspiration on Google. Specifically showcase shopping ads will launch in the coming months on Google images YouTube and discover on Google search. If you're interested you can use showcase shopping ads today. And now my third shopping announcement. This is targeted at brands and their retail partners and we call it shopping campaigns with partners. Both brands and retailers have always had close marketing partnership. Again there's a certain things in this talk that sort of mimic slightly mimic Facebook or lend from Facebook's ideas and it happens both ways of course. But you know Facebook has a partner advertising partner promotion system too. And as users have moved online both have been looking for ways to strengthen and build on that collaboration and shopping campaigns with partners is doing just that retailers on their site now have the option to accept additional budgets which are coming from their brand partners in Google ads. And brand partners on their site can select which of their products or product categories they want to promote with that additional budget. The Estee Lauder companies worked with one of their retail partners to promote the design of frequencies and shopping campaigns with partners help them increase both the online as well as the in store conversions and increase the awareness of the product. In fact this is a good start. They click share on Google increased by 70 percent which is a phenomenal result. If you're excited you can join the beta program. Is this so is this an anti Amazon play because again thinking from my own experience of some brands we work with. You know this is obviously retail so just thinking about retail brand right now that has multiple big brands on there and some of their headaches some of the issues that they have is they do compete with Amazon. Unfortunately those brands can also be found on Amazon and there's always this back and forwards with the brand and the you know the supplier to say well how do we compete with Amazon to sell your product. And the brand will either give them a discount to compete with Amazon which seems I don't know. Or they don't. Google is essentially giving brands a back door here to say here's a top up I want you to push this new product line because why. You know they could stick it on Amazon couldn't they but Google is giving them a literally a link an account level link to pump budget into your business if you're retail and you're selling that brand so I think that's quite. I think that's a good idea I think it's nifty I think it's interesting be interested to see how the measurement looks and how it looks in terms of the campaign reporting. Be very interested to see that but yeah I think this is a sort of a car anti Amazon play which it has to be. Amazon's also another I mean this is giant fighting giant you got Facebook punching Google punching Amazon. Punching each other and yeah monsters so where's David. For shopping campaigns with partners today and with that let me turn over and talk about local we know that many users still prefer to visit a physical store whether that is to pick up some supplies or to try out that camping gear. Before buying it check if that six person ten really fits six people because when I bought barely fits for or to have another coffee and some snacks before heading out on that. Help you reach users as they're looking for businesses and you can try local actions like phone calls or store visits we've launched it in Google's largest properties including search YouTube maps and this. Now Duncan is an example of a brand that has adopted local campaigns they wanted to promote the new and then newly remodeled stores as well as promote some of their beverage options that they've recently introduced for example. And with local campaigns Duncan saw an over four. In monthly visits coming from Google ads they're very happy with those results and so are we and by the way it's not just Duncan we recently ran global studies with ten advertisers across many different. And our results show that local campaigns help those brands drive a median five acts incremental return on that spend from their in store sales. And with that success in mind happy to announce that we're expanding local campaigns inventory further. First we know users like to arrive at the store with some ideas about what they can find in the store. So soon you can use local campaigns to display specific product lines for example and help users explore your store before they're getting that second. When users look for places in maps they will soon start to see relevant promoted locations in their search suggestions. For example I'm a user previously did a query like for dog friendly parks or similar. See this is going to kill organic this is going to kill the little guy though. So I mean I don't even deal in organic but local search is the mainstay of cost effective and easy easier SEO for small businesses and local businesses. So ads are just going to start pushing pushing them off all these all the organic listings for these places and these businesses off off off. Essentially Google wants everyone to be spending money on some form of advertising. Then they might now see you're at for a nearby pet store in their search suggestions. And third we're rolling out promoted pins more broadly in maps today promoted pins only appear as users are searching in maps or as they're exploring an area in maps. Soon they will also see promoted pins when they're planning a route to destination or as they're navigating to a destination. That is really useful because that makes it easier for them to add an additional stop along their way to one of those. And last but definitely not least I'm very happy to announce that we're opening up local campaigns to all of you. Anyone can now take advantage of these launches and use local campaigns to optimize for local actions like store visits or phone calls. I mean this is literally peppering Google is peppering ad slots and add opportunities because a bit like Facebook they they've hit your wall. I don't know if they've hit but they're close to capacity. There's only so much they can serve so they've got to create more places to put all these ads. Yeah it's crazy amount of I can understand why this is going to require so much machine learning in the next few years because there's going to be three four times the amount of placements and search is just going to be a teeny spec on the ad spectrum on the Google ad spectrum. Not even considering Facebook LinkedIn Instagram Pinterest. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Thank you. Let me transition over to travel. As anyone who's ever booked a trip knows planning a trip is a very time consuming and very complex task. A trip is an experience that has many different parts. They all need to be decided. They need to be coordinated and booked. And to date, we help users with, for example, the flights, our hotel search and ads program or things to do information in search just to name a few. But trips are not planned in one sitting far from that. People turn to Google when they're planning a trip throughout the week for many, many weeks in a row searching for where to go, how to get there, where to stay and what to do. And we're now tying together our existing travel experiences into a single cohesive travel planning experience focused on helping our users with that trip planning. I think this is best shown to you with an example. I said it earlier. Google's aggregating everything. Everything is done on Google. That's there. That is what they want. Yeah. It's good timing because I still need to plan my annual family vacation. And I heard very good things from a colleague about Vancouver. She mentioned that Vancouver is excellent for whale watching. And I think this could be interesting for my kids, my wife and myself. So however, since we moved to the US from Europe, we've adopted to the local customs here. That means we're now only doing one big vacation a year and big is relative because based on my like original German standards, it's actually pretty short. Anyway, the key thing is we have to totally get it right. So on Google search, for example, I can start as usual or I can now go to Google.com slash travel on both places. I can research places to visit and explore potential trip ideas. So let's figure out if Vancouver is good for my two year old and my seven year old research for Vancouver and in the explore tab. I get a summary of Vancouver. I can go deeper in different directions. For example, I can gather ideas on things to do and I can even see sample day plans that have been created for me. I see other information as well. For example, when is the peak tourist season and how is the weather throughout the year? I'm browsing through that. Decide Vancouver is great. That's very promising. Next thing is typically I start to wonder how much does it cost to get there and spend the money. So if I switch over to flights, I see the Google flights results. That gives me an idea of how much it costs to fly there and how long it takes to get there. Looking at the results, I'm very happy because there's multiple affordable nonstop flights and I really, really don't like stopovers in particular when I travel with him. You have to handle it to Google. This is impressive. I mean, it's all impressive the momentum they've built in the search platform. It's no longer a search platform. Let's be honest. It's both impressive and scary and daunting for the future. I mean, we might as well all have a barcode stamp Google on the back of our heads soon if we're not careful. At this stage, I'm not really ready to purchase any of these flights, but I can track the flights using Google flight price tracking. And now Google will inform me when those prices move upwards or downwards. This is one of our most beloved features. Next, let's go over to the hotel tab and check out hotels and vacation rentals. If a particular place catches my eye, I can zoom deeper. I can look at lots of pictures supplied by both the hotel as well as users who stay there. And I can read reviews from very prominent sources from all around the web as well. And of course, I can compare the rates and availability from our hotel app partners and book directly with them. Let's say I do that, I have a hotel, but then I've run out of time and need to pick up the kids from school. Any time later, same evening, weeks later, I could go to search, look up Vancouver and continue planning from there, or I can return to google.com slash travel and pick it up where I've left it off. When I come back, I jump into my upcoming trip to Vancouver. I now see a weather forecast for the time that I will be in Vancouver and I see the trip timeline. Reservations, for example, for the hotel, as you can see, but also for flights, trains, buses, and so on. And restaurants, you see, my wife has booked a restaurant that also shows up here. They automatically added, thanks to the power of machine learning, from their email confirmation in Gmail to this timeline. And when they're gapped in my timeline, like that flight that I haven't booked yet, I see useful information, in this case, the flights that I'm tracking. I have saved many places also in Maps and in Search and they will show up here too. This unified experience is available already on mobile and starting today, right now, this is rolling out on desktop as well. And as you can see, our aim here is to help users connect the dots, organize their trip information better, and make trip planning easier. And collect their money at every single opportunity and charge everyone for the ad expenditure, for the clicks, for the impressions too. Clever. Power. And that creates more leads and more opportunities for you to connect with those users in their moment of intent. And, for example, user now, let's say going to Google flights, looking up for some flights, can more easily connect via the hotels tab with our hotel's partners in the same session for the same trip. And because this experience is more cohesive, it's focused on the entire trip planning, it helps users organize their information and pick up what is previously left off. This does not only generate more leads, but also more qualified leads for all of you. So we are very excited about these shopping, local and travel announcements, and I hope you're too. With that, thank you. Thank you. I want to introduce Chatna to the state. She will talk about how marketers can throw their business in a responsible way. Thank you. Yeah, so, I mean, that was quite a lot to take in, wasn't it? Incredible, really. I'm intrigued by the shopping on Google, the instant purchases, include, you know, in the search, on YouTube, those immediate instant purchases. The reason being, I mean, Google's essentially potentially enabling people to not have websites. Websites can be a pain in the backside. They can be expensive. They can be high maintenance. They can, you know, just, it's just another big thing, particularly for retailer to worry about. Are we going to see a point in the near future where retailers can exist, you know, smaller ones, perhaps purely on Google, just by running ads? Who knows? Probably. Well, yeah, so I'll see what's coming up next. But thank you for watching this video. I'm sort of a bit mixed views about this one, some really, really clever stuff, though. Let me hear your thoughts. Leave me a comment because I'd love to hear what you're thinking about these things. Are you in retail? Do some of these shopping features sound juicy to you? Yeah, hit the like, subscribe if you so wish, and I'll see you on the next video. Thank you for your time.
