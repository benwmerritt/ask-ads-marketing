Hi, my name is Victoria. I run a Google Ads agency in the UK called Smeaketing and I'm a member of Forge. Before signing up to Forge, my main concern was probably relating to the value I'd get from Forge and whether it was worth the ongoing investment in Joiling. But I can say that absolutely it's worth it in terms of what I get back and how it's helped me grow my agency. I've definitely seen an ROI and it's one of those situations that the more you invest in terms of your time, the more you'll get back from it as well. So I'm thoroughly enjoying being a member of Forge and will continue to be a member of Forge for as long as it's relevant to me. The main thing I get from being a member of Forge is really the guidance in terms of growing your agency, the confidence to implement price changes and operational changes, things relating to staffing. That can be sometimes be quite daunting when you're running an agency and also running an agency by yourself can be quite a lonely prospect. But within Forge, there's so many community members who are doing the same thing as you. It's a really great community and one of the things that I think sets it apart from others is the quality of the other Forge members. So everyone in there is really driven. They're building their own agencies. They're working really hard. But at the same time, there's a real supportive network there of people who are wanting you to build your business and build your agency just as well as they're building theirs. So the advice that you get from others in the Forge community is brilliant. It's a really well-rounded community, people across the world. And no matter what your issue is, whether it relates to operations or sales or a particular problem within Google Ads for a client, there'll be someone there who can help you and give you really great, excellent support, whether it's Ed or another community member.
