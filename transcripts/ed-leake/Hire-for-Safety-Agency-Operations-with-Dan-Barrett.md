It meant that the more that we grew, like we hit a million dollars or whatever, I was paying significantly above market rate for my managers. But I didn't care because what I was optimizing for was safety. Let's roll back those that decade. You're first hire, who or what would it be if you had your time again? Who would you hire? So you could you can do the out to call you. I can do it. Yeah, I still actively manage every now and then I coach people in our niche, right? How to do that kind of stuff. So I'm still actively involved. Who would be my first hire? You know what? Let me rephrase the question. I'm going to do a two-parter. What would be the trigger to hiring and secondly, what role would you hire for? Yeah, okay. That's a really good question. So in real life, what happened was the reason I first hired and I hired a PPC manager, another manager was because I got to maybe like 14 clients and I basically stopped doing the work on anybody that wasn't complaining. At the time, I didn't really realize that was happening. And I had half of my clients leave on the same day. Oh, right. Yes, bad timing. Right. It's not like they got together, but they all left on the same day. This was immediately following the birth of my first son. And the reason I remember this was, I went a couple of weeks after that, I got a bill from the hospital for his birth and we didn't have enough money to pay. I remember that moment like so vividly, right? But, you know, it was such an emotionally resonant moment, right? And that was my, I realized then that like, I had not been able to keep up the quality of the work. And ultimately, so what I look for is quality of work and quality of life. One, if we cannot keep up to our standards, that's a trigger for me. And two, if I have people working late, working weekends, missing kids, soccer games or whatever, I will not allow that. Right. So that, that's for me. Right. So I think it depends a little bit. If I was maximizing again, maximizing for revenue above all else, I would go longer without hiring because hiring can be expensive. Early on, the way that I did it was I paid per client. And so as my client base grew, their revenue, their income grew, right? And then as if it shrank and shrank, so I wasn't on the hook for a salary. And I did that for many, many years, probably much longer than I showed up. And that was worse for a margin. It meant that the more that we grew, like we hit a million dollars or whatever, I was paying significantly above market rate for my managers. But I didn't care because what I was optimizing for was safety. So in any case, so, so I think it depends a little bit on what you're optimizing for. Right. But I look at quality of life, quality of work as if your quality of life goes down too far, you are not going to manage the clients. Well, if the quality of work starts to decline, they're not going to stay. And so that, that's really what I look for. Now for me personally, because I was managing everyone, I, hiring another manager was critical for me because it allowed me to start marketing the business. Do you mean a PPC manager or do you mean a person manager? Oh, no, like a PPC manager. So I hired another person to do ad management work that allowed me to spend time in the acquisition of leads and clients, which at the time I wasn't doing in a kind of systematic way or whatever. So, you know, to me, that was the big decision. If I had to do it over, that's probably what I would do again. But I think it's also individual a little bit, depends a little bit on what your skill set is. I liked being on camera. I liked being the face of the business. It doesn't have to be that way at all. Right. You could have hired a manager or a marketer rather to get your leads and just be like, I'll manage all the clients. If that's what I had wanted to do, I maybe would have done that. But yeah. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah. And it comes down to cash flow as well, because some people can't easily afford, even with 14 clients, if they're not charging enough, they might be like, well, I've got to take a big pay cut. But what does that open up? And I think to answer my own question, the mistake I made was my first hire was, and he was a lovely chap, but he was a junior. So I had to teach him. And I already had a full-time job. The whole reason I hired him was to give him some workload. And he was straight out of university and inexpensive. But yeah. It's expensive on time. So if I had my time again, I would have, firstly, I wouldn't have gotten office either, because that was very costly. I know you're an office person, but you can always get an office in the future. The lower your overhead, the less clients you need to be okay. The lower your stress. Absolutely, right? You think about, okay, how many things need to go right in order for me to be okay? The fewer things that need to go right, the more certain you are that things are going to go right. The more pieces you add, the lower that number keeps going. The more complex things get, the more likely it is to break, the less likely things are to go your way. So it's like, the simpler you can keep things early on, the better. So the reason that I paid for clients, same idea. It's like, well, okay, if I lose clients, your rate goes down. That's not great for you. It's not great for me, but I'm not going out of business. So yeah, capping that downside risk is huge, especially early on.
