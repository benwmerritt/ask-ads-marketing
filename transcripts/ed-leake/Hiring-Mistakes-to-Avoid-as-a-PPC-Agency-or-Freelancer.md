What recommendations do you have for being able to quality control the staff and make sure you're getting the right people on board? They're potentially at that stage where they're going to be moving across to a bit more of an agency setup. So they're hiring people, either contractors or full-time or part-time staff. So look, hiring is difficult. I don't know anyone that gets it bang on. My hit rate is probably 50-50. I fire every other person I hire. So it's really difficult. And again, I have simplified operations, and this is what I teach in the forge, not to be boring, on two fronts. So internally, there's a thing called speed reports. And also I have an operations dashboard, which is separate, which actually combines, beg you pardon, the Google ads now. It didn't before. It used to be two separate things. It's a spreadsheet. It's nothing, you know, dashboard makes you sound fancy. Speed reports really straightforward. So when you're hiring, say you're a freelancer or a new agency and you're expanding and you take on a person. It might be someone part-time, full-time, might be a freelancer. The worst thing you can do is not trust them to do the job. If they're going to fuck up, let them fuck up. And I know that's hard. There's a hard pill to swallow because it's your client, your money, but that's just agency life. However, you can monitor that process without being micromanaged. So a speed report is really simple. It's literally traffic lights. Think of it as a Word document or a sheet or whatever. Two boxes, one red, one green. Like what's good, what's bad? And then a summary. That can be a Monday, a Wednesday and a Friday to start with, like just regular cadence updates or it can be once a week or twice a week. So you literally say to your new hire, you've got these five accounts to manage. I want a speed report every Monday and every Thursday. And it literally gives me bullets of what's good, what's bad, and a summary. Essentially what's bad, how are we going to fix it kind of situation? Just keep me on top. It's really quick for them to do. It's really quick for you to read. It just keeps the blood flowing through the business. The operations dashboard is you don't need it when you're super small, but that brings in Google ads KPIs. So again, spend health, the KPI, conversion KPI, and then other metrics like recent changes. So just a drop down of have we done negative keywords this week? Have we done new ad copy? Just really top level. I don't need to see the ad copy. I don't need to know what the negatives are. I just need to know that it's happened and then a date stamp to say when it happened. Has the client had a report? Like again, date stamp. Have we communicated with the client? Yes or no? If it's a yes, date stamp, like really top level stuff. Was the last communication with that client positive, neutral, or negative sentiment? You know, were they moaning? Were they asking questions or were they happy? Literally, it's a line in the spreadsheet and you can quickly review it to see have we done these things? Is it on target? Is the client happy? And that's an operations dashboard. And that will keep you sane. So you're essentially saying correct me if I'm wrong. When you're hiring someone, you're putting them on, you're giving them a dashboard or a spreadsheet of this is the ed leak way of I want you to optimize the accounts. And then they're just going through that process, making sure that everything is done. Not only Google ads sense, but also client relationship sense and the way that you want it to be done. Yeah. So this is where it gets nuanced because it depends on who you're hiring. If you're hiring someone experienced, I wouldn't tell them how to do their job, but you do need to tell them your process. So frequency of reports, what the client expects, how we talk to clients, what you expect, you know, top level stuff. If you're taking on someone who's more junior, then that's a much harder job because you have got to train them and you've got to make time to train them. You can't just give them God tier ads framework. There's a pitch. Sorry, Aaron. I know you've got your own thing. No, no, no. I'll put some information down below. We agreed on a 90% commission for me. Didn't we anyway? I think that was what we said. I'll beat it. Bait beans. Um, yeah, but you can't just give them your training or my training. It'll speed the process up. If they're green, they're new to this, then it's probably the worst hire. If you're just starting out is to hire someone who's new just because they're cheap. Cause you've got to spend so much at an ornament amount of time with them to get them up to speed. So that's a very different kettle of fish. And they would struggle with just having to do a speed report because they then haven't got all the back end to say, well, you need to, this is how you fix the problem. Cause they haven't got the experience to do it. So you've essentially dragged me down a different route here, but I would say in hindsight, cause I hired juniors to start with because I thought, oh, they're inexpensive. It was the wrong move. I should have saved my money and hired someone experienced because at that point, I could have split the agency. I could have had the sales and marketing me and then I could have had the operations, the senior hire, so the Google ad stuff and all the work is their responsibility generating leads and sales is my responsibility. And then all of a sudden you've set a foundation for a decent agency. Cause if I get my job right and they get their job right, we'll be hiring soon. And then that team on the ops side will, will expand. You can't do that. Yeah. And it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's always two that, you know, some of the cheapest alley rate or cheapest salary, it can become a lot more expensive. If it's, yeah, if you're not, if they're not the right person for what you need. And we should say, well, hold on a minute. How do people get a foot in the door? It's not what I'm saying. There are plenty of businesses out there that have got small teams to large teams that can accommodate a junior. If you're on your own, again, context here. If you're on your own, your first hire should not be a junior unless you're prepared to really, really hold their hand and train them up. So it's not about never working with juniors. As soon as you've got a senior and you get more accounts on, then you could hire a junior to go into the senior and their job, if they're happy with it, is to obviously hold the hand and drag them through the account.
