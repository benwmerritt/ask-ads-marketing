And they literally go to your website to check you out. Like, is he real? Does he do this? Is they are they're case studies? So. I felt like I should be able to take on more clients, but I also felt busy most of the time. And then then I got ill and we had a holiday with the kids home. It's one three. And we have a lot of stuff happening in the house. So I think I mean, it's probably one month of work on processes, which is which is which is OK. I think I think I have done some stuff. I sort of I'm a little bit more strategic in terms of when I'm doing Google ads. So instead of just doing lots of stuff, I'm more like thinking about, for instance, do I want to expand this account or do I want to improve performance? So it's more I'm more mindful of what is the goal actually. And I also created sort of processes and SOPs that support that. It's not perfect yet. And we can talk about that because I could probably spend half a year doing more of this still. But I laid out a plan and I put up the post with the Streamlight Mission. And I laid out a plan that this week I'm supposed to do website. And next week I'm supposed to do LinkedIn. So I'm going to stick to that goal. And then I'm just going to leave the processes, let them be. Because you can always make them better. And I think also I think they benefit from sort of maturing a bit or I mean not doing anything with them, trying them out a bit. And then with the added experience, I can sort of improve them as I go. I'm not really sure about because my expertise is Google ads and I want to be that's what I mainly want to do. But I think a lot of my clients appreciate that I also do a landing page so I can also do a little bit of Facebook. So at the moment, my website is a little bit more generic. Also the ad copy, but I'm not sure if I should make it more specialized towards sort of Google ads. A couple of things. So the processes, you're completely right. They'll never be perfect until they're perfect, which is maybe never. But yeah, I think we can over do some processes and checklists to the point where we don't ever use them because we're constantly trying to refine them. So do get to a version one and then put it to use and make notes against it to refine it. If you want feedback, we're a tight group. There's 100 members. You feel free to share these things openly if you want. I don't think anyone's going to steal and quite frankly, if they steal it. Well, that's a compliment to your work as the sun comes in to burn my face off. Secondly, the. Essentially the imposter syndrome. So you're scared about being the expert if you're not the expert. At the end of the day, you've got customers paying you money and you've been doing it for years and people have been paying you for years. It's good enough for me. Should be good enough for you. So if you do, if you take the blenders approach and you go into groups where you can be specific and more targeted instead of just posting on LinkedIn, that's probably a good approach. You know, if you're a bit more shy, you can use groups, Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups, where you can join into the conversation where you might be one of very few Google ads people. So you can be more confident there. And that's not to say, Blindie, that's why you did it. But that might bloody hell the sun. So I'm going to melt away in a minute. And so that might be an approach. If you know, if there's a confidence thing to build up some confidence, you can do it smaller in groups to start with. I don't think I'm mind. I don't think I'm mind doing it. I just think it's like it's like if you haven't exercised for five years and you've got to do it, it's like it's not going to feel nice. I think also just the very fact that I start, you know, posting or writing stuff down will actually give me more or make me more of an expert, you know, because it's there's a basic level of just you're just doing stuff, you know, checklist kind of way of managing Google ads. And then there's the sort of strategic where you actually, you know, as I said, mindful of why am I doing this, you know? And that saves you time and it gives the client more results. I'm not sure about the Facebook. I mean, it sounds really interesting with the Facebook groups. The ones I'm a part of in Denmark is is mainly of other, at least where there's a lot of other freelancers and agencies. They seem flooded with people selling stuff. So. Yeah, don't be scared of smaller groups that are a bit more niche and specific. Never. Yeah. Don't worry. Like even if there's only a thousand people or five hundred people in a group, if it's got posts in it and it's it's more niche and specific. Yeah, it's a way to go. It's Sam's done that approach as well. The other thing you said, your website. So. And I know you asked me a private message about the videos where I talk about websites, agency websites. If you're so. Don't let it hold you back too much. If if you're if you're not using your website as essentially a landing page or something that you're pushing through ads or whatever, if you're doing more of the sort of soft outreach or engagement stuff, then the website is less important because it's more about you and what you say. And they literally go to your website to check you out. Like, is he real? Does he do this? Is they are their case studies? So. If you're targeting specific niches, then obviously the website, it's more important the case studies talk to that. But otherwise, I'd say it's probably slightly lower on the priorities. Dedicated landing pages. Yes, if you're running ads or you're doing promos to people or you're doing freebies or offers. Yes. But the main website. We get. We can get really. Agency owners like an analysis paralysis over our own websites. So if you feel that way, I just skip it and carry on doing the engagement thing and working on LinkedIn and see how you get on there. It would be my take, to be honest with you. I mean, I think it's not like. I did a fair amount of work on it yesterday, but you have a point like. The way I'm doing it now is more of a landing page. Yeah. Like where as opposed to a classical agency, the site will be very generic. Like we do Facebook and Google ads and then testimonials and then whatever. You want a great offer. You mentioned you're very good at getting the quality of your leads for your clients up instead of the pure volume. And I completely agree with that. So maybe writing a case study, but packaging it up like a guide is the offer on your website, you know, talking about that specifically. So people opt opt in to downloading that because that's far more interesting than someone rocking up to your website and seeing that you do a free audit or free consultation or book a call. Give them something tangible and show them the process because they're not going to do it themselves. I've said this a million times and even if they do, they weren't your client. So I would probably lean into that bit that you're really good at and show it off. And say, stick your email in, I'll send you the good stuff and then just have a nice, gentle email follow up to say, you know, give me some feedback on it. Are you going to implement it? Can I help you implement it? You know, just the obvious things you would put it further down the side so you would have the top you would have. I mean, that could be your page. Your agency website could be literally we do X, Y and Z. Here's how download the process, the case study, whatever you want to call it, the blueprint, whatever, and then explain what it is and why it's important. And that could be your lead magnet, but that could be your agency's website, essentially. It's far more effective and valuable than trying to go in with a free, free audit or whatever.
