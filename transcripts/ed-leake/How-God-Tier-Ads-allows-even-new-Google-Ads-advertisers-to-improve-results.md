Hey, what's up guys? My name is Robbie Shelton and I, or my family owns an e-commerce business called Earrings by Emma. And about three years ago, we did Google ads and we've been, it's been month in and month out has made us money. But at the time that I did it, I kind of plateaued. And so I just said it and then forget it or forgot about it. So this is my attempt to try to, taking God to your dad's, is my attempt to try to revisit it and grow that sales channel for us. The thing that appealed to me when looking at different courses was that God to your ad seemed to be up to date. And like other things that I had looked at, they just seemed out of date, which was frustrating because you don't want to spend forever looking through a menu that doesn't exist anymore and trying to find something or maybe it's in a different spot or maybe it just doesn't even exist. Anyway, so far, so I'm like an intermediate level, probably more beginner level even because it's been so long since I've been in Google ads. And I will say so far it's been, and I'm just giving my honest review, it's been a little frustrating because I don't know, like it starts off like having you check out like where all your different tags are. And I have a Shopify store. So there's some integrated ways to install the tag on Shopify. And then there's also the Google tag manager, which seems very streamlined and nice to use, but it's like, do I have it in both or do I not? And so like trying to research those questions has been a little frustrating. But I do what I do like about the course so far, or the framework is what they call it, is that it is just a checklist. And he does link to the Google articles themselves for these like beginner steps in the beginning. And then I've been read through yesterday, I've only had the course for a week. I read through just ahead. And I really liked some of his PDF documents that really nerd out over different topics. And so it seems like I'm really getting a good thorough view and education as I read through these things. And then I also like, sorry about that. I also like that I have this like framework that I can revisit and make sure that like, like, like a tune up for your car, like you go in and there's like a checklist, you know, do they go through, you know, check the washer fluid, check this, check that. I liked that there is a tune ups kind of idea of a framework. They call it SOPs, which I think is standard operating procedures. Sorry. Again, I'm not I'm not a agency guy or a full time marketer. But anyway, I've liked all of that and learning it. And so I'm excited to hopefully get better and progress. So anyway, like the group, I can be able to go to the Facebook group. I can search questions. You know, you can ask questions of the group, but it's probably been asked before. So you can search that in Facebook, which I really like a lot. So yeah, I would say what sets it apart is that it's a it's a actionable program that lets you it's a checklist. And it's up to date. So I've really appreciated that too. So anyway, those are kind of my thoughts as I think out loud. Sorry to go long winded, but I hope that helps. And to me, I think it's been worth it so far. We'll see how it goes as I progress.
