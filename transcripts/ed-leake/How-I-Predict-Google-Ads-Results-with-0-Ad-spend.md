Now it's not a clickbait headline, this spreadsheet will genuinely help you predict your Google Ads future. So without further ado, let me jump over to the sheet. Let's assume that we've done our keyword research, we go to the input tab on this spreadsheet which I will share with you and we literally paste it in. So we paste the Google Ads keyword planner results and we use the historic, if we're using the forecast information, we use the historic download, we don't use any forecast stuff because another reason I use this spreadsheet or variations of is that the forecast information is not very good. So yeah, I don't use the Google forecast tool for the simple reason that you can't radius target within it. When you put live data into it, it doesn't agree with the live performance, I mean it can be miles off so I have for years used a projection spreadsheet like this one. So you paste all your keyword data in and then what we have here is you can change the currency but this is literally symbolic, excuse the pun, it doesn't convert anything, it just changes to your currency, to visual appeal to be honest with you. We can also include or exclude the top 10 most expensive keywords from the calculations. The reason you might want to do this is if you're in a really competitive marketplace and the expensive keywords have a lot of impressions and you can't currently or don't want to spend on them to start with. However, the keywords I'm using is for accounting software so as you can see it doesn't have a massive impact on the total impression share or the blended CPC, cost per click. So let's just leave them included. Again visual reference the top 10 expensive keywords are here and for your reference the top 10 cheapest and this is just guidance really with the cheapest, they are not calculated here outside of them being part of the total impression share. It's just for reference, gives you a few pointers. So this sheet is a bit different how most people deal with projections. Firstly, we have a scroll bar in 10% increments so right down at the bottom 10% of impression share. So I target impression share essentially what is available in the market, what's the size of the search market that I have and this is 150,000, 5000 impressions. So that's how we dictate what we can potentially spend. You'll also notice that the blended CPC when you're in the bottom sort of 10-20% is reduced and reason being that's to simulate where you're going after a tiny portion of the market you can be really aggressive with your bids i.e. bid really low and very specific where you're targeting because you aren't forced to go after the whole market. So that just simulates being selective and then conversely when you start getting to 70, 80, 90 and even 100% of impression share the bid simulation does go up because the reality is when you have to be there to capture the impressions that people searching you will have to pay for them. So let's drop down to about 60% of the market which is let's say our sweet spot for the purpose of this example. Then the only bits that you change are the green bits. So your conversion rate, you click through rates and remarketing spend again something I never see on forecast and calculations or very rarely put in some money for remarketing and this is for search so you're remarketing spend on search. Conversion rate if you're starting from scratch 2% is okay but it really does depend you could be selling a really high ticket item and your conversion rate is half a percent because the item is worth 100 grand. You might be selling t-shirts and therefore your conversion rates 10% because they're cheap and they shoot out the door. That is difficult to guess quite frankly. If you're unsure I mean by all means ask and I might have experience of the industry that you're in and can give you a guide but it would be very much a guide. Same with click through rate 2% is low. It depends on the industry but 2% is low. Let's say 5% is a reasonable click through rate but again some accounts that I have are 10% 15% 20% so it can fluctuate. Another thing with conversion rate actually if you've got organic traffic use the organic traffic conversion rate as your benchmark that will tell you roughly where pay per click should be. To be honest a good pay per click campaign will beat organic but low ball it so if you're organic for the past 6 months is 2% put 2% in there. Another thing that I'm different than a lot of people with is that here I've split the performance into month 1 and month 3 and you might be wondering why. Well brand new keywords, brand new campaigns, brand new ad accounts perform very differently. Month 3 you know 90 days in is about the sweet spot than they do at the first month. So month 1 is your discovery month that you're understanding month, it's your data gathering month. Essentially you're paying for the data and yes you may get conversions you might do perfectly fine but month 3 you're going to be better. You're going to optimize and improve, you click through rate is going to go up and so is your conversion rate. If you're doing things right and of course the business at the end of things is doing things right. I haven't included month 2 because that's the wiggle in the middle. So month 3 click through rate goes up, conversion rate goes up and that impacts the spend so if we were going to capture the same amount of impressions it would push the spend up but the whole point of this is to work out below if it makes financial sense for the business anyway and you might be asking well why haven't you bumped the CPC or reduced the CPC because surely if you optimize your CPC goes down. Not true. One thing I've seen over the past 10 years actually it can be the opposite. So the more confidence you build in the data and the performance and the keywords often means you'll spend more, you'll bid more because you're converting better and more and also you'll find that a lot of the more commercial intent biased keywords are more expensive per click. So this input has all the keywords in it whereas at the end of month 2 we might not be bidding on half of them. And then the next inputs we have down here. So we've got the top level conversion metrics which are how many conversions am I going to get, what's the cost per acquisition. So what am I paying for a conversion and this is a lead. It might be a phone call, it might be an email inquiry, if it's e-commerce that would be a transaction and you can ignore the CPA because quite frankly unless you're selling identical items then CPA is kind of irrelevant for e-commerce because you've got revenue reporting so you want to be looking at ROAS, you know return on ad spend. The other three things that you can impact are these your close rates, your revenue per sale and your profit margin. So let's think of a lead gen situation. So this is for accounting software keywords. Okay. So this is the first so let's say that our close rate so people who sign up from a conversion is 20% and then revenue per sale. So this is your average revenue. It might be lifetime value of a customer, it might be the average order size, whatever suits. Remember this is projection so you're never going to get this bang on. No one has a crystal ball. This is to give you an indication of whether advertising is going to be good for you. Accounting software, well I know that it's not necessarily cheap but I think an average order, let's say your customer stick pays 100 quid a month or $100 and they're with you for two years on average. So 2000 and the profit margin, well it's probably quite good. You know you might be making 65% so it's a good little business. So that then tells us how many sales we're going to get from leads and also the cost per sale. So a lot of people focus on cost per acquisition but here we've got the actual cost per sale. So month one versus month three and you can start to see already that we might be hitting some trouble here. We're over half the revenue but our profit margin isn't much beyond half. So we've got a total projected spend and then we've got a total revenue before profit. So currently month one we're going to be better than break even. Month three we might be doing quite well until we refer to our ROAs ROI and profit. So these are essentially the return on investment numbers, the business metrics and what we're seeing here is the traditional ROAs which a lot of e-commerce businesses will use but what we can see actually what we know about the business i.e. our sales close rate, our average order value, our average sales value, our lifetime value, whatever we're going to use here and our profit margin we can see that we spend 37,000, we lose 8,500 but month three we spend 55,000 and we make 1000,000 and a half. So not great, probably not good enough. That tells me instantly if this was you and your business and you came to me in fact I'm going to bump this up to max you want to get every impression you can. You want to spend 100 grand a month come month three. If you'd come to me as a potential customer and you said Ed I've got a accounting software business this is my current conversion rate this is my current close rate AOV and profit margin then I would plumb the numbers in I would look at this and say yeah we can spend 100 grand probably not month one but definitely by month three so we can spend what you want to spend. Problem is it's going to cost you and you're not going to make money and immediately you could say right so we need to fine tune this so we need to stop spending on the high expensive keywords and we need to focus on making this work so I want to look at the lower portion of the market I want to spend 10 to 15,000 a month instead and make you profitable and then I want to also you can say right if your conversion rate is only 2% you will make money I mean by spending 14 grand you'll make about 10-15% profit are you happy with that and a lot of people would say not really unless you scale it and then we can see that if we scale it we might run into some issues where we can't make it profitable but what we can say is okay what happens if we improve the conversion rate so let's say by month three it's not 3% they've made change to the website and it's actually 3.25% and then all of a sudden you can start massaging or you know where you need to be so when we go back down here we can see that actually that highly profitable so a 50% increase from 2% to 3% makes the first month profitable and that also shows how important it is that the website is doing its job I mean it could be a barnstormer they could say oh actually our conversion rate is 5% currently and then all of a sudden you say right let's go for broke because it flat out spending 66 to 100,000 a month we're going to make you between 30 and 100,000 so as you can see it's a really powerful little spreadsheet and we can even then re-include the expensive keywords and still make money and spend even a bit more money to get a few more customers in fact let's see the difference 153 sales versus 155 so it's an extra two so yeah this is really good now if you're a in fact I can use some actual figures from an e-commerce site I'm thinking about I think they're more like 9.5% to be honest with you just as a quick reference say your e-commerce you're converting at 9.5% and your close rate so what would you do with e-commerce well I would set this figure to your close rate minus your return so say your return rate is 2% yeah if it's 2% then your close rate would be 98% so that's how you deal with e-commerce then you'd use your average order value let's say it's 33 pounds and then your profit margin is 30% then you can see that you could be spending on these keywords which is accounting and nothing to do retail but never mind well it wouldn't make any profit so yes so it wouldn't make any profit if this was the the cost per click for this retail customer yeah it doesn't surprise me that's really bloody expensive for retail but the point still stands if that were the projected cost per click for what you're selling and they were your metrics and they were your metrics you wouldn't make money you would hemorrhage money so this would save you from blowing money and wasting your time advertising so thank you for listening to me ramble on you've been very patient and I've been Ed Leake with beautiful hair like that you probably have to pop up a mantin don't you find a stream and dip it in and flick it about the place do grab a copy of the spreadsheet and do hit the like button it does help and please do leave a comment do ask questions in the comment section give me a bit of feedback it's very much appreciated put this to use all the best enjoy
