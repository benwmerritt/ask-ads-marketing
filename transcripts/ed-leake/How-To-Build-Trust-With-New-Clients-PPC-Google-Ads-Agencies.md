Three things your clients are probably thinking about you right now. Firstly, do I really trust this person? Secondly, yeah the results were okay but I want more. Thirdly, are they a lazy bastard or are they actually doing stuff and how do I know? So those are the three things. Trust, it's hard to seal, especially in the short term. First six months, don't expect to have it in bucket loads. Secondly, clients typically are never happy with the results even when they're happy with the results. No disrespect to clients, they just like to have a moon shot or seven. Thirdly, are you doing anything? You lazy PPC person. So how do we tackle these three things in reverse order? Communication, number three, are you doing anything? Well tell them what you're bloody doing even if it's just a speed report week or bi-weekly. They might not even read it. Doesn't matter. You're doing stuff. Secondly, how do you get better results? Well do your job well but that's obvious, we know that one. Think about how you can go above and beyond. Just think about it, just go a bit wider. Can you do something outside your Google ads account probably? Can you do a little bit of competitor reconnaissance and showcase that to the client so you've done that extra work? You've built additional trust so we whack that number one on the head whilst covering off two at the same time and say to the client, this is what we're going to do as a result of this competitor reconnaissance but we might need this, that and the other from you and might need a better offer from you. It might need a suggestion or tweak on the landing page or on your product or on your service or whatever but here's what everyone else is doing. Going even further than that, what about if for an e-com client, you've tested out their shopping cart process, they don't have an abandonment email or their follow-ups are non-existent or when they do send you an email it's pretty drab. Can you offer some advice? Can you share a template that you found in the wild that's a winner? It's someone else that's doing it well. Value add, help them retain customers for longer. Just think wider than your Google ads account. I'll say that again, wider than just the Google ads account. So communications builds that trust, reassures them that you're doing the job and bringing them fresh information. It's the pressure of the job to do so especially with the pending AI massacre but it's not here yet and AI should help you in the future anyway. If you're keen and optimistic about the future, AI is probably going to turn the world into an absolutely perfectly wonderful place but until then, until then you've got a job to do so go and do it.
