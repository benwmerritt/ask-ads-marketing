Uh, someone watching Mr Beast could be anyone, someone watching an agency videos, boring get like you and me. And I think this is what puts a lot of people off the sea. Oh, it's only got 200 views. That video is I won't do one like that, but they're missing out. You're watching agency forge on YouTube, the mastermind community for PPC agency owners looking to scale without the stress. Is YouTube your primary channel for leads? Do you think YouTube has made the difference for your agency? Have you measured it? I joined forage because I do have some success, but like any other business owner, even even bigger agencies, 20 to 50 people, 100, whatever, there's a lot of things that are a mess and I'm not going to pretend I have it all together and everything's great. And I'm making six figures a month by my course. I'll tell you how I'm trying to focus. That's why I bought forge. It's like, I'm doing pretty good, but I could do a lot better and I need to refine it. The answer is I don't know. Um, it's got a lot of attention and I, you know, I get, here's some white label, you know, I saw you on YouTube, I own a web design company, you know, we've got 20 clients. I just, I can't figure this out. Do you guys do white label? What's your package or, you know, uh, that kind of thing. And it's like, okay, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. And it's like, did I track that? How many, you know, time hours? It's like, I don't know. We got that white label. We got that other client. We got this one that saw that one video one time and it's like, you ask me, how's it doing? It's like, I'm not really sure. It's really big. It gets stuff. Uh, I see analytics, you know, from YouTube organic. Uh, and then I see social media from, from Twitter or X. Uh, nobody calls it that, but all these other things and that's the thing. I'm honestly, I'm, I'm working on right now. It's like, where is everything coming from? And I'm not, even as an agency owner, I'm not entirely sure. And I need to work on that. Yeah. Well, that is a very candid answer. But I think that's the problem with, um, anything when you do branding, which is, let's face it, when you're posting on social media and it's your face, it's personal brand, isn't it? And if you're on multiple channels, trying to measure that and get it was probably a little bit of a tricky question that I asked really. Um, because measuring all that as a nightmare track, yeah, you can put UTMs and tracking links, but the way we are with cookies now, everything's last click. Reword the question. Did you see an uptick when you started doing YouTube over time of people getting in touch? Or have you got a different, um, marketing channel where you definitely saw that when you started doing this, you know, you mentioned posing on Twitter, I don't know what's wrong with Twitter. I post stuff and everyone ignores me. So I think I'm just followed by bots. But did you, was there anything you did? And you actually saw an uptick over a period of time, your agency growth? It did go through a course on refining YouTube. Cause again, just went into it, recorded a bunch of stuff. It was kind of messy. And to give you a quick summary, YouTube is pretty much SEO from 10 years ago. You just put keywords in your title. You put keywords in your description, add some hashtags, add the tags. It's, it's SEO from 10 or 15 years ago is the YouTube algorithm. So it's like, Oh, well, I wasn't really doing any SEO. And I got, um, two buddy or whatever it's called, the plug-in says here's your search volume for YouTube. Again, it's just old school SEO. But here's, here's, you know, search volume compared to competition, high search volume, low competition. It's like, great, I'll make one of those made one. And that helps significantly. I was just kind of throwing it on YouTube. It's like, actually do it correctly, approach it like an SEO when extended text ads switch to responsive search ads. It's like, make one of those. And it just skyrocketed how to switch. I just, I logged into a Google account and how to switch. GA for switch. I did one of those, like the week it was shutting down and panic mode when everyone went on, like, how do I switch or how do I switch my clients? And it's like, okay, I actually put some effort, do some keyword research, tag stuff, collaborate with people, all these things you can find it on any blog on how to do YouTube. And it's like, all right, I'll actually do it. I'll do it the right way. And that started last summer of 2023. And that did make a big difference long term doing YouTube correctly. Yeah. Yeah. So it is the fall, it's slow burn, but it's the branding exercise. I'm a big fan of YouTube for agencies, definitely. The niching is where the power is though. Talking specifically to a specific industry or vertical or whatever. Sam in our group, Enforged does a great job of that. Tomik Martin, who's on YouTube, a very specific, very specific. And those still rank, they get a lot of traffic, legitimate comments, handful of leads. It's just, like I said, I'm really messy with it. I kind of thought, you know, we do a lot of home services that could be a niche, so it could do Google ads for plumbers, make a really good YouTube video, good call to action, hey, get a free account audit, you're not performing the way you want to, click on the link below, actually put more effort into it and track that and see how that does. And then maybe Google ads for AC repair, you know, all these ones we've done and they're really good niches for us. I'm like, yeah, I didn't make a YouTube video about that exact niche. And I guess it could happen. They rank really well. They don't get a lot of views, but everyone viewing it is exactly who you're going for. Exactly. Yeah, this is the thing though. People look at numbers and, you know, my agency videos are low numbers, but it's because someone watching MrBeast could be anyone, someone watching an agency video is boring, get like you and me. So the importance is a lot smaller. But the industry specific case studies, the show and tells videos are brilliant for generating interest. And I think this is what puts a lot of people off the sea. Oh, it's only got 200 views, that video. So I won't do one like that, but they're missing out. Hey, this is Ed. Thanks for watching.
