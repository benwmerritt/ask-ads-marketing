How do you deal with a pushy Google ads rep, especially those that send them emails saying that you've not done something or you haven't hit the apply all recommendations button so they're trying to make you look like a prized which is not very reasonable of them. Well pretty straightforward. Their normal gambit is to suggest spending more money or applying all those recommendations. So you've simply got to pick and you can cherry pick a couple of these for your clients and you can do a case study of this that you can send to everyone that gets infiltrated by a Google ads rep via email. And it's as simple as this. It's here's the bidding strategy. Here's what happens when you apply all recommendations and bump the budget. Essentially what they're telling you to do is allow the bidding engine to dictate how much a conversion should cost your business, Mr or Mrs. Client. Does that sound reasonable? No, it bloody doesn't. Oh, no, it doesn't does it. That's why I'm here protecting you by managing that budget and the bidding and optimizing around it against it and keeping the cadence of the account in check. Because otherwise those pricks would come along, apply everything and they would royally screw that up. You can literally show a before and after example, hopefully not one that you've actually had to experience. Another angle you can go is straight for the jugular character assassination. So explain to your client how Google hires these people. A, they're not even Google employees. They are outsourced and B, they follow essentially a very short shrift training procedure. And when we say training in quotation marks, it means here's how to get clients to spend more of their money. That's their MO. And most decent clients will understand this pretty quickly if you explain it to them. These people are hired by Google via a third party to get you to spend more money on the hopes and promises that by clicking a few magical buttons, they will transform your business. But at the end of the day, it's not their money. So it doesn't really matter. And this is the stupid thing from Google's perspective. It's not a very long term view. This is a quarter on quarter. Hey, let's get the ad revenue up. Let's not think about the longer term impact, negative impact to our client base as they realize that we've forced them to spend more money. And therefore they will slowly retract over time because it's hurt them. Oh dear.
