invest the grand plus our fees in ads, and then book in well, quote for a quarter million quid of roof roofing deals. Juicy is anything, isn't it? You are on the last call, weren't you? Yeah. Yeah, give it to us. All right. So I've been working on, I think the goal was acquire a new client and don't lose any clients. We haven't lost a client in two months. That's sweet. Been really good. So we've kind of like solved that, that challenge, which I still think was from taking on clients and solar industry with two smaller budgets and how many competitors then come into the Google ads auction compared to when we were advertising. So we've kind of like sat that out and the clients who have had the decent enough budgets have remained and held strong. So we're all kind of through that now, which is great. We are hopefully about to sign a really good client tomorrow, I think they're in the conservatory roof space, which is good, quite competitive industry, but anything to do with roofing, we're kind of really crushing at the moment. One of our roofing clients at the moment, we've got this campaign into an unbelievable sweet spot where I think they all managed to bring the cost believe down at like 20 quid for a new roof replacement. They've quoted over a quarter of a million and spent the ground. It's unreal how good it's working. So we're now really just trying to go after and get more roofing clients. So that's going to be the sector that I'm pushing content for with YouTube. So everything I'm doing with YouTube is really to supplement client acquisition in a way or provide kind of utility content for them during that process. So one of my more recent videos was on like the perfect roofing landing page design, which kind of like jumping back to what you guys were talking about about five minutes ago, about sharing stuff. I wasn't really sure if like, should I share this? Should I share all the information about it? But thought, they're going to find out eventually. I might as well be the one to gain the authority in sharing all this kind of insider knowledge. And I'm going to do the same for the Google Ads campaign build, which is a little bit more hesitant, but it's not like loads and loads of people are watching it as well. And yeah, by the time, like you said, there's plenty of pie to go around. Like there's so many companies who's going to actually execute on it in the exact same way that we do. And like every campaign is different as well. So, you know, it's more just like sharing the fundamentals and it's been working really well with the YouTube stuff. Then like, and then it's not like been posting every week, but been really focusing just on good quality, going really good in depth information on the topics. I believe like the videos I've pushed out on those topics are the best videos on the internet forum. Like I've looked and there's not that many of them. So it's not hard to be the best, but they've racked up subscribers. I think I've gone from like 15 subscribers a month to go up to 118 now. Often these videos as well, it's not like I'm plowing like, you know, how to build a performance max campaign type thing. These are stuff I'm ranking really well for. Get it. I've had like five inquiries through it now, through YouTube, a decent level of ones. So yeah, main goal this month is just get that new client on board and get more, get more roofing clients. Ideally, if we can get five more across the UK, decent size over the next kind of couple of months, that would be really good. So you've got that moonshot case today, haven't you? If you can say someone, you know, invest the grand plus our fees in ads and then book in or quote for a quarter million quid of roofing deals. So that's a juicy as anything, isn't it? It's not going to be because of the nature of Google ads, it's not like you can just start a brand new campaign and hit that. But it's no proof of concept, isn't it? It's like any case study. It's like any case study has that disclaimer, doesn't it? It's like, you know, we can't guarantee it's going to be the same for you. You go on to any, any Dick Funnels landing page and you'll see the disclaimer saying, you know, well, this one guy out of a million made a few quid. The rest of you probably going to fail miserably. Um.
