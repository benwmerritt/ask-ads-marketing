Smart bidding see a lot of people still struggling with smart bidding and by that I mean max conversions TCPA or ROAS So what do we do? How do we get it to work for us? firstly do not treat smart bidding as a Fixer of all if your account structure is wrong poor keyword selection poor ad copy Not doing your negatives all the other 50 hundred things you could be doing Don't try and fix it with smart bidding if you want to diagnose that stuff and get more help beyond smart bidding then check the description for a extended free training from me with a flow chart and information on how to diagnose these things Like I say, it's free all I need from you is your email address so I can spam you so I can sorry update you So how do we manage our smart bidding so it makes sense? I Haven't I've just jumped into an account, but this one isn't budget limited So let's talk about budget limited really quickly. So there's two scenarios of budget limited by that I mean you've set a budget you're spending it and Google's telling you can spend more The first scenario is the easy one where let's say you've got a budget of $50 a day You're spending it sometimes nibbling over it. You've set a Target conversion of I don't know 10 so you're getting five conversions a day and you're happy with that What you can do and the simplest thing to do is lower your target CPA You might drop it down to eight and see if you can get an extra conversion and still spend the budget and There's two outcomes there. You spend the budget and you get an extra conversion great or You don't quite spend the budget, but you still get the same volume of conversions. So you save money The exact same thing for target row as you lift the target rise limit maybe 10 20% and See if it still spends the budget how frequently should you do this? Again, it depends on how many conversions you go. You have going through your account, but Realistically once a week so pick a day Monday. So you review the last seven days Tweak your bidding so don't overcomplicate it Don't be changing bids every single day unless you've got a very fast high-spend account and even then The opposite of that is you've got a budget you're spending it and you're still budget limited But you're not hitting your desired cost conversion. So you're over your cost conversion or your row as is below where you are This goes back to the freebie full training thing that I put together That's not a bidding issue probably That's an issue outside of the bidding and you're trying to fix it with the bidding saying well, I'm giving you this money I want this target CPA Why are you not hitting it? Well, you need to get your keyword selection campaign structure our group structure add copy Competitors extensions you name it. We can't fix that here today. That takes a bit more effort. So go and grab the freebie So let's have a look at this account. It's not the situation we've got so we want to go last 14 days And this is so we can segment the data by day So drop in segment time day Okay, and we've got this high spend highest spend campaign at the top So this is a test performance max campaign. I can tell that because someone's named this very well targeting the uk with row as 200 pound budget And let's have a look so we Look for our daily spend and as you can see We are barely hitting half that spend So that tells me two things it tells me that Either the bidding is restricting this or the market is restricting this. It's as simple as that If there's not enough people looking for the thing you're selling or Pushing then you can't magic impressions out in the sky But of course, this is on target row as and it's same for cpa just inverse that You are essentially throttling the spend by setting a target. So this is currently doing Let's have a look around around six as low as three four times row as up to a 12 times row as And on the days where it was actually spending over 100 the row has dropped to four four and a half And what you're essentially looking for here are with an exception of that friday The spend was not even 60. So essentially what you're looking for here is What's your priority? Is it to lower the cost conversion? Is it to increase row as? Or is it for spend? So is it for volume? You're trying to get more conversion through the account. So to get more conversion through this account purely through bidding and remember we're talking about smart bidding here And not by tweaking optimizing around the bidding. That's a separate routine entirely Then your options are very simple For this one, you would lower the target row as in fact, let's have a look At what the row as is set up. Isn't google ads really quick to load these days? Okay now So we have a max conversion with a target row set. So we have a t-row as 550 And we are achieving 6.4. Okay, so google's actually slightly overperforming our Target here, which is good. So what I would probably do looking at more recent dates 64 four Hitting the target. So it looks like every other day we are hitting target row as Which is averaging out about where we want it to be So a simple simple test here would be to drop your target rows. For example 10% Give it a week Does the budget spend more than 10% does it spend? All of its budget. So do we go from 70 to 100 pounds a day to 200 pounds, which is the daily budget And that's the thing The auction isn't as simple as an increment. So if you up your bid 10% you might be able to spend 20% more You might spend double more it depends where you are in that auction flux. You might just be outside of the What I'd call the mid-high auction area So Where a lot of competition is and it's pushing you down because your row as or your target CPA We can see that the search impression shows actually only 25% for this campaign That says the upside is quite large 70 odd percent to the upside and that would mean that we could in theory Get another million impressions in two weeks. If not more. So there is a big upside there. So really simple segment by day Are you hitting the spend? If not, do you want the volume nibble down your row as do you want the volume? Nibble down your CPA if you're running CPA very straightforward How do you fix things if you can't? even Spend the money or you're spending the money and you can't even get close to your target row as or CPA Well, as I said at the start of the video get the extended free training where I give you a free download A flow chart to help you work through things and explain things in more detail and that's about it So what I've just covered will help you with your bidding Outside of that you need to diagnose things improve things and stop trying to use bidding to fix An issue that isn't a bidding issue. Hope that made sense. Thanks for watching
