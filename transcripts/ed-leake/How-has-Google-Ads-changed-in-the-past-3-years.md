What is still applicable in Google ads from two or three years ago versus what's changed? So how has that job changed? How is managing a Google ads account three years ago any different to what it is today? And do we even believe it's that different? Because I think it's interesting. So to prime this, I did ask it in the God Tier Ads private group entry on purchase of the framework 499 from all great retailers. I did ask a few members and we got some good responses. Michael's in the group as well. So we can walk through them. I mean, from a top level perspective, go on, Michael. What do you think three years ago? What do you think has really changed? This is a video I actually recorded yesterday is the guaranteed lifetime of success with Google ads. Now, the reason I can say that is because I've been using the same strategies for the last 10 years. So this blends perfectly with this question, what worked well three years ago that doesn't work well anymore? Or what is that? What is still applicable from two or three years ago versus what has changed? Now, I would argue that 80 to 90% of what was applicable from two to three years ago, by the way, two or three years ago was 2020. I'd be even saying the stuff from 2016 still works now. The technology has changed. The psychology remains the same. But Google ads is a very psychology based platform. People are proactively searching for what they want. So that psychology is not changing. So that's where I want to start. So oldest prime with saying, I think 90% is the same, 10% is different. And that 10%, it's not even worth that 10% most of the time. So that's where I'm going to start. Yeah, before we go into other people's stuff, what are your thoughts on it? Yeah, I'd lean into that heavily. The you say psychology, it's if we're talking about intent, search and shopping is intent driven. So like you say, it's an aspect of psychology. It's commercial. Unless you're looking for information, which isn't really Google ads play anyway, you're looking for a click that converts into something lead or a product purchase. Features have changed shift and moved around performance max has come instead of shopping. I know people and we've tried it. We've actually gone from smart shopping to performance max back to standard shopping with better results. So Google changes are not always positive. What's the biggest thing that doesn't work anymore with a big caveat is scagging accounts. So do scags still work? Yes, they do. But they don't work in the way that people used to abuse them, which is scagging an entire account. For anyone that doesn't know, it's a single keyword ad group. The way I use them and the way I teach using them is the same as it has been for a long time. It's the heartbeat of an account. So let's say you sell car insurance and your big spending keyword is drumroll car insurance, then that would have that would be scagged. That would be in its own campaign, its own ad group. It might be exact. It might be phrase, but probably not. And it might be broad. So there's a single keyword with a different match type potentially in an ad group in our campaign. And that is allocated its own budget essentially. And that simply is the heartbeat of the account because that's a high spending, high converting term. And therefore, we want to see it and we want to control it. We want to protect it. We don't want it mixed in with other budgets and other campaigns. So that's so treat, treat a scag. I call it a king maker in God, here I was just because I like medieval and so I call it the money keyword or the money maker keyword. If you've got a certain search term, not even keyword, but search term, you exclude it from the other campaign you put into its own, it has its own budget, impression share. We have a insurance client that they had like this very niche line of insurance that we're getting about 14 leads a month. Now that was amazing for them, by the way. But I found that there was one term that was going really well. I negative that one exact match from that campaign, put it into its own campaign, put it on max, top impression share or max price impression share. The leads went from 14 to 28 in a month. It doubled the lead. Now for most people, that doesn't matter, 14 to 28. For a very niche insurance term, worth a lot. And these money campaigns or these kid campaigns, outstanding. But that's when scags do work, is when they are actually done specifically post the data being there, not just being like, I've got a five million keywords built out with an Excel spreadsheet. In my opinion, that's always been wrong. But people used to do it anyway, full accounts from the get go scagging. You want themed keywords, themed campaigns or like a group of like the campaign has like a goal or an objective based on a certain line of business. But then within that, it could be like ad groups that are based on themes of keywords that have very commercial intent as well. And the like someone, and I've had this before, someone say, well, why don't you just why do you need that scag? Why does it need its own campaign? Why do you just put that ad group elsewhere? And it's purely delivery, budget control. It's all it's about. You want that keyword flat out maximizing budget. You don't want any other compression share, market share, cost per click, Saturated control. Yeah. It's, I love that you started off with that, because that is such a powerful way to get outstanding results for accounts that are already going really well. So the other couple of things that I think have changed, audiences and conversion tracking because of privacy GA4, the technology has been trying to catch up. So tracking is sort of, we've got enhanced conversions now and GA4, which has some interesting audience data and properties. But I don't feel like we're in a better place. I feel like these products, these features have been added to keep us where we were in terms of data. So Google doesn't lose out. So I don't think these are necessarily adding a lot to the table. It feels more like sticky plasters to keep, you know, to keep us having reliable conversion tracking. It's never going to be a hundred percent. So can I ask the question there? Sorry, Ed, is when you do conversion tracking for your clients or recommended, do you recommend it through Google Analytics 4 linked back to the Google ads account or using the Google ads conversion tag itself? Both, but probably primarily tag. If you've got multiple channels, I, I don't know. I'm starting to lean on GA4 being quite reliable, honest. Oh, interesting. Compared to, every business is different and you get to make a decision. Most people need to use Google ads tag simple as that. Yeah. What a third party tool. I've seen people say this before, if you're using Google ads tag, you're a noob. Kasim. I completely disagree. Kasim on that wonderful hand. Kasim from Solutions. I did post that. I think I saw it pop up on LinkedIn for a small, small medium businesses. They don't need that level of third party tracking and third party tracking because we've got a couple of clients that use it. What converts and then there's another one. I can't remember the bloody name of it. All they do is move the goal posts. Yeah. A little bit. And it's not, it's just, I don't know. I, yeah, look, the Google tracking is pretty solid. It's reliable. If you, if you face Google ads off against analytics and you compare and contrast, you do get a decent amount of pattern. Are you right? If you're spending tens and tens of thousands a month, yeah, get a third party as well. But if you're only if you multi-channel, there's no point. If you're doing pure Google ads, even then I'd say, well, third party tracking, all it's going to do is shift the budget around a bit. I'm not, I'm just not that sold yet. We've got an enterprise client we work with who has Google ads tracking, Google analytics tracking, and also a third party. And they do not match up whatsoever. And it's really challenging because they're spending hundreds of thousands a month. And I'm there to consult on what the accurate data is. And that's when we've got to go back to like Google click ID offline data, but still like, I just find for most businesses, Google tag manager, using Google ads tag, set it up in there. Just do just, that's your fundamental one on one. I started off with analytics, by the way, just linking them in. But Google analytics, what it was, the beautiful free software of like, what a software, what a amazing analytical software. But then obviously over time with ad blockers and then data privacy, it's that conversion data isn't as powerful as it once was. So Google ads. I think GA4 has improved that situation reliability. But yeah, a GA3 UA, whatever we want to call it, did definitely tail off over the past year, like 80% is accurate or worse sometimes, just counting conversions. I think GA4 has definitely caught that up. I don't know if some of it's through modeling. I don't understand the underlying technology well enough to know, which means why are you using it? Well, I don't understand the third party trackers underlying technology. That's why I'm not using them. And a prime example is last quarter for big retailer of ours, what decent size retailer moved a lot of budget to Facebook ads because this third party tracker said that Facebook ads actually was converting more than Facebook, the analytics was reporting net result, no more revenue net result, they got more budget. And we the budget just moved, the client got no more revenue. So it was an exercise in futility. It felt like I think these third party trackers and for a lot of data at the enterprise level, it shouldn't be used for tactical decisions, it should be strategically where you're placing budget at what stage and why, maybe campaign level. But any lower than that is probably too granular, because then you are really trusting in that tracking being Bob on. And essentially, we're measuring chaos, which human behavior is completely chaotic. I might run to the crapper and buy something on a whim. I might sit there on the sofa every night looking at something and never buy it. It's so difficult to, sounds like a leader, pretty trivial life, doesn't it? It's not my buying habits, by the way. They're more like a Steinpost. They're not like, as they say in Zen, is the finger pointing to the moon is not the moon. So maybe conversion data is pointing us in the right direction, not actually what the tangible outcome is. The Google ads tag why I like it is the data driven approach. While some may over attribute, it actually does attribute where attribution is due, because you, if we're doing the old school last click model, once if something was the middle click or the first click, and you start turning that things off and like now the start of that funnel is dead. That's why I find it relevant, especially for Google ads. And I do the same with Facebook. Now the data does overlap, but I prefer to have overlapping over attributed data that gets results than under attributed data that doesn't like if you're really getting to the point where you're trying to save pennies like just relax, like stop being so stingy, like just run ads, get results, get on with life. There's more than life than just like lead generation and e-commerce like have it run your business and focus on those things as well. Yeah, I think that's a golden nugget. You prefer over attributing to under attributing data or analytics because one will make you spend less and that's compounding because then you'll spend less again because you're getting less revenue through less conversions. And that's a downward spiral, whereas over attributing, yes. But it's kind of forward looking, isn't it? It's fortuitous. It's like, Oh, well, I'll spend more on that. And then next month as a result of that, you've actually got more, even though it's not quite as much more as the attribution's telling you. So yeah, there's a lot of that at play. I mean, what else has changed really? The use of the psychology, the fundamentals remain the same regardless of the features that Google adds to an account. And this is something that frustrates me a lot because I sell a training product, God Tier Ads, the performance framework. Which I've bought. Michael has bought, which I do get a few emails about. It doesn't I rarely get refunds. I think I've had, I could check the spreadsheet actually, I think I've had four this year, which is trivial. But I've just had an email from someone saying, it feels out of date. And I'm like, why? What have you read? What have you watched that's telling you that something's different now? Because the fundamentals of a good ad campaign. Hamozi, what are you saying Hamozi? God damn you, Al. And that's just me having to not lecture someone, but just educate them on actually, just forget that the buttons have got different colors and different names on them. Like the biddy, the same bloody system is has it improved? Has it got worse? Who knows? But it's the options are the same. Campaign structures are still the same. Extensions are generally the same keyword selection and how you research keywords the same match types of thinned, their behavior has changed drifted, whereas exacts are less exact. But still, the principles remain the same. So performance max, you don't have to use it crying out loud. It's just it's there as an optional thing. Yeah, particularly for Legion, you do not have to use it. Yeah, that's pretty wild. Unless we've got an insurance client that they use it for Legion, but they only their conversion points is offline data feeding back in. So it's real tangible data, not just like, cooked rubbish bot leads, like the legit leads. But unless you've got a high volume of data, I think lead generation Pmax is your your cowboy. It's fucking. We use we only use it with offline data. I wish I could show you a back office report from one of our insurers. Yeah, track lead through the application through the approval through the policy and that all that feeds back into Google ads as different types and Pmax is it's half that so the conversion rate from 10 and the CPA is about where you'd expect it to be. But the quality of them going from a conversion to a lead to closed is half not 10% worse is 50% worse. So there's a lot of shit. The other problem with these leads from performance max is that they waste the business's time because they're lower quality or this spam on a junk. You got to remember someone's got especially a business doing thousands of leads a month, and they've got a team of people on the phones on the emails. Someone's time is being used up with this crap. So yeah, Pmax is optional. I'd say I dare say it's optional for e-commerce as well. Just quickly with Pmax for Legion is the elements of it are dynamic search ads, which will mostly be branded traffic most of the time if you get leads. The second part is YouTube videos. So to what extent does that actually work? I run YouTube ads for clients get great results, but you have to run them like a laser like that. That's unforgiving because that's like a display network. That's like Facebook bit harder. And then you've got like GML ads and then also the rubbish. It's like, what the hell is going on? Like when you talk about a black box, it's like, I'll open the black box and it's just filled with dog turds and empty wrappers. And then there might just be like a dollar in the corner. Like it's mostly rubbish, low quality ad inventory by Google that they just want to spend. Sounds like under my Christmas tree. Empty wrappers, dog turds and the dollar in the corner. You can't even spend a dollar in this country. Yeah, I think that's fair. YouTube's 80 90% ad offer ad offer ad. The what you do inside Google ads, you can throw a doll if you've got a good advert and a good offer, you can throw a doll in Google ads and it will probably work. If you've got a pretty shite advert, it doesn't matter how good you are at Google ads, you are going to struggle with YouTube ads making it work. So definitely when you then see what performance max puts out with this sort of like soft porn music and the slide shows these automated YouTube ads it creates, they are terrible. They are a terrible experience. And it might cynical self says that Google knows that these are terrible. But what it does allow them to do is to fill that bottom 10% of invent inventory that's not getting sold that's junkie that's crap that attracts no clicks or clicks. It pushes the market up then because it means that if there's more advertising the market, it means that the base price goes up. Of course it does. Of course it does like display. So economics, business, Google. Yeah, it's like, yeah, so displays again, it's difficult. It's, I'd say Facebook ads are definitely easier because it's a much narrower playing field and you can pick the field you play on displays a lot tougher in that respect. And Pmax is just blasting you farm wide, auto generated ads, auto generated videos, which are the most hilarious thing until you've seen 10 of them. So yeah, don't don't buy into the hype and don't worry about it. If it doesn't work, if it doesn't work, don't worry about it. Use something else. I can't get Pmax to work. Okay, use your search campaigns. What, you know, don't go back to what works two or three years ago. Well, yes, shall we actually go down the list before I get hungry? So yeah, so in the group, let's let's read them. I mean, we can maybe graph these comments on as a screenshot after to help people who are still with us listening. I'm sorry. So Larry, Colin X says, Hello, Larry, it really sucks that exact match turned into what Google thinks is related. Are you close variants? And then on the flip side, I'm amazed that some accounts perform really well with broad. Hey, Larry, I've been saying broad for years, but I will caveat that sometimes broad works beautifully and other times it doesn't. So it doesn't always work. But yeah, so your negative keyword list should be your best friend. Absolutely 100%. Larry, what hasn't changed? You must test. Yep. So the principles remain same. Don't get me started on the disappearance of actual search terms. So yes, Google took search terms for people that don't know or relatively new. Google did remove a lot of search term data couple of years ago, might have been three years ago. Then they gave us a bit of it back. But certain industries, certain accounts, particularly lower spend or lower impressions tend to not see a lot of data in the search term reports. So you might see, oh, I've got five conversions, you go and look in your search term report and it's showing you three conversions and the other two are from unknown sources, which I feel bizarre because it's like if that person's prepared to click an advert and convert, then surely that data should be visible, their search term should be visible inside Google ads. But hey, yeah, privacy. I have around that is you've be hot on your account, check it once a day, because some of those you'll get the impressions or like the impressions and the clicked data that day and then it disappears after for the search term. So if you're just a bit faster on it, you can write your negative keyword list out and also add them as keywords. Mostly it's negative keywords for me. I don't really care about adding you because you've already got that click. So the only tip and workaround is just get on that fast. Yeah, this is that's a good point. Actually, a lot of work is with keywords is up from selecting keywords. And then it's most of its negatives. And it's such quite rare, especially using broads that you then add more keywords, you're essentially a negative. It's a negative nursery, isn't it? And I did I did go back to Larry asking him if he felt that broads had changed over those years. So yeah, he's essentially found that broads have worked in certain circumstances. Adrian bold fellow Brit and cynical bastard. He he says it pays to be negative, which is obviously pun. So I don't know why I've consistently positioned negative keywords as the most important aspect of an effective account, agree or disagree? Negative is the most important thing, Michael. Yeah, negatives and keywords like ultimate success doesn't come from doing things right. It comes from not doing things wrong. So every $100 you have, you reduce that wastage and then all that money is being allocated to proper things and negative keywords and settings are the two things you need to be laser focused on from the start and then everything will just work. If you want the like the one thing from advertising, it's like negative keywords slash settings, and you're golden. He thank goes bless bless you, Adrian. He goes on for a bit of a ramble, which I won't read out. But yeah, he's okay. Cool. No, thanks, Adrian. But I agree. Well, we'll go for grief. The negatives are pretty, pretty high up there. Dave Ashley, wow, things that haven't changed. That's hard. I see Dave, we disagree a bit of that. So Dave's coming from the angle that a lot of things have changed. But is the context of that is that features and stuff in Google ads or is the underlying strategy making sure that conversion tracking is set up properly? Yeah, that's one on one should always be the case. We can still safely ignore what Google reps have to say. Not making changes to the account. Now this is important. So what hasn't changed not making changes to the account early, if there hasn't been enough clicks, so both ramping up or turning off too early, which is completely right. I did a sound bite about this sort of a ramble about what the first week or month looks like in an ad account and Dave's completely right. If you've done your job well, give it a chance to produce some data for you. I'm not saying don't touch an account. If you've started a brand new account or campaign that is going completely teased up, it's spending 10 times what you expected or whatever. Obviously, step in, but you do have to have a bit of patience and inform your client of how things work. They might watch Big Al yesterday and think that it happens overnight, but they've got to be patient to spend the money to essentially research the market and get that data in. And then finally, he says testing broad match has improved, but he's not believing the hype around AI, which I kind of agree in terms of Google ads. Yeah, still uses exacts in large counts. Yeah, exacts definitely. Google AI, what do we think in terms of Google ads? Does it even exist yet, Michael? Is it doing anything that we can see? I'm seeing nothing of value. If there's any intelligence, it's actually just from maybe some of the bidding models in the back end, even if they work. That's the only thing. Some of these copy recommendations, everything I just think is rubbish. I think you need more control because the less control you have, the less... I've never seen an account that has followed the Google recommendations of Google AI, that's outperformed someone just doing it properly. At the same time, I've seen people do the scags thing and then they're just too old school. So you've got to find this perfect blend of the new way approach blended in with old school strategy or old school psychology. Yeah, I think that's more relaxing a little bit on... I mean, keywords is the prime example. If you've got an exact keyword that's not spending what you need it to spend to get results, but it is getting some results, it's like, well, chuck a broad in and just test it and control the outcome a bit with the budget. So, you know, pull the budget back a little bit, chuck a broad version in, just see what it does. Keep an eye on the search terms. Do they look relevant? Are they out of context? If AI or Google's AI was that good, we'd see better context in the search terms tighter. Its ad copy would be a bit better by now. The YouTube ads it creates for Pmax wouldn't be shite. So we're a bit off because the automated stuff, I don't think it's AI though, this is more machine learning stuff inside Google ads like bidding engines and stuff. And the thing with a bidding engine, we just have to take Google's word on how sophisticated it is really. If we're getting results, it's like, ah, the bidding engine is amazing. But if it's not doing what we want it to do, it's like, oh, well, maybe I should do manual bidding, but then I lose all this machine learning. But you don't actually know what that is. It's what Google tell us is happening. So, but yeah, hey, automated bidding is definitely a step up. It's been around for donkey's years, but it's definitely a step up from doing things manually. Now Chris shoot. And Chris, I don't know if that's how you say your surname, SCHU double TE, but I'm gonna say shoot. Sounds good. Chris has put war and peace in here. So he thinks a lot has changed in the past three years. So new campaign types, new ad formats, new bid strategies, new keyword match type, behavior, new data attribution, new audience signals, etc. New campaign types. Well, we've got PMAX. The discovery has been replaced with, what do they call it now? What that awareness type of campaign? Yeah, yeah, that's awesome. It's new, isn't it like lead? Yeah, I can't remember what it's called. I am a Google ads professional, honestly. Yeah, this is the thing, like, something's got a name change and a tweak. I'm not that bothered till I see it in action and working and I'm not going to pretend to know all about it until I've actually used it for a fair amount of time. So there's people who will chase the trends and there's people who just get there to get results. Everyone will talk about the new features. Yeah, you mean like us recording a Alex Hormozzi video? No, but that's just context about value, mate. It's more about like when there's a new feature and people like acting like it's the bee's knees and they haven't used it or they don't have enough clients or they've got clients that spend like $500 or $2,000 a month. They don't actually have credible data and then they're an expert. It took me six months to record my PMAX video. Yeah, probably more. I waited and I waited and I waited because I saw all these videos coming out, all these comments and things. I'm like, that's wrong. That's a lie. That person doesn't know. That person doesn't know. Like they've put something out. They're just working at me. No, no, no, no. But I just thought like, I'm like, that person is putting out information. They don't know enough for it to be gospel. And I was like, I'm going to wait. I'm going to sit back, going to gather the data, the understanding, and then I put out 95 minutes of free training on YouTube. Because I was like, I wanted to blow all that crap, all the crap I was seeing out the water. And some people creating courses on PMAX that had less in them. Yeah, I just don't, everyone wants to be a bloody guru. Anyway, new ad formats and new campaign types. I think they're kind of minimal. I know we've had the migration to RSA from ETAs. And there was a lot of poo-pooing about that. But RSAs do the job now. So yeah, new keyword match types, behavior. Yeah, this is probably... Look, we can fix it though, through scripts, a negative. So exact match are very loose now, but we can fix that by applying negatives. But I say that we've got one account where the negative list is now too large. It hit the maximum number of necks for an exact... For an exact match ad group. That's how crazy it's an automated script that ads all the variations in. Essentially, it kills close variances and stuff like that. It's a very specific circumstance, but the fact that there were thousands of variations of the very tight exact matches is hilarious in one way and sort of frustrating in another. So yeah, Chris completely agree. I wish exacts were still tight. And I wish Google just said, look, test abroad and we'll give you the exacts, but give broad a chance as opposed to just sort of trying to make exacts broads. Data attribution, well, we've got data driven versus last click now. Are you touched on last click, Michael? There's still plenty of accounts that can run on last click. If you're a small business, you're spending a grand or whatever, all your data is last click really. So don't worry about that. And if you've got enough data run data driven, it's made your life or our life was Google ads managers. Very simple. We have two choices. And for most people, the choice is data driven and forget about it. I actually think it's better for most clients anyway. Easier. Because when you look in the attribution report in Google ads, you see that maybe alright 60 to 80% are within the first click. Now that might be based on that the cookie wasn't available. But I still think data driven is relevant. Just that's my approach. Yeah. So like data driven is position based. It's just that it's instead of being equally weighted in the second, third, fourth spot, whatever, Google will add a little bit of waiting, but it's position based, which is fine. We used to use position based a lot for our e-compliance. Google Analytics, import position based. Yeah. Oh, Chris, this is a big one. Let's make this the last one because I feel like this video has been going for 40 minutes. This is going to be a masterclass by the end of it. I'm very sorry that I'm boring you. It's great. I just don't want to use up all your valuable time. What hasn't changed? Chris agrees core principles of running winning ads. Account structure is still important. He's put stag, scag and eye bag. I don't know what an eye bag is. I don't know what that is. That's hilarious. Negative keywords, very important. Yeah, we all agree on that. Proper conversion tracking. Yeah, that's one on one. If you haven't got conversion tracking, what are you doing? Unless you're doing a branding campaign or an uplift campaign, fair constant search term mining. Yeah, I think we said that we add less keywords than we do. Yeah, keyword mining was a really good way years ago where you'd have a campaign with a broad match or a broad match modifier and whatever, the other phrase, and then you'd exact match the negative out. If it's just like car insurance, you put that as a broad match, but then you negative out exact match and then you just mine all the keywords that are not that. Alpha beta. Yeah, you got the alpha campaign, then you mine across. Yeah. It's still a viable strategy, but I think for a lot of people, it's too much work and they... I think that too much work, the data's not there or just like sometimes it's just mental masturbation. Oh, here's a controversial one. Monitoring and optimizing for quality score. I have stopped giving a toss about quality score unless there's a problem, and then I'll use it as a diagnosis tool, but I don't use it as a leading indicator. So long as the keyword... for me, anyway, as long as the keywords seven or up, essentially Google's telling me you're in the right place. So yeah, I don't... not for me. I think quality score is really important. I'm only recently getting back into it, really understanding the importance of the CTR, the ads being relevant, and then ultimately the page being relevant. Yeah. I ignored it for years and most people I know still ignore it. It's like a very, very, very last case when sometimes if you just look at it from the start, you get higher ranks, lower cost per clicks, which means you add show higher and it costs you less, more clicks, less money. You don't want to be that person optimizing from like nine to 10. It's like no, you optimize when it's like a three to like five or five to six or seven. Yeah. Anything under seven is a trigger to do something. Seven or above is diminishing returns for your time most of the time. I guess it's one of those things where you feel like you're on top of the account. You've done a lot of stuff on this account. It's like, you know what? I'm going to, this month, I'm going to analyze quality score and see if I can make some tweaks. He's put search partners and display still suck for lead gen. Yeah, pretty much search partners. Writing good ad copy. Yeah. I mean, against 101 and high converting landing pages. Yeah, 101 landing pages. Like if you were starting out in Google ads, what, what would be the advice and not to make this video go on too long, but it's get a flat get the foundations right in Google ads. But then you want to multi skill yourself. So you want to tack on some automation to speed up the process. But I said also, you really want to be good with landing pages. Yes. Just even knowing the fundamentals of a good performing landing page will put you in the top 10% because most people don't do it or don't even look outside. They don't look outside their Google ads accounts. They don't look at competitor ads. I used to be a bit like that years ago. Don't do any recon. You know, you got to recon the search on the scale. Well, I recorded another video today exactly about this. And my concept is 50% of success comes from in the account 50% outside of the account being it for the lead gen. So 50% of success is from the Google ads 50% from the landing page. The problem is with people is I'll spend the same amount of time and effort in the account getting a 1% return. When you put that same time and effort on a landing page, you get a 500% return 5x and that's standard. But so many people don't have the skill or it's a developer or somebody's doing the landing page. It's like, just get a landing page software. It's not that hard. People think that needs to be pretty. The best landing pages that work are not pretty. They just have the core elements. Good headline, good offer, good call to action, good hero image, and just being a good business. Simple as that. And actually just make sure that your headlines are lined with what people are searching for. You go to good offers so people contact you. A call to action so people take action. A hero image or images to know that your business or what's being served is actually relevant to what people are looking for. And that's it. Not that hard. And just like and tweaks like social proof near the call to action button. So your little star rating or whatever you're doing stars or whatever. Some of my landing pages are ugly as sin and like some of my best landing pages convert incredibly well like 40%. And it's just a shot image of me offering something. It's a headline. It's a few bullets. It's a clear call to action with the testimonial underneath it. You can't like exotic services. Exactly. And you can't scroll anywhere. Yeah. You're completely right. There's a lot of this outside and funnily enough, I think it was Chris Shu actually left us that big comment. I think he recorded a video very kindly about landing page optimization for another member. So I'm going to upload that inside God tier framework if you want to purchase because he literally went through what makes a great landing page showing off one of his I think it was before and after so brilliant. So some of the members are great because they share stuff like this. So Casper says evergreen. So if Google suggests it do the opposite. I mean he's kind of got a point. And then but Nikita she said Nikita mind all I hope I'm saying your surname right Nikita. She just said Google support has become utterly useless which yeah yeah it always has. I think that's the tragedy actually we used to have Google reps that were dedicated to the agency side and Google's even his premier partner we don't actually have someone dedicated anymore and yeah I think that's a loss for everyone but that's just Google skimming and trying to make more money and constantly chasing chasing next quarter isn't it. Wow well mate I reckon that was good. A lot of you can't say that it's got to be it's got to be everyone else that tells you it's good. So leave a like and a comment to tell us if it was good or not. Yeah well mate I enjoyed it. I think it's really valuable just to go over these things. So many people know it but not many people do it and you only get the results from doing. So if you've heard this a million times and you're not getting results you're the problem because you're not doing what needs to be done. Simple as that all of this stuff is what you've been talking about for years what I talk about in all my videos and simple as that if you just do this stuff you get results and then when you don't get results you do this stuff in a different way and you just keep engineering it. You're never going to get it right from the start you'll be arrogant to think that but it's just it's not a one-stop-shop but there are core fundamentals that will always work. Yes tough talk from daddy Nadalyn but yeah you are completely right. I think everyone wants a shortcut and you can't be proper work fundamentals and you don't have to work stupid hours like some of some people. I used to work stupid hours. It's not about the hustle it's about doing the right things at the right time applying yourself appropriately. Yes and then I'm going to say the same and stick this straight on my channel. I'm not even I'm going to be lazy not even cut it out so thanks for being on my channel Michael and thanks everyone for watching. Hit the like and subscribe because I put one video out a year. There you go. Nice man that was good. Salute. Awesome man. At least I've got a nice machine. And a nice pint of water.
