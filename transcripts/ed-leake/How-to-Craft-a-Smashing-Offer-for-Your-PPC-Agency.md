because then you'll probably get triggers like I haven't got time. And then it's like, well, look, let's have a call, see if I can do it for you. Of course, it's going to cost you money, but the outcome is potentially this. So I mean, it happens, doesn't it? Well, losing the Facebook for that client. So you know what the fix is, you need to get mobility leads coming in. And I know you're working on it. I know you're working on it. And you've not been very well. So it adds a bit more pressure. But you're you're working on the new landing page, the tweak, the revised offer going from the free audit, which we all agrees crap, to your new offer is way more enticing. So I think I'd be surprised if you can't run that on Facebook as an ad, get a few people into your funnel. And even if you have to manually tap them up in the by email and say, it's been three days, you downloaded blah, blah, blah, blah, how yeah, is it useful? Do you want to talk about it? Like, you could literally handball them at the start just to see what responses you get. Instead of a fancy funnel, because if you get five emails coming in, you could literally handball them and just see it just strike up a conversation because it while it can work, especially when you just want to get some bloody leads in. And you can do the same process on LinkedIn, of course. So yeah, you want to get that working for you, don't you? Exactly. The only holdups with that is my number two, she's been traveling, she's in she's just got to New York, she's getting married, and all this sort of thing. She said she would finish building that out on a PDF and like I've just given her just the bare bones material. She says, I'll make it sound good with a copywriting with screenshots and everything and put like just the header and footer and bolt that onto that one sheet that talks a little bit about us with a customer testimonial. And you know, it's even got embedded YouTubes in there of testimonial. So they'll read through that and then they'll see that the bottom maybe they might look at it. But yeah, once that's up and then just a few tweaks to the landing page where they can go and download it, you know, then we're off to the races as Dan Wardrobe would say. So and yeah, that's pretty much only yet. So once those two things are all start running ads, and I'll even look at, you know, maybe doing some quick YouTube ads as well, you know, very short 15 seconds video about it. Yeah, I did a video about it. And then who's done that? Michael's done that for his. He's got like a landing page blueprint, B2B blueprint, but also posted just posted flat out on LinkedIn. And even if you're connected to people that aren't appropriate for it, you might get some interest that way or start connecting to people that are in your target and then share that because you then can tap people again, it's tapping people up, you engage with it and message them saying, that's all you liked my bar. Did you download it? Yeah, if not, why not? Or just give them it in a message or whatever. You just want to get it working for you. Even if it's not as sexy as you want it to be, don't worry about that. Most people don't judge you based on the way you look. If we did, I'd be fucked. And you've seen you've sit down and you've, you've seen but you've seen like the quality of some of the stuff I put together. It's quite basic. And it but it works because it's about the content. It's about the message and it's about the piece of value you give them out the other side. Yeah, if you fully brand up, great. But that's six months down the line when you've got polish on it and it's actually working for you. So don't worry, get the logo on it and make, but in basics. But you'll be all right. You I think that new lead gen you've got is way better. It will entice a few people. You just got to get it out there. And you've probably got to be a little bit pushy to start with, like messaging people, replying to emails, just like pushy. Tell me about, you know, will this help you? Because then you'll probably get triggers like, I haven't got time. And then it's like, well, look, let's have a call, see if I can do it for you. Of course, it's going to cost you money, but the outcome is potentially this. So I think your, the general pushback will be all, yeah, it's interesting. I haven't got time to implement it, which is a perfect foot in the door for you. Jam your foot in the door and say, hey, I can do it for you.
