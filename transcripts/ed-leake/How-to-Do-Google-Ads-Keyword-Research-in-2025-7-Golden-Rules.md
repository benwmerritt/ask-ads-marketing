Hey, I'm Ed. Let's do proper keyword research without paying for tools. I've managed over 60 mil in Google ad spend so I can show you how to get the best out of Google's keyword planner. I'll be answering some common questions as I go and I'll give you some quick tips throughout the video. Intro done, let's crack on. To start we need a reason for doing keyword research. So I picked the first thing that came to my head beginning with A which was accountant. Today you and I are accountants but it really doesn't matter this process applies to any business. Let's work our way through my notes on the left hand side starting with paid tools. So I've used many paid tools in the past but I've never really been that convinced of their value. They make sense for SEO and content ideas but Google ads is about accuracy not just more keywords and to be fair Google gives you everything you need for free often more data than these tools can offer you as well. For example rarely do the paid tools give you specific location data beyond the country. None of these tools have clean and complete data on your competitors and spying on their keyword is overrated to be fair. So don't assume a competitor is making money bidding on those terms. They might be they might not be perhaps more importantly just because it works for them doesn't mean it'll work for you. You could argue on exception I quite like infinite suggest because it uses Google's own auto suggest data but even that touts itself as a never ending Google keyword suggestions which is the opposite of what you and I as advertisers want. It's good though for negative keyword ideas I'll give it that. If you're looking at these tools for a magic bullet on bids uh don't bother. Instead use Google's suggested bid as your barometer. It tells you how commercially viable that keyword could be and when it comes to initial keyword research nothing beats getting your hands dirty and doing the work because if you don't do it someone else will do it and they'll probably beat you. Before we dive into keywords I want to cover a fundamental step that too many people skip. You should be doing this for your own business or if it's your clients and let me just show you a sheet that I've got inside God Tier ads which is my product by the way but in here there's clarity. Who do we serve? Why are we doing it? You know what do we do for these people? Which areas of the business do we want to target and why should they choose us over our competitors? So I've just filled these in really quickly. Remember this is going to be for an accountant again it doesn't matter. So we're an accountant and we exist because we serve small businesses at a price they can afford. I want to focus sorry we as accountants you and I want to focus on payroll then small business accounting just to get a foot on the ladder and why should our prospects choose us over the mountain of competitors? Well we offer same-day bookkeeping and payroll runs at no extra cost incredibly exciting. In all seriousness you should answer these questions including the targets as well you know how many leads or sales do you want to generate and do this with your client or if it's your own business you should be doing this and also I highly recommend you actually do some competitor research literally googling your services for products and making notes of your competitors what they do what they offer what they call who actions are and that sort of thing. I know it's a boring exercise but it's really good for creating ideas and also making sure that you're not missing a trick. Yeah and always remember your goals because what's the point in doing keyword research and advertising if we don't have a goal which is a rhetorical question. With that done let's head back over to the planner. Okay first we need to enter our seed keyword so this is our category term we can take a look around and get our bearings so your seed keyword should have a decent volume it should provide additional long tail ideas as well so let's put discover new keyword accountant I'm in the UK so that's fine we don't need to enter a website address pit get results let's just close down refined keywords and then the things we need to check location targeting language search network so I start with search partners off you'll get cleaner data and you should only really use partners to expand your campaigns when you're found that they're working if you need to that is in terms of date range I use the 12 months because I like to see the trend over the year and then Google will hopefully recommend some broad in your search terms and they're really broad I rarely use these unless something catches my eye I give them a quick glance so we get a fancy little chart that tracks the search volume over the year pretty self-explanatory and when we apply filters later to the keywords this will adjust to show us the search volume you can apply some breakdowns to the the chart I don't really use the device one anymore and to be fair it's too soon for us to be reviewing the the location information we need to refine our keywords further first so before we start chopping away at the keyword data we really need to answer another question how do you find a high intent keyword we can categorize keywords three ways so low intent keywords would be uh navigational informational and we really want transactional so a transactional keyword identifies commercial intent without preference to you or your competitors I didn't make that up a friend of mine Josh did but he's not that smart so I assume he stole it from someone else but I like that I like that definition keywords that identify commercial intent without preference to you or your competitors we'll come cover competitor terms later again back to the planner so I just wanted to cover that off because we've got another question to to answer so on the topic of competition do you use the competition rating so this column competition not wishing to sound harsh but if you can't compete don't compete the exception being of course if you've got a low budget or if you're in a data gathering or testing phase at this stage keyword relevance matters far more than anything else so don't worry about the competition column but whilst we're talking about columns let's have a look at our options I mean we could even opt to remove competition get rid of that distraction but it's not important so for this example I'm going to leave it in place we can add some other commons columns if we so wish you can use organic impressions and positions to filter out keywords you already ranked for and you don't want to bid on those essentially that's to avoid overlap I'm going to assume that we're new in town so we don't have any organic traffic when looking at these keyword ideas your your seed keyword so accountant in our case you should have decent volume in order for them to provide additional long tail ideas with decent volume too if you start too long you'll miss loads of opportunities so this is a decent enough amount of volume we don't want to use the refined keyword tool at this stage because if we update the seed keywords it resets the settings you'll also miss a few negative opportunities if you start using this too soon and negatives are half the battle all right so what about bids let's cover off the question of top low versus high so don't expect your your bids to to be set at the low end and mop up all these searches so don't think that you're going to get 33 000 impressions on a 2 pound 51 or dollars or euros or whatever click if you want a quick approximation of where a sort of medium bid would be I use the low plus the high and then divide it by 1.8 so we whack the count on screen so here we do 251 plus 970 divide by 1.8 and that gives us a slightly high side so the expected bid is probably closer to seven pounds or dollars again or whatever your currency is that being said you shouldn't be setting bids based on what you can afford to bid or what I tell you to set your bids out or even what Google tells you to set your bids out you need to work out your ideal break even starting bid because it's your safe middle ground so once you see data and hopefully some conversions coming in then you can adjust bids and targets to suit on a established account you already know what converts what your conversion rates are and that will tell you what you should be bidding okay so keyword ideas before we dive through the recommendations let's fatten out our keyword selection if you weren't confident of the kind of terms we should be adding we could search for accountant and review the autocomplete suggestions let's have a look now so we can see accountant near me which is high intent so that's someone looking to take action now obviously if you're not interested in local then this is a potential negative keyword if you're national it still makes sense to have a location based campaign where you put well let's do a search for it where you put a local number in your call extension but also have your location extension so just make sure your advert hyper hyper local and more likely to get clicks so we can see from the organic search results which are a bigger tell often a bigger tell than the ads because anyone could put an ad up and they could be doing it wrong but these organic results show local accountancy firms and brands in the area so this is a high intent keyword so this is a positive sign let's add accountant near me to the list and because we're not stupid let's add some keywords that we know are appropriate so small business accounting throw that one in you're allowed to add up to 10 seed keywords here let's get results and review what we have now notice that google's most relevant highly suggested term is cpa i'm not so convinced so let's head back to the search and take a look and yeah as i suspected cpa is quite an informational term it's not really something we want to be bidding on so we can add that as a negative term but the annoying thing about the keyword planner if you go to keywords you have to manually add negative keywords which is obviously slower so i've got a bit of a hack hacky way of doing this so if we select the keyword we don't want now let's create a master negatives so this is just an ad group that you can add all your negative keywords to so when you download your plan later you've got your negative list we can add that as a broad so we're adding it to the plan so it's now a negative all right let's start doing some filters because we've got 726 keywords here so let's add a filter for keyword does not contain and for now let's just remove cpa let's assume we don't do anything or we don't want to see terms for that but it's also cut out some of these really low terms by using another filter for average monthly searches over 30 why because anything less than one impression a day on average is unlikely to trigger an ad and as we've already got hundreds of keywords it's going to help us look through these also we want to look for high intent terms i mean i don't want to scroll through all this thought so typically means higher cost don't think at this level you're going to find magic cheap keywords that are high converters to be honest with you they're very rare so don't try and don't try and cheat it by looking at all the cheap terms so we're sought by the top of page bid high range first and then we have a quick squizz at what's going on here now instantly i could see we don't have accounting and we have accountant i notice payroll well we do payroll so let's add those as well but of course you can check the search results if you're not sure but i'm pretty confident because it's what we do and then update again so we've still got 558 terms to to look through here which is plenty and to be honest with you we don't want to be checking each and every single one because it's not about how many keywords it's about finding the high intent keywords we can always expand later so now let's refine our keywords using the the refine keywords tool so importantly when you update your seed keywords it resets this filter that's why i haven't used it until this point so i'm seeing a lot of brand terms in here so let's expand this and untick and then retick non-brand so we've only got the non-brand terms for now let's just collapse that also this course that's google telling us it considers the semantic theme of these these keywords these terms as training and learning focus so i'm going to untick that as well get those out of the results that drops us down to 276 bit more manageable um we've still got the impression filter set to equal or greater than 30 you can use and we'll cover this later you can use dsa dynamic search ads to collect these low impression terms but if you do that you do need a robust negative keyword list and we'll be adding those as we go so let's carry on you might also be thinking why didn't i start with a website well because if you use a website to source your keywords the refine keywords filter isn't available it's only available when you use seed keywords not the website which is annoying i also wanted to show you the manual process because it makes sense to know specifically what you should be doing but if you do start with the website first before you refine your keywords then use the entire site obviously it gives you a more fuller picture it depends on your situation but the entire site here is absolutely fine typically you can also put your competitor websites in here and you can even find popular youtube videos on your subject matter so we might find a video on accounting and we can actually use that in here as well so you can put any kind of URL you want in to find keyword suggestions and the youtube videos are quite good if they've got lots of conversation and commentary going on just dismiss that and collapse that but again we're still at two two seven six so let's add some more keywords we're interesting payroll so let's do a keyword contains and payrolls oops let's weed this down a bit drops us down to 86 that's a bit more like it okay so we have if we're looking at term high volume stuff we've got services and we've got management and the immediate question is is this the same or a different ad group for these terms so the best way to look at this when adding keywords is to remember what the user sees so they see the advert and they don't see the keyword so would one advert serve both of these keywords okay and if we're not sure it's the same old check again we go back to google and we search for them so let's have a look okay so we can see that payroll services outsourcing outsourced outsource outsource so this again this is positive intent this is someone looking to outsource their payroll let's have a look at management I can spell it right now sage is software software software not software informational so we can see that management is biased towards doing it yourself i.e software whereas the service was more towards outsourcing so the answer here for me is these are two separate ad groups but I think we're going to focus on services because that's that's more relevant for our offering what we could actually do now before we start adding these keywords is put more filters in so let's edit it does not contain so let's put manage what else would be related in here a little system got online anything online is any good for us get rid of those let's scratch those what are we down to now just 78 which is not too bad oh as you can see it doesn't it doesn't work like that so what we'll do is change this to semantic so it should so manage should capture management let's do that there you go good so you don't have to put in every single variation the semantic option widens the net for you so we work down the list looking at our themes so we've got payroll services we've got outsourcing we've got solutions and again we can sort by bid to have a look international payroll well let's say we don't do that so again we can negative that we're not into international and because there's more than one term I would usually add it as a phrase so that's now in the negative list so and again you know what let's stick international in our filter so payroll services solutions outsourcing providers these are all thematically linked and they could be served by one advert that is if it's comfortable and appropriate to write an advert for outsourcing payroll for example so we might decide that services solutions outsourcing are all thematically linked now we can add these to a a new ad group payroll services for example so we create that ad group add them as an exact I always start with exacts unless it's a large account with established data then I'll exact and broad and then we add those to that ad group so once this ad group is up and running in the future and if we see significant differences so we just look at that ad group that we've added if we see significant differences in here with these keywords outsourcing services and solutions then we may decide to split the ad group so we can tailor the ad copy and the landing page more appropriately but I would say that these are when we look to the search results these are thematically linked so I think they're quite safe to to sit together in that ad group for the time being so yeah I add keywords as exacts they confirm or deny your thesis that it was a good idea to have that keyword in in the ad group in the account because they'll show you through the metrics they'll show you in conversion rates and so on you might consider adding a phrase or a broad if you're using smart bidding but my preference would be in 2021 for keyword match types exact and abroad especially if you're using smart bidding if you're not using smart bidding and you struggle to hit 30 conversions a month then I would be careful of broad keywords you really need to be on top of your negative negative keywords if you're using broad on low data and low volume accounts another simple rule about these keywords if you're unsure at any point and you google it and you're still unsure you just don't include it so let's jump across two grouped ideas because some of the work's already done for us so the annoying thing is when you refine when we use the refined keyword tool it doesn't apply to grouped ideas that's why I didn't jump straight into grouped ideas but your filters do impact the grouped ideas slightly annoying but hey her unfiltered grouped ideas are quite good for organic content ideas but for paid search we're not really interested in going after questions and informational stuff typically but again grouped stuff can be good for negatives so let's clear some of these filters away so we can see the complete list so let's get rid of the keywords the payroll and average searches so just clear this out okay so the most relevant group apparently is personal tax count well I'm not an accountant but I don't think that that's relevant to us at all we deal with small business and payroll and so on whereas this is personal tax and also look at the bids compared to what we've been seeing they're really low which is another tell that these are not not high intent keywords or they're not commercial viable they might be high intent for the the person who's doing their own tax but commercially they're not high intent for us so we could take this entire group and add it as a negative and we could do it as a phrase match as well so if we take negatives phrase done so we've squished that even though to be fair these are such low volume terms it wouldn't really necessarily trigger it doesn't matter that's nice and easy so within the download later we can pull off all these this master negative list so let's have a look at some of these financial accounting right here's a prime example of why grouped ideas cannot be added at face value so you can't just go in and add this as a as an account as an ad group it's low competition good volume and it looks cheap and you might be thinking well what's wrong with that it's low it's low competition it's loads of volume and it's it's cheap well not not so fast let's google this and find out yeah so we clearly see this not a high intent term it's no good for us this is very much informational investopedia wikipedia that's a big tell if you see wikipedia high up that's a big tell there's one ad by a massive company at the end of the day they don't care where they're advertising clearly because we've seen them crop up all the time so don't let that skew your opinion of the search result in fact use the the organic is a much better signal than seeing that one advert so back in guess what we're going to do not add the whole group we're going to add that as a negative in quotation marks we're adding it to our negative list so hopefully you get the idea i mean it's literally rinse and repeat going through the grouped list and through the keyword ideas list and keep adding them proper keyword research is not quick it's not throw stuff at the wall and see if it sticks i mean you can if you want the slightly quicker starting point start with a website and get some c keywords that way but then i would still pull them out put them in and then you can use the refined keywords option as well so it just gives you that extra granularity okay so quick recap see keywords by category and known intent use google auto suggest and related terms use your own websites use competitor websites and landing pages top organic results as well feed them in especially when the high intense stuff not informational use few topical youtube videos if you so wish group ideas pretty potent finding negatives as well as positives and yeah use that little hacky ad group for all your negatives keeps things easy so let's have a look at forecasts before we go on to a few other key areas like bidding on competitors so forecasts to look at this we go plan overview and here google will give you all the magic so it will tell you exactly how your business is going to fare we wish so how accurate are the keyword planner numbers and bids well the main use for the plan overview from my perspective is actually to see the locations and top locations so for example in the uk we might be interested in cities um this is this is probably probably encounters as well which are kind of like states in america i guess well not really states are like countries uh to someone like me um but this is more informational more useful than um the projections tool if you're going to use it though what i recommend you do is you copy your plan and then you go into your ad groups and you delete your master negative because it will use your master negative in your projections but in short why do i not trust the forecasting tool well i use my own spreadsheet because the issue i find with this forecast is it just doesn't or it rarely matches reality so you can put live data in it where you know the click through right you know the average cpc you know the impressions so on so forth and yet the projections don't agree with it and i've done that time and time again which makes me think well why use the forecaster so the the most accurate keyword data you ever get is from running ads and there's no other way around it this tool's okay if you already have an established account with historical data but i really wouldn't rely on it for anything other than a finger in the air for new accounts especially with low volume keywords the forecasts just they just don't match what you will see when you enter your beard and your budget and so on it just this doesn't this isn't reality so don't assume that things are going to transpire like this it either fills you with dread or false hope so instead base your decisions on your business fundamentals what you do is you you take your current organic or direct traffic conversion rate and you use that as your benchmark then you factor in your back end conversion numbers i.e. how well you convert for e-commerce that's essentially your return rate so if your return rate is five percent your back end conversion rate is 95 percent then you need to consider your product service margins you know how much you make after you pay for your advertising and also use those numbers to set your ideal bits don't use the tools to tell you what to bid your bid based on how much money your business is going to make out the back end so if you want my projection sheet just leave a comment and i'll stick a link in for you i also have a video walkthrough for it i'll share that link with you as well so yeah if you want the projection sheet just ask when you're finished in your plan overview or to be honest from any screen you can create campaigns but don't use that you can download all your ad groups and your keyword data which is the option i'd choose you don't want to create one campaign with everything in it it's highly unlikely well if that is the case then download everything first grab your master keyword list and then remove it the better option though is to download everything then you can either manually work through it or use ads editor and just in case you're not aware this master negatives would go under tools shared liary negative keyword list and then in here we'd create the keyword list and we just paste the the negatives in here and if i show you a negative keyword list you can apply it to any campaign you want simple okay what about all these juicy competitor terms we saw like sage into it quick books yada yada yada so bidding on competitors okay as far as the law goes if you don't mention trademark terms in your ad copy then it's fair game so a few things to consider when bidding on your competitors so if you're a me too i.e you're the same if you offer or do the same thing it's quite common to bid on competitor especially in the commerce space but be very mindful of brand preference you have to think like the searcher are they looking for a hoover or a vacuum cleaner are they looking for the brand or does it not matter and then the other brand sorry the other competitive bidding would be a scalper so you're similar you do something similar perhaps from a different angle and you want to lean on this other brand's demand so that looks like brand plus product or brand plus service i.e their brand then there is the just going straight for the exact brand so yeah bidding on a competitor's exact brand term um the pros are if you're it's an easy win if you're an established brand and you're genuinely an alternative and people would be considering you the negatives are high cpcs it's going to cost a lot but also the probably the biggest one people clicking your ad by mistake and then you get your competitors support phone calls and requests which does happen in addition if you're bidding directly on brand you need to be aware of their ecosystem which adds to your workload so so when they have a problem you stop bidding or when they run an offer you're aware of what's going on you can't really automate this sort of thing you have to keep an eye you know your ear to the ground so the other option is rlsa win them back so remarketing um against your competitors keywords so your remarketing list it's an entirely different topic but this is a no-brainer really you can dedicate a campaign to competitor terms uh where you target your audiences so they're not observations the only way your competitor terms will trigger your adverts are if you're they're against your audience if that makes sense let me say that again so the only way that your audience will see your adverts is if they search for the competitors and they're in your audience um all of this can backfire if the brand is much bigger than you and has a bigger cash pile they'll just turn their guns to you and and start advertising on your brand which is not always ideal so it's pros and cons i think the the best one is the rlsa so if people are looking for alternatives as well then certainly try competitor bidding but don't just do it as a matter of course which brings us neatly on to um adding additional negative ideas so competitor terms their contact information so brand plus contact brand plus uh support plus phone whatever it may be uh if you've got a lot of local competitors just have a look on the maps and you can take their company names and negative those if you don't want to be found for your local competitors that's an easy one location negatives really obvious if you don't want to be seen in london negative london out and burrows and post codes and whatever you can think of uh google predictive search this is to be fair this is where infinite suggest is good because it will show you all the predictive information and you can sort through looking for negative ideas otherwise you have to do it yourself keyword uh space a look at the suggestions and then do it for bc and the rest of the alphabet of course and the other one is to put your competitor brands URLs through the keyword planner and see if there's any negative ideas uh by using their website in keyword ideas start the website and put them through here and see if it gives you any um suggestions and that should really cover it for negatives i mentioned dsa well dynamic search ads work for me so i used uh dynamic search ads to hoover up all these long tail um low volume keywords for example if we put a filter in here and we do less than let's say 50 still leaves us 184 um search terms in here now obviously a lot of these won't be relevant but you're building out negatives the fact is there will be more than this uh there will be more than this so you use dsa to capture the lower volume long tail terms but will it work for you again another easy test to know if if dsa is going to work for you is when you put your website through the keyword ideas use pages so put specific pages in and then review the suggested keywords that come through from google don't use your entire website for this use individual pages and you just have to look at the keyword ideas and see if they are relevant or otherwise if these keywords are not relevant then that's a red flag that dsa might be a problem for your website and then i've put together some if we scroll down some golden rules just to recap i'm sure they're more than seven but these are a solid start so less is more um you want the most relevant highest intent keywords you don't want to just be throwing every keyword at it number two focus as much time on negatives as you do positive keywords this is really important in smaller accounts to be honest in fact sometimes a small account can have more negatives than it has positive keywords three avoid i put 50 here but under 30 impressions so you want equal or greater to 30 impressions per month per keyword particularly if it's an exact match otherwise you're just going to fill your account with loads of low impression keywords that chew up your time to manage keep our groups to a maximum of 15 20 keywords now this is including all match types so if we had five exact keywords for example and then we we included those same keywords as broads that would be 10 keywords and even then you know seven or eight keywords with two match types you're getting to the limit there i you don't want too many keywords because you got to remember the whole what the user sees you know they look at the advert they don't see the keyword is that one advert and the landing page relevant to all those keywords that's when you start splitting out your your ad groups if if you can't answer that question with a yes for number five you want to have at least one ad group per unique landing page so your landing page for a specific service or product or variation or whatever it may be now depending on how complex your offering is this might be too much to ask but the golden rule is one ad group per unique landing page and then number six is use exacts first for controlled testing growth unless you have an established account with proven data then you can use both an exact and abroad and number seven cast a wide net with dynamic search ads which is great for scaling it's like it's it's a cheat it's easy if your website works with dsa then it's a great way to scale okay it's q and a time so i asked my facebook group to ask questions around the keyword plan and keyword research so let's take a look see some of the questions in hither so james is asked let's cover competitors please thank you jim um i've already covered that one in detail i think so yeah so let's jump to to mike sorry james let's have a look so mike said find a lot of people ask about how accurate the numbers are even keyword planner volume bid or in say semrush they want to know how much to believe those numbers should they set bids based on the data etc thank you mike um i've already answered these but a quick recap would be i don't trust third party tools because um i don't trust their data especially when google struggles as well so google's data is not always precise so how how the third party's expect to be any better well it's a it's a rhetorical question that one so the main reason these numbers are so hard to project is that they're based on a moving target the auction and the ad rank so i use my projections i'm not by the way mike i know i'm not answering you directly mike because i know you're a you're an expert um so i use my projection spreadsheet because it's simple it it's anchored around search impressions as well and the business metrics search impressions are arguably one of more constant things and the business metrics are the business metrics so calculate your ideal bid and let a rip as they say so belinda asks how deep do you go into relevant keywords for a client do you assess potential traffic versus keyword volume and estimate the keywords needed to use budget or go all in knowing if their budget grows you have spare volume ready and waiting thank you belinda okay so on the first point i'm assuming you mean a prospect because once they're paying you going deep on keyword research should be your default approach really i've never given a prospect my keyword research because that's money and they haven't paid any so instead i would give them projections based on on the research you've done but not reveal the data so you don't give them all the keyword research for free so it's a bit carrot and stick perhaps but i think it's it's reasonable i i've used a variation of my projection spreadsheet for years now it works it it sets the stage and it works which i've said already so just thinking about your question just trying to split it up in the head so when it comes to budgets yeah so a big mistake we've made over the years is allowing the budget to dictate the work so this is really true of startups and small businesses especially growing businesses so it should never be about spending the budget for the sake of it because that forces your hand to find more traffic for the sake of traffic so i i highly recommend in this situation you do a discovery campaign where client might pay for pay for your time and you focus on a narrow area with a fixed fee in a budget so you use this as a 30 day trial or pilot to see if it's worth expanding the cool thing about doing a discovery is it saves a lot of pain and it relieves well it relieves pressure on you because you you and the client have committed to a test so it has a beginning and an end essentially the end might be a full stop or if the numbers are decent it might be the expansion into a full campaign and ongoing management i hope that answers the question belinda so uh mathias sometimes i'm having a bad time when any relevant keywords have very low search volume my first idea is to tell the client dude your stuff isn't getting searched would appreciate other ways to go yeah thanks mathias this is a common issue particularly in um niche and b2b markets where they just well often there isn't the sufficient search volume so honestly don't try and force it um similar to my previous answer you should have started with a discovery campaign now i know that's easy to say you're probably already started so uh one one thing b2b usually has going for it is strong order and lifetime values that means you can afford multiple touches and having a little patience with it so if the demand isn't there in the search volumes you can't just create it you can't create the demand google is presenting you the demand that's there it's it's finite so instead what i would suggest is that you remarket content to prospects that come from all channels so your analytics audiences from all your different channels share case studies white papers videos or whatever content you have that explains something and shows value and you can do that with remarketing of course but even better you could try and get them to opt into something something of value that will help them and then nurture them through the email so take them off the search engine and um yeah don't be afraid to put money into marketing the content because it really does work hope that answers the question okay so luke says when to use broad match i've covered this but my simple rule is start with exacts gives you more control um over spend and the query match obviously for for new and small accounts if you're not using smart bidding and if you struggle to hit 30 conversions a month just be careful with broad match so your negatives need to be really good it's not unusual as i said earlier to have more negatives than positive keywords in a small account well it's not for me anyway yeah so on the established account side i'd include and i do include broad keywords if you're using smart bidding or automated bidding and you're already getting results and you've got some headroom so you've got budget to to spend you want to scale um phrase match obviously if word order is important but otherwise i'm really not that bothered by phrase that's why the latest google keyword match update doesn't really bother me and uh my clients our clients because phrase has been performant it's been the performance lagger now for years uh we've seen better results with broad quite frankly so in short i've seen really good results from broads but only if you do really good negative keyword we uh work in other words don't blame broads burning through money if you can't be asked to to keep on top of negatives i don't mean you personally luke um just general comment thank you okay so jeff said general advice on when to pull the plug on a keyword if it seems to be very relevant but isn't giving you good numbers what is typical or advisable in terms of volume for keywords in ad groups campaigns to keep sanity of management example i have an account that has 1500 keywords but only the top 50 have more than five impressions a month the top 50 have oh okay right seems like a good idea just to ignore the others uh looking for advice from experienced ppcs right jeff this is the fat one so let's break it down first question when to pull the plug on a keyword that you think is relevant the simple fact is you need to do a better job of convincing people in the ad and the landing page unless it's an exact an exact match then you can review the search queries obviously for for negatives to try and reduce the cost but if other terms around it and inside the account are converting your then you're absolutely sure that this keyword is buying intent and is relevant then it's it's got well it's more than likely the website a few things to consider really important questions to to objectively ask of the destination page and you have to really be objective first of all add to landing page message match gotta be one to one if you want the best impact make sure you focus the landing page on a single purpose or a single message so one message to one person to one you know for one reason a headline super important as you know but can can anyone understand the page in six seconds when i mean anyone i mean a lay person like me if i've got no prior knowledge of your niche or your industry is it clear who the company is as well is their branding because i've seen that in the past people strip back their landing pages to the point where there's no there's no branding you know even removing things like phone numbers and stuff like that which are trust signals is it pushing usp's benefits not just features you know just even if it's simple like before and after or bullets yeah so what they get before and after you know i can before and after state of mind or situation that works well don't use stock images which i know is easier said than done especially for client hasn't got the budget but if you do use stock images try and get them from somewhere that doesn't look like their stock images uh clear call to action what do you want someone to do you don't want them to submit trust signals testimonials reviews ratings any accreditations i mean there's literally hundreds of things you can make sure the landing page does but yeah that hopefully that's helped answer the question i'm losing my voice now um in terms of the other part of your question what is typical or advisable in terms of volume for keywords i covered this earlier but low volume keywords just add bloat so in your rank example you've got you don't have 1500 keywords you have less than 50 so you need to pause anything with less than 30 impressions add the remaining terms as exact negatives to a dsa campaign and let the dsa loose to capture those tiny impression terms it really really isn't worth your time trying to manage a thousand plus keywords that generate so few clicks each month they're literally the perfect case for dsa so thank you jeff um rob suggested how to assess keywords volume plus cost per click with smaller budgets yeah i think i've covered this rob i've come at bids and volumes from multiple angles now so i think i've covered that off and then leon how you how do you assess each keyword for top of funnel middle of funnel bottom of funnel right okay so similar to my reply to uh mathias i'd be looking at what content assets you can show for top of funnel and middle of funnel so you need to address the user sees in the search because it's not about the keyword the only thing the user sees is the advert i keep saying it so can you make your advert relevant and enticing enough that they will click when they're looking for top of funnel term so when they're at the informational term stage and then can you give them value once they click an advert instead of an organic result which they would um typically click and does it make sense for the business to be paying for this anyway so beyond that it's macro micro conversions but reverse engineer it so for example in analytics you'd create segments for micro conversions and then you would review how many macro conversions you see in the segment so this validates your assumption that someone who for example visits the pricing page watches 50 of the video validates that they're a good prospect and that you want them in an audience why would you redo this well because if you see that 30 percent of your buyers perform these two specific actions then that makes sense to have a segment or an audience or a micro conversion for those two things i hope that makes sense if you start measuring everything as segments or audiences first then you have the option of understanding these uh tofu top of funnel terms and if they're helping or hindering so you can check attribution you can review the the top of funnel terms with first versus last click in the attribution and you can do that over quite a long window as well like 45 to 90 days oh thanks Liam okay so before my voice really evaporates kevin is asking what's the rationale for having multiple keywords that could be triggered by the same query e.g. because they're match stacked uh synonyms or contain some of the same terms i'm asking because this is common practice but i don't understand the rationale so i i assume you mean the same ad group well i mean really it's it's an expansionist strategy i personally use exact and abroad in the same ad groups uh same keyword two match types so my exact will take take the prize the click uh unless the broad beats it in the auction so you have control and some certainty with the exact match and then the broad gives you additional volume and cheaper associated clicks and it might not convert as well but it's often will come out in the wash the clicks are that much cheaper you still keep on top of your negatives of course but i mean i look at exact and abroad like batman and robin not daffy and celeste so that's a different thing though to misrooting which i'm not sure if you're asking misrooting is where multiple ad groups and campaigns can trigger for the same query so that's a very amateur thing to do unless you're testing some kind of hypothesis of course but it's it's it's also quite common to have misrooting in an account you should have one advert with a variation or two that best serves that query you should send people to one page best serves that advert when you start cannibalizing this continuity and competing internally with in your account you're losing control and you're losing performance if that's the case then one of those keywords will be beating the other the keyword with the better stats should stay and the other keyword should go it's as simple as that you could argue if it's if it's relevant so these keywords that are in separate groups or campaigns are relevant you move the weaker performing keyword to the winners ad group so you don't lose that volume so yeah misrooting terms they really hurt performance that's why i put the auto match type two negative list script in in god tier ads because that helps to a certain degree so thanks kevin edgar edgar asks how do you go about grouping similar keywords such as auto accident attorney auto accident lawyer etc would you group these two keywords together or keep them separate what determines your decision thanks edgar i think i've answered this whilst working through the keyword planner but to to iterate you you must think about the advert the searcher sees it sounds like i'm repeating myself i know sorry but that that is the only thing they see so they're not concerned about your keyword or my keyword you need to look at it from the perspective of would your one advert makes sense for both auto accident attorney and lawyer if you're not confident of the answer then obviously you need to search both terms and review the ads and the organic results so google will give you a breadcrumb to follow here it's especially true if it serves a different organic result because google's trying to provide the most relevant result and you should obviously do the same with your advert so that said you could come from the other angle here if one of these terms is really low volume and doesn't deserve your time or you know managing it separately because there are thousands of other keywords then you do have the option you can use dynamic keyword insertion in the advert but if you do this you must be confident that the the landing page is appropriate for both queries for attorney and lawyer so it's a that's a trade-off between efficiency and performance i hope that answers the question edga rob says how will keyword research be affected and what adjustments will need to be made now that changes to match type are coming again i think i've covered this one rob as you probably saw i didn't use phrase match i mean i'll test phrase match but uh it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth do you see exact and broad batman and robin so just for anyone that doesn't know broad match modified is becoming phrase so if you didn't use phrase before then this is a push from google to get more people into broads because essentially what it's doing is saying you can't use broad modified it's going to turn into a phrase a lot of people don't want to use a phrase or don't need it and therefore maybe considering moving to broad from broad modified so you probably do need to move broad modified to broad if you don't have exacts obviously move to exacts as your first option again it comes down to volume and your appetite for spend etc etc so if you're going straight to broad and you have enough data you should be okay but do it slowly so keep on top of your negatives switch portions of ag you know ag group at a time or campaign at a time depends how big your account is but engrams are really important now as well that's why uh plug we're releasing search query steroids on advolver next week because it's essentially shows you search query trends over the year six months uh past quarter and then month so it shows you how the engrams are performing uh in specific time segments never seen this been done before it's really potent very useful and it's quite timely considering what's going on so i got something right yeah thanks for the question rob so john which tool uh you find it best for discovering competitive competitor ads keywords thank you so i've covered this one multiple times now john i think you probably know my opinion on these third party tools so sorry doesn't mean i'm not answering your question but i think i've already answered it a few times and eddie said pick me no eddie okay i think that just about covers it so did i miss anything it's been a long video if i missed it ask your question in the comments if you want to reply and if you're mad enough to have sat through this whole thing and you're full of information how about getting even more so i've got a proven process and structures for google ads and you need to check it out it's called god tier ads and you need to check it out because i'll put the price up again soon so here's the advert i've been ed leak you've been very patient don't forget you know don't forget to hit like and subscribe i'll revisit this video when google removes manual bidding and keywords from your account you think i'm kidding anyway bye for now cheers
