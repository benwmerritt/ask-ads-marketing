And yeah, just have money, doesn't need to be a lot, coming into my bank account each month, but I don't really have to do an awful lot for. Retire early, chill out. The New York Times The New York Times The New York Times The New York Times So on paper, I think he was a good fit because it's lead gen, which is what I'm focusing on. It's a decent-sized company, he's got a decent budget. But again, now that's just something that I've realised that actually, you know, the kind of people I want to work with are not people necessarily who own the business. It's sales managers, marketing managers with a big budget that they've just got to spend, and haven't got time or the knowledge to do it themselves. Yeah, it's a tricky one because that... It's very difficult to see that kind of person before you work with them, i.e. the over communicator. I don't think they necessarily highlight themselves in the pre-calls and... Yeah, that's true. You can't... I don't think you can easily qualify that or know that of someone, you learn that of them when you start working with them. But just be quick to reinforce your rules. And if they get unhappy at that, then it's, you know, you depart ways, don't you? So I just be... Yeah, just learning from experience on that one, I would get... If you haven't got it in your contract or your agreement or you're onboarding, if you haven't outlined how you work, I'd be very... I'd be sure to reiterate that or make sure that that is there for the next one that comes on because otherwise... You've got nothing to lean on in this situation if you don't do it to say, look, this is what we agreed in terms of communication. Sure, if you've got a panic on one day, get in touch, but don't email every day telling me that you've had one less phone call or whatever because that's not productive. That is a nightmare client. Most of my clients I barely hear from. So I think I'm quite lucky in that respect. I've come to that place, I don't hear from at all. You know, I send them the monthly report and... I know, we're the same and some people worry about that. But I'm like, yeah, but they've been doing it for two years. I'm not that worried. If it's a new client, then I'll probably be more worried. But yeah, just keep on top of that. The thing is though, we've leased coming in because you're doing your thing, you're doing your content marketing essentially. It gives you the confidence to be able to fire painful clients, of course, because it's easy saying, oh, don't stand for it. But if you need it for cash flow, it's very difficult to let someone go. Yeah, that's my plan. So I've got about 14 clients at the moment and I'm at capacity really in terms of just like, the mental load of knowing, being able to do it all myself. I did that plan, I think on your, was it your profit fix formula sort of thing where you rank all your clients? So you're, because you're doing lifestyle, you don't want to hire and grow and hire and grow. You're more the lifestyle approach, aren't you? Yeah, yeah, I definitely want to be able just to be sort of, to different because I'm part-time anyway. And, you know, I like to continue to be part-time when both kids are at school. I'd like to then reclaim some of that time for myself. You know, quite like the kind of work-life balance that I've got at the moment, but I definitely want to be at the point where I can dip in, manage it, maybe be the face of the business, you know, the one running the sort of the business side of it. Because that's the, I enjoy that part actually more than the Google ads really. And yeah, just have money, doesn't need to be a lot coming into my bank account each month, but I don't really have to do an awful lot for. Retire early, chill out. Retiring is boring, but yeah, that's essentially what I... Oh, I've never made it to do. Well, you've got children, I don't. I guess they keep you busy. But yes, that's what I've churned my agency into. The money comes in and I have a conversation once a week with my lead guy is pretty much what it's boiled down to now. So it is definitely doable. Definitely doable. Okay, so it's working for you. Good stuff.
