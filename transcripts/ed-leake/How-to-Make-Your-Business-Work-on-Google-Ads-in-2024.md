If you're just focusing on the ads, you're fucked. So when people join the Facebook support group for God Tier Ads, I asked them what's their biggest headache at the minute with Google. And it is very interesting. I was looking at the most recent issues and a lot of them around profitability, increasing CPCs, black box campaigns, scaling. A lot of people are complaining about costs, you know, high CPAs, struggling to hit ROAS, making a profit, you know, making a profit. It's like that's not the fault of Google. It happens. That's a business concern. You know, if you can't afford the clicks, then you have to resolve the reason. Is the product not good enough? Are you an incredibly competitive market? Well, what are you doing that's better than the others? For Ecom in particular? I think that was Ecom because he mentioned ROAS. There's a lot of pain around making money. So if you can't afford to play the game, you can't afford to play the game. You have to you have to you can't just do Google Ads and assume it's going to work. You need to make the bloody business work. So you need to do all the anything you can do outside of that to make the business work first. Especially if you're just starting out as well with a new business. You should be not spending money on ads unless you've been, you know, if you've got capital behind you, you've been funded fair enough. But, you know, don't set up a drop shipping store and then wonder why you can't make money because you're spending $10 a day on Google Ads. It's the world's moved on. That was a decade ago you could get you could get by doing that. I set up a dropping a drop shipping store two months before Christmas about a decade ago. Drop shipping crap from AliExpress and I made like 27 grand. It was amazing. And I did it whilst running the agency. I did it for fun to show my team what could be done. And also I wanted to set up an actual e-commerce shop. Too many fucking ideas, not enough time. I wouldn't be able to do that now. And I was drop shipping leggings, by the way, so like Christmas leggings. People went wild for them. I can't believe I admitted to that. But yeah, it was just really a test to prove that it could be done, but you can't do it now. You cannot do that now. People need to move away from these old internet marketing ideas of just like something for nothing. You know, just set up some ads. It's really easy. People are saying it's easy drop shipping this. Advertising is like real business now. It's like investing. It's and it should be traded like investing. It's not like buying penny stocks or doing crypto. It's like hardcore investing. You're allocating money to get results. It's more competitive. Costs are going higher. People are making a lot of money. And that's why it's getting more expensive. If the numbers are not working out for you, it's usually a business numbers issue where the economics are not stacking up. And it's usually not the ad account. It's usually your conversion rates. It's usually the economics, average order values, lifetime values. The customers, there is so many things. Exactly. Exactly. Ecommerce was like easy. I was saying this to my mate today where, you know, he set up a store years ago and he's like, I just set it up, got a 3x ROAS, you know, ran it for ages. And that was like Facebook. He was saying, but now you can't just set up a Shopify store and just run some Facebook and Google ads. Like you need to really have everything honed in. And even if it works, it's only going to work for a while. Ad costs are going up or people are going to steal your ideas because they're a really smart, sophisticated people online who were just looking for businesses that are getting popular. They just reverse engineer it and just cut in and just grab that market share as well. Amazon does it with it, with its basics line. When it sees something selling well, it'll get it on Amazon basics and just recreate the product. They are vicious, but that's the world we live in. I mean, to count what you just said, you can be lucky if you've got the top 1% product that everyone wants or this, sorry, there's a certain demographic or audience that really wants that thing and it's very unique. But that's just a first move as advantage and people will catch up and replicate it.
