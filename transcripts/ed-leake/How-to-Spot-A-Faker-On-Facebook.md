Emily sent me a message on Facebook, she's frustrated. She's frustrated because her main competitor, another boutique fashion outlet, is getting thousands of likes and hundreds of engagements on every post on Facebook. However, on closer inspection, after I took a look on Emily's behalf, I saw they were up to no good, essentially. To me, it looks like they're buying fake followers and post engagements, but how do I know this? So I'm doing this video to enable you to investigate with these three simple tips to see if a page, one of your competitors, is faking it on Facebook. Number one is inconsistent engagement. So simply scroll down their page and look for posts with either very little or no engagement whatsoever, and then ask yourself why that is. How can this personal page go from, say, zero engagements to 500 in the blink of an eye? Because, well, they're probably faking it. Number two, their engagement ratio is just weird. And what do I mean? So if their posts are getting, say, 50, 100, or, you know, hundreds of likes, but little to no comments, then that's just not right. So yeah, a big tell is that their share volume sucks. If there are hundreds of likes and no shares, that just shouts fake. Now, number three is the biggest tell of them all, hidden comments. You have to remember that when people buy likes and followers, it's from a bot farm and fake account farms that are typically in the Middle East and Asia, and some in North Africa. So these bots will often post random comments, spam links, or just plain old gobbledygook. Essentially, unintelligible comments. So, you know, single word replies are quite common as well from fake accounts. You know, hello or good. Something that doesn't really make sense. You know, you wouldn't just post that. So why is this the biggest tell? Because these comments are often automatically hidden by Facebook or manually hidden by the page owner. If you see a post listing a number of comments, you know, it could be 5, 10, 20, whatever. But when you click on it, you only see one or perhaps no comments, then that's another really telling sign of fakery. You know, fake it before you make it. It's bullshit. They're only harming their own page because Facebook algorithm will give them no organic visibility of their posts. So that literally leaves them two options. They make more fake nonsense to make themselves look good, or they have to pay through the teeth to get engagement because they can't advertise to their own page likes because their own page likes are junk. It just hurts their pocket. It can hurt their branding and, you know, in the long run, it will hurt their reputation. So leave them to it. And that's it. Three simple tips. So I hope that helps you sleep easier at night, Emily. All the best. Cheers.
