## Transcript
Anyone could do an audit and find anything because an account is never perfect. There's always a stone to unturn. You're watching a highlight from Agency Forge with me, Ed Leake, exclusive community for PPC agency owners to stop about in those other groups and join agencyforge.com application only, terms and conditions apply, etc. So yeah, so you keep it straightforward and you use the project management software essentially to trigger a recurring. Yeah, or any like ad hoc stuff will pop it in there as well. But as simple as possible, really. Is your setup Tim more complicated? Your clicker? Well, it's not too complicated. Like the speed reports are done and they're a bit more expanded than yours because my PPC guy thought it was just too simple. He wanted to show more metrics and then explain on a weekly basis. Now we have a weekly meeting and he goes through and talks through for each one of us. We've only got four or five accounts, so it's not massive. All done within about half an hour, maybe three quarters of an hour. Sorry, is that weekly with you or the client? Well, weekly, just internals and internal meeting between as manager and my PPC manager and myself. We'll just go through where we're at and we'll have like a mini strategy session, but thinking about splitting that into two smaller ones in the week, like I've stand up on a Monday and then a check in, tell us the week results on a Thursday and let us know why you haven't implemented what you're supposed to for that week. What was the hold up? We're using more the click up on the internal PPC guys, the Google ads guys. When we want, okay, what are we going to do in here? What are we implementing? Okay, let's set up a new performance mix. We've put that in the day and then they might not have gone and checked off the status to say they're actively working on it. Like what's going on? You haven't started? Yeah, we started that already. Okay, well, one is check it off then and then they'll forget to tick it off. Again, say it's done. You know, so it might have been implemented, but I wouldn't have known. So I filled it in and then I want them to notify or hear a notification that has come through. But yeah, that's essentially what's been happening with my project management tool. It sounds like you do have to go in and check up, even Sam and Dale are having to go in and check up to make sure if it's not ticked off or something slipped through, is it genuinely slipped or they just forgot to tick it off from an operation perspective. So the client finding stuff, I mean, taking two steps back here, let's be honest. If someone's savvy, they'll always find something. It's why the free audit is so ubiquitous in the industry because anyone could do an audit and find anything because an account is never perfect. There's always a stone to unturn. So if you've got a client that's itchy to look, they'll find something. Stop trying to scale your agency on your own. It's a lonely pursuit. It's boring. It's tiring. It gets your blood meds. Join agency forge.com, a community mastermind training from like minded PPC agency owners and myself, Ed Leake. I was going to follow that up with the dot com, but I'm not a dot com on a real person. Go check it out.
