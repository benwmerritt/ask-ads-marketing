Just diagnosing this smart bidding issue. So running target CPA the bid is set at the ag group level 24 to 26 euros. Unfortunately over the past 30 days it's hitting 39 euros a lead and the leads need to be really 30 euros or less to be comfortable for this account. So the question is do we have a bid issue or is this a targeting issue? Well the simplest way to answer that is to benchmark against the rest of the account. A situation where it may be a keyword or targeting is where you see a lower conversion rate, a lower click-through rate and potentially a higher average CPC. So you'd simply drop back to the account overview and you'd look. So I'm looking at all search campaigns and I can see the average cost conversion is around about 27.5 euro and 22.6 percent conversion rate which is not an issue for this campaign. So that tells me that this is potentially a bidding issue. If you're seeing much lower conversion rates then it's more than likely not going to be fixed by bidding. So that's where you have to use your a brief analysis. Benchmark your situation, this campaign, this ad group, even a keyword across like-minded ad groups and campaigns. Benchmark that situation so you know that you haven't got a targeting issue before you start trying to fix things with your bid because bids can't fix a targeting issue. So what do we do? We benchmark against the account conversion rate. That helps us understand our CPA. So what we do is simply under divided by whatever our conversion rate is. Let's call it 28th, round it down. So we need three and a half clicks. Again let's round up. We need four clicks for a conversion. So the first thing we need to do is take our target CPA divided by four. So we can afford to bid 7.5. As you can see the average bid from the smart bidding is actually 11.3. So we're quite a chunk over. Now how do we combat this? Because we are not budget limited and it appears that we are bid limited but we're still overbidding. I think we're going to have to switch to a portfolio strategy because with the portfolio strategy even if we're running it against a single campaign we can actually set a maximum bid. So I'm just going to call this TCPA test and what's the date? Just for my reference here, 13th April. I'm going to leave the target at what we're hitting. We're hitting about 30. So I'm going to leave the target at 29 which is just shy of the happy point, 30. Save that. So this is now going to apply a new bidding strategy. Just drop back to the ad group. Okay so we need to set a bid limit. So to do that we go to tool settings, bid strategies and we pick out our new strategy in here which is a target CPA bid strategy. Set it 29. We drop through to the bottom under settings and then advanced options and we have a min and we have a max bid limit. So we know that we can afford from our calculator 7.5. So we know the average as well is 11.2 so 11.3 but that is a significant drop. So now we have a trade-off. We're going to lower the cost per click which in turn should reduce the... So long as our conversion rate remains constant should lower the cost per conversion. However there is quite a bit of volume of conversions coming through here. 296 so 10 conversions a day and this is the trade-off. Across the account are you happy with the volume of conversions at the current average CPA? Can you afford for this individual campaign to overrun in order to get more volume? So this is where you have to use a business logic to this. I'm going to say that actually we can't afford to do this because it's... 40 euros is far too much. So I'm actually going to set the maximum bid at a halfway house. So I'm going to go in at... 9.4 so let's go in at 9.40 as our maximum bid. So I'm meeting it halfway. This is because I don't want to shock the system too heavily. As you can see these bids are way higher than 7.5 which is our ideal bid. So I don't want to shock the system. I don't want to reduce this campaign down to no conversions or just a handful of conversions. So we're going to... Especially as the entire account is hitting targets. So this is more about refinement.
