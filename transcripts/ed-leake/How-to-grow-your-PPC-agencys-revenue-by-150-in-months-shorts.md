## Transcript
Within about two to three months of actually being in the forge my company revenue increased by 150% I've been doing Google ads for so long. But this actually gave me a framework to unlock what success looks like and how to actually get to my own success and it was actually quite effortless. The reason why is the information in the education is so clear it's made for PPC agency owners not PPC specialist PPC agency owner so the business insights the business operations and how to do it for PPC. The only reason I joined this mastermind is because it was specifically for me and Google ads or a PPC agency owner. I cannot recommend how good this is the information the videos and the training in there is outstanding. But what I think has been way more important is actually speaking to Ed one on one who I've been following for about seven years now.

These are real people you get to ask them specific questions and you get specific personalised feedback.
