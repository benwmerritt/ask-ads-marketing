What is the thing I could immediately do right now that will likely increase exposure, traffic, you know, that sort of thing, take the top products that are 80% of your sales, go in right now and get better titles, description, AI descriptions is phenomenal now. And you can like give it a bunch of information about like identify the audience and then write this and keep it under 5,000 characters, but like put the most important, you know, information within the first 150. Just doing some of those basic things, getting your product type in there, it really just gives Google additional information. Don't make yourself professional. Kirk is the third. Oh, is he? Is it? 123. Yeah, number three. Yes, but you did the other who's counting matching his position on the top 50. Is he number three? I believe I think you did finish third, right? Kirk. Yes. This is not acceptable. That means I, and based on what I saw about the voting, I didn't get there through my voting and through votes. And I was like, I'm kind of proud of that. Like I feel like I earned it. Oh, thanks. I'm only on the list because of voting. It was kind of... Oh yeah, you were one ahead of me last year and this year I've dropped. I had a good year last year, but obviously not good enough. Number one. Super important. It is directly related to revenue I found. That's a joke. Yeah, I don't, I do wonder if it makes any difference. It's got to make a little bit of difference to notoriety, but I don't know because you've got your own audience. I've got my own audience and I think we all live in our own little bubbles. I look at it purely as a brand lift sort of a thing. It's just like people will be like, how, you know, oh, do you land clients all the time from conferences or speaking or writing? And it's kind of like, I mean, on one hand, no. On the other hand, yeah. I mean, you know, we'll get leads where it'll be like someone's like, oh, hey, I read your book, right? So yeah, you'll see. That's my old one, by the way. That was no longer in print. I pulled that out of print. So actually that's probably worth a lot of money as a campus. Yeah, it's even signed by Kirk, though I signed it. I wrote this. This old annoyed Gil because he came on. I've got his book, but I didn't show his book. So sorry. Sorry, Gil, if you're watching this. It was an interesting book and that was five years ago. But yeah, so you don't find we're kind of going off piece already. We're not even this is fine. We can this can be part of it and the info can come after because I think I think it's actually interesting because you do a lot of speaking, whereas I'm too timid to go on stage because I feel like I'll say something that will offend half the audience and maybe get put in a woodchipper at the end. But do you find it so you don't necessarily do it for leads? Surely you do it for leads or is it brand building for the agency? There are multiple motivations that go into it just like for all of us. Number one, I enjoy traveling. Number two, I do enjoy like learning and presenting and speaking. But these are not in order of importance. These are in order of what I'm thinking of, by the way. Yeah, I mean, and then there is kind of that brand lift thing like we discussed. It all adds up, right? It all adds up into things like the top 50, you know, all that stuff kind of, I just find that it helps kind of maintain this overall inbound lead marketing thing that is part of like how we get leads. And I just don't really have direct attribution tied to where specifically those leads are coming. And at this point, I've just kind of given up trying to care and I'm just again more going for that like just, you know, get my brand out there, keep turning out content and the leads kind of keep coming. And so I'm just going to keep trying to do that. Yeah. Not very scientific. Not danger. You like traveling. I don't like traveling, which explains why I don't do it. And you enjoy it. And you did a very interesting video on stop the scale. I do remember that. I think I shared it, which is also interesting. We should probably link to that in this. Sorry, Ashwin, I took it off-paste. We can include this anyway. Hey, it's Ashwin and Ed. We're here with Kirk Williams, Google Ads shopping expert, e-commerce genius and multi author of several books. Kirk is here to talk to us today about Google Ads shopping and what he's seeing in Merchant Center, with shopping ads with Pmax and how he's approaching e-commerce today. Kirk, we're super excited to have you here. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for having me. Great to be here. Great to chat. Question number one was what type of retailers and e-com do you think Google works for? And this is quite a broad question because it could be a brand new account. Actually, we should probably look at it from a brand new business perspective because obviously, if someone's already advertising, it's probably working for them. Yeah, there are a few thoughts that I have on that. One would be, I actually think I look at that a little more individualistically than industry-wide. And so when we are getting, let's say we have a prospect come to us and they, like, here's our website, here's our ad account, we're just getting started should we run Google Ads. I'm usually not really focused as much on exactly what industry they're in, if you will, but more of a variety of individual things. And I think that is important because you can have, let's say, someone selling t-shirts who is making Google work for them and you can have someone else selling t-shirts where it's just not working, right? And that gets into a whole mess of non-Google Ads stuff. So one of the things that we try to do as an agency, as we're, and again, this goes into even kind of how I tick and how our agency ticks, like we do try to be fairly selective with who we work with. And one of those selection points is just like, do we think Google Ads can work for them? And so we might look at things like, what are their price points as well, along with whatever their product differentiators are, right? So we'll have someone come in and they offer the exact same thing that four other mega big box stores offer at a higher price with just zero things and difference. And they'll say, hey, we have a $3,000 a month budget. Can we make this work? And it's kind of like, man, you're trying to sell a $25 hammer. Why wouldn't someone go to our Home Depot or whatever your retail? Do you know Home Depot? Does that name ring? Do you know that brand? Home Depot. Do you have Home Depots in Scotland? UK? I think we do have Home Depot in the UK. We have B&Q. I think we have Home Depot. I was going to say, what's like the home improvement store there, like the big box one. B&Q. I don't know what B&Q stands for. But yeah, so do you? I got us on a rabbit trail. But anyways, hopefully that makes sense and kind of like starting to dig into some of that stuff. Like, can this actually work? And so probably some of those core things would be like the budget that they do have. And then like, yeah, what are some of those differentiators? What does their website look like? Do we think that they're able to, and then we will look into like auction pricing and stuff for sure, just to get a general idea of, okay, here overall the keywords we'd be buying, right? So what are those average CPCs? Just to try to start to get an idea of, do we think we can turn this? Because if at some point we've then find out we're like, hey, the only way you could be profitable is if we have like a 25% conversion rate on non-brand, you know, you have to be selling one every four clicks sort of deal. That's, I just don't think that's basically possible to start out and nail that. So like, I just don't think this can work, right? So, so that's to answer your question. We kind of think of it a little bit more individualistically based on those factors than just a broader, what does work for e-commerce or not? Do you find that potentially a big tell is if they are directly competing with Amazon, for example, you know, if Amazon stocks it, it's cheap, it's available. Do you find that it's, but then it gets difficult to compete with something like that, you know, the everything store? On one hand, yes. On the other hand, no, just because at this point, like, literally everyone is competing with Amazon for us right now. And even, you know, who knows what's going to change in the near future with that sort of thing too, because Amazon has changed a lot with, you know, the sellers they've allowed in and, you know, that sort of thing. But I'll tell you on the Amazon side, one of the things we look at is if they are running an Amazon store, or, or, or maybe if their actual products and brand is on and is on Amazon by other retailers, or if, you know, they're selling it, because then what starts to happen, especially if it's their own store, is we definitely see them click through on, you know, our, our merchants and our shopping listings and then purchase through Amazon. Oftentimes, you know, shipping is faster or, or whatever, sometimes even with stores, Amazon is cheaper for the exact same store to say it's exact same price, right? And that's definitely where you're going to, where, you know, we'll, we'll tend to kind of let them know there may be some value of incrementality that, you know, you can test for, but also you might struggle with this since you're already going aggressively on Amazon, unless, again, unless there's some reason that someone should buy from you that's different from Amazon. And I'll tell you, we actually just started working with a client. And this is kind of interesting because their Amazon store is very, very, very consumer based. And so it really is just like, you know, Joe Bob needs to go and buy one of the products. And so it goes to Amazon, right? They also have like this, this B2B kind of commercial side. And so one of the things we've already been consulting with them is, is starting to say, Hey, I think they have a, they have a, they have a, like a B2B side where there's actually like wholesale deals and stuff like that that weren't quite as, as obvious. So that was, so one of the first calls that we had, I was really kind of suggesting to them, Hey, people are going to be seeing, you know, your shopping listings or whatever it might be and going to your Amazon as well as here, you really need to again show that differentiation on your, on your site that this, this is the value of purchasing from us buy and bulk, you know, wholesale pricing that they don't get from Amazon. And then let Amazon consumers, they'll go there, don't try to stop them, you know, let them go buy their one product at a time sort of deal. And again, just making it very, very evident what your, you know, what the value is of purchasing from you on that page. And that seems real simple, but it's just amazing to me how many, how difficult in some ways it still is to do that on a landing page. Yeah, I don't want to drag the question out too long, but I guess the Amazon can be useful if you've got repeat custom, if it's a one off product and it can be fulfilled by Amazon, it's a bit tricky. But if you've got repeat custom, and obviously using Amazon like a marketplace like eBay to get the customer, pay Amazon their share, and then hopefully the customer comes to you. Because obviously, if you fulfill it yourself, you can put your own invoicing and paraphernalia in there to say, come to our store, it's 20% cheaper, whatever it may be, then Amazon. And we also offer Prime or whatever. But I guess that's another strategy, because I'm going to take this off piece again on it. But do you tend to find that a lot of e-com that come to you startups are on the smaller side? Or do many of them have a significant budget and funding? Or is it typically the mom and pop, as you'd say? I would say at this point, new accounts tend to be more on the small side. But that does not mean there aren't still, that doesn't mean there aren't still new accounts. And some of that could just be my own agency bias. We're a small agency. There's probably going to be some level of client, corporate client, who's just always going to go to a densew or something like that, and is never going to consider Zato. And also, I get that. So I do know, I mean, there are obviously new startups all the time. Startups get investments. And so that is the case. So you can have startups who all of a sudden are like, hey, we got $20 million, we got to spend. And so that absolutely happens. And then what I find too is that there still are, especially in the US, there really still are a large number of more on the commercial side of things. Just kind of still a few years back in terms of tech and the way that they think of marketing. And so you'll still run into these businesses where there's just some fairly healthy, profitable, machine parts, sort of something. And they've just never really given, let's say, Google Shopping a Shot sort of deal. And so we'll also meet those where they have a bit of budget and profit. And I'll tell you, I love those because they tend to already be in a stable place. They got their numbers down, they tend to be profitable and all that. And so it's just a matter of us turning on a new channel in some ways. It kind of reminds me of the old days of Google Ads. So those are the ones I enjoy a lot. Yeah. So Merchant Center, Merchant Center Next, there's like a whole bunch of stuff and it can kind of get confusing for a lot of people where they should invest their time. So what's the 80-20 on Merchant Center today? Yeah, so I really enjoy the next interface, to be completely honest. And I'm not really a UI change guy. I'm just a big fan of if I know where that button is, like I want that button to stay there sort of deal. And I really don't mind the change next. I mind that it happened at the same time that multiple ads, Google Ads, UI changes, and GA4, and a bunch of other UI changes happened. But overall, I think it's still pretty much, I mean, there are things that changed with it. There are certain places like some settings are in a new place and that sort of thing. Once you learn where those are, I don't think there's anything key that's really missing from Classic. And there is even additional functionality, additional reports and stuff with Next. They added Product Studio. That's kind of interesting to tinker around with. Probably the only complaint I have of something that we use fairly regularly that we used to think was missing and then we found it because it's like buried is the, it's like the product feed history graph. So I don't know if you remember, in the Classic, for the listeners, you would click on, I don't remember what it was at this point, the product issues or whatever. And you would immediately be taken and see how, like a visual graph over the past 30 days of how many, it was like green for the products that got up that were approved and then red for the products that got disproved. And you could see at an instant when there were total feed drops or a bunch of disapprovals or something like that. And that was pretty easy to actually map with certain things, especially historically, if you wanted to look at, just to see like, whoa, why did we have a thousand products that got disproved on that day? And that actually impacted our performance and stuff like that. And that's now buried like three links deep. And that's kind of annoying, but it is still there. And so that's probably about my only complaint. I've even like brought that up to Google, just like, can you guys make that less so that we don't have to click so many buns to get there? Otherwise, I don't know. Yeah. Next doesn't really bother me, I guess. I have other things to be bothered by at this point. So would you say for somebody who's coming in today, who's never used the old version of Merchant Center and doesn't have those, that familiarity or those biases on where things should be, they're starting fresh. Would you say that experience that Google's created today with Merchant Center next, is that better than what used to exist? The one, so I just don't know if I'd say better. I think I'd say equivalent, although I will say it just drives me nuts that we don't have easy access to data sources, that it's kind of hidden in the settings and stuff like that. I don't know. It used to be just on the main nav on the side. So that's a little weird, is it just seems like I still feel like I'm having to pause to think, okay, how am I supposed to get to my feed because I still call it a feed? Oh yeah, that's right. It's in here. And I don't know, as opposed to just like, there it is, click on it. So yeah, it is what it is. Well, we've had our rants. Ed and I have had our rants about Google's UI and UX. It's tough to figure out. Usually when you encounter some kind of UX or UI decision that you're not comfortable with, you can usually see the logic behind it, like okay, other people would probably approach it this way. Maybe I'm in the minority, but with Google Ads, it's really difficult to figure out why they're doing these things. Oh, I hate the new ads UI just to be clear. It's Merchant Center that I'm not as like me. Again, other than, you know, and to your point, it's kind of like, you know, one of the most important things that you go to Merchant Center for, I almost am wondering, and maybe I'm alone in this, but I think Googlers are maybe thinking that we're just going to Merchant Center for a bunch of data and reporting stuff. And unless some people are doing that more, there are some reports. That's just that's just not typically where we're going, right? And so one of the reasons primarily that we open Merchant Center is we need to dig into products and data feed stuff like that. So it's just kind of weird to have the data sources section so hidden. Again, not that huge of a deal, but ads, the ads UI is on another another level of annoying for so many reasons, as I'm sure you guys have hit like so many, like so many campaign buttons. That's actually a joke that I've put into some of my sessions, where I'll tell people here's my favorite report and then I start walking them through like clicking the first you click campaigns and then you then what you do is you go to campaigns, then next you're going to click just to kind of show the foolishness and even how like small like I want to see the the freaking stat like the graph like why'd you make that so small now you know it's like stuff like that so anyways rant over you guys you know refer to your past discussions for probably all the same points that I would bring up. 2010 was the pinnacle of UIs. Straight forwards. It was still called AdWords back then. It was a spreadsheet on the screen and some charts if you needed them and a condensed menu that didn't take up a third of the bloody screen. It was just I don't yeah and everything was easy to get to, but someone has to justify their job I guess, creating new buttons everywhere. Just very quickly on the for god's sake, Merchant Center. I know what I'm doing. Merchant Center, I agree with you. It's about the product feed that should be front and center. It is slightly odd. However, I'm a bit rusty on it. You mentioned studio. Is there anything in studio like one feature that you actually do use on a regular basis or it's super handy that people should be looking at? Yeah, actually yes, but right now I've encountered a glitch with that. The only thing I like using it for and so like I let I let Google know and I haven't heard back from them yet, but I'm like hey and that is within product studio there's a remove the background button click for images that's super helpful. So like we have as an example and this is what I was trying to do it with. We have a product that we pulled from a client and you know for whatever reason the background stuff it's it's all black you know and it looks real it looks real weird and so I just went in a product studio and was just immediately like bleep delete the background and it just you know bam put it on a on a on a clear white background whatever and then I couldn't save it so so one of those like wow I'm so thankful for this tool and then I like it didn't work okay come on man. Yeah that's good so that's a that's a perfect example because that's one of those things that sounds really trivial but if you're not when you need it if you don't use Otishop it's um or a similar tool then it would be a job that you'd have to literally give to someone else and wait for them to do so it is uh so Google is yes replacing us so yeah that's a great great example and and even that yeah exactly you like save the image to your computer and you open Photoshop and blah blah you know um where this is it is literally in platform button click I mean the whole process takes two minutes sort of a deal when it works. I don't know if you guys follow Phil Kill on Twitter but he he posted last week there was a product I think it was like a probiotic capsule or something like that product that um one of their agency clients uh produces and he basically like took a photo of it of him holding it in his hand and he put it on GPT and he had GPT 4.0 create three versions of it one was like just a plain background one was on a tongue and something else and I was like like they're just moving at such a rapid pace and Google yeah to my knowledge and I don't use Merchant Center a lot but to my knowledge studio is exactly where it was when it came out a year ago yes and that that is a failure of it for sure like I I think there's a I think there's a lot of opportunity there that has still not been used but also I just think it's coming for sure so I think it's one of those like it's not there yet but absolutely it's going to get to that point at some you know at some time um right now the the most annoying thing with studio so so with that you know you can create a background sort of deal it's extremely limited to what you're able to create and then um and my biggest complaint is you can't actually uh like re-prompt so as you know a huge part of like image building oftentimes that I found at least is say like okay not quite that now add this or okay yes but now remove this and and you're like it's like that conversation that you're working towards something and this is a total hey you're gonna have to restart this background thing again if you just want a little tweak so that that's an annoyance with it as well so so like the background thing especially with those other ai tools where you can create stuff that's so much better like product studios know we're close to that with with that sort of thing yeah and and the ads and they have a video function as well with product studio now um and you know a similar thing it's it's just it's just not very impressive yet um I think it will get there eventually but not impressive yeah that's some of the some of the stuff I've seen the image to video is is getting really impressive um I showed I showed my wife uh the I think it was there's someone prompted for an image of a lady leaning against a wall holding a a bottle of perfume and it looked real she didn't even have seven fingers and then they prompted to I don't know what they did it in but then they prompted for her to step forwards look at the camera and hold the perfume up and it was not I mean it got a little bit jank at one point but it's so close now and I was like okay so you've got model product person camera person um sound editor choreographer organizer admin all these people that just don't exist in that world because it's just someone prompting um that's a lot of jobs yep I've did it again haven't I taken us off on on the I don't want to be negative but it's the creative industry's yeah it's really quite daunting what what this AI potentially can do because it's still not you know it's still got jank so it's still not all of it is useful but the images are getting really good really good although it makes me look ill most of the time and it turned um turned Ashwin into DJ Khaled when I prompted an image for oh that was that was insulting on a personal level yeah sorry about that I didn't learn to bling it's not it's my prompt skills obviously uh right moving quickly on right biggest mistakes you see Kirk uh in specifically e-commerce google ads and these can be when because I assume you do audits people come to you um I don't know if you consult but yeah I mean what do you see specific to e-com okay let's see I'll give you a couple of very tactical things and then maybe more big picture philosophical um first would just be like super basic feed optimizations it's still amazing how many brands are just not doing your basic feed ops they're they're pushing up whatever product data they have oftentimes not great from you know Shopify to google merchant center a lot of times they're utilizing the google and youtube shopping app which um it is just not is not ideal for that reason and uh and so in some ways like if someone was was just like what is what is the the thing I could immediately do right now that will likely increase exposure traffic you know that sort of thing I think it'd be take your top take the top products that are 80 percent of your sales because a lot of times you have that you have five to ten products 80 percent of your sales go in right now um and what some we'd like to do is look look into our search terms report just kind of build an idea of like who who is our audience who are they searching for the people who are actually converting and just like and get better better titles um description AI AI descriptions is phenomenal now um I have kind of this like big chat or a prompt template that you know our team uses that I've built where it's just like take take this product page you know you you plug in the URL um and and you can like give it a bunch of information about like identify the audience and then write this and keep it under 5000 characters but like put the most important you know information within the first 150 because that's how Google description descriptions work product descriptions people if they do see the descriptions in shopping they'll they'll most likely see the first like 150 but you can have up to 5000 which is a ton of characters um and so that that's one instance where you know we are actively using you know AI to help us but just doing some of those basic things getting your product type in there um it it really just gives Google additional information so that's probably one one mistake with actually relatively an easy fix um that that we still see and another here is an interesting mistake that we've seen lately that has changed and I'm curious to hear this from you actually if you see the same thing but as we've done audits more and more um I've seen pmax tactics go like the opposite way which is now they seem to be obsessed with over segmentation so we'll go into some account you know where there's like you got $7,000 a month in spend and there's like 11 pmax campaigns in there and you know each one is targeted to like one product with like 37 clicks over a month you know maybe one sale you know that sort of thing and it's like okay first of all you know we can get in the pmax shopping conversation but like first of all okay if you're going to use pmax for this especially if you have more limited budget um you almost have to like lean more fully into the automation aspect of it and not and not like you know shrink your data set for the the poor thing to learn on you know so that's this kind of weird thing that we're seeing lately where in the past it was almost the opposite when pmax first came out there was just a ton of times where you're like whoa you know you have 400,000 products in this one campaign let's try to figure out how we segment those out you know so we still see that sometimes but yeah I don't know um but and then and then I'll say the last one and then you know we can chat about whichever one but last one I was thinking about was the other big mistake this is more on the strategic side this is a mistake everyone has made for all time but it's still a mistake and that is like e-comm brands are still trying to to aggressively trace a direct line from ad click to purchase and and and and not actually try to determine like how can I get more sales with this platform that I would not have otherwise gained you know kind of the incrementality idea and so I still think there's kind of this over obsession within platform tracking and not as much trying to figure out and test and figure out like things like incrementality and how it works into your broader you know ad channel strategy and all that stuff so we we still kind of see that as well which can you know really really strangle strangle the funnel so yeah I think if you're I mean if you're a smaller budget it's probably not it's less of a concern but if you are a 100% relying on google's attribution or to be fair any ad platforms attribution then you're missing a trick and it isn't the gospel it isn't it's probably I don't know I'd say 80% I'd say we're lucky if it's 50% accurate these days with tracking being blocked and cookies being annihilated and so on and I think attribution's a bit of a red herring for many accounts I think I've said this for a few years advertisers have got to be in charge of first party data you've got to be tracking at the very least so free commerce spend versus campaign at the very least if you only got one campaign well okay you don't need you don't need your own tracking but just so you can attribute like you just said input versus output I put an extra five grand of budget into campaign x did that give me revenue on the back end and can I see it coming through campaign x not worrying about product splits and targeting and yada yada yada but just the in and out in and out and the bigger you get I think the more important that is the bigger the the inventory bigger the budget even more important it is to understand the simple input output because google any attribution is not going to give you the the true story and the funnel's too complicated the journey is too complicated and it's getting crushed with all the tracking issues so yeah and I think another piece of that too is like where actual scale and growth with google ads comes from and and I just think that that is often the the focus is often turned to the campaign buttons like the optimization buttons so someone will be like hey I want I want to scale more aggressively with google ads I want google ads to be a big channel for us you know we hear this a lot right so how do we do that opi bids and and the under yeah the understanding is that it's something within the campaign itself or the account now and that that's where it gets tricky right um sometimes it is uh so you know sometimes an account is more inefficient than it should be sometimes there are like key targeting things that is being that are being missed um hey these you know these are absolutely core this is a core target audience you're not you're not utilizing it hey you know first party data you have no you have no customer list added in here you have no audience list right so sometimes there are failures in that for sure and that's sometimes why it gets a little tricky but what I find more often than not especially I think as I've seen like I think I would say from what I see the ecom industry has matured in a sense with just their understanding of like like the technical way that ad channels work and all that sort of thing like brand operator operators and that and so in some ways I just think like the way you grow a demand capture channel like google ads is primarily by looking outside of it so I think that that I think it's one of those like if you're looking at a small business and they want to know how they can actually grow their spend and how they can actually grow their business I actually think that having some basic well thought out campaigns as a as a place to start and then like turning their attention and focus onto the the levers in their business that can actually unlock scale like those upper funnel channels so maybe something like youtube facebook as well as just those basic like increasing your conversion rate on your website like figuring testing like obsessing over the content and offer on your website you know trying to unlock those sort of things because we so often have conversations with brand operators where for the most part their campaign is already targeting their ideal audience and we know that because at some point you know I don't I don't know maybe it's because I'm doing home improvement but that's on my mind right now like if you're if you're if you're like you're in the home improvement space and it's like at some point if you're selling you know electric drills and you're bidding on the keywords by electric drill and you can see in the audience that it's like DIY home improvement people and it's people who have visited Home Depot and and all this stuff and if that's what's happening and those people are not converting there is a reason that doesn't involve your bidding um there's a there you know you again that could be inefficient you may be bidding too aggressively or something like that but again like like why are those people not purchasing from you and to me like figuring the answer to that question is actually how you start to unlock success and scale because then that's that's the real thing preventing you not trying to figure out how you optimize your your audience bit a little bit they're the right people they're landing on the right product they're just not buying there must be something you're missing there must be something in your product there must be you know maybe they're going to amazon because it's cheaper how you're going to solve that you know like those are the things to figure out and too often everyone's attention gets sucked into trying to like figure out the tiny little lever in the ad campaign as opposed to that bigger problem so that that's that's a huge mistake I think and that's increasingly what we try on the strategic side to also kind of dig into and help our clients think through um well you know while we manage the campaigns it and it's unsexy isn't it but it is product price fulfillment all of that happens outside of the ads platform um if you haven't got the product that people want at the right price and you drop the ball and your custom services crap then doesn't matter what you do tweaking your google ads it's the same for lead gen you know if you're if you're the person that operates the drill that isn't buying the drill and you're not picking up the phone when people are a lead is calling you well you're going to lose it to the the person that picks up the phone quicker so it's yeah a hell of a lot happens outside the ads account and for years I was I was guilty of this for years I'd be super optimized at Mr Efficiency but um sometimes the efficiency is at the cost of growth because you're trying to be too efficient with everything and optimize the hell out of it when actually sometimes the answer is a tweak in the business and all of a sudden you can spend more you can bid more because you convert more uh and that unlocks the next level yeah yep and and I think it's just healthier for everyone in the industry for us increasingly to understand that hey this is the place in the your brand success and so and like as an agency okay so how do we price for that place how do we help support us being in that that role in that place how do we make sure we all understand this so then we can have you know a good relationship and move forward and and transparently I still think we're in a little bit of this transitional period where I still get it and like we're having a lot of these conversations where I'm really trying to educate prospects coming in as well as current clients as far as just frankly the limitations of what can can occur with with google um again at a at a place where your account is already at some level of efficiency right I I think you can I think a bad ppc manager can really screw up an account but I think there are limits to what a good quotation marks you know great ppc efficient person who really is aware of data and really knows you know how I think there are limits to what they can do without all of that other stuff right so yeah 100% hey look I sell god tier ads as you know I sell a training product it's not a course it's a product framework but even I will say it's it's there as the framework it's it's not going to fix the business it's not going to make you well maybe I do say on the sales page it's going to make you top 1% but that's only because the the bar's so bloody low in the industry sometimes but yeah it's it's just this so much that happens outside the ads account and I think with all this automation and AI um big flavour of the month year past two years three years I think that's forcing people to think like that now hopefully I say people marketers to think more outside the the ads account which I think is a positive thing and to explore those avenues but just I know and I know it's tiring educating prospects and it is because you can spend a hell of a lot of time with a prospect that doesn't ever pay you but I think to answer your where do we add value as an agency as a freelancer even as an in-house it's part of that education to make sure that you work with the right people and that the prospect who's probably a small smaller business um if they're you know asking these kind of questions probably really understands where where Google's place is in all of this and what what is possible but also what is expected over the business as well and I think people respect you for that and the people that don't respect you for that well it's probably be good for you that they run off complaining about you because you don't want to work with them anyway I love the stuff that you've been posting about tariffs and and the kind of I think justified anger that a lot of small businesses are paying the price for what's happening with with this what is effectively a trade war so what are you doing to think it through with them and doesn't necessarily have to be with your clients but how are you approaching it what's your tariff preference advice for like best case worst case scenarios it's it's one of yeah yeah you got to love the third rail of politics right yeah I I don't know it's it's interesting because chaos is the name of the game and chaos is just chaos makes business really hard and I think that's a big part of markets and everything from you know the markets to individual decision clients are trying to make where we just don't know what's going to happen next I mean I I am not kidding you it's like every time I come into work I open it and it's like oh hey we have a new tariff you know percentage on China sort of a deal I haven't even looked this morning it could be different as far as I knew the last it was 245 percent which is you know staggering I don't know it could be different now so so just that alone is just some level I actually think a lot of people are kind of like trying to see what's what's going to happen with that but it is starting to already impact shipments coming in shipments being ordered you know that sort of thing and so in some ways I think there's a little bit of a delayed reaction that will already happen that I just don't know if the average consumer is fully aware of the fact that when everything is paused suddenly then all of a sudden that's going to pick up again then kind of a COVID type thing then everything is going to try to ship at the same time we're probably going to ships you know circling the bay and LA sort of a deal like they were during COVID right so I just think there's some some like I think because it's so chaotic it's really hard to know what to do like so one of the things that I don't like I'm almost even hesitant to say advice to clients because there's also some level like they have so much more information than I do about what they actually need that sort of thing but I do think as much as possible from what I understand from from you know as I'm as I'm looking online seeing what brands and and importers that are saying it does sound like a lot of their manufacturers are trying to figure it out with them and so you know it it's probably worth trying to get some insight if you haven't already into are there deals that can be struck here or just just some figure out some various ways where you both can kick the can down the road pass the chaos to survive and then you know obviously doing what you can as possible to move manufacturing to a lower tariff country but again like this is this it's almost a joke to say something like that because nobody knows what's going to happen and like I think one of my frustrations has been I think a lot of people who don't understand the complexity of marketing in the supply chain kind of seem to have this mentality of almost this like just pick up and move you know just bring your manufacturing to the US you know that sort of thing and it's like they're like why haven't you been preparing the last five years it's kind of like I know brands who have been like they literally have been stressed about that and making steps to move here and and I think one of my frustrations with all that right now is like just just how difficult that is and without that understanding right of totally moving a warehouse even if you bring things over here let's say you actually might not have access to the skilled labor you think you do because a lot of that labor who knows how to do very specific things especially in electronics is is is within like certain provinces in China and that sort of thing so so they're actually training and that stuff that would need to happen and then even just like raw materials imported would also need to take place which which involves a new supply chain figuring out how to transport those raw materials here as a you know it's very complicated it takes a long time and so all that to say I don't really know what to do and how to solve all of that but I do know that I think everyone's like kind of doing their best and one thing I will say if it's a brand listening so I'm an agency I think there are a lot of ways where no one is in a better place for a brand to go bankrupt and go into zero dollars right and so one thing I'd say is do do like talk to your vendors talk to those who you're working with and see if during the chaos you can like figure out maybe different scope arrangements you know just just kind of like how do we figure something out so that we can survive if things are you know that dire for you as I've been hearing with with some businesses where it's kind of like if this goes on a couple months you know they're not going to survive if that's the case but try to be open and and just have a just have an open on this conversation with you know someone like your vendor and maybe you can figure out some way to reduce scope they can reduce fees you know something like that so that you can kind of both make it through to the other side probably is at least on the ppc side maybe something to consider so it's it's tough out there sorry yeah I think it's less of an impact if you've got stock if you've got stock level obviously I do wonder how it will I mean of course supply chain speed and fulfillment if that slows down that's one thing but another thing is if if your imports from let's say China are 200% so your price you've essentially tripled your price if you want to maintain your profit level then is the consumer going to pay it or what proportion of the consumer can afford to pay it and yeah I mean will it hopefully well this is wow it's sort of like a morality issue I was going to say hopefully people stop wasting money on tat that they didn't need but that doesn't help the businesses that sell the tat and I mean that with the yeah the greatest respect that's the people that's what hurts an economy you know exactly yeah yeah um people probably spend too much on rubbish I mean Amazon Prime turning up every day did you really need it but that's I don't elect your people um do you have a business proposition for your chaps though I'll buy a big boat with some containers on it and we'll just park it outside of the the the legal the jurisdiction of the US waters and we'll get a dingy off to shore and people can buy what they want Amazon rates same day delivery you just have to drive to the to the coastline we'll stick you in the dingy and we'll take you to the boat with the cargo on it all from China no tariff because we're not in the US waters but I don't like to travel so it's already failed but yeah it's difficult and the problem is politicians as ever are playing they're politicking and they don't give a toss about the little guys and gals um so they don't care what happens really they are yes um I don't know and it's not it's not one it's all of them and it's just politics why I don't get involved with politics it's all a load of bollocks um they're all as bad as each other but this is particularly mental you're not allowed to say mental uh it's not particularly correct uh crazy is the word but no I don't think you're allowed to say that either I have to go okay as somebody with mental health issues I give you full permission to use both those words I do it all the time good um yeah so yeah there's no answer to the tariffs other than they might end sooner rather than later because he's doing bully boy tactics which he's trying to get the back there is one thing that I take from being external to the US is that um Trump is a patriot and he genuinely loves the US and he generally wants the US to be on top and he's using a very aggressive method to achieve that so he's probably yeah um it's gamesmanship but he's not what he's not concerned about short-term casualties for long-term gain um I think he's doing it for the reasons that he believes are right uh and they favor America in the long run but for the everyone else it's yes it's a bit it's a bit so there's I'm glad you I'm kind of to be fair Kirk I'm glad you said you don't have the answer because no one does but it's an interesting talking point and hopefully it just gets remedied sooner rather than later and yeah and like let and let me be clear like I don't I don't honestly really have a strong opinion on tariffs per se for against like I don't even know if I know enough about them in that sense to solve all that I think for me it's more yeah what do we like clearly to me it's the rollout and and clearly we're in such a state of chaos that again like what you know what does what does the person with their small brand that they started up three years ago that all of a sudden is faced with three x cost of in customs you know you've heard some crazy stories of people going from 26 000 to you know 379 000 or something like that like like what do they need to do and I think the only reason like Ashwin had mentioned I think the only reason that I've gotten actually frustrated online is when I do hear people like blaming them or or even or having no empathy for them as collateral damage because to me like they they entered the same system we as consumers are are in and it's like we can all argue about whatever but like we all buy stuff that is built on the system of this this of global trade right they started a business in the system of global trade um we're all just trying to do our best and figure that out and so at the very least I do have empathy for them who started in that realm where as they look to see where should I manufacture this widget it was like not not only it's like the skill as well was in was in another country the skill the materials everything was there and so it wasn't really a a decision of hey do I want to spend 200 million dollars to start something here and I'm not even sure how I'd get the raw materials it was more of a cool I've I have this idea and here's how our system works someone may have some really good reasons for why that system should change and that's fair that doesn't mean that anyone's really done anything wrong in how they started their business in the old system if you will and so like let's figure that out together and I'm a little frustrated but I think sometimes the attitude of the of the almost like gloating about those um unintended consequences and I like I don't think that's fair so I'll I'll get off my soapbox no it's a good point because because even if you are in the perfect situation where you've got the stock and have some manufacturing on shore everything's working out great there is still that you know okay everything's resolved in let's say a month three months whatever it is like you pointed out there's going to be a whole backlog of shipping orders that need to come in and there's only so many ports that they can show up to there's only so many longshoremen who can you know get the containers off the ships and you have to wait and during all of this the rest of us consumers our demand is not changing you know we're just getting more and more impatient but we still want damn thing same thing in a recession demand doesn't change it's just us acting on that demand that changes so like yeah it is it is a system we all buy into it if you if you work and you participate in commerce and you buy things I don't think you're in a position to critique the system because you're also a participant in it that's the irony they're probably sat there replying on their iPhone that's imported from china wearing their nikes that are probably sewn together in Bangladesh you know it's not it's not done where they are it's all imported at some point probably everything they're probably surrounded by imported goods sat they're going haha and just don't understand the irony that they live in um but that's true of most people you know you go to a I don't know a peace protest and someone punches you in the face you go to a protest about I don't know uh the environment and the environment hydrochloric acid on you yeah and someone's drank drinking out of a coke can whilst on the phone and this that and they drive home in the car you know it's just it's just the world is is mad it's just gone a little bit extreme so hopefully if we all sort of wishful thinking it resets very soon not the great reset just for any conspiracy theorists amongst us I didn't mean that kind of reset well in the comments just a normal reset please just just take it back a notch and then hopefully we'll get through it but there will be a knock on impact like Ashwin just said to supply chains and what have you it yeah it's tricky it's tricky uh and not to drag us out any further like as a final stanza have you Kirk have you had any um it's only sort of change in your client base because of this is anyone paused advertising is anyone made any remarks that are they gonna have to or there there are definitely conversations occurring um I think yeah I mean this is so real time as well right and and and again with the my chaotic remarks in the beginning like it's so real time and it's so chaotic that I think there's been a wise uh hesitancy by a lot of people to make huge sweeping decisions they don't have to um and and I think I think some of that is okay even as that matures okay now we're a few weeks in right um I think as that continues we get more and more insight into okay how how long is this actually going to be and then what does that mean um what does that mean for what we need to do and because it's in some ways business is so much about math and it's just really hard to do math when you just don't know what the numbers are going to be tomorrow for for a lot of this stuff um even even like moving to let's say moving manufacturer to another country that's already set up for that by the way because if I say that and someone's immediately like well move it to the US well you can't just throw up a warehouse um so you know okay in the meantime for this business survival this year not in 20 you know 35 when they can finally get around to building that warehouse and establishing those new supply chains can you tell I'm annoyed by that um that lack of knowledge there um but but like in the meantime like okay they got to figure out where they're going to do that they also need to have insight into those numbers because those numbers are all changing too all the time so I think right now things have been I almost think it's been things have been so chaotic that everyone's just a little bit of a wait and see at least like with our clients um and and I think we're starting to have those conversations of you know beginning the okay well let's try to think of the the various possible things and like what needs to occur but I will say for the most part as I've been checking with our team I think our specific client base like we might have gotten a little lucky because I just don't know if we have anyone really really drastically hit by this which is you know which I'm I'm thankful for um you know and was luck more than anything else but I think that's the case and gosh I just I just hope for those businesses who are going to be really struggling in the next few months through no fault of their own that they can figure it out yeah and on on that bombshell we're probably in there so Kirk has two books check them out three weeks are in the description but one you can't buy anymore yes the updated version plus yeah buy the green ppc pondering green pondering ppc pondering and then the start of scale yeah we'll put some links in do me a favor if you don't like the yellow one or you want to get rid of it don't sell it use just like throw it away is it that bad it's not that bad it's just the green one is better and the green one is like that's the updated version and I don't I hate when I see used yellow ones on amazon because I'm like no it's outdated I know it's not that bad I look back at some of my old videos and I think oh my god I should delete that but it's it's provenance isn't it so it's it's fine I won't I won't look at it again it will go back into the box that it came out of before yeah yeah for all the call yeah it's not actually that bad it's just that like creator like no that's not the thing anymore you know yeah that try on us
