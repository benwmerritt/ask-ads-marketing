I think there's too many people that will pull into the trap of blindfolding themselves because they'll just sit prompting an AI, but actually we know that AI still hallucinates. We've both agreed that it's not enough to just be a technical, tactical one-channel marketer anymore. Do you think it's overblown this feeling or this sentiment that if you're a Google Ads specialist, you've been doing Google Ads for a few years now, you really are more of like into the math and the Excel sheets and stuff like that. You're lacking creativity and strategy and things like that. Another way to look at your question is because someone sent me an email to say can I do a talk to essentially kids, students about getting a job in your field and I thought that's a daunting task to discuss because of the uncertainty which circles round to your question which is people who are already established in the industry. So do we need to be specialists? So 10 years ago, oh no it's longer than that, 14 years ago when I started, I went quite wide and I wasn't a specialist, I could do multiple things. A couple of years into it, I went really specialist and really focused on Google Ads. Stunned very well for a decade but over the past, I don't know, half of that decade I have been branching out and that meant you've got to understand the analytics side. You've got to understand the landing page side. If you're into e-commerce you've really got to understand the product and fulfilment side. So it's the T-shaped marketer, isn't it? It's picking the focus so in our world that's Google Ads but also having all the complementary stuff. So you have got to and here's the good bit we'll get on to but you have got to be good at copywriting for your ads, for your landing page, you've got to understand what a good image looks like for product and also services. If you're, you've taken on a, I don't know, kitchen renovation company and they haven't got any images because they've just started, you can use AI to generate images for that which is essentially a content skill that's not an analytical skill and then the other side of that you've got as I said before analytics so you've got to understand the data. Have you got to be an absolute analytics guru? No, I don't think so but you've got to be able to look at it. You've got to understand conversion tracking. Everyone's got to understand conversion tracking now. If you're working with a third-party platform that doesn't enable you to add code and tags then that's a different kettle of fish entirely but if you can add a tag or a GTM container then you've got to understand what that does and why. Again, you don't have to know intricate details. You don't have to be a developer but you've got to understand why tag fires, how it fires, what it spits out to the web, you know, what's in the data layer and then you've got to be really good at the Google ad side but that is your core component. So coming full circle it's also it starts to sound a bit daunting because actually I've skipped over some deep nuances like you've got to understand the business you're working for. If you're in an agency you've probably got to understand 20 different businesses. It can become overbearing but this is actually where AI in its current form is very good. So learning about a business or a marketplace you can ask it for that research and it will spit it out in 30 seconds. That's quite good. No, that's amazing. I remember when we did SEO in my agency 12 years ago, 10 years ago, that was a manual job back then, scraping and documenting. So now it's a very quick job. Can you write me some ad copy, Mr and Mrs AI? Yeah, I'm pretty good as well. So if you're writing ad copy yourself and you're not using a prompt, you're probably wasting time. Not inside the Google ads account because the Jamini version is a bit crap still. If you've actually tried to create a campaign using Google's own integrated AI. Not great. It's not great, is it? It's not great. So but then keyword research, you used to have to pay for tools. You used to have to do a bit of legwork, grunt work. I think you still, right, use the AI, you'll get a load of keyword suggestions, themes, topics, it will split them up into ad groups or containers or buckets or whatever you want to call it for the prompt. Very good. But I still would go out to the search engines and actually look what is out there organically, who's advertising to understand the lay of the land. I think there's too many people that will pull into the trap of blindfolding themselves because they're just sit prompting an AI, taking that as gospel. But actually, we know that AI still hallucinates. So you need to verify. So check and verify what you're seeing. But again, speeding things up, it probably cuts production time down to a tenth of what it was. So that's where AI is really good. So copywriting, landing pages, image generation, it's okay. Keyword, ideas, pretty good. What else is it really good at? It's very good as a sounding board. You give it a landing page and then you have to text for the landing page as well. But then you can ask it, what am I missing? Or what doesn't look right? Or what else should I add? And then you might overlook something as simple as having some social proof, some reviews, whatever it might be, it might call that out. It's a very good sparring partner. I agree. But we're not quite at that practical level yet where inside God tier ads, there's the 93 point landing page checklist that I collaborated on with Sam Oberon. I say collaborated, Sam's the brains behind it. I just took my face on it. Thank you, Sam. In the ideal world, I'd like to be able to give that to the AI and say, here's my landing page. What have I missed? So it doesn't just answer the question to you like you've asked it, it uses your real landing page. And I know you can connect, you can give these bots, chat bots, because what they are, agents, access to the internet, this that deal, but I'm on about the, the majority of people, what they have access to. I'm not on about people that are essentially hobbying this and creating agents and agents on agents, this and that. The other I'm on about the excuse the expression, the idiot proof stuff where someone could literally rock up and say, Hello AI, this is my landing page. This is a checklist I want to follow. What have I missed? And we're not quite there yet. If we are, tell me. Short cut as you can always download the checklist, upload it as an attachment with your prompt and have it review against that checklist. You will have to probably go through that a couple of times and some models are better with attachments than others like chat gpt. I mean, last week I was trying to clean up some transcripts and it just, it refused no matter how many times I asked, it simply refused to review and edit the full transcript, it would go halfway through and then just stop. And then I went over to Claude and Claude did the whole thing and one fell swoop. That's interesting. I fully agree with you. Um, but not quite there yet only. No, we're not. And I don't know that will ever be. So I don't buy into this idea of AGI and sentience of AI. I just, I don't think that you can replicate the complexity of the human brain fully in a computer because a computer is, it's, it's going to operate any AI models going to operate on a data set. It cannot generate those inputs and that learning data set on its own. We're now going down the philosophical path. So that being said, I do think, I don't think we can readily predict what is going to happen. But over the next five years, I think there are some things that AI has proven, you know, some things are going to happen and some things look likely to happen. And your best bet is to start running if you haven't already start running with what has been proven and probably skew towards what is going to happen while hedging your bets just a little bit. The 23 pillars of ad copy has an AI prompt to write you some really good adverts that are headlines and descriptions that are within character length and use the USPs and so on and so forth. As an example of an update that's coming, we are rewriting that prompt to 2025 standards. Now, actually, you can get the 23 pillars of ad copy. Here's the call to action for $5. It's a foot in the door offer, essentially. We're all marketers here. You know what it is. It just gives you a taster and it, but it also gives you something very actionable. Essentially, it shows you what a good advert is. It shows you real world comparisons. It's pretty solid and for $5, you can't really lose. And then I'll get your email address. I don't actually do a lot of selling on my email. It's mainly content driven and you'll get more freebies as well. There's loads of freebies. Just buy it. It's five friggin dollars. We're now in the world where everyone's an expert on AI who's into anything digital, remotely digital. Everyone's got an opinion on AI. And to be honest, it's tedious and I'm another one of those people. But I try and check myself constantly on this. So, AGI, do we have it? Is it coming? I think the percentage chance that we don't get some kind of sentient computer is one or two percent. But that might be in 50 years. It might be in five months. I don't know that. This is what's destroying everyone's head. We don't understand the timeline. And that's really daunting. It's scary. But we're all in the same boat. So, it's the old adage of don't cross the bridge until you get to it. We don't know what the timeline is. Try and push it out of your head. Anyway, if we get AGI, I don't think it will be sentient in the way that we as a human understand what sentient is. And therefore, it might be a bit problematic. And that's the scary bit because it might manifest in a way that we simply don't understand. And unfortunately, if that is the case, and I'm talking like the other end of the scale, the one two percent where it manifests in the way we don't understand it. Therefore, we cannot control. It is multiples of what we are. And we are the ants in its bloody path. Hopefully, we land somewhere in the middle. And with DeepSeek has just proven, if anyone's following this world, that there's a lot of change happening constantly. And this is another thing. People are getting so entwined into a very specific thing in AI. I literally over their shoulders, a big monster coming to just crush them, which is the next big version. It's the next big thing. China's just released something that's as good as open AI's version, whatever, latest version, and it's 95 percent less compute power. So you can run it on a tampon dispenser, which is great. And people, but people thinking that China would just not doing anything or in the dark on this, staggers me that people are surprised that China would doing AI to this level. It's like, well, of course they fucking are. They're as big as America. So now there's loads of propaganda on both sides, saying one's shit, one's a lie, one's a something the other. Ultimately, this is all frigging noise to you and I do it to try and do our jobs. This is all noise. Like Ash Wins just said, we're going to try and actively help people over the coming year, cut out all the noise, and avoid especially for marketers and all the fear mongering around it and just like, look, you don't you're not going to lose your job. You're not going to get paid less. You're not going to have problems unless you do sit completely idle and just stick to your lane and don't do anything about it. I mean, if you literally your job is you log into Google ads and you look at Google ads and you move on to the next account, then we will help you improve that because that's not enough. You don't need to be a copyright guru. AI can do that for you. You've just got to understand what the output should look like. You know, what's good, what's bad. And there's stuff inside God Territor that already does that. But we've just got to marry it up with the automations to say, look, don't fear it. This is what good and bad looks like. You can use this automation. Is it going to be perfect? Are things going to change and move? No, it's not going to be perfect. And yes, things are going to change and move. But that's why we're doing free updates. So it's a very complicated time. But 90% of its noise, just remember that keep doing a good job. And our job is to support you to improve your job over the coming year and help you become a bit more with respect, more of a sophisticated advertiser, shall we say, your career and your ability to think and present ideas in a way that makes sense to the people signing the checks. And that's what it is at the end of the day. I think the terrifying part is, at some point, you know, AI is going to hit a threshold. If it's not AGI, it's some other threshold. And nobody knows, am I going to be above that threshold or am I going to be below it? And so, yes, that's scary, but it's not going to happen tomorrow. But if you're constantly worried about what's going to happen in five years, you're not focused on what your client wants from you this week or next month, or what you need to do to get that promotion or that raise that you're chasing. So, I mean, why let an uncertain future consume and eradicate the potential for you to achieve things this year? I couldn't agree more. Essentially, it's the opposite of the angle I've always taken. Well, that's it always. The angle I've taken with God to her, to her answers that don't worry about change, embrace the change, but also embrace the fact that your fundamental knowledge needs to be solid, which is fly, you know, some people might think, oh, he's anti AI or what? No, not nothing at all. It's contextual. But I am flying against the people that are now shouting at you saying, oh, if you're not doing this with AI, you're obsolete and this that and the other, they're lying for a start. Trends don't change that quick. Oh, if you take a step back and think about what we're doing, we're advertising to people with intent, people who are looking for a product, they're looking for a service, looking for a thing. Until the way they interact with their phone, their computer, the tablet device changes until the way their shopping and their habits change, then nothing actually changes. So these things, this won't shift overnight either. So if something incredible happens of AI tomorrow, it's not going to change the world for a Google advertiser tomorrow. It will, it will drip down. You will have time to respond. And yeah, you want to get in front of it as much as you can. But as Ashwin just says, you don't want to be worrying about it. You just want to be thinking about it and using it where it will speed you up and also use it wisely, because I know plenty of people that are all in on AI or heavily using AI and they're spending more time trying to make the thing work than they are doing work. And I get that if you're ultimately get it to work, the efficiency saving, you know, it's there. But I do feel like we are playing in a sampet of dry stool at the minute. We're not, we're not, we haven't got, it's not even sand yet. So we're still swimming around in the, in the crap bits. A lot of AI tools out there, I've subscribed to so many and they are hit and miss. It's just not, it's, this is a very young industry. Everyone's still learning. No one has all the answers. I certainly don't. So don't worry about it. Just at the very least grab hold of the coattails that someone is going to, so someone can drag you along and we can drag you along for a start. And there are, there are other people, of course. Long short of it. Do a good job. Don't worry about it. Just keep one ear to the, to the ground as it were.
