Hey, I'm Josh Yates. I wanted to talk about Ed Leeks PPC performance framework and how it helps me. So I am a full-time Google Ads contractor. I've been doing Google Ads for about seven years. So I, before I saw it, I was pretty set in my ways or I felt like I was pretty set in my ways. Like, okay, that's, that's for the people that need to be told what to do. And I'm someone who knows how to get into a Google Ads account and crush it. But what I like about Ed Leeks framework is that it keeps me honest because as someone who has clients relying on me and just me, like you, you, you send me in to fix a problem or to do what's already being done, but way better. So that's great. But what's bad for me is that no one is coming behind me, right? I don't, I don't have anyone coming behind me checking that things are that, that things that might be left to the side are being done. And it's not just things as simple as auditing an account, right? Because I think that's what it sort of sounds like what I'm doing, but it's like, how am I going to approach smart shopping and have I been diligent for things like, have I looked at geo exclusions ever, right? In a specific account or am I benchmarking a specific attribution model? And if that sounds like a tedium or in the weeds, it's, it's not, it's an exhaustive list of every with everything. It's not just a list either, but because there are PDFs that you can reference in videos. But it's an exhaustive list of ways that you can improve an account or things to look at to expand accounts even, right? Like how are you going to be approaching adding new keywords, right? To a specific account based on what the search query report looks like. Also, if you're anything like me, it's, it's useful whenever you have an hour, two hours in the day, you've got an account and you've decided that you're going to be working the account sitting down. Where do I start? If you have trouble or you just want a fresh perspective on things too, right? Cause I'm always in my head. I'm, I'm the only person that's I'm working with on these accounts in many cases. And where do I start using this list is a great place for me to like start having those conversations with myself. So yeah, that's it. I hope this is useful to you guys. I definitely recommend you pick up at least framework and I'm sure it's going to be useful for you as it has been for me. Thanks. See you.
