Because if we give everything we got and a little bit more to our clients, we're trading a service for their money. We want to give them the very best. And I'm telling you right now, you need to be part of Ed's group. You need to be part of his membership because there's nothing out there like this. I've spent over $30,000 on courses myself. I've bought almost everything and nothing compares to this. Alright, hello everybody. Today, I've decided to leave Edleek Forge a testimony and I don't leave a lot of testimonies. And I don't give, I mean, I don't give a lot of testimonies because I think there's way too many testimonies out there that are fake. And they mean nothing, right? Like you get your friends to leave testimonies, a lot of companies do, you know, their family, whatever. You know, he has done such a great job at helping not only me, but countless other people. I've decided that I was going to give him a 10 star testimony when there's only five stars to give away. So he's getting 10. Okay. So, you know, because I don't really believe all the testimonies I see out there. I'll just, let me just share my screen real quick just to show you I am a business. Here I am right here. Top click Joe. I wish I looked better, but there I am. I own top click Joe. I also I have a partner in another business called trust local where I'm the CEO of that company. Alright, so a quick, quick story about me. So you know how I even got involved with the paper click and why I think Ed's program is bar none the best in the world, the universe, the galaxy and beyond. And I'm going to tell you why. So I owned a restoration company for 27 years, water, fire, mold damage. A lot of you do work for those types of people. I had a roofing company, a foreign company. Of course, when you're in restoration carpet cleaning, tile cleaning, air duct cleaning, all of that stuff. And, you know, we were, we were the largest restoration company in Southern Colorado. I did all my own ads. Anyway, I did all my own stuff. And, you know, it was very, very simple. It was very simple to do Google because not everybody was doing it to do paper click. We're in a world today where it's changing rapidly. Things are changing almost daily in Google. And if you don't have a mentor to help you with that, then you're going to, you're going to fail. And here's why I love Ed stuff so much. It's because almost weekly he's adding fresh content. I have probably spent minimum $30,000 and six years buying classes, buying courses on paper click. I'm not going to name any, any classes that I want to throw anybody into the bus, but I've really gotten nothing out of all those. One of the classes was 10,000 bucks. I actually bought two, one for 10 and one for 7500. Luckily, I got my money back on the $7500 one because it was such crap, right? The $10,000 class, I did learn quite a bit, but I'm going to tell you right now, Ed stuff in forge. Oh, so the $10,000 class here, Ed's way up here with the content he's putting out. It's so much better at hardly no cost at all. I kind of find it hard to believe that Ed actually sells it for such a low cost as good as he is. But you can tell by listening to Ed, you know, a lot of these gurus are very, I don't know condescending. You know, Ed is so humble, and he has all this knowledge. Quite frankly, Ed's a type of kid. He's not a kid, a man. When I was in school, when I was in high school, he's the type of kid in high school that we would beat up because he was way too smart and made us all look bad, right? And now we need these people, right? I never beat anybody up, Ed. That's other people did. I'm too much of a whim. It wasn't me, but Ed is brilliant. And he's like genius at pay-per-click, and he's so humble at how he delivers things and what he has. It is, I don't know that I can say enough good for Ed to help him get more people into his forge group. And look, he doesn't take everybody. He's interviewing people, and you know, you're going to be very, very fortunate if you get into this group because some of the top names in the world are in there. I remember when I first signed up with Ed in the very beginning. I'm not even sure I'd get in now, but when I first signed up and I saw Mike Rhodes was a member of his group, and I'm like, oh my gosh, I bought all of Mike Rhodes stuff also. And listen, Mike Rhodes, his stuff is brilliant. He's one of the top pay-per-click experts in the world. So I knew I was in a scary place at that moment. I'm like, these people might be way too smart for me, way over my head. This is unbelievable. And you know, the way Ed delivers stuff, I bought, I don't even know if he sells it anymore, God Tier Eds in the very beginning. And we actually use God Tier Eds as our checklist in our agency. And I was, I was never planning on owning an agency. It wasn't my, that's not what I wanted to do. I had this very successful restoration business that was the largest in Southern Colorado. I sold it. I did really well with it. I could have just retired my wife retired. She worked in the company for 27 years also. But those of you that are entrepreneurs out there that are listening to this right now, what do we do once we do that, right? I don't fish. I've golfed a couple of times and my friends quit inviting me because quite frankly, it takes me 40 times to get it into the hole. And so I had to cheat because they retired waiting on me. So what I do really, really well is this, what I'm doing now. We're helping people make money and I love it so much. And when we're in that business, I hope that all of you think like me, we want to give our clients the very best. We want to give them 150%. Even though there's no such thing as 150%, I still use that term because if we give everything we got and a little bit more to our clients and because we're collecting money for them, we're trading a service for their money. We want to give them the very best and I'm telling you right now, you need to be part of Ed's group. You need to be part of his membership because there's nothing out there like this. I've spent over $30,000 and six years on courses myself. I've bought almost everything and nothing compares to this. Nothing even comes close to this. If Ed started like getting rid of people that he didn't want in his group, right? I would probably, if he let me go, I would probably cry for two weeks and I don't cry. Maybe a month because it's such good stuff and I look forward to it and weekly we're getting things. And I love the fact that Ed just put out this stuff on RSAs and how to write them and should we pin, should we not pin? You know, all this stuff is every week I'm getting such value. And like I said, I don't give out testimonies. I think that they're overrated. There's way too many people out there that are giving testimonies for companies and they're, and it seems like the same damn people on some of these courses that you're buying that are, it's the greatest thing since Apple Pie if you're from the USA, right? But nothing compares to what Ed has put out. Nothing at all compares to it. Nothing even comes close. I'm letting you know right now. Thank you so much, Ed. Thank you for being so brilliant and being so humble and sharing all this knowledge with us because as a, as a freelancer in the beginning and as doing Google ads for my own company, I never had the privilege of working for other companies and learning what they do, go into another one and learning what they do, learning all these different ways to do things and figuring out for myself what is best. I've worked by myself and I've learned from classes. So it's a little intimidating sometimes when you get on and you're talking about what you know, when you don't know what everybody else knows yet. And I just, I think that I'm getting really, really good at what I do. Ed just put out a video. I was listening to something Ed was saying how he works two hours a, it's either two hours a day or a week. I don't work that much either. I have employees now. In fact, I know I do have employees in the US but overseas. So my agency is running 24 hours a day and we're about to open in another country with top click Joe using their currency. I'm already setting that up. So at 65 years old, most people my age are thinking about laying down on a couch and watching TV, eating popcorn, getting fat. I still, I do CrossFit. I stay healthy. I'll never quit. I don't, entrepreneurs don't quit and I love what I do. I love helping people and I love the fact that Ed is so generous with his knowledge. If you want to learn everything there is to know about pay per click and this industry that we work in, then I, I'm telling you, this would be the best investment you could ever make. I would have paid the $30,000 that I've already spent on classes and it may be more than that. I can't, I'm just figuring out in my head just what I can remember. So I'm sure it's more than that in six years. I would have paid that to edge classes worth that and some, and you're not going to be paying that is not even close. It's not even the same universe. But the guy's brilliant and he deserves a testimony like this because there's nothing like what he does out there. When you have one of the top people in the world as a member in his group, following Ed, you know, you're in the right place at that point. And, you know, so I'm so happy to be here. Ed, thank you so much. This is a, this is a sincere heartfelt testimony for Ed Lee. He owns Forge and I pray that you use your brain and you think about it at least, at least start talking with Ed about what he has and get in his interview process to get into this group because it is bar none the best group in the world for pay per click. And I belong to other groups. I belong to several because I like seeing what's going on and what's changing, you know, things are changing rapidly. And, you know, and you want, you don't, you don't want to buy a course or a class where somebody has never even done it himself. Like I thought about doing my own class like in selling a course, right, because I'm fairly good at doing pay per click. But then you get into a group like Ed's and you start questioning yourself. You start thinking, wow, am I really that good? I really need to pay attention here so I can do a better job for my own clients. I have a very low turnover rate for my clients because I give them 150% and I do everything I can to get them leads and I stay in my lane and my niche and Ed will talk about that a lot. Get a niche, stay in that niche. I just happened to know a lot more than most of you out there because I own the restoration company for 27 years, and I had almost 50 employees. So I know a lot about that arena. And I know how to make money. And I love what I do now and I love that, you know, if you're in, if you're interested in getting into pay per click or you've been doing it and you want to grow your business, Ed's place is this is where you need to be in forge. You need to be here. Okay, I'm growing my business because of Ed and who does that at 65 me. I'm going to grow this thing. I want to be one of the world's largest agencies now because it sounds like it'd be fun. So I'm starting to move things around and I'm starting to grow but you got to start somewhere you got to start small you got to get good at what you do and the way you get good is being in groups like Ed's. Thank you, Ed, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you, I thank you, I thank you. And I can't wait to see what else you're going to put out there. And if you're not in this group, you need to get a hold of Ed, and you need to get into this group because this is the best group, like far in the world that I know of right now. Thank you so much, Ed. Bye bye.
