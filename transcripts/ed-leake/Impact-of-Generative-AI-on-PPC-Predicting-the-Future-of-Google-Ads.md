for an individual to keep up with it is really difficult. So I don't I cheat. The last two years has been the most disruptive in terms of new technology and AI and automation, but also government regulation. Is there anything you're doing now to sort of safeguard against different changes and regulations above the, you know, making sure you've got cookies on your website? OK, so this is a really hard question. Funny enough, someone asked me yesterday about what the future holds. No one knows. Let's first say that. Not even Elon Musk. No one knows. So if you're looking beyond five years, no one's got a clue really anything could happen from a mindset perspective. And just a psychological drain, I would try and avoid thinking too far ahead because it's going to send you loopy when I first started coming out a couple of years ago. All I was thinking I was consumed by thinking about, oh, what's going to happen in five years? What's going to happen in 10 years? And it just consumes you. So you've got to live in the moment and, you know, think ahead, but try and keep it to a year or two in this environment. So what I mean, what can we do? Well, the problem is AI isn't good enough yet to replace us. If it's good enough to replace you, you need to get better. So I'm happy for you to go down either the path of different recommendations or things you're putting in your own agency, or if you want to be really brave and stand out and limb with some things that you think will be coming in. Yeah, what the future of our industry looks like. Yeah, we use it for basic automations, like helping us improve ad copy and that sort of thing. Yeah, some language models for writing landing page copy or suggesting new headlines, even to analyze negatives. Typically, these automations and tools are not very good with numbers. So we don't rely on it for any analysis currently of the data because you've then got to double check the work. You might as well have done the work anyway. So really top level stuff, really basic. We're playing with some different tools that. Well, actually, I can't take credit for this. A chap called Dan Barrett in Forge, he's automated using Zapier and chat GPT, his reports for his agency where it will literally do all the summaries and explain the reports in English to his clients. And it's done a pretty good job. So I mean, that saves 20 minutes an account a month. You got 50 accounts, soon adds up in terms of all the legislative stuff, like the cookies and the law or even Google's getting caught offside with that. So for an individual to keep up with it is really difficult. So I don't, I cheat. I use some of my harder money to hire someone to do it for me. And if you're a freelancer, you're like, yeah, but I've got lots of money or whatever. It's like, OK, we'll just find someone in on upwork who's a specialist in the tracking side or the consent mode side or whatever it is that you're struggling with. It's normally tracking. Most of us don't want to be stuck in tag manager and messing around and tracking gone are the days where I can be asked with any of that. So I just find someone that literally it's going full circle to the niching again. I find someone who's not a Google ads specialist or a marketer. I find someone that specifically calls out that they're really good with tag manager or tracking. I'm like, OK, speak to that person hire them for a few hours a week or as a one off that you need to fix a few things for you. So offload it. Get it out of there into someone else's head that knows how to deal with it. So it's the cheats way, but it's the best way, I think.
