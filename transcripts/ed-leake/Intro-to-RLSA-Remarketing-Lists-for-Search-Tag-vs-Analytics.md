Hey, Ed Leak here. So we get to see hundreds of Google AdWords accounts and that means we get to see hundreds of problems, if not thousands of problems. One of the main features that people are forgetting or neglecting to use in their Google AdWords accounts when we look at them is RLSA. So remarketing lists for search advertising. So today I want to quickly run through what it is, how you use it, install it or use it. A couple of caveats or common problems we see and then a few advanced techniques that we use with retargeting lists for search advertising. Essentially people that are in your list, your audience, could be organic traffic, social media traffic, direct traffic, email traffic to your website. If these people are searching again for your keywords and your search terms you can retarget them because they're obviously still in the market. Now you can install a tag for your lists which are subject cookies people as they visit your website but the better way or the prefer option is to use your analytics integration and send audiences from Google Analytics back to your AdWords account. So I'm going to hop over to the computer, she's over there and show you how to do this. Won't be a second. Okay so I'm just in a test account and on your left hand menu in AdWords, this is using the old interface by the way so this will move unfortunately. We do have access to the beta but we're playing around with it at the minute so I'm going to show you the old interface which is not exactly great timing but never mind. This is where you'd set it up within shared library audiences. If we click view, if you've never set it up before you'd be presented with this and then set up remarketing you can ignore dynamic for now and Google literally gives you a retargeting tag which is fine but it means you've got to add another tag to your website and maintain another tag but there are also some limitations that you don't get with analytics so if we jump over to Analytics, I prefer Analytics because it can send audiences and segments that you create over to AdWords. You don't have to install any code, you don't have to do anything clever, it's really straightforward so you would literally create a segment. So for example here these time-based segments that we've set up, if I just edit one of these, these are great. So these essentially say for this particular account someone who's spent between two and four minutes and they're from the UK are in this segment which we can then create an audience from. So really simple, demographic, location, you don't have to put that in if you don't want to but the condition's the important thing here so the filter is session duration is between 120 seconds and 239 so two to four minutes. A quick tip here, get rid of that, put that to 240, call that four minutes and that you can call it whatever you like but I'm just changing that because I'm a bit OCD. Session duration 240 that's essentially saying anyone who's spent four minutes or more on the website is in this segment okay and that four-minute segment we found over the years particularly for retargeting is quite the sweet spot no matter if you're a service or e-commerce based business people who've spent four minutes or more who haven't converted are ripe for retargeting. So let's assume we save that and we've got our audience, I beg your pardon, our segment. Now what we do is go in here and we've got all these segments, custom ones, loads and loads and loads but what we can do is literally when we've got the audience set up go to the right hand side click on actions and then build audience and this takes you through to the admin. Essentially what you're doing here is setting the membership duration so how long will people remain in your retargeting list this particular list. I just said retargeting instead of remarketing in this day and age they're the same bloody thing it's just Google calls it remarketing to confuse people so those terms are interchangeable. They didn't used to be by the way but Google has changed the rules being Google. A membership duration 30 days is about right for most people if you're a service-based business for example and you've got a long sales cycle you could push this out to sort of 90 days but this is you know I can't tell you what to put here. This for most e-commerce stores 30 days is ample for most service-based businesses 30 to 90 but it all comes down to your understanding of your business so we're not going to labor that point. One annoying thing it doesn't carry through the name so you have to put the information in there and then you just get the audience definition here to confirm what you are in the next step sending over to your destination which is an AdWords account and literally if I okay that and then hit publish it will go to that AdWords account I'm not going to do it because this is a live account so what happens when that is sent over to AdWords I'm going to jump in and show you.
