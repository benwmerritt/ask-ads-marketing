All I know is that if I stopped posting videos, business would quieten up. That's the only barometer I've had for the past decade. If I go quiet, it trends off. Does YouTube work? Well, fuck me. In the short term and long term, it depends on your experience. Definitely the build up, the snowball effect. And seeing the laser targeted as well. Yeah, he's more laser at the moment. Some super lasers, those case studies for specific industries of the bollocks. They're what I would do if I was going niche. And probably Google ads, I'm not because I'm doing training mainly now. It's not niche, niche is it? So I know there's three people here that have done YouTube and made a living out of it. Michael, well, I think Michael, I don't know if Michael says that YouTube is living, but Sam is making it work. It's worked for me. I deleted loads of them. I shouldn't have done. I used to do like news videos, embarrassing. Back in like 2014, I think. But they got me clients. They got me clients. I used to post them on Facebook as well and boost them a little bit. And they got me clients. I literally talk about what's happening on Facebook ads, Google ads. They were shit. And they had a really cheesy intro, but YouTube has worked. And my Google analytics training stuff that I put on there, that absolutely generated. That probably built half a frigging agency. You put case studies up. You put example case studies up. You put testimonies up. You put your broader picture stuff up for your Shopify and your little new ones inside Shopify and stuff. But the more niche stuff you can do the better. It's specific thing for the type of store. I know plenty of people who stuck to it. I know Jeff Sauer, he did a 90 day challenge. And he literally built a new, he already had a consulting training business. He built a new one on top of it from those videos. Quite substantial because it's just relentless. So I do wish you all the luck with that. It's hard for me to work. I don't know if I've never been able to do it, but it gets you that archive of content there. And you've got so much you can repurpose as well across social and stuff. Also as well, not just even if you get no clients from it, but someone would say everything else is the same as you've got a prospect he's picking between you and another agent. Who are they going to pick if you've got this archive of knowledge? Don't even need that many subscribers, but they can just see you're committed to the process. You're sharing it. Exactly. It's better than LinkedIn CV, that's for sure. And I agree with you. The channel's really young and I don't care about the vanity metrics as much. It'd be nice to have a little bit more retention on that. But it's like it's right in the work and the videos you put out, I think. Absolutely. And just piecing that all together, like you say, that massive public archive of all the things that we take for granted. Sometimes convince ourselves that other people know that stuff and that, how to do that anyway, and really they don't. We put those small things out a bit, could be viewed as massive value for them. Yeah. All I know is that if I stopped posting videos, business would quieten up. That's the only barometer I've had for the past decade. Literally, if I post videos, I get people contacting me, messaging me, inquiries, buying stuff. If I go quiet, it trends off. YouTube's a compounding thing and definitely works. Yeah. But it's the highest barrier to entry as well because the video production is the hardest thing to do. Anyone can write something and spit it out.
