Most folks in your industry, they think very rationally, they treat humans as economists who treat humans, which they take normal decisions. No, they don't. Humans are just irrational. But the bit that I get transfixed on and what most of us would be is the unique positioning or proposition, how we stand out. But actually having that distinctive brand is probably a stronger weapon to cut through other advertising, PPC managers to use a weird metaphor. You talked about it, you know, we all, I come from a scientific background, like I used to, I studied mechanical engineering and I like my numbers and shit like that. So I understand where we're all coming from here. Like we like the report somewhere, but definitely the distinctive brand is really leaning on the irrational side of human beings. And it doesn't mean much, you know, it's not meaningful. It's not purpose led. It's literally just leaning on the way people remember and notice stuff, which is about, you know, stuff that are different or more noticed. I know it sounds very, very obvious, but like, that's it. So by leaning on that, you have an advantage because most folks in your industry, exactly as I said, do not think this way. They think very rationally, they treat humans as, you know, like economists would treat humans, which they, you know, take normal decisions. No, they don't. Like humans are just irrational and you need to lean on that. So yeah, it's, that's usually to answer your question, I had to go back to it. That's usually the highest level because so, so very few understand and do it. Yeah, I like that. I think just considering that could help a lot of people here and also the triggers. So in the third part of the canvas, the trigger. I mean, one of the simplest things you could do is every single lead that's come to you in the past six, 12 months, whatever, or every person you've spoken to, just think back and write a note of what triggered why they came to you in the first place. Cause I've never really considered that. And those triggers are, they're not pain points. Are they? They are literally a response to a situation that people find themselves in. And there will be multiple triggers that you could use, literally call people out. So be careful when you ask this, as you said, that question about clients, usually they would start with the problem that just happened. Right. So usually they wouldn't go that far back in time. So it's up to you to really ask the specific question, but okay, you know, you want to bring back Google ads in house, but what led to that? Right. Really asking like a, like acting like a journalist to uncover the, the things that led to that, the events. And usually, and then you need to guess, like again, intuition is important here. People are going to lie to you. I'm not going to forget shit. So you also need to develop an intuition about what makes people act. And a lot of it is the irrational social emotional type of triggers. So like quick example. For hot jar, you said one of the key trigger for us was our website commissions have dropped while and they are on Google analytics usually. And there's quite a few steps after to pick hot jar, but the core trigger, the biggest one was this one. And guess what? We build entire campaigns around Google analytics. The entire positioning became about, we show you what people really don't know website and like traditional re-analytics. And it worked really well. Just because we think we thought of trigger. I worked with a shampoo company years ago, serving Latinas in particular. One of the core trigger was when the weather becomes more humid and they're planning to go somewhere like an event or whatever on their with friends. That's usually when they think of shampoo, they think of controlling their hair. Again, some of this, but like the purpose to understand that the best type of customers were living in California and Florida in particular, because the weather is more humid there than ever, than in the US. It's those things where in retrospect, it sounds fucking obvious, but trust me, the power is, you know, going through that. Like I bought that very microphone because I leaned on my irrational fucking brain telling me you need to sound like Joe Rogan, even though I hate the guy. But I researched the mic he was using and I'm using the same because I want you to have the same type of voice. So it started by listening to a fucking podcast of his. So now if you're sure the company and you want to send a microphone, guess where you need to advertise on podcasts and say, Hey, you know, podcast of guests that have very good voice and say, you know, do you want to sound like him? You know, it's so it feels so easy now. You know exactly what to say. And that's why the city is important like for triggers. Last example, a solar panel company I also work with from my program. One of the quad triggers was, oh shit, electricity, electricity processes are going up on where they were in that context, watching the news. And they were with their partner. Guess where you should be as well. And what type of stuff could you say? And what is the monster here? The monster is the greedy corporations putting the fucking electricity price up. That's it. The only thing you need to say is that and you are the answer to that. And your point of view could be around that and all of that. You can see how powerful it becomes when you understand triggers and not just problem and solution.
