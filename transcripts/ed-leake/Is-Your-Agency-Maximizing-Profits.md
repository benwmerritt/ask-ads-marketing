Okay, cool. I'm giving you this client. Now you've got eight ways to make money out of him over the long period of time You want that client to be the happiest they can possibly be Cool, so I've thought long and hard and deep about this I came from a sales team Used to run sales teams blah blah blah So I've kind of taken some of those elements and then inputted them into the delivery team So I've actually got eight different segments that somebody can own commissions based off now One of the big things that I found is I pay for commissions on the previous month So there's always a big check coming which gets them excited which kind of keeps them in that role You know what I mean and that kind of you talking a little bit about that But there's it's really based on how you've kind of structured your company now I know a little bit about Your service off offering this and once they're on board is there any way for them to step up on pricing? Or is there a value ladder you can tack on additional services or yeah, so we're gonna roll out Facebook ads now Go as a part of that. So that's gonna be one of the things Potentially well, I think we ruled out last week, but we were thinking about doing a bit of video work, but I think It's not really gonna be worthwhile after our conversation last week So we'll stick with Facebook ads do that. Well, cool complimentary service. That's perfect. Yeah But what what I do is the eight different segments is one is the sale of additional services So because that person's dealing with them on a day-to-day basis They build the trust up and then we'd be like cool what you guys need right now three months into the relationship or whatever It's Facebook ads. Let's take it on. They're gonna start the conversation So if they started up they get them to the point where that's good you give them a percentage of that And then I've also got scaling up. So how my ad spend Works, you know, we package it into certain levels zero to 10 K is this price 10 K to 20 K is this price blah blah blah all the way Up so if somebody scales them up and that's really like client success, you know, because you're on the scaling up if You know the clients happy and you're getting the results. So that's the second major one And then the third one is like a portfolio threshold, which is exactly what we were talking about Hey, five X of whatever they're getting paid, you know You set that threshold for that role and then you say it cool any dollar over that amount I'll give you a commission on gotta give them a bit of oomph to like go and push for more Etc. And then I do all client happiness and client success stuff. So Google review throwing 50 bucks clutch review throwing 50 bucks video testimonials case studies and even referrals So there's quite a few different elements there, but it's like, okay, cool I'm giving you this client now you've got eight ways to make money out of him over the long period of time You want that client to be the happiest they can possibly be, you know, I mean, and so that's how I've kind of designed it But yeah, cool. That's very loads of avenues so you kind of like Leave it to you the client manager to be able to like I mean That's interest for the client to do well then dissolve them all things all based on their success and yeah Give them loads of avenues to achieve that in very achievable ways as well Yeah, like even even a Google review that looks great on your business at the end of the day But that's like 50 bucks. You can throw them, you know, usually when a client gives a review I'll throw them an incentive to you know, I mean to get that kind of what's about to get it kind of happening, you know I mean so Very good. Thank you. It's sort of like affiliate marketing is it But yeah, I've been the same I've tossed $50 code to people that leave me a review for God to it. So absolutely Cock on there Liam with all those different avenues. Is there a Safety net though where someone who someone might be a little bit keen to try and upsell and do all these things month one Do you have a sort of a like don't try and sell to this client until after? Three months or anything like that. So how I've kind of Scott the my project management system set up Sorry is there's a first 90 days which is a scaling program and then they kind of hit into a maintenance program So within that first 90 days, there's certain points where I I give them this suggestion of going ahead and going You're either you want to scale up now or you want to go ahead and try and offer a different service So like even doing things like down sales, you know, like you could you know Like click cease or something along those lines like additional services that people think about 14 weeks 14 days in or 30 days in you go Hey, we've been monitoring the traffic on on your particular Market and we found that there is a lot of fraudulent clicks like you just throw them in a dummy account for a little bit See if that is and then you go. Yeah. Yeah, it's 40 bucks a month or whatever Even though it's a down sell that's you're selling the software that doesn't take any additional time off your plate Doesn't take any maintenance for you for you to do pretty much like 40 50 bucks worth of profit all day You know what I mean? So, yeah, there's little things And the old add up the old add up first you with scale you and some of both, you know At scale where you're doing 20 counts 30 counts 40 50, you know, you're going for more and more and more So it's all these out of but you are very process driven So you've got you've got a specific process to go through which triggers these points of Upsells cross sells review gathering and so on I believe that is in the on massive onboarding checklist that's inside for to trigger a review After 90 days as well. I don't know if anyone uses that massive checklist, but it is that's in there as well. So yeah, it's good. Good idea You
