Your Google remarketing campaigns are probably broken. When surveyed by Forbes, chief marketing officers across the globe share their number one priority. And it was boring. Marketing efficiency. But before you switch off, and to prove boring can actually be very beneficial. Great news everyone! Let me show you one example of marketing efficiency in action and why your remarketing campaigns are possibly and probably broken. On one hand the ad platforms are trying to increase our efficiency and on the other they stick two fingers at us. So what's this one setting that wrecks or breaks your retargeting? Well let's just create a display campaign inside Google now. So obviously you would fill in campaign name, location and so on. And then if it's a retargeting campaign you might retarget your past seven day users and you might exclude your converters. But what happens when you add an audience in display is you get this targeting expansion and by default it's set on. It's set to essentially a conservative setting. But this breaks your retargeting because it expands your audiences beyond what is inside your list. So you want to turn this off. And I see this on in pretty much every account that we audit. And when we look at their retargeting or remarketing we see this setting is turned on. And it's as simple as that. You want that off. You do not want to expand remarketing audiences. In addition you might also skip past additional settings. In here I would highly recommend you exclude all of this. Now this obviously mature audiences comes down to your own product and service that you're marketing. But for most people yes this will limit where your adverts are displayed and your retargeting adverts. But for most people you do not want these content types because they're essentially low quality and low value. And most of us don't want our brands or our clients brands featured on this kind of sensitive topic. I'd also recommend you try removing below the fold and in video because these will certainly lift your quality of impressions. You click the rate and should increase your ad rank as a result which will lower your cost per click and your cost per thousand impressions. Your CPM. And this is true not just of retargeting audiences but of any kind of audience that you may add to your display campaign. So if this wasn't a retargeting campaign you might be targeting an audience then the same thing happens. Your targeting expansion by default is set to this first point which is a conservative expansion. Now for non remarketing you can turn this on but I'd recommend starting off with it off and only expand when you find that this audience that you're using in your display campaign is actually working for you. And then allow the automation to kick in but otherwise if you're doing any kind of retargeting you do not want targeting expansion on it muddies your audience. And that's it how to unbreak your remarketing campaigns in Google ads. So is your marketing efficient and are your remarketing campaigns broken. Jump into your Google ads and double check that setting and make sure it's turned off.
