fashion it reworded a little bit to be calling out a specific industry. Because I'd still bet that that would outperform a catchall one. You cannot really say, okay, I'm in the dire situation. I need leads right now. Basically what we're trying to do is getting more leads in our funnel. Google has dedicated funnel and C level dedicated funnel because mostly we talk to CEOs and CMOs in the e-commerce industry. But we tried some cold LinkedIn messaging with a bloody Pmax ebook that I wrote and we had good returns so I think yeah. But your funnel's open-ended, isn't it? It's not niche specific or anything, is it? It's sort of any e-commerce. I think when they have three or four resources don't know, they get another email automation with the case study, with customer reviews and stuff like that. Take your very best case study for an industry that you want to work with. Replicate your lead magnet and funnel, just copy and paste it and literally just change instead of saying e-commerce, call out the industry or the niche. Just to see, then you've got one funnel that's going after everyone and then you could go after that specific vertical industry and just see how more responses you get from a slightly tailored. I'm not saying rewrite everything, I'm just saying sort of fashion it, reword it a little bit to be calling out a specific industry because I'd still bet that that would outperform a catchall one. Once it's working, you could try not gating it till they download the thing and then ask for the PDF, email, sorry, but at this stage you need email, so yes. Which I know some people find a bit uneasy because you've sort of reached out and then you're asking them to put their email in, but I would still very much try. In the past I've been a bit caught out with giving away freebies and having massive numbers of leads, but not many of them converting. Until you start to tailor it down a bit more. I sort of forced it with, even with God Tier ads, I forced it down a are you an agency or are you a business because the language is quite different to what people want when you're an agency and when you're an agency that immediately a freelancer and a marketer sort of understands that language whereas a business owner is not, it does make a difference. If I was in your shoes, I would duplicate, tweak and then have two attempts going. So I've got one list of people in this industry who I'm contacting with my slightly tailored funnel and then the other funnel is just running because I don't think it'd be a lot more work.
