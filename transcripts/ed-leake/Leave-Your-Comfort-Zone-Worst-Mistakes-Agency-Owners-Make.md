When you focus on your weaknesses and try to improve them, you waste a lot of time, focus on your strengths. And once I switched, that's when it thrived. You're watching Agency Forge on YouTube, the mastermind community for PPC agency owners looking to scale without the stress. I feel like the biggest mistake I made when I very first started and I'm getting better at it now. The biggest thing was not being myself. And I personally think step out of your comfort zone is the worst advice ever given. And it's extremely common in that if you focus on something you're terrible at and you hate it, it's really bad for your mental health. And I've always seen, you know, if you're scale 1 to 10, if your skill set is a 1, maybe it's in-person networking, which is me. That's a real example. That's how I tried to get clients in the very beginning. I went to networking events every breakfast and lunch in and happy hour. I hated it. Nearly gave me a heart attack where I'd almost throw up in my car right before I go in to some breakfast. I'm supposed to shake hands and give out business cards. It's like, oh, this is going to go really well. But yeah, scale 1 to 10, you start at a 1 and so many people step out of your comfort zone. Step out of your comfort zone. If you work really hard, you're going to go from a 1 to maybe a 5 out of 10. Nobody wants to hire a 5. That's a waste of everybody's time. If you're naturally good at something and you enjoy it, or at least if you're naturally good, you're a 7 out of 10 without trying. If you work really hard, you're a 10 out of 10. People want to hire 10s. 10s will be successful. So if you're naturally good behind the scenes and getting organized and project management, or if you are good with people, or amazing at networking, they make friends for life going to a business happy hour and 10 clients on the way out. It's like, well, I don't know which one you went to because I went to the Chamber of Commerce and I went to all these other ones. And it's like, I didn't get a single appointment. Just no, I hated it. And that was, I was never going to be very good at networking. And I worked ridiculously hard and maybe became a 4 out of 10. And I almost threw up every time I almost went into an event. And I did that for a year. And it just, that was such a big mistake. It's like, why don't I do PPC and SEO? That's my skill set. That's my comfort zone. That's where I'm extremely good. You know, like Michael Jordan, he played basketball. Was he a good writer? Who knows? Like he focused on one thing and one thing only. He was naturally good at it and became a legend. He didn't focus on other stuff. I'm sure he had other interests, but when you focus on your weaknesses and try to improve them, you waste a lot of time. Focus on your strengths. And once I switched probably about a year and a half in this was so stupid. I decided to be myself, stay in my comfort zone, which is the opposite of advice you get. That's when it thrived. I did a ton of SEO. I could write, I could build back the links. I knew SEO very well. And I did PPC from my own agency, my PPC agency. I ran PPC for myself. My, my skill set, what I love to do was extremely good at, I switched to that and clients started pouring in. And I got to, I just wore headphones all day. Didn't talk to anyone that was in my comfort zone. I loved it. I was so much happier and it was wildly successful. Imagine that it's like, if you hate it and you're not good at it, don't do it. We're all adults. That's a, that's advice you give to children because you don't know what they're good at. People 20s, 30s, 40s, you know what you're good at and what you suck at and what you're terrible at and what you don't like. Don't do it. Yeah. That's, that's, yeah, that's mega. I love that. You're similar to me in that I do networking events because in my early days and hated them and I tried doing actual events where you hired a big stand and nightmare hate it. Yeah. Speaking. It, it's, well, speaking. Yeah. People ask me all the time, can you come and speak at this? Can you come and speak at that? And I just say, I just can't, I'm a hermit. I, that is way out of my comfort zone. I don't need the money. So I don't need to put myself under that stress. I'd be red faced swearing. I'd fall over the place. I probably, I probably get into my stride about halfway through when everyone's left because I've, you know, embarrassed myself and then it'd be great, but no one's there to watch it. And the other thing is what you stick in your comfort zone. Stick to your lane. Yeah. A lot of people would misinterpret that as complacency. It's like, oh, Chris isn't very driven. No, but they're misinterpreting it. It's lane and put your foot down and then hire for all the shit you can't do or don't want to do. If you're, you know, if you're crap at front of house stuff, if you're not a good salesperson, you don't like talking to people. Well, that's where you want to find someone to do that for you. You know, if you crap at the Google ads, don't, because a lot of people start an agency and they want to do Facebook ads or SEO, whatever. And they have no technical ability. It's quite a common question I get is, Ed, I want to join Forge. I don't really know Google ads. I'm not very good at it. You know, manage a couple of accounts, not getting the results. I'm like, do you want to run an agency or do you want to be a Google ads person? Because if you can't do the Google ads, you need to white label it, outsource it, hire for it. But that's where your head needs to be. Your head doesn't need to be. I'm trying to grow a business and I'm trying to become an expert in something that I suck at and I don't really want to. But I don't really enjoy it, but it's part of the business. It doesn't have to be. And I think this is where this is the Internet mindset, isn't it? It's because everyone on Instagram is faking it till they make it and all that crap. And it forces that horrible mindset of just, you know, you just got to do 80 hours a week, you know, break out of your, you know, comfort zone and do this, do that. It's all in words. It's bollocks. And I like the YouTube thing. I had to sort of, I had to break out my comfort zone to do YouTube originally and now I don't mind it so much. But if you're sat there looking at us two watching this going, I don't want to do video. It makes me vomit, sweat, piss myself. It's like, don't do video then just because I say it's good and Chris is making it work. Don't do video if you're watching this, if you don't like it. It's in the beginning, but if you piss yourself and you made your 20th video, just stop. You're tearing yourself apart. It's challenging yourself and stepping out of your comfort zone or two different things. And I think that's what the complacency thing is. And I think especially adults, if you're in your 30s and 40s, you know what you're good at and you know what you're not good at. That's advice for much, much younger people because they don't know. If you're really good at something, just stick to that and you're going to thrive in it. And I think, you know, speaking of the hustle and grind and 80 hours week and all that. I mean, that's something that's been very eye-opening to me taking care of, you know, mental health and happiness and all that. I'm not motivated by money at all. And there's plenty of rich people that are miserable. So it's not really being a data person that chart doesn't correlate. Doesn't make any sense. I go to my kids' things, you know, they have some thing at their school. I go to it. I'm usually the only dad there and it's like, well, you know, you guys can work. I'm going to go to my kids' stuff. And that's, that drives me and that makes me happy. And, you know, just not getting caught up in every little thing and making more money, you know. And my goal, it's not even money. You know, it's, I'm at about 35 hours a week. I want to go to 30, 25, 25. That's my goal. I don't like boats and private jets and all this other stuff. I don't really care. That's fine if that's what it pays you and you want to do that. But I mean, my goal is to be put on paper, I mean, be work five hours a week and make 200K. And no one, no one sells that in their course. That's not an ad. I've always stayed figure some months. It's like, I don't care. I just barely want to work. Yeah. I talk about it quite a lot because it's, it's the, the other side of it. And there's people like me who are obsessed with creating things and it's the pain in the ass. But I've learned to back away from it. It's like, oh, I did that. I need to do another thing. Often it's been motivated by money. I am less so now because the older you get, the re, you realize that time's worth a hell of a lot. And if you're going to lose that 10 hours a week, you need to be sure that in five years, that was the right move because how much is it going to give you? It's on their wishing to have more money. It's always, no, once more time. No, well, maybe more money to buy that extra organ that they couldn't quite afford. Yeah, maybe. But no, super important. The thing with a good agency enables is what you're hankering after, which is less overhead, less stress, less work, but still a very favorable income. Just like the UK, there are parts of America where you can live on 200 grand, very. What was the word? Royally, should we say? There are certain cities that you probably barely get a window, but there are parts of the country where that's a lot of money. So I completely get that. And I think I talk about this at the very start in Forge. You've got to have that. You've got to agree with yourself what your vision is. Is it the lifestyle business or is it the growth business? Yeah. If you're trying to get somewhere in the middle, it gets messy, but you've got to be honest to yourself and say, can I stomach that? And you don't have to say yes. You can say, you know what? I don't want all that, but I do want the nice bit, the lifestyle bit like your building. Yeah, the point is it has to be your dream. You can't force someone else's dream on you. It has to be your own motivation. And some people, you know, like my friends that are entrepreneurs, I don't think they can shut down. It's not really about the money. It's just about staying busy and doing something and charging into the chaos and making order out of it. Like my friend that has franchises, he has five of them. He's just an operations guy. It could really be any single business. He just wants to go into the chaos and organize it. Let's switch this and make this more efficient. I don't think he can ever shut that off and he will never retire, but he has backed off on the hours. But it's like, you're just, that's how your brand works. You need something to fix something to organize something to do. Or people, they want a mansion and a Lamborghini. There's nothing wrong with that. If that's your life goal and you want to build an empire and, you know, they publish you in college classes on the greatest marketing person ever, that's fine. You just, you can't take someone else's dream and put it on you. That's like, from that inception movie, I like it so it's like, in the movie they're talking about, you can't just say something to somebody and it'll plant in their subconscious and become their own thought. You have to make it think, make them think it was their own thought. That's the only way it will stay. That's a crazy movie about dreams and everything, but it's the same way. If someone else is like, hey, make eight figures a month. It's like, that doesn't motivate me. If someone's like, hey, you want to work five hours a week and get 200K, it's like, I'm listening. Actually forges like that work less, make more, more time. That's extremely motivating to me and the plan of working less and less and less. That gets me out of bed. I'm extremely excited just to exhilarate the thing. Kind of ironic. Yeah. I'm going to get to five hours a week one day. That's going to be the best life ever. I don't really, I need enough money, but that gets me out of bed, not the money. But he's quite, it's quite ironic, isn't it? Working less gets me out of bed. But I'd be a facetious. I know what you mean. I think that's good. And the health thing, again, front and center. Well, if you're in your 20s listening to this, you probably like, there. And I get it, you can bludgeon yourself when you're younger, but you really do have to think about the long term. Hey, this is Ed. Thanks for watching.
