took like no time. I mean look at this, beautiful. I've uploaded the search term report and you've got this heat map, this visualization of all the words broken down, so essentially engrams analysis and it's ordered by whatever you want to order and it even created filters. This is the other crazy thing. I didn't ask for filters, it created filters. Probably looking at all this and thinking oh that's a lot of work isn't it? Can't be asked to do that. Have no fear, you can ask Manus to do it for you. So then I said can you now improve the analysis by following the attached framework calling out any specific steps you took? I uploaded the framework and this is where it just took it to the next level. Oh wow, okay that's cool. So to not distract you in the hero it only fires after you scroll past the hero. Oh shit, we're cooked. It came up with this, it's a microsite. Look at this. View training opportunities. I don't know what color your pants are right now but life's short, there are too many AI tools and they waste your time because generally they're crap. Until now it seems like we've turned a corner after the past few years of all this crap that's been thrown at us. Marius AI, I've just been trying out thanks to a chap called Tom O'Grady who shared an invite link from my God-tipped alpha community. So I'm Edleek by the way if you don't know why I'm a Google ads guy, I sell frameworks and stuff, you don't have to worry about that if you're not interested in Google ads you can check me out edleek.com. Anyway Marius AI, this is not only tweaked but blown my whistle quite frankly so I'm just going to run you through what I've built with it. It's kind of scary. Are we cooked? I don't know, I'm feeling quite excited to be honest with you, not cooked. So yeah I just jumped into Marius, I didn't even pay for this, I have since subscribed, I think it's $39 I've paid or something just so I can do more things but you'll see I gave it quite a noddy prompt, this is not a very good or well thought out prompt. So the idea for this tool was take Google ads search reports and essentially doing a full analysis on it. So yeah create a web page where I can upload my Google ads search term data, create a visual heat map of the words based on ad spend so we categorize it by spend, allow it to be filtered by impressions, clicks and conversion metrics and also have an option to book it search terms by theme and context. I mean I didn't really specify too much and as you can see this ran, I can't remember how long it took, it didn't feel like it took that long. So it had a little error, I told it to continue, fair enough it sent me a notification, don't know what that was about but you can literally see it working through the process in real time here, thinking and thinking and thinking about it and I'll get to the point where it says I've successfully completed the task, it tells you what it's done, I mean this is ridiculous and then it gives me a link to deploy, well sorry it's deploying it to a development server and it gave me this link. So it was this, right? So I've just tried to upload a standard exported CSV of the search term reports, notice how it's incorrect, it didn't work but I didn't stipulate anything so I then in my original prompt so then I went on and asked, where is it? Here's an example export from Google ads, update the upload requirement and analysis to match this, I probably should have done that at the start, that's all I said, I literally gave it a standard export and said can you make it work? And it did, it ran through that, analyzed it and then pop, it came out with this version and then I'll just upload the sheet again and it's created this, like literally two prompts, now hold your horses, know what you're thinking, oh I can't read the text, it's not very good colour, what, yeah okay, nuance, details, yeah I've got to highlight this to read it but the information is here, okay, so I then said, and look it's got a working filter thing which is great, so then I said to it, right can we tidy this up a bit and I didn't get it spot on, I think I told it to like darken some bits, anyway, let me go to the final version that is sort of working as intended, this took like no time, I mean look at this, beautiful, I've uploaded the search term report and you've got this heat map, this visualization of all the words broken down, so essentially engrams analysis and it's ordered by whatever you want to order and it even created filters, this is the other crazy thing, I didn't ask for filters, it created filters, this is, yeah visually it's not bang on and it's still some dark text on dark backgrounds, it's still some white text here hidden but it's pretty freaking good, you've got match type analysis, ad group level by theme, so it's picked out different themes and this bit I love as well, which is what I asked for is the context analysis, so this one is general terms, I've got to highlight this because it's still, I couldn't get it to show this font as maybe I should have been more specific but anyway, it doesn't matter, so it shows you the spend, the number of terms, the number of conversions, conversion rate, now I haven't checked to see if it's hallucinating or not to make sure these numbers are correct, I did a couple of spot checks and it looked okay to me but obviously if you were to put this into a real production environment you would properly check it but for less than an hour's work and I say an hour's work, two minutes for me, 58 minutes for Marius, I just realized I called it Marius, it's called Manus, I need to go back and edit the start of the video, that's annoying, okay anyway but love this, so location based and I asked it to analyze the context and performance and notice how it's given us a quick summary, like look, below average performance, higher than average cost per conversion for price sensitive search terms and then the example search terms were here and then purchasing 10 example search terms here, now what I could do, see where it says there are 297 more or 32 more, I could essentially say to it, create me a report where I can expand this and then I could see all the high purchase intent, sorry the high converting search terms and themes here, so then I could, I mean I don't know if this is capable of doing it but I could perhaps upload my current ad group structure and say restructure the campaign to suit this analysis of the high converting, high performing search terms and of course the opposite, the stuff that's not working very well, like this question one spent not a lot of money, 77 quid, that spent 100 quid, this is only a small account over like three months, that's a bit bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, anyway this is fucking impressive, like just start for 10, now I did some other stuff which I want to show you, so let's have a look at that, so you can also use this for like landing page, we know that AI can be used for ad copy and copywriting, that's kind of obvious but I've done a proper landing page analysis because Manus, not Marius which I said before, Manus can go out to the web, so I said analyze my customer reviews from the God Tier Ads review page here, so just to show you what that looks like, so these are all the reviews from God Tier Ads customers, it's 200 and something and then make suggestions using the customer data to improve the landing page here and I'll show you the landing page, it's not great, it's in my typical style which is just a lot of text and not a lot of design quite frankly, anyway the goal of the landing page is to convert as many visitors to buyers as possible, again this prompt is super simple, there's nothing fancy here whatsoever and it did it pretty down quick, so it literally look, it shows you that it's scrolling down and what it's working on and you can click these bits and it shows you it literally scrolling down the page and extracting the reviews and you might be like well I don't have customer reviews, well do your competitors have customer reviews? Do you have links to forums and pages where people discuss the product or service that you have? Think outside the box, how do I collapse this? I know what I'm doing and then it created this, so it created, it's completed its analysis and it summarizes what it did for you, then it gives me a final report and it literally works through what I should do to change the page, okay, pretty impressive right? Well then I was thinking, hold on a minute, hold on, and by the way this is good, I mean I'm not going to walk through it all but I mean let's take this, let's take one as an example, so show strengths, limited showcase of the 400 step checklist, despite being a key selling point in reviews there's no specific testimonials about this feature, so straight away this is brilliant because I'm too close to the product, so I didn't even notice that one of the key selling points that's highlighted in customer reviews is not even showcased strongly or obviously on the sales page, yeah, and I do this for a living, so it's like a second pair of eyes, so anyway, we, Sam and I, Sam Oberhart, inside God Tier Ads there's a landing page checklist, if you sign up for God Tier Ads you get this, it's a 93 step checklist and in this day and age of AI you're probably looking at all this and thinking oh that's a lot of work isn't it, can't be asked to do that, have no fear, you can ask Manus to do it for you, so then I said, oh I said to visualise it, there can be some visual breakdowns of the data just for my own nerdiness, I love it, can you now improve the analysis by following the attached framework calling out any specific steps you took, I uploaded the framework, our framework, and this is where it just took it to the next level, so it was good out the box using essentially, I assume, data that it's found across the web and using best practices that it's found and so on, but my framework's better, better than all the free information, it's more specific, more precise, laser targeted, of course it is, I'm selling it, so I asked it to use that to see if it would enhance the output and it really did, so let me show you, it's got methodology steps that you can check, but the enhanced recommendations now uses the God Tier Ads priority checklist essentially with recommendations and implementations, now this is top level stuff, we can probably skip this, I want to see the meat, look at this, enhance the headline, so headline on a landing page is super important, revise the headline to specifically mention the 400 step checklist and framework consistency benefits, create a headline that combines the value propositions of master Google ads with our 400 step checklist and framework, get consistent results without guesswork, easy for me to say, sorry I was just trying to eat my tongue, so consistent results without guesswork, so the rationale, it gives you a rationale, I love this, it's not just giving you what and then what to actually implement, it's giving you the rationale behind it, so it identified a number of customer reviews that specifically spoke to this, this is, yes you can do this yourself, but this was quick, like real quick and it's fucking impressive and there's more, there's more, okay, so then I was like oh can you mock up the changes for me, this is where I got a little bit crazy, I actually asked it for a revised copy of the landing page because it mocked up a wire frame, I won't go for all this, but I'll go to the actual outputs at the end, so essentially I said oh could you make the changes to the page for me, so let's have a look at the page, so this is the page, you may notice I'm on there, what's the page, right, here's the tweak, now it's not perfect, but it's implemented its headline, so it's done that for me, it's implemented the subheading, and let's compare them, so my subheading is God Tier Ads Framework is the always updated Google Ads training that gives you instant clarity done for you templates, so you don't devote your life to the machine, it suggests during thousands of ppc professionals who've increased conversion rates by up to 145% which is outcome based, probably stronger, mine's a feature based, this is outcome, using our always updated framework, eliminate confusion, save hours with our comprehensive system, probably better, and then the reason it's probably better, they backed it up, they, the AI, shit I'm even referring to them as a human now, it is backed up with a testimonial in a box which is a bit wonky, but the principle is there, calls it out, then under my video, there isn't a call to action, but there is here, get your 400 step checklist now, now it's a bit sort of wonky, and look it's even, okay now, it's even added a button, does that even work, it bloody does, so it's added a button to go to the checkout, a hover button, which, and it even comes down after, oh wow, okay that's cool, so to not distract you in the hero, it only fires after you've scrolled past the hero, oh shit, we're cooked, mine definitely doesn't have that, I like that, oh my, it's even added a headline here, yeah it's in a weird colour, I mean I don't know why it's chosen that purple, but it does call out what this image is, so I did this infographic because, because, but it calls out why that exists, then it adds the real results from real customers, I'm an idiot, I haven't included these, but these are stellar, and again this, yeah the CSS and HTML, it needs a bit of tweaking to the design, most of my work needs a bit of tweaking to the design to be honest, but look, conversion rate before, 11% after, 27%, these are stellar results, client retention, I didn't even know this one, 60% up to 85% after, I didn't even know that was in one of the reviews, then it's got a, well actually these are results, and then you've got the actual proof below, a testimonial from someone calling out that specific metric, pretty good, I don't have that, nope, I don't have that, did it do anything else? I think, oh yeah, common questions, I don't have those, nope, common questions, how is this different from other Google ads courses, what, yeah I mean that is a question people ask, is it worth the investment, obviously, but you can't, I can't just say obviously, so yeah, I mean let's, let's see what it's put, is this worth, I mean really it should say is God tier ads worth the investment, but again you can tweak this, our customers report significant ROI through improved conversion rates up to 145% increase, time savings and more consistent results across campaigns, the framework pays for itself typically within the first month of implementation and breathe, that's good, it's a little bit stale, it's not got my sort of cadence to it, but that's not an issue, I could go into this very quickly and just tweak the way it's worded, but this is this is good copywriting, it's literally calling out a specific result, a couple of pain points, like consistent, save time, the obvious ones, and then it pays for itself quick in the first month, like pays for itself quickly, but this worked for my specific business, a great question, loads of people ask this, yeah, how often the framework updated, the framework is updated monthly, yeah, kind of, sometimes it's updated multiple times a month, sometimes it's a real month, but yeah, I mean there's been hundreds of updates, has it changed anything else, it's changed all the call to action, sorry if this is boring, but this is impressive, notice that my call to actions are non-existent, it's added more buttons, look in hell, it's added buttons at opportune moments, it's really, has it, I think it has, yikes, okay, ah, money back guarantee, all these changes here too, okay, so I don't highlight that very clearly at all, in fact it's not obvious is it, that there's a money back guarantee, in fact you have to scroll quite a way down to get to it, and even I don't know where it is, so by the way this page converts, so this is good because this is going to improve upon that, but yeah, lovely, obvious, why didn't I do that, I'm a guru, what do I know, and then instead of going back up, yikes, I've got another one to show you after this, do stick around, come on, where are we, yeah, so instead of just, and it did, I remember reading this in the output, instead of this checklist, it's added some additional callouts before the checklist, essentially the priorities from the reviews, so the checklist, the step by step framework, the SOPs, the community support, and the lifetime update, so these are the four things that it identified in its analysis, and it's called those out ahead of the longer list of bits, because the longer list of bits is harder to read and interpret than these, sort of subhead, I don't know what they are, H2s, H3s, again the colours are a bit wonky, but these are all really solid ideas, and the copywriting is pretty solid, pretty solid, I think we've seen enough, that's good, I'm going to implement some of these changes with some finessing, wow, okay, and then, just for shits and giggles, so I'm into financial stuff, I don't want to say too much, but anyway, I asked it an innocent question about analysing Bitcoin price patterns against markets, commodities and other indexes, including bonds, although a bond, not an index, but don't worry about it, look for correlations in behaviour, and come up with the very high probability times that buying would be profitable in the near and long term, again quite vague, and also went to sell to ensure you lock in positive price movements and profit, okay, what did it come up with, I could show you loads of stuff, it's literally showing examples of its analysis, I mean, real good, and then it came up with this, where's the link, it came up with this, it's a microsite, look at this, for you training opportunities, probably need a longer date range, current signal, buy, why, let's have a look if it's actually any good, so the current technical indicators, and if this doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry, it's just fucking impressive what it's turned out after I gave it that one prompt, I think I might have tweaked the prompt midway or something, but I mean, it's literally me being more on typing stuff that's not even 100% accurate, and it came out with this, so it's telling you, so these are indicators, RSI and MACD, they're technical indicators, you can't use them to trade on their own, or you shouldn't do, well you can on a longer time frame, but most people don't think 5, 10 years ahead, anyway buy signal, so current technical indicators suggest a buying opportunity with the following conditions, prices up in an uptrend, yep, so above 50 day and 200 day moving averages, it's an uptrend, MACD shows positive momentum, I wish you could click on those, can I click on those, they're probably somewhere else, and the RSI's neutral territory not over bought, yeah I mean, okay, it's not bad, it's essentially finding correlation between the indicators, I mean it's not awful, and then again it's got this weird thing where it likes to put really light fonts on a light background, but it's okay, yeah cool, and then we've got the analysis identified, 31 buy signals, by the way this is not financial advice, so don't go out and buy bitcoin, it collapse on you and then you blame me, gone cross, RSI oversold, RSI's okay, Bollinger Bands, Bollinger Bands bounce, and then MACD, so yeah, and look at this, buy signal performance, holding period, average return, medium return, positive return, probability, really, really, I love it as well, you go to the bottom and somewhere, wait let me just go back to the home page, yeah it gives you a disclaimer, which I find hilarious, so wait a minute, so there are, I need to look at this more to see if it's actually legit, but it's found 31 buy signals, but it's also found 32 sell signals, so that suggests that it's neutral, but anyway, so if you were to hold for 90 days or more, you could get a return of 18.5% and that's 82% probability, it's not awful, but then because bitcoin's so volatile, it's kind of the opposite at 90 days, right, oh it's showing it on the chart, I'm being an idiot, so we need to be able to click this chart, which we can't do, well there's a buy signal right at the top there, that's not a great buy signal, but at least it's showing you where the buy signal's triggered, so you can understand what it's saying and also the sells, so another step of this I'd say to compare those, the buy and sells and see what the gains are over a year, because it looks like it's making multiple trades, it's still bloody impressive, you've got correlation analysis, I've not even looked at all these, I mean, holy moly, technical indicators, I think that was, no we weren't on that, oh my word, look at all this, even just to help you position a long-term portfolio, it's like if you've got money to invest and you're sat there going, is it a good time, then you're not worried about the movements, you could, yeah what, trading opportunities, profit taking strategies, this is so good, assuming that it's, you know, you validate everything, market assessment, did I just break it, what happened, okay that page doesn't work, you can ask it to fix it and that's the other amazing thing, you literally say this bit's broken, can you fix it please, and it's like oh yeah, I found out what I broke or did wrong and I'll fix it, it's just like okay, I mean if you're a developer looking at this, I don't know what colour your pants are right now, but you also might be thinking holy moly, this is going to amplify my work, I can literally get my idea or the idea to MVP in a day, which is pretty bloody impressive, probably the AI is, you've got to, like the first tool I showed you, my sort of search term report analyser, you've got to know the answer in order to create the application really, because I needed to know what I wanted the outcome to be in order to create the, does that make sense, so I think without sounding arrogant, the experienced people, the smarter people with the experience are going to accelerate ahead because they know the question says he who gives it a noddy prompt, but I know what I wanted it to do, tell me what you think, was that told interesting, was it useful, does it inspire you to try AI, is this scared the living sh** out of you, I think this pros and cons here, I mean it could be really impressive until it's able to do this itself, I mean what's, when we get to AGI where it can rationalise this and go well I need to do this in order to make this better, well yeah your landing page sucks so I've already built it and uploaded it for you, and now I want 10% cut, otherwise I'm going to shut your computer down, yeah might be problematic, but otherwise, quite impressive really isn't it, so yeah I've been Ed and you've been listening to me, watching me play with Manus, not Marius, I call it Marius at the start, Manus AI, all of this power for $39, sh** the bed, like and subscribe, thanks
