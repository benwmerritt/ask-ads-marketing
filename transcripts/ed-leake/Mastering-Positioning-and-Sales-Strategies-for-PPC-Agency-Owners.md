I like Google Ads, so we do a lot of Google Ads. Does that mean that you have to stick with that service? You can layer services, but they've got to have synergy. You're watching Agency Forge on YouTube, the mastermind community for PPC agency owners looking to scale without the stress. Specialism, positioning, offer, front and back end. This literally moulds your agency from the perspective of your prospective clients, perspective, prospective. There you go. So specialism in my opinion is the way to go. This could mean you are a Google Ads specialist, you're a LinkedIn ad specialist. You pick a niche, you pick a vertical, you pick an industry, you start narrow, you go wider. How do you pick a niche? Oh, everyone says pick a niche. How do you pick a niche that works? Well, one that's big enough, one that you're interested in, one you have experience of, one preferably you've got case studies or a single good solid case study that you can show off and one that you know you can serve. Say you pick a niche and pick a specialism that you want to lean into. I like Google Ads, so we do a lot of Google Ads. Does that mean that you have to stick with that service? Oh, I don't want to just do Google Ads. No, it doesn't. You can layer services, but they've got to have synergy. Think about YouTube ads and Facebook ads, there's synergy there because you can reuse the content, the video content. And then there are approaches to niches. You can niche cycle, you can niche in a niche, you can layer niches. There's loads of different things you can do to, again, go down that specialist super targeted rabbit hole. I don't know if it's a rabbit hole. This is unscripted, but you'll stand out because you're talking very specifically to a specific audience and prospect that no one else really is. But then you've got to present them an offer, an offer that they want. So your value proposition, your positioning. Do you look and sound like every other agency on the market? Nine times out of 10, you will do. Hey, we do PPC. Who gives a toss? What do you actually do and who do you do it for? And what's the outcome? That's your positioning. Your offer is more about how you get them there. Foot in the door offer, for example. So you take your service, slice it up productise it or turn it into a foot in the door. This is a very top level, simple thing. And that component is your offer. So what's the outcome? What's the value? The important thing about this kind of offer is that you give way more value than you take. It gets you in the door, it gets you talking to people. But there's literally hundreds of approaches and channels. So then you could split into front and back end offer, essentially your marketing and your sales offer. So we've got our specialism down. We've positioned ourselves. So we're talking to the right people, the people that we can give a offer that's of interest to them and gets them the result that they need. And then we head over to acquisition because we've got now got to present this to people find them. So you pick a channel. And here's the mistake that everyone makes. I made it to, you don't pick a channel, you pick every channel. So you're going to do social media, you're going to do Twitter, you're going to do Facebook, you're going to do link, are you really? Are you going to do TikTok? Are you going to do Reddit posts? Are you going to do YouTube? You know, pick a channel, laser focus that channel. What you need to do is saturate a channel till you cannot get any more blood out of it. If you're still getting leads from a channel and it's working, lean into it, go all in and keep leaning in till you literally hit a brick wall. Most channels are big enough to sustain an agency for a long time. And that goes for niches. Some niches are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And people turn up and say, I don't want to be too narrow. Yeah, you do. So you have a way to capture that person's interest. It could be an opt-in. It could be as simple as a lead gen form on a Facebook ad. It could be as simple as someone replying to a LinkedIn message, a form of opt-in. It doesn't have to be an email capture. Then you nurture them. And that could mean many different things. Or you go for the kill. It depends what you're presenting them. Is this a front end or a back end offer? If it's a back end offer, you can often go straight for the kill and say, you've been interested in this piece of value, we're going to deliver it for you. Whereas if it's a more of a marketing, so a front end offer, you perhaps have to nurture these people through email, give them some case studies, some examples, show them the outcome. Pretty straightforward stuff. Most people don't do it. But follow up on it and keep following up until you're blue in the foot. No, don't don't do that. Don't do that. How many times have you responded to someone that sent you 15 follow up emails every day? Who teaches that? Follow up in a systematic human way. So think about what they've just downloaded. What can support that in terms of say a case study? And then what can support that case study that you've just sent the day before in terms of a breakdown, like an exploding diagram of specifics, like, there's the result, here's how you do it. And then what can you lean into after that? You don't have the time to do it, we'll do it for you. Let's have a call. Let's do a sale. Let's do a sale. What's what's that? I don't know. Just yeah, you know what I mean. This is the framework, the perfect process to follow, to be a bit more like me. But I'm only worth seven figures. And most gurus will tell you that's chump change. But back on planet Earth, aka reality, I think most of us would be quite happy with that. Hey, this is Ed. Thanks for watching.
