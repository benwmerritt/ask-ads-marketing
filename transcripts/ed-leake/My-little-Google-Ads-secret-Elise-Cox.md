## Transcript
I've purchased a number of courses but none have been as valuable as God Tier Ads. The program is extremely clear. It's all really well presented with some amazing support materials like PDFs. I was actually a little bit hesitant to do the review because to be honest, it's kind of my little secret. I've actually won projects based on the resources that are inside God Tier Ads. So it's something a little bit close to my heart and I can't thank Ed enough for sharing his expertise with the world. It's quite clear that Ed is a man that knows what he's doing and he really knows his way around Google Ads. I also know what it's like to get started with Google Ads and so this course I believe could be someone's most important purchase of their career. If you're looking to start an agency or perhaps just looking to lift up your game on Google Ads, this is the course for you. So I found it a little bit hard to keep it to myself when to be honest, I know the huge difference that this is going to make for people. So it is just that good. If you really want to lift your game, get this course. It is insanely well priced for the ridiculous value and consulting that Ed provides in this course. The resources, I just can't speak highly enough of them. They are so well put together, the quality is insane. I wouldn't have the magic touch on Google that I have now if it wasn't for Ed and God to your ads. I've never known a course creator quite as dedicated as Ed as well. The activity in the Facebook group and also just the updates from Ed are worth their weight in gold. There's just no other way to say it. It is just so valuable. The amount and volume of content that Ed keeps adding to the course on a monthly basis is exceptional and I believe there's still a lot more to come. So I can't recommend this course highly enough. I've spent so much money on courses, thousands of dollars and by far I have to say that the course that I have received the most value from has been God to your ads. It is just phenomenal. I really can't speak highly enough of Ed and this course. It will lift your game. So if you're serious about Google, this is a course for you and no matter how new or experienced you are, the way that Ed explains everything will make sense. It is so clear you just can't go wrong. So make sure you sign up, join the team at God to your ads, join the Facebook group, get on board. This course is absolutely what you need. So thank you again to Ed for putting out this course and yeah, can't recommend it highly enough.
