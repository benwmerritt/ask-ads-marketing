and Ed has this discovery call script and I followed that and literally by the end of the call, the guy that I was talking to, he basically just said, you seem super authentic, you know, you're asking all these amazing questions that no one's really ever asked me for and let's just go send me through an agreement. That was like my first agency client research within like two weeks of starting. I'm Michael Svidane and I'm doing this review and testimonial for Ed Leeks Agency Forge. I actually own two agencies at the moment. The first one's Tight Marketer, which specializes in YouTube advertising for coaches, consultants, of course, greatest that sort of thing. And the other one is other one called AdForge, which specializes in Google Search. Basically, when I started AdForge, I knew a little bit about Google Search. I doubled in the past, but I wasn't an expert in it. And then Google being the all-knowing, all-seeing entity that it is, one day it just showed me one of Ed's videos in my recommended feed on YouTube. And the second I watched it, I was like, this guy is, he's my answer. So I watched a lot of his content and I just was like, yeah, this is it. Where do I sign? I signed up, I don't know, a couple of weeks ago, some around there. Within those two weeks, I consumed a lot of the content that was very relevant to me. I applied specifically like the sales call training he talks about, discovery call training. And I had, I was offering this one month for free, to let people know how much I can help them, I'd love to hear from them, build up the trust. And Ed has this, he has this discovery call script that he goes through with you. And I followed that. And literally, by the end of the call, the guy that I was talking to, he basically just said, look, I love the way you roll. You seem super authentic. You're asking all these amazing questions that no one's really ever asked me before. And let's just go. Like don't worry about the frame month, let's just go send me through an agreement. So this was, that was like my first agency client to search within like two weeks of starting. It just blew me away. Like the amount of amount of value and information that you get inside the agency forge is just absolutely phenomenal. Like it was kind of almost overwhelming how much there is. And it's regularly updated. The community is fantastic. There's a lot of good people and a lot of great people in there who are willing to help and give you ideas and advice and whatnot. Ed's very responsive with any messages or questions that are posted in the community or sent to him. And I have searched high and low to find a community. And that's what it is. The community is not really a course. It's a community to find a community like this one. Now I've spent five years on the past five years creating my own YouTube advertising course and whatnot. And so I know a bit about creating courses. And I can tell you right now, you're not going to find a better place to invest your money in education when it comes to Google search advertising for shopping, e-commerce, for Legion, whatever it may be. What this is going to do for my life and for my family is it's going to secure my future as an entrepreneur and a business owner. And I will not have to rely or face having to go work for someone else again. This will allow me to produce more for my family, allow me to do more with my kids because of this trend, because of this education. So the price tag that Ed's put on the agency force, it's a nothing but it really. And I really look forward to growing and scaling my new venture with Google search with Ed, with the agency force community. And if you are thinking, if you're just considering or on the fence and you're teetering, yes or no, just bloody do it. Just do it. I'm telling you, you will not regret it. Just invest the money. That's the investment. Invest the money. Apply what is being taught. And as long as you are doing that, as long as you are taking steps, actions every single day, applying what you're learning, I can guarantee you that you will make back what you invested with Ed within the first two months. Easy. So join Ed's agency forge. And I look forward to seeing you there.
