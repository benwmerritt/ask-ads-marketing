Sometimes client management, same old thing, it's human nature, it gets boring. Looking on paper over the past eight years, client management is incredibly profitable. The numbers are unreal. You're watching Agency Forge on YouTube, the mastermind community for PPC agency owners looking to scale without the stress. You and the wife are you sort of the tech, technical, strategic side? So you're doing the Google ads side. Is she the front of house at sales and lead management? Or do you both share the jobs? So she split operations? No, she she does a lot of the financing and projections, more of the business stuff. Because she she has a bachelor's degree in finance, so she's better at projecting and looking at the business, more of the business things. I'm more sales and I'm on the YouTube videos and, you know, all that. She's she's more on all the operations and things like that. Still runs accounts because, you know, you don't want to lose that skill. But and then I'd say, I don't know the exact number, 30, 40 percent. I'm still running accounts and then business operations, sales, things like that. So I wanted to shift more just looking at the numbers. It doesn't seem like it immediately because my course is 500. You get five hundred dollars. You do absolutely nothing. It's an email. So it's like, well, this this is just free money. It's it's a passive income. And it's it's really not. There's so many things to run. And I look at that. It's the numbers. It's like the agency just crushes the course and in profit. Doing it properly. Yeah. And it's and you're not you've set your agency up as a lifestyle business because you don't want the headache of 50 staff. You like to keep it tight. And I don't blame you. So yeah, you because of that, you have a bit more on your plate because you haven't got middle managers and people undoing this that the other. Yeah. Doing the course. It's quite a lot of work on top of that. So I think the long and short of it is if an agency owner is sat watching this or even a freelance who's thinking about starting an agency and also thinks I should do a training course, you're sort of saying no. Oh, it's it. No, I learned so much looking at other people, not myself. And I had a client years ago, real estate investors, you know, they flip houses. You know, this is huge in the US, other parts of the world as well. And they were they were making a fortune. I mean, they were spending 50,000 a month with me on ads. And and they were in Houston only and they wanted to expand into Dallas, another major city or the other major cities of Texas. It's easy money three or four hours away. You've got a proven model expand. And then instead, they thought, no, we're going to make training on how to flip houses, how to get into real estate. And that was the beginning of the end. I ran both of them and they were both about 50 grand a month and they had the weekend seminars. They were full. They had the mastermind, the whole thing. But splitting their attention, the business partners split up, went their separate ways and everything kind of crumbled. Both businesses are out now. And I've seen that and read that so many times when when business owners want to to split their attention and divide up, I'll bring it back to PPC. You say, oh, I could do some software. I do some I've got some scripts. I could sell some scripts, you know, I could do I could do a course. I could do one on one consulting. I could do weekend seminars in town, 200 bucks a pop. I fill the room and you start thinking of all these, this makes money. That makes money. That makes money. And I've done it myself. Sometimes client management, same old thing. It's it's human nature. It gets boring. And it's like that person selling a course I could sell a course. I'm way smarter than or maybe I'll work the conference circuit and then I'll say, hey, you can hire me $500 an hour. I'll train your agency. It's like, wow, that's big money. But looking on paper over the past eight years, client management is incredibly profitable. The numbers are unreal. And the course, it made money, but profit the percent side by side. And when you look at it like that, black and white, even though it was more exciting, it was something new. I got to be on YouTube and post stuff, all that fun emotional stuff on paper, black and white. Awful idea. All awful. I'm not motivated by work. I'm one of those guys. I don't I don't want a legacy. I don't want a big name. And it's fine if you do with if work gets you up in the morning. Me, I could never work ever again. I wouldn't even notice. So I looked at it and I evaluated it. It's like, well, what what's your plan? And you have this at the beginning of Forge. And I recently reread the EMIS incredible book from the 90s. But all the business stuff still applies. It's like, what's your primary goal? What what's your plan? What's your life plan? It's like, well, I want to work less and less and less and less. It's like, which one fits that better? It's like, for a course, I have to be up to date on the best of the best Google stuff and updated or hire someone to do that. Whereas the agency, I could just build a business and hire people and hire people and hire people. And then eventually there's a CEO, there's a sales team, there's 20 people running PPC and I could just sit there and collect money or I could sell it. There's an exit. Whereas the course doesn't really have an exit. And yeah, it's fun and I'm in there and I'm getting all this recognition and YouTube interviewing big names and people are asking me to be on podcast. And just that inflates your ego. But if I were to get an outside audit, which I have from other entrepreneur friends, they're just like, what is this course? I'm like, well, you know, it's fun. And I got this YouTube and I was on this podcast. This guy's the biggest in the industry. It's like, right, how much money did that make? It's like, well, no, I mean, eventually people will see it. And then, you know, I was on the podcast and just from a strict accounting standpoint from other people that are much, much more successful than me, the bottom-solve businesses. Like, what are you doing? I don't, you just grow the agency. It's like, well, the course is fun. You know, it's something different. Uh, your agency was much further along with operations before you, well, probably before you did, uh, your ads and all these other things. And it's like, you could not go into your agency for a couple of weeks and it wouldn't fall apart. I'm, I'm still very active in my agency. I have my own accounts that are 100% me. I, maybe if I had 10 people and some senior people and some operations, I could dabble with another project. But I mean, any entrepreneur, even a crap YouTube video will tell you, don't divide your attention between 10 things, all 10 of them will fail. You can do them later. Um, if you want to, if you've gotten established business, you're like, Oh, I'm going to go buy some houses. I'm going to go get into stocks. I'm going to get into crypto. Yeah. It's like, what is your current business look like? It's like, well, 40 hours a week, but I'll do nights and weekends and I'll trade crypto. It's like, that's an awful idea. Um, which I did that too. It's like, if you can walk away from your business and it runs yourself, that diversifying is appropriate. If you're 30 or 40 hours a week and you want to diversify, you're not ready. Yeah, bang on. Is there, there's no way you could do it if you don't have a spare 20. So if you're, if you're working part time on your current agency or your freelance work or whatever, yeah, fair enough. But even then it's like, actually, uh, better than the devil, you know, for most people, it's like go all in on that. And if you're not doing 40 hours, why, if it's a lifestyle thing, brilliant. Keep that. Keep that. If you want to do that, some people, they love business. They can't get enough. You work 80 hours. It's a shiny object. Yeah. It's shiny objects. And everyone's like, Oh, of course, that'll make you a millionaire. God, you're out to sold a lot. I'm not, you know, um, but my God, it's taken a lot. It's pretty much been that some, some points a full time job. And there's no way I would have been able to run client accounts, everything else with it. Hey, this is Ed. Thanks for watching.
