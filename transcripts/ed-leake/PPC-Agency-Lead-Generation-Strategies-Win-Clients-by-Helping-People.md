That happens in the God-Trived Facebook group. I get emails quite regularly from people saying, do you trust so-and-so? Because they've answered some questions in your Facebook group and they've offered to work with me. Who said, I need some freelancer Google Ads aid? I think he literally said it for my supplement company. Yeah. I was like, oh, this is Pomerick. I messaged him. So this is called, I guess, Slack message. And I was like, hey, man, I actually did some ads for supplement brands. I sent them a screenshot from a recommendation. We got on a call and I called the deal to sign the contract. It was one call and I was very surprised because previous agency was just doing ads on his brand searches and nothing else. So it's not cool for me. They're easy to call us, you know? Oh, good. Because Sam tried this technique. In fact, I think Sam got a few of his first customers using the Facebook group technique, where you go in, offer free advice, don't pitch people. So if you're now in that group of e-commerce people that sound like they've got some decent numbers, if you chip in once or twice a week, here's your manual job. Go in there once or twice a week. And if someone's asking a Google Ads question, you can give them the free response and keep doing that. Yes, but I also thought I can actually build an automation that scrapes the keywords from this channel. I would just do the work. Just connect with people. Leaving automation to the LinkedIn thing. The group, we've just got actual real humans in it. Don't do the dead internet thing. Hello, sir. I'm sorry. Please, guys, please. Cheer me up. Cheer me up, please. There's literally an automation that basically looks every day for keywords that people posting. Like, I need Google Ads freelance. I need Google Ads agency. And then when it sees the trigger, it sends you a message that just notification. Just says, hey, there is a guy. For you. Right, got you. That's more like it. That's a better use of automation, getting a trigger to drag you into the group to talk to people. Good. Well, you've got one from it. So that might be more effective than the cold messaging. At the time in the group, and I've got a lot of friends who have big companies just from group arbitrage. If you're in this community with people who are your ideal clients, you'll get 80% of your results from that. Just offer value there. Just offer value, and people will be attracted to you. You don't even need an average. They'll hit you up. The law of reciprocity, which is when you do people give back, the issue is that people give to everyone, and not everyone can give back. So it's about being strategically generous. You're in an environment right now. They feel strategically generous. You'll just get heaps of clients. So just don't over-milk it. Just sit there and be cool, and just give people advice. Because if you overdo it, the admins will see you, and you'll stand out, and they'll be like, hold on a minute. Infiltrators. Oh, good. That happens in the God-Thou-R-I Facebook group. I get emails quite regularly from people saying, do you trust so-and-so? Because they've answered some questions in your Facebook group, and they've offered to work with me. I'm like, I've got no idea who they are, but it's happening constantly. People are like, oh, this person's helpful. It's a winner.
