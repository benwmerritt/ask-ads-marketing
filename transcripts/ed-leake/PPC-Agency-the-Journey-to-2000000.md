You know, I always love connecting with other people who have who have reached my level or higher Because I've noticed that you know, there's a lot of bullshit in the industry a lot of Entrepreneurs and nothing against you but like lots of people selling courses who have never Achieved anything but they they're kind of like You know regurgitating the same stuff that they have maybe gotten from another course So just like shared experiences is what I really value You know, that's why it's hearing from you what you have experienced and maybe just one sentence one thing that maybe Like I don't know like was stopping me mentally or or maybe just like I haven't you know Looked at anything from a particular angle Maybe that you have looked at because your background is different my background is different and to your point In a different way compared to me, but I'm sure everyone has a different path So just like hearing, you know a tidbit maybe you know something that's relevant to me Maybe like to you it was easy. Maybe for me, it's the opposite, you know, it's always the case Yeah, and we all have different paths my I am my path is very unconventional, but it It has taken 14 years as I wasted about seven years. I well, I hate to say I wasted seven years I am I didn't have a coach. I didn't have a mentor no experience. So those seven years were very It's experiential even a word I don't know but I learned a lot and I learned pretty much everything I shouldn't be doing If only I had a time machine, but yeah, maybe I should have got a coach when I first started it was Rocky but Tom how the hell do you say your surname is it buke vicious? I'd say like an American version as it's buke vicious. Yes. That's probably the best way to pronounce it Buke vicious. Yeah, so I'm a principal and co-founder at scoob Essentially, we we help e-commerce companies drive more gross profit through paydads and analytics That's essentially the the essence in terms of you know, what I do currently I'm more responsible for sales and marketing for the team and and You know, I still help out with the take, you know with with some kind of like more complex problems so that the team members you know Encounter like maybe bigger account more complex account. Maybe like there's some sort of kind of technical element that the team needs help will They typically ask for for my help in that area and just kind of like overall like more like strategic, you know, the Strategic direction in terms of let's say how we you know, first like how we move forward, you know, how do we kind of like take it? you know to the next level so your founder and Sort of lead or strategic steer is that it's what I call my help Yeah, we we can call it that way. Yeah, because I found it but then Actually, my wife joined the company later Um, so she's you know, she's a partner in the business. She she runs operations pretty much like all service delivery team members They report to her But but yeah, pretty much like i'm you know, i'm the one who started but then she helped me to Take a much like to help me grow scuba and expand because I've noticed that You have to have kind of like a yin yang between different team members. So you have to have someone who is good at um kind of coming up with the direction coming up with products or services that you know that uh, you know One should sell having come to get you know frameworks or processes in terms of you know How they should be delivered based on you know what your your observations in the market then sell them and then Uh, you know, the other team member has to be responsible for you know operations essentially, you know making you know Miring making sure that you know team members stay with you for a long time Making sure that you know Decline retention is high. You know we essentially making sure that pretty much we deliver what we promise So i'm that first part of the of the team initially. I was both Yeah, well, that's yeah, that is the solo founders Sort of diction isn't it it's everything you're lead gen you're marketing your sales. You're onboarding your Technicals you're reporting your strategy. Uh, yes, i think That there's not necessarily a revenue number, but I mean i mean looked at my own flowchart But I have a flowchart for agency priorities where I believe that you do you should be prioritizing in stage two of my flowchart Uh to split operations out from Essentially front end stuff and I do believe that agency owners should be At that stage like the 25k a month kind of agency. So still small Should have a dedicated operations now you might have a co-founder that does that and in your case it's sort of a co-founder, but it's the wife which brings its potential issues, I guess having to be in the wife, but um But yeah splitting out First second was tough until we actually had to divvy up the responsibilities because we were both very driven So we're kind of like stepping on each other's toes Yeah But it is the perfect split it's essentially front of house and then operations. It's like it's the it's the sales versus the work Uh and trying to mix that is a nightmare, especially for the agency owner And I think the agency owner can get the most out of doing the sales not the operations But we cling on to the operations because I think a lot of us are Start off technical especially in the sco or pppc space. We start off as technical or the doers So how long you started because you're what you turn over roughly at the minute It's close to 1.2 mil a year And you and how long you've been around? Oh nine since oh nine so close to what 15 years this may 15 so a hundred grand a year of perfect growth Well, not perfect. I would say it was like, you know, as you mentioned, you know The beginning was a choppy because I was uh when I started I was actually doing this on weekends Like for four years. So it's kind of like a almost like a hobby Yes, you know a little side gig Then in 13 I started actually at full time Okay, so officially 2013 will say the agency started so you went from freelance to agency Yes, yeah, we yeah, we could call it that way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So so, you know, I'd say since uh, you know 13 full time then in 14 My wife joined because then I was like, I think we were doing like 200k a year or something like that Um, and and pretty much like I could not handle everything because I mean, yeah, it was a ton of stuff Yeah to handle and and uh, but at the same time, you know, I did have some freelancers that did not some did work out some did not Um, and and maybe it's a big lesson I would say if you can, you know, either get a co-founder or or hire someone full time to to help you uh The big problem with freelancers is that sure, you know, they're temporary, but at the same time There are points, especially, you know, when you're a young agency The temporary factor is not a good thing because actually I've had a few freelancers, you know Raise rates like a few times on me and I'm like shit. I can't afford this Yeah, it's it's it's it's important. Uh But yeah, then in 2014 she joined me And then there was a pretty much like two, you know person team then next year We had, you know, two more full-time employees and physical office And then we just kind of like, you know, so this was like a kind of like a big jump and then I would say for maybe I'd say for like a let's see. Actually, I did a timeline here. So it's easier to actually remember what you know what but I would say Yeah, it's okay. My memory is foggy all the time. Yeah But I'd say like four years we were doing like less than 300k a year something like that but then there were a few jumps, um, which is uh, actually I started uh focusing more on marketing because I realized actually up to maybe when was it, uh Maybe up to 2015 or so I fully relied on referrals And and uh, my network wasn't massive Um, so and at the same time it's like, well, you know, how do you know people? I mean, you're you're not gonna ask your neighbor if you need like ppc services So unless you want a bad client Yep, yep, exactly So so yeah, so I think that you know that when I started to actually mark like, you know, implementing some marketing Our company then things started changing You know started getting more leads than I realized actually I'm not that good in sales So I needed to you know train up on some, you know, some some sales processes and you know some some sales activities Also, I'd say maybe like prior to like when I was starting We were offering too many services to pretty much like almost like everyone So that's kind of like a you know, I'm sure you have talked to and you know Quite a few others I've talked to but I think that you don't realize until you actually do it yourself and then you actually kind of You know burn from get burned from your mistakes um, but uh in 2015 we actually had a you know, we actually redid our brand and we did our Not so glad we established a more specific specialization so so we essentially Got rid of SEO like social media stuff like websites And and just focused purely on ppcs because we actually this sounds very much like my journey Yeah, I went full service hit 300k Okay, did you plateau a bit at 300k prior or after a specialization? So after so did you all specialization so oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, so you went down to being ppc Yes, so two things happened actually and it was it was actually bad So what happened was uh, we had we hired this uh Branding agency, you know out of brooklyn new york and they were actually cool They actually helped us to kind of come up with that because they were you know doing like you know Brand positioning and all of that, you know, they came up with like a new logo helped us actually to come up with a new name and stuff Uh, and and uh, you know, they did this exercise and and throughout the exercise We like we did it come like an 80 20 analysis and we have realized that Pretty much like most of the revenue was coming from ppc That was like one thing We were getting most results from ppc And actually we enjoyed it most After this it kind of like felt like, you know, we're doing favor, you know to some clients By helping with other areas because we're We're just like maybe we're not as good As we could have been or maybe like we had like the wrong clients for you know back, you know back in the day But but yeah, that that helped us to actually, you know focus the other thing that we have done is that we have realized It's like we we actually had to uh say no to uh to to lead gen clients So we said, you know what we're gonna do this for e-commerce because we've noticed that uh, you know back then We were not able to help Problem solve the lead quality issues So we would get a bunch of leads, you know, things would look good from our end But then clients would say well, it's not a quality lead blah blah blah blah blah and and and uh, you know back then Since there was not a lot of specialization in the team um, you know We didn't have like the the mental capacity or you know or expertise just to kind of problem solve for that so we actually dropped as like the the lead gen site and uh what happened was that uh After we announced it and we after we fired a few clients We lost a couple big clients And uh, did you think you made the wrong did you think I made the wrong move? Yeah, because we were we almost reached like 300k that year We announced it. We lost a couple clients and actually two team members left. So then there was like two of us left And uh, our revenue dropped like next year by like almost like 100k and was just like shit No, but we shot ourselves in the foot Uh everything became easier Yes, and and uh, but then it was like there were a few things that started happening. So I still continued on the you know the referral route For so so we you know we you know I partnered with some agencies that are full service because you know previously you could not you know talk to anyone You know who's full service. Hey, I'm full service too. How about you send me some clients, right? Yeah, but uh with our specialty then Uh, we were able to start partnering with uh some agencies that they were full time For us, you know full service. They offered everything They had a wider client base and and and uh, you know, we were kind of like a specialist Arm for those agencies to help them with more complex ppc accounts So that started helping Um with with uh, you know with the you know the overall kind of like a lead flow and and and you know the overall business but Did you find I don't know if you still take on referrals? No Oh a referral or white label Two different things Um, yeah, they are I might so my concern my issue with referrals full stop They're great as a sticky plaster to get some money in early But you can't control them and I don't mean the rate that they come in but the quality of the leads And what I found is it's really very hard to say no to Agency referring you to work because you feel like you're letting them down because they've got let's say it's an SEO agency Right, they're working with a specific client that you've got no experience of or you don't want to work with that type of client In your case, it would be lead gen. So you've got these agencies coming to you and saying oh, well, we've got this and you're like we We don't want to It's very difficult to say no to him to those Referrals because then that agency is going to go well, we don't want to work with you in the future then because you're going to cherry pick That's my big concern with referrals And I just got into a few Issues over the years trying to deal with referrals because I was trying to get them into specific Neashes that I wanted to work with because we had the experience in the case studies for them Yeah, so uh similar experience So one was that we're strategic in terms of which agencies we align with so not just like some, you know random agents initially was just you know anyone local Anyone with potential clients um Because at the same time we did not have a clear picture in terms of let's say who our ideal client, you know is and you know all of these things right but We've gotten more selective But I agree with you it was hard and and also and maybe I'd like to kind of differentiate like overall referrals versus white label so white label is essentially We do work under their umbrella So we have tried that for years and it was somewhat successful But then later we we like after you know deeper analysis and after we have you know in you know, significantly improved our own client base um, we we uh reduced that more and more and now I think maybe like actually now we don't take White label that I would say like it started in maybe 2010 or so Uh when uh budget got budgets got caught guess who got caught first like from those agencies. We did. Yeah Yeah, so so that was that was bad and the other thing is that it was harder to raise rates and and ask for essentially What you're worth um Because the agency the other side has to pass it on so it's it's a double step to get that rate to go up. Yeah Yeah, exactly. And the other thing is that we have noticed that uh When you have this type of relationship like white label relationship is that you Don't control the client flow You know to your point. So we've gotten some bad clients Needy clients that we had to serve just because we had a You know pre you know pre-grifting relationship and we had a commitment to support that agency So it was tough because like you had to take pretty much like everything under that agency because otherwise you were kind of like risking damaging the relationship so I would say that and maybe like the final thing is that you know, maybe Poor expectation management some agencies were good. Some agencies were pretty bad on this and then You know, it would get like too many questions or or maybe questions that you know Maybe that we should have been discussed or maybe even like goals that should have been maybe realigned and and and so on To make sure that what's what's communicated to the end client is correct and at the same time, you know, the kind of there's no scope creep from The man account management side. Yeah, I think if you do white label all referrals you've you've as the The ppc side of things I think you've got to control so much of it right Right up and to the point of sale and I'd even argue before the sale Because I've got a pre onboarding checklist not an onboarding a pre onboarding and it's essentially a risk assessment of the client And you run through all these checks to make sure if there's any red flags Before you take money So I think if you've you've got something like that down and then you've got a very strict process how you work Communicate who does what and really structure it then white labelling works, but you still have to be specialist I think a white labeler that Well, I know that white labellers who are ppc agencies really struggle because they have everything thrown at them Whereas someone like uh, justin rondeau did a video of me invisible ppc and they're lead gen Okay, and mainly local service businesses some national stuff, but you know your roofers you plumbers that sort of stuff And ultimately they're all very similar from a google ads perspective the lead gen flow landing pages the crms the tracking So they can have a very structured approach, but if you started throwing Insurance companies into the mix and ecom it would just it would be a hell It would be hell to run that white label agency So how are we going to take you to get to one mill then in rev? So we reached one mill in 2021. I love the way you're checking your notepad Well, actually by the way, thanks to you because like you asked me some questions So I actually came up with like eight pages of like reflections And actually I did the timeline hall. Let me show you so pretty much like this is like Oh brilliant from the start which is like, you know revenue new clients and uh new team members by year and then you know some Few milestones so and then it's it's it's easier to have a conversation because I didn't want to ramble I should probably do that because I tend to ramble so sorry you so you went from 300k what year? Uh, it was like 286 in 2015 and then we actually went down to like 200 then 217 and you know 16 and 17 after we specialized Yeah Yeah, but then we started marketing and then it was like You know 315 507 725 and then 1 million and 1 dollar Through re you know half four years later. Yes Yeah, which is a transformation that's Like ignoring all the nonsense you see on social media to to double for three years straight a double No, sorry 50 not double it's 50 50 50 50 50. Yeah, either way. It's very impressive. It's very good I haven't asked you about profit, but um, I I'm assuming your profit levels were sort of steady or Did you cut into them? I'd say Things became better maybe like I'd say maybe 500k mark was uh when when things started improving significantly uh because You have an overhead right so pretty much like you have to reach enough people who are pretty much like enough clients and enough team members who are You know purely focused on service service delivery because initially when you think about like, you know I like to break everything down into like sales and marketing and then there's like, you know, someone responsible for operations Then you know, you have team members who are Responsible for silver service delivery. So I think that maybe like 500k is something that is uh Like I would say maybe a breaking point because then you know, let's say here's a founder Pretty much like you have to you know, pay or you have to pay for you know, all of like overhead expenses and all of that So you have to reach a certain point I haven't taken notes on this so but I would say like roughly I think that that's kind of like the point where When you know when things get better for the agency owners Before that, you know, if you're investing almost reinvesting everything back into the business because like that's what we did depending on how you look at the you know gross profit net profit and also You know how much salary you take or you know, you know, do you take actually, you know a market rate salary? All those factors, but I would say like 500k would probably be A good breaking point for you to you know, see decent profitability You are very similar to me. So on my flow chart, I've got 50k is that critical 50k a month Is that critical mass point where you should be in this position where profits going up not just revenue? and you should be quite removed from Doing all the stuff So that's very interesting And this is this is the problem that everyone has when they're a freelancer or a solo agency owner and they might get to seven 10k a month And then they they're starting to hit the ceiling of their output, you know physically I've run out of time to go and do marketing And it's taking that step of saying Which is what I did. Well, I can't have that 10 grand a month. I've got to give someone five of it To then to take to step back essentially financially. I'm going to reduce my financial Winnings or whatever. Yeah, you unlock me to go and do the bloody marketing And if you find the right Find the right person is the tricky thing And it's it's taking that risk that leap of faith to do that But on the flip side There's a lot of people that are watching this and a lot of people contemplating that We're actually there's nothing wrong with having a lifestyle business where you are A freelancer a well paid freelancer. You're doing six figures. You don't have to hire people You don't have to grow an agency if you're happy at that point So I think people really need to consider that that that picture Many years ahead of what they actually want and then reverse engineering because no It shouldn't always be about the money because people get Get to a certain point where they're like hitting the head and ceiling and they can't make any more money apart from putting the prices up But it doesn't always have to be like that if you've got a good balance And this is the the bit in your story You're a bit bigger than that. It was more like 25 co-month, but you flipped the marketing switch on so what one thing did you do? Because you did your branding exercise you specialized um I used to call ppc specializing but I now have pivoted and I don't think it's specialist enough Just saying you do google ads. I don't actually think he's a specialist anymore I think you have to go a bit bit narrower but your Ecom google ads is a bit narrower still but it out Maybe I'll add a couple things we I like to say that We do google ads. We're really successful So there are two kind of two angles. So one is we do google ads for boring but essential companies Well, so our money is Right. So as an example like automotive uh aftermarket parts Yep, you know like selling radiators or you know, yeah big business Connector boring stuff, right? But it's a big business You know, it's complex business typically, you know, we're we're dealing with uh, you know, tens of thousands actually sometimes even hundreds of thousands of Excuse that's that's you know, that it's scalable, right? So that's that's one side the other side that we work in is uh, kind of b2b supplies So hats, you know, like helmets boots, you know welding equipment, you know that type of stuff Um, the other area is like a sports equipment. So like So I'd say we have quite a few niches that are boring but but essential Where where you won't find us as you know selling promoting makeup apparel jewelry, you know Kind of like that type of side of the econ business. I'm not sure if we're good I think I can hire probably a few people and then maybe we can become a lot better But I would say like our core focus is on those areas kind of boring but essential But it's big enough There's plenty of it. Uh, and this is the thing people get distracted. It's like, oh, we could take on that I don't know jogging bottom or Lycra leggings business or you know, you get distracted. It's like, well, we don't really work with those sort of people so Okay, so you are you are more specialist you have a you have a type Which I think is the right way to do it. You have this pivot though this marketing pivot So what was that? What was the the main piece that you did marketing wise that changed the game because you went You had quite a jump in revenue Yeah, so so a few things Blogging was one thing so So I started writing guest posts. So maybe I've heard of like a company unbalanced conversion excel um big commerce A few others and started writing blogs on our site and then uh, you know, if you You know some sites with audience, right? Because I think maybe something that maybe the audience should learn is that I try to figure out At least like roughly where you know, your audience is and then you know try to write articles and we've gotten some leads It wasn't massive. You know, I did partner with you know, a couple, you know folks. I actually did some uh a couple of podcasts back then Um, and then we talked about google ads, but you know, it was like more like for Shopify stores, you know, that type of thing also directories so There are directories so If you let's say google let's say ppc companies within a particular niche or you know stuff like that um Back in what was it like maybe 17 or 16? Um companies like clutch, maybe I've heard of yeah Um manifest and you know companies like that started popping up and then they started, you know being uh pretty much like on top of the search results so actually I got active in and and uh, especially particularly with clutch and and uh that helped us to Drive a lot of leads to the business Um, you know, we were specialists. We were good at this and you know And we I think I joined clutch when there was like maybe five or seven thousand companies now there's like 25,000 companies, but we did maintain I'd say like almost always top 10 positions Like when when you do like clutch, you know research based on customer reviews case studies a lot all of that stuff You know we actively worked on making sure that pretty much like, you know, that side is working And we were demonstrated as leaders within that area. So there two there were two things actually at play number one was third-party social proof because you know, they're calling your customers You know or your customers are filling out and then you know clutch folks are verifying, you know that you actually worked with them So it's like, you know third-party validation, which is helps with research if somebody's looking at, you know you as a potential Partner and the other thing was that, you know, besides we're driving a lot of traffic So so based on that it's like, you know, you get, you know relevant traffic plus social proof. It's like, hey Look at scoob, you know, this is you know, one is like it's it's rated well and and you know, it's it's a top leader It's it's it's almost like feels like somebody did your homework for you So when you've got no audience Because I so I love youtube so I did well, I don't that's wrong. Sorry I hate doing videos. They make me nervous, but I love the outcome of doing videos YouTube has been brilliant for me over the years really really brilliant. Uh, it's made me seven figures But you have to build the audience up whereas you went where the audience is now interestingly I also did the same as you back in the mid 2000s. I wrote for convert.com Semrush ahrefs So I did the whole thing of writing a guest post for a number of these Uh blogs like you did so I did the same thing And that worked very well as social proof because when people were researching For me or the agency I'd come up and there'd be links back and and it'd be stuff you could cite as well Um, I think I had an article on big commerce or I was in one of their roundups many many years ago So yeah, you're using someone else's audiences and yeah, that was Nearly 10 years ago, but you can still do that today. A podcast is a it's sort of the The newer way even though podcasts were still around that and you can do like a road around trip on podcasts like a A road show where you get interviews across many different podcasts through an industry for example Like you're focusing on I don't know enterprise e-commerce You could find a load of different podcasts related to that and turn up and show your face and talk to people And that's it's a great way to get started if you want to drive traffic and awareness It takes a bit of effort, but it's you know, it's hard to grow your own Audience and everyone's trying to do it like you only have to look at linkedin. Everyone's trying to be a guru and grow their following um, yeah I think that you know like with linkedin it's something that i'm considering doing this year because I I haven't done much linkedin uh at all but i've noticed that Everybody's trying to come like write an epic story, which is like it's not like I despise them But to me it like looks too cheesy. It's like look at this this happen and this happen and we saved them and well I'm like it's like I don't know to me. It's like sounds like a bunch of bullshit Uh, I don't know that co chamber Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll I'll share one thing. I tried youtube back in 2017 and maybe you can look it up Uh, I started a channel called customer science But maybe a mistake that I made was that uh, I decided to take it uh to do it professionally And uh, you know My revenue was kind of low back then so it was not it was not sustainable So I actually did it with a you know professional editor. We actually rented out a studio And I was just doing these like you know segments like super edited segments You know with you know about like google ads like that type of stuff You know what's stuff that no one gives a toss about Or the branding and the magic and the polly. Yes, if I could if I can make seven figures with One light and no effort and some of my previous my old videos are awful. Um, it just tells you how How premature trying to do all the all the posh editing and the lighting all the fancy stuff That's like when you get to the like even at my level like most people say oh, you should be doing it And I'm like I'm perfectly fine as I am it works and people get Too distracted by the branding the logos all the fancy jazz when it's I mean you've got a device in your hand You've got a recording studio in your hand Just record a video on your phone. That's good enough to get you started some of the I attracted a um a few big businesses from my early videos and my early videos are really bad and these big businesses Were spending millions on google ads millions But they watched my videos and like oh, I want to talk to this bloke because he seems lucky knows What he's doing, but sorry I cut you off because you may And interjection about you know the stuff that I tried but to me, you know, I can't say that youtube worked but To to your point, you know, I did it for like, you know, four or five episodes because like I think it was like A lot of my time and it was like maybe 1500 bucks a pop You know to pay to the editor and you know to film and all of that And it was expensive back then. I mean just when you think about it, you know, can you do it weekly? No or even daily I mean, it's you know, it's a lot of money. Yeah, if you're turning over 100k 200k Um, and you wanted a full blown show. I mean, it's it's a third of your income not your profit so exactly lesson learned and and uh, you know, you know, it was good, but you know I do see value with youtube and and uh, you know I think that my perspective has changed but at the same time, I think it's uh It's almost like, you know 2020 I could not have made this decision back then because I was overwhelmed with everything that was going around me Now, you know, get to step back and say, all right. Well, let's really think about marketing, right? Because let's say I don't have to deal with let's say, you know, 40 or 50 You know accounts in terms of what's happening, you know, within each account myself, right? So so so I think that that allows me to kind of step back and really think about and just be a bit more strategic and thoughtful Back then it was just like let's do a bunch of stuff to Get traction. That was the goal, right? And and uh, well, I was spending like, you know, a ton of hours Like I think I remember was like spending like 20 to 30 hours per article To you know, because it was like two three thousand word articles, you know for those guest posts I didn't have kids back then so so I could afford to do that. I could afford to, you know, rise Not sustainable. Yeah But you know, some of those things have worked and and I was able to kind of like push ours, you know Push the agency, you know to to the next level there. You know a few things that have worked Yeah, and I think that's the important thing. It's not the medium doesn't matter. You do audio you do video you do writing You can send bloody postcards and yes postcards can work I think this is the problem you especially when you're newer in in running a business you try and do everything at once You try to all these different and you also you're impatient So you might try not to pick on you but you might try your video and you do five and you say, oh, I'm not getting leads But if you'd just done another five you'd go to lead if you did another 50 you'd have 100 leads and and It's it's just as I suggest with agencies that you Uh focus you narrow your focus service and delivery and niching and industries Uh, it's true of marketing. It's like go all in on something If it's twitter, it's twitter, but you go all in and you you try it till you've given it a good try 30 days 60 days, whatever it may be But you don't try it once and fail Because everything works if your audience is there everything works facebook ads might be the perfect thing for your agency if You know, you're working a certain service industry might fail miserably for ecom. Okay, well Tutorial videos on youtube might work perfectly for ecom And but not something else. So it's all you know, ultimately where's your audience and that's why using someone else's audience Is it's still a great method? Um, so anyone watching this you don't have to put 40 hours into a blog like tom did I do remember these 3000 word articles. That was the sort of standard, wasn't it? They did take a lot of effort I remember ah rafts really wanted a heavily researched piece A unique piece about sco and ppc And it took it did take a lot of time back then Days of work. So yeah, but I think they pay you back Yeah, in fact, I don't know if rand fishkin's still on the scene But rand was doing the same and larry kim. They were names that I saw all the time guest blogging Was larry hubspot. I can't believe you remember now, but rand was obviously word stream Yes, that's it. Sorry. Thank you pardon me was word stream and then rand was obviously Molotv Yeah, and how and they built they did content marketing and it still works It's a but it's a different avenue different angle different sort of effort Because some people do not want to record videos and I understand that Um So just circling back a bit then so what how many team members do you have now that your current size? So right now there's a 10 of us full-time. Okay Uh, we're actually looking for two more. So like we're actively interviewing. So hopefully, you know by the end of this month there'll be 12 um, and and uh, we have a six contractors Uh, it's quite quite a sizable chunk. So you're you're sort of doing 100k ahead Somewhere there. Yeah Okay Yeah, and and you know contractors, you know, we have like two folks who are doing cold emails for us and we just Three months ago. I hired someone to actually help me with closing. So actually Now I'm trying to take it to the next level, which is I don't you know sell anymore Trying to kind of work out through the kinks so I can actually step back from sales as well And then on the other side, we have, um, you know, two specialist, uh, kind of like a two specialist like one guy's doing pinterest And and you know, someone else is actually helping with like, you know, another like specialty ppc uh, a couple of accounts and and then we have a copywriter You know as a contractor Just kind of like supporting but I would say like 95 of the you know the work that is you know, like Which is like in terms of like our core verticals core areas of expertise is you know done in house And and uh, yeah, do you feel that now when you hit a million that you use this? where you become specialist That because you've got more revenue things start to creep out a little bit. So you're hiring for a bit of pinterest you're You're trying a bit of cold email. Do you feel that it's because you get this Confidence because you got the revenue I don't want to call it complacency, but that revenue sort of Freeze you up to try more things or do you think it allows things to creep? a bit So great question. I haven't thought too much about that, but I would say it allows me to maybe experiment more but typically Uh, when we experiment with some areas, it's typically done by market demand So as an example like pinterest, right? Um, a long-term client. I mean he's been with us maybe since 2018 or so So we started with google like we maximized it, you know, so I think we're starting like 7k But then I think we went up to like maybe 50k a month and that's been Um, yeah, so we we maximized that Then we added facebook because he trusted like then we you know test bing bing wasn't that successful You know based on return enhancement and then he's like, hey, I want to do pinterest and I'm like, well We don't do that, but it's a good client. So then we said, you know, let us like find out, you know, someone who's a Specialist like not another agency, but like someone who's really good and you know, the guy was actually Uh, he's like working full-time at you know, another company similar industry He does that, you know full-time in-house And you know approached him and then like he did the audit and we're like looks like you know Our values match and everything else and then he you know started doing that and we've been doing that for you know the past like three four years So do you now sell pinterest to other clients where it's appropriate? Uh, we're we're appropriate or we're the ask we don't necessarily focus too deep on that Maybe we should but but but It's like whenever there's a need We do explore that but I kind of go by the number of requests. So actually now we have you know had multiple requests about tick tock ads I'm waiting Because actually right now like in terms of let's say tick tock ads Can be okay. Maybe I don't have like too much of like Percent and I don't have a tick tock account, right? But looking at the you know pure metrics and and you know Pure numbers and pre requirements like the question is like can they produce video in the first place? Can they do xyz and if that's the case? Then we can explore that just because it's you know Unfortunately, there are like sharks out there like other agencies who are full service And uh, they may you know try to take away business just because the client does not necessarily want to manage separate channels, you know with separate teams, right? He says it does I feel like it does make sense Um to to to approach additional services that help with the overall growth of the company You know that we're serving. Yeah, no, I agree. It's uh, as long as it It doesn't become a distraction and that investment can be scaled And it adds to the outcome the value proposition. I think with tick tock ads. Yeah, I'm not particularly familiar with tick tock ads, but if it adds value to the outcome And it it defends you from another agency stealing your client away then I think We have to consider it don't we strategically is it google ads and ecom is that sufficient? I don't think it is. I think basket abandonment email follow-ups and stuff like that Are possibly required not for all And then some other strategic things maybe even conversion optimization But beyond that when you hit your spend limit in google ads because if you're doing a good job and the clients did a good job That's the other important thing. They're running a good business with a good product You can actually get to your max spend in google ads Relatively quickly and then it's a point we can't spend anymore and the client's like well get it more And it's like well, where'd you come from and it and you could you could double your client every year for five years? They love you But as soon as you hit that maximum clip They're going to be going. Wow. Do we need another agency even though you've done a splendid job? And this is this is the problem and I think ecom can hit that problem They've experienced that. Yep It's like yeah, it'd be great until Uh, you're you're reaching a certain point and especially if uh, the business Leaders want to grow every year. Yes Then it becomes Maybe you're great at you know going from zero to maybe let's say a hundred k And then maybe like from a hundred k to let's say, I don't know like a few hundred k But then maybe like if they want to try to reach a million You can't just do that with google ads depending on the industry, of course because like they're a little Then you have to look into other channels and and and so on so I think that you have to be strategic, but I think that To avoid the scope Creep and maybe it can like noise around you At least what I found was success at least somewhat successful and it's not You know, I'm not testing it at a massive scale at all. Uh, but I would say finding non competing specialists Like, you know, could be freelancer, you know, you know contractor someone maybe who's you know Really competent in this and who aligns with your value and then maybe get them to Work on those like non-court channels That's at least that's because like then you don't have to develop, you know process documentation You can share it in terms of how we work, you know basic structure, but You don't have to develop a you know a specific checklist on you know, how you optimize certain things on Pinterest Especially that's if your guy's like doing like spending 100k a month on on on ads doing Pinterest who's an expert at this, you know It's a double-edged sword, isn't it? So if you don't in house it So you essentially become a project manager for the client the client might not even be aware that this Pinterest person is not your employee Which is fine. So you're adding value, but the risk is then if you're contracting or using freelancers that they leave And they take that expertise with them. It's just it's that tricky balance, isn't it? I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to it. I think I think the the overarching thing for me is control So you you control where the client goes because you're prescribing it. So instead of one client turning up saying I want Twitter ads another one turns up saying I want Reddit ads and before you know it you've got 20 services Sure, I think it's more of a case of stepping back and saying what would suit the majority of our clients to help them Scale or become more efficient or for us just to deliver more value. And what can we what can we? Pre-sell or upsell or cross-sell to them to control that And then this drive then this might drive a wedge into the agency because then you start finding edge case Clients that don't fit any of that But you can see them becoming an issue in the future because they're going to have these bespoke demands of you because you Scaled them to a to a a point where now they want more and more And this is where you then might become even more specialists because you say well We no longer work with that industry because they have all these Specific requirements that just causes a headache. It is and it's an this is the problem of scaling an agency And and maybe I'll add to you know to your point about control Yeah, I agree with you about control But I think that you know, there's a couple things that at least how we do it one is we're being transparent with the clients that You're asking for something that we don't do our core services x y's because to me like branding and and you know How customers perceive us is very very important. So I say hey, we're gonna source one for you Right, so you know what to expect. We're gonna manage them But at the same time, you know, like we do manage them through our You know through through through our lens like through our approach So one is like, you know, how you you know calculate goals, you know How you kind of track towards goals, you know weekly reporting like all of that stuff is in our shape and our format or and and like only just like specific optimizations like You may be optimizing audiences differently slightly differently in Pinterest compared to Google ads as an example or you know, that's or keywords or whatever right But we still have that step internally to say you need to optimize that piece, right? You may do it differently just because it's a different platform But like we do require like we have like a very methodical approach to managing accounts So making sure that you know, they do the thing like audience management as an example or or you know bid, you know, optimization That or budgets like that type of thing But they do it within the constraints of that platform So they still are with our process except like the specific steps would be different just because it's a different platform, right? They can you know manage it that way, but we want to make sure that You know the the items are checked You know everything is presented in a way that scuba would present Yeah, your agency's house rules And again, this is another place or component where people are not able to do that People get They overthink it Like your processes your they can be or your sops can be so simple like for budget management They can literally be the we get the budget from the client and we're allowed to spend x over or x under And if this happens, yeah, we take this action and if it's really bad we Do this we escalate it that could be your budget management sop Because people get into this thing where they need to create these vast processes heavily documented That will then change all the bloody time need to be updated. So that's another thing people overthink the sops They can be super simple For this thing bullets for this thing bullets Says the guy that created god tier adds a massive framework of stuff But that's that's an exception. That's like a that's like a manic person. That's me just dumping everything In a thing you're meant to take slices out of it It's probably someone that works top to bottom every day. Bless them Yeah, this is this is very interesting Because you've been doing this for so long And you mentioned the 2020 vision hindsight. I think it's always good to to reflect so in hindsight If you your first hire it was your first hire. Did you say was your wife technically? Yeah, yeah, so in so in hindsight But hold on so first full time right what we can call it that way because yeah Because I did have freelancers help me. Yeah first full time hire if you have your time again Was she the right was that the right role to hire for or would you do something different? Well, yes, ultimately. Yes, and and you know whenever I meet up with my other agency friends um Some of them some of them who don't have a strong ops person They they say like hey, tom. You're lucky just because like I have to deal with this stuff So I would say that uh, it does require a specific type of a person with specific type of uh, maybe capabilities and and and character traits um Her background is in finance and accounting. So she's got uh, you know bachelors in finance masters in accounting Um, also, she's super direct right, which is good because like you have to be direct with people to solve problems Because on the in the back of the house I think most clients like like uh, like most people like being uh told directly Yes, she doesn't deal with clients though Uh, she does with uh some okay And and the main reason is that we actually we we have lost uh one account manager who And we just had to you know to maintain the relationship. She she picked over you know Just the account manager was reporting to her But uh, you know, that's going to change as soon as you know, we have a new team member unboarded But like technically based on her role doesn't but by the same time she's she needs to act as a buffer You know somebody leaves, you know, she needs to cover for that until the person is you know until you know a new hire is in place Uh, but uh, yeah, so sorry. Can she do google ads? Yeah, yeah, so brilliant. So she's like she was an analyst, you know in in corporate america So so she does that and also she was great on google ads Uh, but the perfect first hire I believe I mean trained her on google ads essentially. Um, yeah An operation ahead of operations even if it's not in name But I think that's the perfect hire someone who? Handles operations even if that's just handling the google ads accounts the reporting and some of the client comms Yes, and and yeah, so that's so maybe I'll add to that you have to have someone who's uh Very methodical and whose process drew and it's almost like a someone's like Not like a and like a sports car, but someone's like freight train once they get you know, uh You know pretty much like their momentum like they move no matter what what the roadblock says because you know Clients will leave, you know team members will leave, you know, there will be problems You know all kinds of but like moving and you know going further so so overall, you know I'm very very happy that uh, she joined my team because uh, yeah because of those qualities because you know, that's a consistency and making sure that pretty much like Things are working the ways they're supposed to work one thing maybe to to add to this is that and actually It was probably one of the biggest compliments one client said Uh, scoob is run like a well oiled machine and that was a more of a compliment to her which was like Shed got done on time and it was just like You know the way the you know, you know the way the client, you know expected So I'd say like that's the role that the need you need to have It's a massive trust builder if just being reliable boring and reliable is good Yes, yes, and uh, yeah one thing that maybe Was challenging sometimes that's some more technical things because I'm always like deep into like more technical issues But like like highly technical, you know areas Maybe it's not necessarily her, you know strength, but I would say like the fundamentals, you know client communication Making sure that like stuff is done cross like pretty much like everything is working That's I would say is her strength and I've noticed that you know, you need more of that You know, maybe like 80 percent of that and maybe 20 percent of that sometimes but I can always Other team members they can help with like some more technical aspects. Yeah this Everyone tries to hire a unicorn and it's again thanks to bloody social media where you're told that, you know, you need to hire a unicorn but we You hire for the primary role and any any additional Skills or experience is a bonus like if you're head of operations You should be in this context You should be decent at google ads But you shouldn't be you don't have to be the best because most likely as the agency grows There'll be another person under that head of operations Or you know head of performance, whatever we call them. Who is the google ads pure geek? There might be multiple and ultimately there might be people under those but the You you got I don't want to say you've got it slightly easier. It's your wife. She can't really leave the business I think one thing that people might be saying is ah tom you've you've cheated there because that's you you've hired your wife So all the shit bits of the job she might complain about but it won't make her leave And I think if you hire someone in this role, which I think is a very good idea Especially when you're at the 20 25k a month mark For google ads agencies quite similar for SEO agencies, but I think if you hire someone in that position You need to quickly identify and when I say quickly with the imperative mums The shit bits for them So the bits they don't enjoy because if they're really good you want them to stick around because this will be a pivotal role for your agency's growth and your Head as well because it unlocks so much of your time and mental energy not doing all the bloody work But you have to understand what they don't like so then you can hire for their pains as well So you're preparing for that next level because you freed up your time you go off and do your marketing And it works if because you've now got time to do it and then your head of ops is Fatigued or frustrated by these things where you hire for those because you're now trying to protect your head of operations So you've got to you have to think about that You know you just don't like you know dump all this, you know You know to to to your head of ops and say deal with it. It's a tough job It's a tough job, but you uh We divide and conquer, you know, there are certain issues that so we we do talk a lot about you know these You know different issues and and you know Some you know, I advise I help out on certain things the same thing on her like, you know Sometimes I need like hey, we're negotiating a certain deal with with a client You know we we talk we kind of think through things things through Together to ensure that We come up with the best possible solution because that's that's how we grow I mean together because like you can't know it at all and you typically need you just you need like a third party perspective to uh to to uh, you know come up with a good decision sometimes like it won't change the outcome But at least you have heard like hey somebody's thinking maybe in a slightly different way that's I'd say The approach that we take So you've got this far. You've hit that magic number where you're over the seven figure number in revenue So what's What's the plan from here? Are you happy or we're never happy though? Are we you want to go again scale again? or not the way I think about it is that I would like to scale continue to grow but uh I'm a big believer of sustainable growth It's you know something that uh allows uh, Say me to live my life, you know team to live their lives, you know properly in a balanced way, but at the same time grow um, so and and uh I think in order to grow and or I want to build that since essentially an agency that you know can be soluble if I Wanted to sell it one day no interest in doing that but but let's say if I wanted to you know I want to say essentially I want to build out all different roles in the team that It's kind of like a living and breathing organism That does not necessarily require my day-to-day involvement That's essentially like the ultimate goal You know in terms of like the you know the the dollar like the the sales figure I'm thinking it has to be probably between two and three million a year because then There's enough room for a leadership team. There's enough room for you know Full like full-time sales and marketing team You know and so I think that that's that that's the next big milestone that I'm trying to reach The other thing that I'm trying to do it's it's more like a personal thing. I know But a few guys of course like quite a few friends who have reached uh ink 5000 list I don't know. It's like It's you know tacky whatever But it's like I would like to get to you know two million with a with a certain level of growth Just to you know just to get on the list. Don't want to be like number one or like I don't want to see like super growth Let it just like something just to kind of chuck off and just tell it to my kids like hey, I did it Yeah, this comes back this Comes back to the shit list for me. I I don't care about awards credentials and stuff like that I care about what makes me happy what frees me up I try and let my ego Stay out of the way. Uh, so it doesn't become more more more Particularly like more revenue more this more clients more. I'm very much now. I don't know if it's because it's an age thing because I 42 this year, but I now think about how I'm gonna be Is that gonna make me happier? Healthier better. Do I need that extra money? Do I need to be on that list to keep up with my mates? Do I really care what my mates think about me? I don't know. These are all questions that do these things make you happy Yeah, maybe like, you know, you know, that's how you know It's not the main thing, you know But it's something that I thought to me one thing was like I almost like felt Um, maybe almost like incompetent like before we reached, uh, you know, seven figures. I thought like because Some guys, I know like they they build like big companies doing, you know, tens of millions of dollars And and I'm like, well, look at me, you know with a small business, you know, yeah, but 99 percent of people Don't even make, you know, a hundred grand a year Maybe yeah, extrapolate the world. It's it's it's 99 percent of people are under like I think it's a thousand dollars or something a month um So if you if you can hit six figures as a freelancer or solo agency Someone who's not destroying yourself pulling your hair out You should give yourself a pat on the back if you can maintain that phenomenal if you can get to 200 amazing If you can get to a million brilliant, do you not underestimate how hard it is to get to 500? And a million and to be honest, it gets a bit simpler It's a bit easier. Sorry. Not simple It gets a bit easier after that sort of 30 40k a month mark because you've got that critical amount You likely got a team beneath you. You've got that Cash flow you should have some profit that's your buffer And it does get a bit easier and go from a mill upwards You know, you've got that big springboard but um, you're certainly not uh A failure for hitting a billion bloody dollars Yeah, I know I did it and I know I know it was just like Sometimes the content you watch sometimes people you talk to it makes you feel it in a certain way and and uh, I think that that's Maybe Maybe like in two three years, I'll be like, you know what forget that no longer a factor, right? But uh, based on that, it's like I think it's always good to have some sort of a north star. What do you like? What do you want to achieve as a business? because I've noticed like the other thing even with the team team members they want to improve and they Want to have some sort of they want to see some sort of growth because their career is growth Otherwise, you're gonna keep them only for let's say a year or two and that's it So making sure that you kind of clear out some sort of like growth paths For the team members and making sure that like they get successful. They are able to kind of grow with you um, I think that that's you know a factor because I think that There's one focus on like, you know your own personal side But also once you have a bigger team now, I feel a big responsibility for the team. It's like hey, you know, we are supporting You know Quite a few team members, you know and their families, you know their kids Making sure that you know, they you know, they have a good life So so continuing on that and they have growth aspirations They may not want to work on the accounts anymore someday, right? Need to make sure that there's enough room within the agency that they can still stay with us But at the same time they they can take on a different role. Maybe like there's a specialized role Maybe there's a you know, kind of like a team manager role team lead role Uh, maybe even a sales role. I don't know but but But the point is that there are opportunities to grow Not just enhance your own, you know career as you know agency owner Um, because it's kind of it stays with you, right? But but at the same time serve other people and make sure that they Get their goals met, you know, whatever the you know, their goals are and hopefully we can meet those as as best as we can Yeah, I completely agree and I am empathetic to that But ultimately and I've learned this the hard way the agency owner. You're the one that risks Everything essentially especially in the early days. So you should be rewarded for that and I think If that means I used to take the shitty stick So I'd like if anyone's got a problem pass it up Hill to me and I've slowly realized over the years That's not fair on me and it's actually very hard to deal with so I pass it back down more these days Because it's like I would not admit it That's my luxury for for risking and putting all this energy in and risking all the financial side of things And that's the important that's the other important thing, you know, if you get to a million or you get 500 grand Whatever it may be 10 million If you're not enjoying it and you're not extracting that dividend that reward of A bit more free time a bit more headspace another holiday if you want another holiday or You want another dog to walk, you know, these things that make you happy Then and I don't mean the material things like a new Lamborghini the crap that we can ignore the the healthy things then I think you have to make time for those and that sometimes does mean that you are prioritizing yourself in the business Which I think is a just reward Which is sort of, you know A lot of people don't like to say it, but yeah You I'm not saying don't look after your staff, by the way remember who Who's also earned that reward ultimately And and the thing is you're the one constant. You're not going to leave the agency. You can't well, you can You can leave it you can sell it But you're that one employee that's going to be around forever and regardless of what you do It's very difficult to keep an employee. You can pay bonuses. You can pay more money But it's not always down to the financial reward as you've just said so I think you have to expect that someone will eventually want to leave because they want to get to a point That you can't fulfill, you know some some stage higher And that's okay and again that It comes easier with critical mass ie you have more people because you make more money And you could afford to lose someone apart from the wife can't afford to lose the wife. She's in a very crucial role So she's essentially co-founder now Yep bro Tom that's been Very interesting I think From my perspective. I'm sure everyone else thinks the same. Uh, hopefully I didn't waffle too much and cut you off But I love that you brought a timeline jotted down that's super super important I might have to do one of them myself I think some golden nuggets in there Good good Hopefully it was helpful, you know, you know for you know your community and you know Your your youtube channel I used to be in a different mindset years ago Which is like, you know, I've got all the secrets and I'm not gonna share anything but but I realize it's it's actually different You know you have to apply stuff, but at the same time what I've noticed is that probably like the most successful people like they do share Um, and and they're they're fine with you know, their lessons learned. They're you know, they're um their mistakes I used to be kind of afraid of mistakes now. I'm like, well, I messed up in a few areas But that's fine. Uh, I learned from them. Um, you know through reflection and you know changing course and all of that stuff, but uh If you're afraid of mistakes, you'll never take a step It's part of the it's part for the course. It's part of the process and sharing is also very powerful if you think you've got the secret You haven't And that was true for me. I used to be the same way you don't want to share because you don't want to give it away What what are you giving away? And you've got to remember that you and I and other agency owners and budding agency owners watching this We're unique As I said before majority of people are not putting themselves through this So you could give I mean I give so much information away You could buy my framework for like less than a grand at the minute prices going up I mean If you applied that you like it's 13 14 years of my brain distilled just follow it and it will it it works But I know sadly that most people won't apply it. They'll buy it think about it and this is not to kick anyone. It's just It's just lie. So if you'll sat there thinking I'm going to implement I'm going to implement tom said something useful ed didn't Go and implement it because it's that's where the rubber meets the road That's where the winners are the people that you try it do it fail learn Rins repeat Yeah, where can people find you? Let's say find me on linkedin. I think that you know, I don't post on facebook. I don't post on twitter or any of the other areas I was at linkedin. This is where I'm planning to be more active this year You can go and I think linkedin.com forward slash tom look at vicious Or you know, whatever the link in the description and to your website scoop marketing. Yeah, tom's surname I can't even say it. So I'm not even going to pretend to say You can vicious vicious tom. That's the Thank you so much. Thank you for sharing. I hope you enjoyed it. Uh, I know I did um, even though it's late here So I I appreciate your time. Um, yeah, good luck for the next stage in the journey Thanks
