I think it's a psychological thing. Quarterly, it's going to be bigger because you've accrued three months. And it's a, it's a, you're thinking forever ahead the month on month. Whereas month on month, you can think of another job. So I know lost, was it last week we were talking about, um, I think paying staff based on a, I think it was like you pay a ratio, yeah, it was like a five X. So they got to pay a salary, but then they got to manage five X what that is. Monthly, I think. Um, what additional incentive based pay helps retain staff. Um, and bear in mind if it's for lead gen. So, so I kind of want to tie something in with performance client retention. I've got some ideas, but I was wondering if you've ever done it and for like lead gen or Liam looks like he's got an idea. Yeah, I did. Well, I paid bonuses. Um, so I'll answer it and then Liam can tell us how he does his. See these two, you're two, there's two ends of the spectrum here compared to Michael. You're at the other end of the spectrum where you're doing the templated stuff. I can get high. So you could probably get away with less experienced, less expensive people managing the accounts. Michael trying to get five X out of his guy might be difficult, but it's certainly one to aim for. If he's paying someone six figures, he should be able to do it. Now, if you're paying someone 25 grand, um, I dare say you can do more than five X, but it's economies of scale. It's what, what's realistic? How much you charge per account? Let's put it, well, let's say that so 25 grand a year, let's say you pay them to an half grand with tax. Let's say that's four accounts. So could they manage 20 accounts reliably? Cause that's one a working day. That's your, that's your five times multiple. I mean, could they probably, yeah, would they burn out, which leads onto the next question, probably. I've bought them. Yeah, but I, this is the thing. I think, Hey, how'd you get around boredom in a job? Well, if the job's boring, it's jobs boring and a lot of jobs are boring. Doesn't Google answers the same really. So you can offer bonus incentives for performance, but. A lot of people are motivated by money to a certain point. And then if the job isn't satisfying them, they'll move anyway. So I think this is the importance of having a really good process and structuring in place, which is easy for you to do template things. So you can stick it on the next person that turns up. Are you scared of losing someone good at the minute? It's, um, how many guys have you got? Sorry. Me, Dale, we just hired someone full time as well. So are you worried about losing them after hiring them? Or are you just thinking ahead? Just thinking ahead really. Not too worried at this stage, but just thinking, you know, because we're not really hired people full time before and everything. Well, we've got a contract is, but like having someone who's like committed to. To the cause and sticking around and what we can do to ensure that. So you can give them, um, you push incentives out initially until someone's been with you for a long enough time. So I wouldn't give someone a month on month to start with. Yeah. Because then it becomes too familiar and I don't think that would stop them leaving, maybe make it quarterly or even six monthly to start and say, look, if we hit these targets for these clients, you know, it doesn't have to be every single client, but if you're on average above the target that we set across the accounts you manage, we'll give you X percent of the revenue that comes in from those clients. So it pushes that milestone out a bit. And then if they turn good six, nine months in, maybe six months, you can move it to maybe a quarterly or bi-monthly. Um, I don't know. I think it's a psychological thing. Quarterly is going to be bigger because you've accrued three months. Uh, and it's a, it's a, you're thinking further ahead the month on month. Whereas month on month, you can think of another job.
