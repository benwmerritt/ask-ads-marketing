Are you still an advocate of standard shopping? Don't put words in your mouth. You're not all in on performance max. My baseline position is that standard shopping is not broken. Standard shopping still works. We have clients who they're not going to want to try out Pmax. They're happy with standard shopping. They don't they don't like Pmax, whatever the case might be. They didn't like standard shop smart shopping before that. And I respect that. I totally respect that. I'm not going to twist anyone's arm. But also for anyone who's willing to give it a shot, I'm encouraging that too, because it is a new technology. We should, in my opinion, be open to new technologies and try these things. The jury is still very much out because it's also it's a moving target if this product doesn't feel entirely finished yet. And we're all kind of bankrolling that, which is something that I relate to more. But the product is getting better. What would your approach be for Pmax? So you've got standard shopping or smart shopping and you're being forced to move to Pmax. How would you segment to test instead of just shifting the whole thing over to Pmax? What would you do? Take your best sellers, maybe, because they've got the the most chance of working or? Yeah, totally. You can look at bringing over because you don't want to have any redundancy or duplication between the accounts, because Pmax will kill your shopping. But you can move, you can test categories. We've been doing with merchants all the time. You can test or you can test it in something like best seller. Totally. I think that this is a good way to dip your toes in. And you just need to make sure that you're handing Google a fair amount of data. You've got to give them a chance, but there's some risk in it. But we've broadly seen that we're seeing good results on conversion rate. I guess what I don't like is that we, and I don't know if this is a macroeconomic trend or something, but as we opt in more and more budget into performance max at this high level, we're seeing average order values going down. And I don't understand this, why that's happening, if it's about performance max or if it's about something else. Yeah, I see it could be the economic climate. And I think another reason people have problems with performance max, and I think that this was a smart shopping issue as well when it first launched, they weren't giving it good stuff. So they weren't giving it the best sellers, they were giving it the bottom pile and saying, well, try and make that work. And that's the wrong approach because you're not mitigating risk, you're just going to essentially just blowing money. So I would try good stuff, a good set of products, a good subcategory, and give it a fair chance, essentially. But as Mike alluded to, and I've said, standard shopping ain't broke. It's more work, but it ain't broke. We don't make mistakes, we have happy accidents.
