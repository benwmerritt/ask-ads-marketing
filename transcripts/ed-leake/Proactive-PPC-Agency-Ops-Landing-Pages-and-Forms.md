your production quality is here and it looks less trustworthy. It's not going to convert as well. Yeah. That's like the subtlety. It's really small details that you don't realise until you like, you're like, ah. Landing pages, which is probably where Sam's ears percope. I think if Lee Jen, outside of the core quality, I think the next thing to be proactive with is landing pages. And obviously that's a very big topic. So instead of saying to a client next month, we're going to roll out a new landing page. What are some smaller steps or baby steps, particularly for smaller clients that you could do? You know, what's the most effective thing you could do? Headline test, form change, you know, what do we think in terms of landing pages for Lee Jen? Is the headline, headline, sub headline, then call to action. That's all you have to test. Like if you're testing anything more than that, you're trying to change colours and shit like that. It's just, you're wasting time. You know, all you need to test is headline, sub headline and call to action. And that's going to be 90% of moving the needle. But your major one for landing pages is what the actual offer is. Yeah. You know, like if you've just got a deadbeat offer compared to the competitors, it doesn't matter if you push and it doesn't matter how you shine the shit, still shit. You know what I mean? It's just like I can't sell shit to everyone, you know. It's production quality as well, because you can take, I mean, offer all those things, definitely best things to measure, but your production quality is here and it looks less trustworthy, it's not going to convert as well. Yeah. That's like the subtlety. It's really small details that you don't realise until you like, you're like, it's the subtlety of how the logos are laid out. Like it's not weirdly positioned and stuff. It's like all the small things that you wouldn't normally pick up on. Is that five star rating the same one from Google? Or does it look like a weird clip up five star? I kind of, these are all like really subtle things that people look at and they're like, it's kind of like on the checkout page on Shopify, you know, that looks legit because it's got the layout that you're familiar with. It's very conventional. What I say is you get pages which don't look conventional, you're like, huh, like I'm not sure. Okay. So proactively, if you were taking on a new client and they had a landing page, would you prioritize tarting it up to make it look respectable and trustworthy before testing elements? I would because I placed a lot of emphasis on it's got to look trustworthy to win the conversion. It's not always the case. It really depends on the service as well. But you know, it's very, yeah, it's very dependent. My like, I say all the time, my website, shit, but I'm selling to marketers who, I guess, are less bothered about the way things look. I don't know, but mine convert right. But yeah, you're right. I think I agree with you. If you take on service client and you presented with landing pages or just pages that look gash, I think my priority would be just converting them to something smarter, just to get a baseline in of something that looks trustworthy. And then move on to what Liam says headline offer call to action. What about Liam? He didn't mention form, but Sam, what do you reckon form? I'm like, I like testing forms. Yeah, that's a huge one. Question to ask. They open ended closed ended questions. How easy are they to answer? Or any quest like question drop off rate? What questions do people drop off on? That's a big one. Yes. How many questions? You ask what does what? How do you how do you ask the questions? Do you break up name, email, phone number into those separate steps? Or they are more conventional name, email, phone number type step. We tested it cross. This is really interesting. The older demographics, so we do a campaign for. We tried testing a form which broke up name, email, phone number into separate steps. And it didn't convert as well as asking name, email, phone number, but people ages upwards of 40, I think it was 50 and above, which are primarily their target audience. You know why we thought, oh, why is this like this works really well across everyone? Others or the other accounts we run, probably because it's unconventional to what they would be seeing. And that's the hypothesis anyway. Yeah, that's interesting. So there's always a reverse test, especially. Yeah. So one thing doesn't necessarily work. Well, across everything. No, because I thought, oh, we found this ultimate multi-step way of breaking up name, email, phone number, reduces drop off rates, but then this campaign just didn't work. I'm not a major founder multi-step forms. The only reason I like them is because it makes it easier to measure drop off, but you can do it with tag manager anyway, individual form piece. I think GA now integrates it. Well, so we tried a multi-step on one of our insurers years ago. It tanked conversion rates. And they don't have an age issue like Sam mentioned, they sell to anyone 18 up to near death. And it didn't work for them. It did not work. So now what they have is a long form with a quote at the end of it. I say a long form. There's email, telephone, yes, both name, lifestyle, don't ask address, but I'd say there's probably seven fields. So it's not a small form. But when we double, when we two stepped that conversion rates dropped significantly, which so that's why I don't believe there's, and Sam has just said it, there's not a guaranteed way of doing forms. It's like, we can't, we can't be cocksure enough to say always do a multi-step form, test it, I wouldn't say it's always going to beat it. I definitely agree. But I think it also depends on what your first question is. Like if your first question is something that excites them, then it's more likely to work. If your first question is what is your name, that's not really exciting. But if it's like, what is the biggest issue? Like do you want, is it lead quality or is it, do you want multi to something like that? And I think it's, it works in a way that's more engaging. And then you kind of, you get them into, you know, people think it's more fun to fill it out. So, but, but yeah, you're right. There's so many nuances in it. Yeah. It could impact lead quality as well, which is something you need to measure. And Michael's just made a point. My sample size of one is biased, my opinion. No, that's okay. I'll comment, Michael, but then Mad said they are better. So I was just trying to, we're both wrong. I've got another example on how to apply it. Okay. You go to a legal landing page, get free consultation. With that, you can probably use a single step form, name, email, phone number. You've got very clear cut offer, you know, who you're going to get through that. Compare that to something like evaluate if you qualify for contesting a will, you know, see if you can contest the will. That's the offer taken through the question steps. And then like, hey, you may qualify to contest the will. Do you want to book a consultation off the back of it, or kind of then find a way to subtly ask for their contact details off the back? Yeah. So it's context matters. And then you can target top of final keywords and convert those who wouldn't have otherwise converted if you're just going in consultation, it's more see if you qualify. It's the context of enabling you to then be proactive on how you target people because you're not going straight for the, for the jugular, i.e. the free console or whatever. AKA we're going to ring you till you pick the bloody phone up, which not everyone wants.
