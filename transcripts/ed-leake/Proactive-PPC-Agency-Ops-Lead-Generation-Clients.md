There's always going to be people who can't afford it and have a certain budget level. It's really about understanding contact rate and then are they genuinely interested in the services that you provide? Because if you can't measure it, then it's just going on the client's word for it. Go on then, let's work on proactive lists. So we've got lead gen accounts, this shitload you can do. Sam, let's start with that call quality. How do we practically improve call quality? What can you do? So I love... Lead quality or call quality? Well, let's say lead quality, because the biggest issue for lead gen is lead quality. So plumbers and shit like that and services, I think that's the one biggest complaint we ever have is the quality is not there. Obviously, the volume drops, it's different. But there's two questions that I've found that really helps with qualifying the leads, which is, are they interested in the service and do they have the budget for the service, your product or service? And actually, just using those two questions, you can determine if it is a marketing problem or if it is a sales problem. Because if they've got the budget and they're interested in the service and you've qualified that, then it's a sales problem. And it's like they're just not closing or they're not talking. And if they can't even find that information out, it is still a sales problem. You know what I mean? Well, it's to be really like... So how do we... We start at the top level with it. So for lead quality, you have to first of all have a way of tracking lead quality. That's the first protocol before you say anything about all of that. The leads that you capture from a form on your web page, that has to be then tracked and accessible by a client, whether that's a spreadsheet, CRM, whatever it is. And then the next part of it, which I think is the most important is contact rate. Because mostly, Jen is either going to be phone calls into the business or form submissions. What's the rate of which you can actually contact those leads? Before you even talk about the quality of who they are, are you able to first of all get through to them? So your contact rate is really important off the back of that. And then the client, throughout this whole process, needs to keep the agency updated on the status of everything. So with what converts, with what we use, is like, was that lead quotable? Which is kind of what Liam was saying. Are they interested first of all in the service and are not... This is not a lead that's come through trying to sell SEO or someone who's looking for the wrong thing. Are they in the market for what you have to offer? Budget? Not everyone's going to have budget. And you can determine that to be not quotable or quotable depending on how you want to measure it. Because there's always going to be people who can't afford it and have a certain budget level. So for us, it's really about understanding contact rate. And then are they genuinely interested in the services that you provide? And that then tells you, okay, if you've got a high lead to quotable or lead to the right, I guess, quotable status of that lead, then that's how first of all, measure your lead quality. Because if you can't measure it, then it's just going on the client's word for it. So the proactive steps then for lead quality is that you need to put something in place. So if you're in position now where you've got lead gen clients and you've got no way of measuring this, or you've just taken on a new lead gen client, or you've had one for a couple of months, then a proactive step is putting a system in place to say, client, next month, this is our, this is your challenge, this is our solution. And this is the hypothesis. You think the leads are shit, we're going to put a system in place, and the outcome will be that we'll be able to measure it and improve it. Exactly. And if they're not quotable, then you need to understand the reason why is it out of area? Is it wrong service? Is it dud number so that then you can then have a breakdown of, oh, we're going to get loads of dud numbers. What do we need to do? Probably find a way to verify information on the form, add more steps, do something there to be able to get better quality info. If all you're getting is dud numbers, all that could be their word that they're saying, dud numbers are not getting through to them. And that's where you come in and try call all of them and see, but it's the ones which just you call up and they just go, you know, what's a fake phone number? Like, do you have a fake phone number problem? Yeah, so this is very proactive. And then of course, there's a load of work that can come off the back of this the month after because you're checking lead quality and trying to optimize it. But I think this is a big chunk. And then for, I think that because that off the lead and sale side for lead gen, the only proactive thing I think we have as Google ads specialists is there is a problem. I need to diagnose it and prescribe a solution. And then I need to have a prediction of what, you know, why am I doing it? Is the high? What's the hypothesis? So I'm going to this problem. I'm going to do this. And I expect this to happen, which is obviously a positive outcome, but you need to measure it. And I think that's the only thing we do. And it might be, I don't know, we've got Pmax is in one campaign, you want to split it out. I think that was an example that Mad sent me. And why do you want to split it out? Well, you think it'll improve the performance. So here's the test, here's the hypothesis. Let's measure it at the end of that period. And that can be something that you discuss with the client as a proactive Google ads thing, you know, a specific strategy that you're going to test. So you're not telling them that again, you're not giving them changelogs, you are giving them your solution to a current or a potential issue that you've seen. So that's proactive. But outside of doing that kind of thing, a test, excluding doing your checklist work, excluding doing your own ongoing optimizations, I don't think they are, they are proactive, but they're also reactive. They're, they're the work.
