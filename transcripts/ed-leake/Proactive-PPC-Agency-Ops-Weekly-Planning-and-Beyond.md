It actually helps a client's stomach week performance periods because you've got a plan about what you're proactively doing as opposed to my accounts fucked. The other part of my question is if we it seems like all of you can agree that reactive is the best approach. What is the effort on where it matters and then. Not caring about the long check list and but in terms of how you plan your week or your month and. How you then deal with those issues is something I'm also a little bit if you look at the beginning of the month you look for all the clients and then you have a home and then you kind of. Based on that decide who needs the most attention and based on that you put it in your calendar or you know how exactly you manage it because I find that I do a lot of it's a little bit chaotic for me. I don't have a very clear structure on how I'm managing managing accounts what triggers you say it's a bit chaotic what triggers the work then on an account so let's say you got 10 accounts site in front of you. It's the first Monday of the month what triggers the work and the type of work what I mean how do you start where do you start. Well normally I would look at the account level I would look at so the clients that's that's performing that has the worst performance. Both in terms of pacing so are we under over budget and then also in terms of KBI so if KBI is twice as high and obviously there's an issue. And then I would try to go into those clients and then look at the campaigns that are performing the worst basically and see if I can fix those. So quickly turns into a little bit dabbling around or should it be you know that I can improve. So do something with the key words it doesn't feel very I guess strategic and sometimes I thought maybe it was better just wrote a little report for myself and then I would use that to plan the entire month. Instead of just doing a little bit of random work each week. You know all performances that good I'm gonna change the target to be a little bit I'm gonna add a negative keyword then we're gonna do the same the next week. It's a little bit it's a little bit yeah to care they can not strategic enough it's just yeah. So it's reactive it's pure pure reaction because you get you're essentially jumping into an account that's underperforming. Okay, so this is another thing why being proactive is better because if you specify going back to the reporting consultation type situation. If you're proactive and specifying what we're going to do in the future it's it actually helps a client stomach week performance periods because you've got a plan about what you're proactively doing as opposed to. My accounts fucked your reacting to it. Whereas when you've got a plan and it's like we're having a bumpy period but I can see the wood for the trees because we've got a plan to go forwards.
