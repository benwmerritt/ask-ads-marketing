So, Carlin asks what he calls the million dollar question, should small businesses advertise on Google or Facebook? Just to annoy you, Carlin, the answer is both, but not in the way you think. So Facebook is currently cheaper per click than Google. However, Google is more buyer orientated because people search with intent, you know, they, I am looking for X or, you know, I need assistance with Y. So on Facebook, you're pushing ads into people's timelines and essentially interrupting them. Whereas on Google, you're not. People are actively searching. So it's quite a different approach. One's push, one's pull essentially. How do we use Google and Facebook together? So what we do is promote content on Facebook first. And that's based on interests and answering pain points, for example, that are appropriate to your industry and business. This is completely non-sales and very early funnel stuff. So very early in the buying cycle, just to educate people on your product or service. And so it's just content designed to orientate people and give guidance essentially. So as you drive people to your content on your website, your Facebook pixel, which you should have installed is collecting them anonymously in a audience list. You can use that list to retarget them on Facebook, but I'd still advise more educated content at this stage. Don't go for the sales pitch straight away. But this is where Google comes in. So, you know, using Facebook to drive cost effective clicks to your content on your website. At the same time, your Google remarketing code, which you should have installed, will be collecting these people in another list. So with this Google audience, instead of paying for keywords in the traditional sense, you can pay to only put your ads in front of your audience. So these are people that have already visited your website and you know what they've looked at and you could put a relevant ad in front of them. I've just done a quick diagram to explain this. So this is one of our live content loops. As you can see, we drive people to the relevant content first. And these can be blog posts, guides, downloads, all sorts. Then we push a more sort of action orientated piece to them. This might be like a guide or an ebook that shows them what to do. Then finally, we push our credentials to them. So they've shown that they're interested. They've downloaded something to help them do it. And then for the portion of people that actually want it done for them, we show them case studies and completely transparent pricing. This is the final sweet spot. In Google AdWords, we can remarket to these people for much, much cheaper clicks than paying for direct traffic from keyword searches. So we know once people get to this stage, if they then look in this example for a pay-per-click agency or company or whatever it may be, we know that they're very, very warm. And in our marketplace, those keywords can be anywhere from 15 to 30 pound a click, incredibly expensive. Using this method, we're getting them for two, three, four pounds at most a click, which is a significant cost saving, I mean, massive. So maybe I shouldn't be talking about this, but never mind. So yeah, essentially, this process allows people to qualify themselves first by their interest and then continue to warm themselves up as they move through each step to the point where you can actually put a more salesy piece in front of them, or keep everything on Facebook non-salesy and once they're on Google, put the sales pitch in front of them, i.e. the advert. I hope that helps, Colin. Cheers.
