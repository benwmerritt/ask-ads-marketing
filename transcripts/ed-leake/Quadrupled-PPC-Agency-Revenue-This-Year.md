and it's been amazing for us. So far this year we've quadrupled our monthly revenue, we've got a nice steady stream of clients coming in every month. Hi, it's Ian from Expo's Profits. Just want to leave a quick testimonial for Ed Leakes Agency Forge. It is the first one I've ever left so please bear with me. So where was we beforehand? I had a couple of year break from the agency game, kind of frustrated and a bit peed off, so went into Econ for a couple of years. So basically I restarted the agency and come across Ed's Agency Forge and it's been amazing for us. So far this year we've quadrupled our monthly revenue, we've got a nice steady stream of clients coming in every month because of the client acquisition process, we've got our SOPs a lot more streamlined, so yeah all in all it's been brilliant. We've got community self-life coaching calls with Ed and the team, all this has contributed towards the growth that we've experienced this year. So I'd just like to say a massive thanks to Ed for putting EGYForge together and helping EGYONAS like myself to excel really and stand out in an oversaturated market. So if you're like I was beforehand and a bit stressed out and frustrated with the entity game or you just want to take your entity to the next level then I'd highly recommend you check out Ed's Agency Forge, you won't regret it. Cheers.
