If that scenario comes to pass, Google ads will no longer be the valuable asset that it is. Yeah, well, I've got the breaking strength of a KitKat because, yeah, you've swayed me back the other way. Match types. Your prediction, you struggled to come up with a positive prediction, but you were pretty quick to highlight the one thing you really didn't want Google to take away, which was match types. So let's dive a little bit into that in detail. Like everybody knows broad matches, it can be good. Obviously, you have the broad match paradox. That's your lovely idea for why broad matches can be a good thing. But if you don't use it properly, it can backfire. So what works? What doesn't work? Where is your mind at with broad match? So I've slept and eaten a couple of times since we recorded that. And I did think about, so I was just thinking about, OK, if match types, do we really need them? And if Google Gevers search topics, so a bit like Pmax has, it's going after a topic or a segment or an audience or whatever. I thought to myself, right, OK, if Google Gevers that, is that the end of the world? So if they remove match types, and I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, because obviously Google listened to me as the fifth most influential PPC expert of 2025, not the first, second, third, or even fourth, the fifth. But would it be the end of the world? No, but there is a crucial, crucial thing. We would have to see search term reports. We'd have to be able to apply negatives. That would be the bit otherwise it would be a complete scam. Because you only have to put keywords in to know that search is dynamic and negatives are required. Do I like match types? I do. I like exact. Could we live without them? Yes. If the targeting became better, a bit tighter, we can still see it in broad. It's sometimes it hits, sometimes it misses by a mile. We Google cannot replace keywords and match types until those are more hits than misses. You can't have a keyword that's got iPhone in it. And then Purple Dildo comes up in the search term reports. It's not like it's just not acceptable because there happened to be a purple rubber case or something for the iPhone. Saved it. Saved it. So, yeah. So search, topical search or search topic. So you're literally selling microphones and you're like, my audience is people buying music equipment. It's too broad. OK. And then you a bit sort of reminds me of display audiences. Then you go down another level. You got pianists. You got guitarists. You got podcasters. So, oh, yeah. OK. Podcasts. That's my target audience. But then how do they know it's a microphone? It's they start to get a little bit tricky. That's product data. But services, it starts to get a little bit tricky as well. Like how do you? OK. Well, Google use the website content. OK. Yeah. So it ties that all together, which it does now. And in, you know, in fancy land, it sounds easy. It sounds like it should work. It sounds like it should be brilliant. Give them a website. Give them a target audience, you know, a rough audience and they'll figure the rest out for you. But until that's the thing that works and it doesn't quite work, they can't remove match types. But I'm not against it. So long as we get the control at the search term, we still need to see, OK, I'm using this automated targeting system, but tell me what it's hitting. Like you do the thinking, but shut, but report it. Report back to me. I've sent you off in this direction. What are the search terms? So I know that if, you know, because we could be in the complete wrong direction. So we need that. We need to be able to talk to our negatives. And it would have to be all search terms, right? Not 30 percent, 40 percent. You'd have to be able to see every search term that led to a click. This fucking privacy thing. I would, I want someone, I should ask GROC because GROC is quite good at this. When someone puts something on Twitter, now you can go, GROC, is this true? And it will actually go out real time and try and work it out for you. Good use of AI. Is it like, is this purely about privacy? Is that true? Like if we're losing over half the search term data, why is that about privacy? I really want someone from Google to say, these are the specific privacy concerns of why you can't see that data. Even better in your search term reports, like we used to get in a UA, GA3, this is filtered data and then tell us what the filter is, what portion of it is filtered and just give us a, you know, a breakdown as why. Bullet point here, like three reasons because of blah, blah, blah. And 32% is filtered out because of these reasons. At least we know and they could do that. And then we can complain about those reasons, but at least they'd, we'd know. Is that too much to ask? Hello, PPC professional or agency owner or in-house marketer. Person doing Google ads. Good news, writing competitor, crushing ad copy just got easier. It actually got fully automated inside the 23 pillars of ad copy, which is a God tier ads product. It's $23 because it's 23 pillars. You can get it for $5 by following the link. Why should you do that? Because it shows you the 23 pillars before and after real world case studies of ad copy in the wild, why one's bad, one's good, better, and what you can do about it to increase your own performance of your Google ads accounts. I'm a professional and this is a sales pitch. So please click the call to action. There's a link somewhere around here. Oh, yes, it's got a chat EBT prompt. So you can fully automate the ad writing process. In fact, it's better than that. It's got a ad writing copy prompt that automatically improves itself. There's a improvement agent. So every time you run it, it improves the prompt. So I give you the starting prompt, you run the script and it improves the output over time. All of this for like $5. It's kind of ridiculous. And I also bloody fucking I also forgot about the RSA template. So there's a responsive search ad template inside as well. So yeah, $5. See what good, bad ad copy is. See all the elements. Learn that. Get AI to do the job for you. Paste into your Google ads account. Win. If you do away with keywords and match types and search terms, you're undoing the covenant on which Google ads and its pricing model were built. The promise was we will show you what people are searching for in a given moment and you will pay for every time somebody makes that search and clicks on an ad, which we will put front and center above all the organic results. So you will jump to the front of the queue and you'll only pay us when somebody clicks on that ad, but you will, you will have the ability to target people, whether they're exploring options or have made a decision based on what they're searching for. You'll be able to target people. If you do away with that, Google's basically becoming a search engine. Did the person using it is using it as a search engine and the person advertising on it. You have to treat it like a social media platform. You know, like with Meta, which is basically interspace targeting. That is going to be a big problem. The second thing is attribution and being able to show people the impact of the ads that they run on business is going to get even trickier. It's already tricky to draw that connection because Google's showing you less and less information. It becomes more nebulous if you group it into themes because even if the options that Google presented us are very specific and they say, okay, you can, you're advertising microphones. It will let you pick who your audience is. Is it people looking for instruments? Is it people who are into podcasting? Even if it gives you that, it also has to let you select what stage of the purchase journey they're in because somebody who's starting to think about maybe doing a podcast and wants to see, Hey, what, what kind of gear would I need to get the best quality sound? What mistakes should I avoid? You don't want your ad to show up for those results if you're actually pushing product. There's a problem. Yeah. So it becomes you lose intent. You lose all the intent when it gets into service. Right. There's a problem. But Google won't. Google will want to sell those ad slots, but an advertiser won't want them. If that scenario comes to pass, I can see the fat at Cal going to slaughter and Google ads will no longer be the valuable asset that it is. Yeah. Well, I've got the breaking strength of a Kit Kat because yeah, you've, you've swayed me back the other way. Um, yeah, the one thing I fell in love with with Google ads, and I don't use the L word very often, the fact that it was, you got everything and it was so precise and you could do what you want. You literally, I want to target this keyword with this advert, send this page. I can see that all of it, I can get the conversion, blah, blah, blah, go on meta. And it's like, Oh, it's just like blob. Uh, yeah. Okay. So I'll, I'll, I'll create 20 ad variants to see which one resonates with some part of this audience that's just like a blob of lookalikes or they might like these page. Yeah. It's blobby. Not saying it doesn't work, but it doesn't feel like it just didn't feel like the same control level. So we're control freaks when I first got into AdWords. Um, and it was a, it's a great product. It's still a very good product because Google still has the search. A lot of people say, Oh, AI is replacing it. LLMs are replacing search. Fucking hell. We're not there yet. Um, just, you know, just chill out. Stop, stop. Let's not talk about AI again. So yeah, Google would destroy the, the cash cow. They'd destroy the product. The problem is they would, they would make more money in the short term because they could treat every, every thing like a broad and just, just spend a bit more of everyone's money, but that will burn people. Um, there will be people or who are already burnt by Google ads and won't ever come back. And I think that would just accelerate it. So to caveat what I said about match types going away, not being the end of the world potentially, the big, big caveat is that they get all of the targeting right. I, I can put my website in and Google really knows 100% what I'm doing and who the audience is. They can't be any fluff. They can't be any miss hits because you can't just stick a grand in or 10 grand in and a page and a topic and it miss a bit. It can't be like that. Cause keywords at least you can see it's my fault. I put those keywords in. I'm missing a, you know, I'm missing the target a bit here, pause them off or add some nags or at least I can see in the search term report. I'm missing because my assumption about this, this keyword is incorrect. And the search terms approving that to me. So I need to go and have a look. Um, which yeah, topics, if we didn't have that level of data would be self-destruct. Wouldn't it? So it truly self-destructed because the ad money isn't going to disappear. It's going to flow to meta and LinkedIn and all these other platforms. And it's not just the ad money that leaves Google out the door. It's the talent. It's, you know, the, the brand trust. It's the influence that Google is able to have on governments around the world. All of that dissipates if the business doesn't make all the billions that it does. And it'll lose the AI race. Cause if it'll, it'll start losing funding. Uh, and pure accuracy has a, has a, the use prime example of this, not to bring politics, politics in, but it's a big, pure, a cratic engine. Uh, and it's a prime example of getting in the way, slowing things down, burning money. And the outcomes not necessarily positive. And if Google gets too bureaucratic about these things and they're just thinking quarter to quarter and how do we simplify this and make more money? Cause everyone wants simple because then they can get on with their lives. It's like, well, not all of us want simple. We want, we don't want it to be convoluted, but there's a difference. Like complex and convoluted, not the same thing. Like complexity is not an issue. So long as it's useful complexity, if it's convoluted and crap, cause someone's designing a UI, it doesn't make fucking sense. Cause they never use the product. That's convoluted. Um, anyway, I feel like Google listened to our last video and they were like, we need to make these two look stupid. And then they went ahead and removed the, uh, negative cap for P max. Well, I think it's what you alluded to in, in private, well, someone reached out to you in that the product managers, product developers don't use the product because why, if you've ever managed to Google out to count, why would you set a negative keyword limit to a hundred? I mean, you could literally go into search term report on probably any account. And literally filter do one filter and have more than a hundred search terms that you're not quite happy with that you could negative. So yeah, it just, I just feel there, it is a disconnect there, isn't it? I just, but it's a massive, massive, massive organization. God knows how big the Google ads development team actually is. In fact, that'd be an interesting thing to ask Ginny because it might be smaller than we think, but in my head, it's like this department after department, after department and someone makes a decision up top. Um, and it sort of filters down and then people who actually use the tool, the product, get it and go, what was this? Gil, Gil mentioned it in his video. Um, it's the bureaucracy that, that holds them back. It's not the innovation or the quality of their people. Um, but just how big and broad and disconnected all the teams are. So you've got, you've got one team that's working on one part of Google ads. You have one team that's working on another part of Google ads. Those two teams don't talk to each other. They don't interact with each other except for their project managers or whoever's in charge of what keeping them on track. And that is, it's basically a company of silos. And everybody knows that when you build silos in an organization, there's disharmony and, uh, you know, a lack of cohesion, whatever you want to call it. And, and we feel that as marketers in how the product feels to use. Discombobulated, but yeah, a lack of cohesion is the right word, but discombobulated just sounds good. Um, I'll, I'll write that down. And I think it's an important note here, actually, whilst we're being serious, and we should definitely put this in if a Google developer or someone on the product team is that sees comments from me, you, the industry, they probably feel pretty bruised because this out there going, you know, I'm developing this thing. I'm doing my job. I think I'm doing a good job. And then I look at social media, I look at the appetite and they hate me, but it's not that and it isn't personal. It is very much pointed at Google, not everyone at their feet. I don't understand how you develop Google ads or meta ads or Reddit ads or any of the ad platforms in silos where one team focuses maybe on button color. I'm being extreme, but in fact, that's actually not an extreme example. If someone's focusing on the UI and then not actually getting involved in how the product works, they're just being given like wireframes or ideas. It's like, we need these buttons to do this. And that would explain why the UI is such a changing crock of because it's got it keeps getting worse. I didn't even know you could collapse the, the left hand column could be collapsed away out of view. Thank God. I didn't even know you could do that until recently. Like I saw someone do it and I'm like, Hey, I don't remember who it was, but there was a, uh, there's somebody on Twitter who shared, uh, that there were two document tabs, one on top of the other and they both led to different pages. You just have to wonder, like, would it not be better for everybody involved if there was some kind of central quality assurance, something like that? Right. Google has its own advertising department, its own marketing department. So alphabet, but Google will the YouTube team will another product lines. Surely are they not part of the conversation? They not like we use the product. We're internal. Uh, we get it and we feedback to the product team before they start pushing this out to the world. Um, and if they do, then maybe they're the ones we should complain about, uh, because they should know better. I don't know. The, the, the UI, constant UI changes is a bug bear in mind because it just feels like someone's justifying their job. It's like, Hey, look, I did a thing. So what you've hidden the frigging button and moved it somewhere else and you put something that was logical under a different menu and it, but why? Uh, for better or worse, the people who work on this, if you happen to be watching it, you are faceless amorphous entities in the either to us. Um, so yeah, Don't take that personally. Again, again, I'm trying really hard not to insult them, but it's coming off really badly. Um, it's leadership. I think, I think the leadership, those are where the decisions are made and it trickles down into a subpar user experience, but I've always held leadership responsible, not the individuals. Yeah. Shit should roll up the back up the hill, not down. So it's the boss's fault. Um, unless there is that one guy watching this video who works for Google and he sat there going, I did that and I'm doing it because I know it pisses you off. And it's not a fucking dude again. Yeah. If that, if it's this one dude or do debt, uh, then. Yeah, we don't like you, but, but otherwise, uh, legs topic equal, equal opportunity haters. That's us. Yes. Good. Very modern.
