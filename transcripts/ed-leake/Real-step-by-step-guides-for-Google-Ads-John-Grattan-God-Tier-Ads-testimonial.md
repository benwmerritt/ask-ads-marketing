Hey everyone, I'm John Gratton. I'm a freelancer in the digital marketing space and I mainly focus on local SEO, website design and development and I had some clients that wanted to do some Google ads which I didn't have too much experience with so I had to take a look around, find some courses and I found some videos on YouTube, got some paid courses and then I discovered God Tier ads and I realized that it was actually quite different from everything else because you weren't just sitting through endless video after video. There's real step-by-step guides, SOPs, campaign audits, you know all the stuff that you really need when it's time to get to work so I just wanted to let Ed know that this stuff is great. I really appreciate everything that he's doing and he actually had an upgrade for the overseas dashboard and that's a great tool because it really helps show you some trends that are going on with your campaign, try to debug some things that you don't necessarily see just by looking through Google ads itself and then when I saw that Ed offered the audit workshop I decided I got to go for this too and it's a great resource because it's not just a video tutorial, it's actually an over the shoulder walkthrough of Ed working on real campaigns and you get to go inside and realize what he's thinking, the decisions that he's making, why he's doing it, what's going on and that stuff is priceless. So I just wanted to make a quick video and let anybody know that if you're on the fence about it, it's definitely a good choice and I highly recommend it. Thanks.
