Hey, it's Ed. I recently joined Fred Valais and Julie Friedman Pacini on PPC Town Hall where we discussed responsive search ads in great detail for an hour. This is the highlights video in a somewhat narcissistic manner because essentially it's mainly me talking. But if you enjoy this, do check out the full length video. Link is in the description. There's a pretty big shift that's happening and we've got some great experts with us today to talk about what you would do for Ed and Julie. Welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. Thanks for having me. RSAs are going to create a few lazy account managers. Dare I say it? But that's opportunity for other people that aren't so lazy. This is to say that a new client comes to you and they haven't done RSAs. Like would you go and write entirely new ad units? So for yeah, so one of those 17.5% turned up, knocked on the door and said we don't have any RSAs. Take their best ETAs. Hopefully they've got a good years of years data and more than two ETAs and take the best components and create an RSA. If they're really good at ad copying, really smart, then be lazy because you could create an awesome RSA and get away with it for some time probably. Well, I mean, RSAs are definitely testing of ads as we have historically known it. It isn't just not going to exist anymore in the world of RSA, right? Yeah, but I agree with that. But the example of AB testing with 10 broads is that's a setup issue as well. And you know, don't get me wrong. A lot of people do it wrong and don't have a controlled test. But yeah, I agree. And people misread them. And as a result of that, you've got 10,000 queries driving two ads off the back of a dozen keywords. And then within seven days pick a winning ad. It wasn't really the winner. And as Julie said, it's not that straightforward anymore with RSAs, is it? But also to touch on what Julie said, we're going to lose that compounding benefit of doing proper AB tests. The trial and error of AB tests, you know, quite a strict stringent AB test routine over a period of time does give incremental value to an account. We're going to lose that. So I'm interested to see that compounding performance will go away potentially. Unless the machine learning is that good that this is all mute, then we just stick a load of ads in and walk away. And I guess there's a question like how good and dedicated are you? And then you can do better than the machine or is there a happy medium? Oh, I think as I think analytical people really struggle with ad copy and ad writing. And I think it's the single weakness of most PPC managers is the ad copy. So can they beat the machine? Probably not over the long run. So I'm defending Google now and the machine. So hold on, I've offended PPC managers and now, oh God, do not evil. I think in fact that is one of the angles that a PPC manager, particularly freelancers and small agencies can take is to team up with really good copywriters and admit that it's not less strength. And if you're going to fill stuff, you know, if you're going to fill an RSA make it worthwhile. But I'm going off on a tangent. Things that you might want to adopt, right? Because it's like, okay, well, Google is telling you this is where it's going. And we all know that you can't swim upstream against Google forever. Sorry, Fred, to interrupt. Did you do multi pinning versus single pinning? We did. Because I think that that would be interesting because yeah, I definitely see that pinning impacts the impression share, particularly top of page rate as well. Which again, you know, that's Google being, I'm not allowed to swear, am I? Googley, they're being Googley. It screws over found the word that didn't have an FC or being it screws over the people that can't. They have very strict brand guidelines that Julie was just talking about. Because we found a single pin is quite damaging to impression share, not necessary to performance metrics. It was four to five times as many impressions per ad going to the RSA ads. And it's not just that, Fred. We so I pulled end of last year, 17% increase in top of page rate for RSAs. So not only and CPCs were flat. So not only is Google biasing the impression share to an RSA, you're getting a higher ad rank essentially. So it really is rewarding RSAs more. That was last year. I haven't got the year before. I don't know if you saw the same. But to me, that's a good look at the top of page. But and but that's the promise of RSAs, right? As Google says, we can show a more relevant ad based on what we know for the auction. And then yes, naturally, you're going to have a higher ad rank. Because it's more relevant ads, so you're predicted CTRs higher. And we can see that in the stats where we look at CTRs of RSA versus ETA. But if you get five times the impressions, and you're controlling your bids in a smart way, like five times more impressions, 10% less conversion rate, well, that's still a hell of a lot more conversions at the end of the day than before. Especially if yeah, if your business has got fixed costs, definitely. I mean, it makes a lot of sense to scale incrementally and take those additional that additional volume. And there's a lot of businesses that are volume play, you know, insurance and finances and stuff. I think it hurts potentially, sort of small to mid tier retailers a bit more, because they might get more volume. But the ROAS tends to dip, doesn't it, in some of the conversion metrics of RSA, but then they got shopping. So I'm sure you're going to main thing for them anyway, right? Yeah. Look, Google is heading towards a or that the target is you give me a URL, you give me a budget, and you bugger off, and we do everything else for you. That's Google's end game. And is it five years away? Is it 10? Who knows? But it's understandable because it cuts out all the drift in the middle, any issues, you know, and performance max is a bit of a test of that ideology, isn't it? But you still have to create your ads. Exactly. And I'll do a soft list for a little promotion here about my book came out recently. So this is my second book. But what if you don't want to bugger off? What if you get to living at this, right? Julian Ed, you can't want to do better. Plus your clients expect you to be different. And I think it's about time, Fred, that PPC manages agencies freelancers became more business savvy. And people are going to hate me and I'm devised, if probably saying this, but there's your angle, there's your range. If you're, if you know that your clients or potential clients are struggling with this connection between Google and their data, that should be your foot in the door. That should be not the PPC, not the ads, because every man and his dog does ads and SEO and so on. But to actually connect those dots for them, you know, you'll be their best friend for life. Because then all you got to do is turn on performance max. If you enjoyed this, be sure to check out the full length video hour long. Link is in the description. Cheers.
