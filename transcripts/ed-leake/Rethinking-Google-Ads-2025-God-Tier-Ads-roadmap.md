We're not just nibbling at the sides, we're giving proper significant updates. In terms of content as well, there's gonna be a shift. The Last One Hey everyone, it's Ed. And this is Ashwin, Balakrishnan. I introduced you to Ashwin on another video, go and watch that if you'd like to know, but he's essentially head of marketing, head of ceremonies, fractional, whatever, you wanna call it for God tier ads now, and I'm glad to have him on board. This is a quick video about God tier ads. So if you're not a God tier ads customer, you don't have to watch it, you can do it, but it's about the updates and what we've got planned coming. And also the kind of content we're gonna put out on my YouTube channel for this year. I've been updating God tier ads for four years now, and I kinda did it on an ad hoc, monthly, sometimes weekly, sometimes daily, sometimes whenever, kind of schedule, which is not very professional. So Ashwin's kindly put an internal SOP together for us, and we're gonna be doing more, essentially large updates and then small updates, then perhaps urgent updates. So if Google changes something significant, we will do that as an urgent update, but we're gonna push things to bi-monthly or quarterly. We're not just nibbling at the sides, we're giving proper significant updates. Not to let the cat out of the bag, but we're probably going to reach out to some members in the community and the wider community to help us bring in their very specific expertise. Like someone who's really good at demand gen, because I'm not, if I'm gonna be completely honest, it's my blind spot. And I don't wanna put something together that I'm not super confident with. I'd rather bring someone in, introduce them to God Tier ads, pay them, however we deal with it, to help us along with the product to make sure it's the ultimate Google ads framework. We're free updates for life, which is still a significant and important thing that I want to keep. Updates Ashwin. We wanted to stay God Tier for the lifetime of your career in PPC, not just when you buy it. And so we're gonna be bringing an approach to God Tier updates that has worked for me in the past in my software focus roles. And so we're gonna treat God Tier a little bit like a software product. It's already built a feature request channel for anybody who's purchased God Tier. You can go in and you can ask for things and we'll take it under consideration. But we also wanna create a roadmap. And so what we've started doing is putting together, when do we wanna update certain parts of the God Tier framework? When do we wanna update the Lightning Page checklist? What needs to be in the product? What needs to be on YouTube for the wider community to access? A little bit more of a systematic approach. And I think that's gonna help with two things. It's gonna help all of you know when to look for updates so that you don't have to constantly keep coming back. And you'll also be assured that, yes, we're on top of these things. It will give us the time and the space to justify those updates being high quality, to make sure that we're getting the right people involved to plug the gaps that we don't have. You're not just getting free updates for life, but you're getting high quality, relevant free updates for life. So yes, it's super important that the updates are meaningful and not just me scrabbling around to do updates. Oh, and also, because Ashwin said it's gonna be more professional. So you'll probably hear about it as opposed to me just beavering away in the background and not telling anyone. And then you were not realizing there's been any updates. You haven't already bought God Tier ads, grab it today or put it on your list. There's gonna be a bunch of stuff in addition to the value that's already there that will only be available to people who have access to God Tier. In terms of content as well, there's gonna be a shift. So I'm narrowed my focus. I'm focusing back on God Tier ads because it needs it, it warrants it. I think people would appreciate it. And also I've been doing too many things. So more of a focus on God Tier ads. That means the content on YouTube is gonna be more Google ads oriented and supporting acts to Google ads as opposed to the agency stuff that's been going up. So that will change. We need to up the game a bit. I've got to stop being so camera shy and do some more YouTube videos. But from my perspective, I don't wanna be doing because I don't need to weekly content. So I'm gonna be doing bigger pieces, maybe monthly, bi-monthly, pick a bigger topic and do a specific piece. Bit like the P-Max video, which is a big 90 minute. Well, I'm not promising a full blown video like that, but maybe. But other things we want to do on the channel, like Ashwin said, bring in some expertise. And Ashwin in particular wants to do some interviews and I'll be there as well. People in the community, people you may not know, people you might know. And I think it's important that we bring people on board who are super smart, but you might not have heard of them because they're not shouting about it on LinkedIn like, I do. And it'd be really interesting to get loads of different angles. You may have even heard of some of these people, but some of the stories that we bring you will be things that you don't really hear about that often because it doesn't get a ton of likes on social media or it doesn't feed the algorithm. But there's stories that need to be told. And these are people who recognize that, yes, there is a beautiful upside to running an agency, to being a champion at Google Ads, but there is a cost to achieving that level. And so what we basically want to do is help you avoid the traps that people fall into with Google Ads and just make sure that you have the knowledge to adapt to whatever is coming over the next 12 months. So strategic content, some tactical content and some more human content, experiences shared content, not just mine all the time. One of the other things that we want to make sure is that you sign up to go to your ads or you download one of our resources, more value comes dripping through your inbox. It's not just that first thing that you've downloaded or purchased, but it's just, if you've bought God's Here ads, making sure that you are able to start it and find where everything is. If you've downloaded something, making sure that more stuff in similar areas gets surfaced in your inbox, just making sure those emails are really meaningful and show you that we're not just full of hot air. And we intend to deliver on our promise to make your job and your career better in 2025 and beyond. We're gonna reinvigorate the newsletter. When you hear newsletter, it's such a banal thing, isn't it? But it's called EdBytes. It's a monthly roundup of essentially the content that I shared. So you don't have to be glued to the subscription buttons and this and that, but we appreciate subscribers. We definitely appreciate likes. I don't know why you'd like this video. You can comment, we always like comments for the algorithm. But that email will be once a month. So if you download a freebie, essentially you'll get added to that as well. And the EdBytes will go out and it will just give you an update of what's been shared. So you don't miss anything. But as Ashwin said, there's a whole load of, if you download one freebie, I think there's another two or three freebies in the welcome sequence. So a load of freebies. And then we've got some more stuff we want to share. And if you've watched the AI video or the video we discussed AI and the implications to everyone's career, we've already touched on this, but essentially it's, we wanna help guide people through that as well. Go and watch that video. Leave us a comment who you agree with, either me or Ashwin on the AGI.
