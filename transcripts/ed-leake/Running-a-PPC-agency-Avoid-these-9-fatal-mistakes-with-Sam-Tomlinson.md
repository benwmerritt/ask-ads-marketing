If you spend as much time listening to Ed as I do, you know that the worst thing you can do in building your PPC agency is operating purely on vibes. Running your PPC agency without process, without methodologies, without contingencies and contingencies for your contingencies is asking for trouble. So if you're building up your PPC agency, you're starting to break out of just being a one person consultancy. And you want to avoid the mistakes that thousands of men and women have made before you, you're going to want to watch this interview start to finish. We got Sam Tomlinson, executive vice president of Warsaw ski, one of the most respected names when it comes to running a PPC agency, not just from the operational side, from the business and financial side as well. Sam's about to give you the blueprint that's going to help you take your agency from 10K to 30K to 100K and beyond without missing a beat. So strap it. I pulled up a couple of your tweets, Sam. So the one where you talked about passing the book. Oh yeah, that one pisses me off. Yeah. And the one that I really like is like when you talked about hiring and I tweeted and asked you a couple questions, you talked about like presenting a united front to the client, not having that lack of cohesion. What other stuff would you say like really throttles a service business? There's obviously like the operational shit, which I think every agency operates differently, right? Like, you know, how do you maximize the labor force? But I think from like a personal standpoint, a lot of it is how you approach teams and how you approach high and low performers tends to be a thing that a lot of people are uncomfortable with. Like I think a lot of agencies and like a lot of agency owners that I've talked with have always been like, well, you know, we hire somebody that don't quite work out. So we're going to try to figure it out. It's not going to work. Like, you know, you have high performers on your team. I think nothing kills a high performer faster than having to carry a low performer. That sounds mean, but it's not. It's just a reality. Like, I think I said something to this effect too. I think too many business owners have conflated employee performance with moral judgment. It's not that. You are a great person and you will be great someplace and you will and you can succeed. But not every player can play in every system. Not every player is the right fit for every coach or every team at every time. And that's okay. It doesn't mean you're a bad person. It doesn't mean that you as a manager are a terrible human or you suck as a manager. No, it just means that for the system that you are trying to run and the needs that you have, this person isn't giving you what you need and is hurting your top performers because they are having to carry that person. That's all. I think so many agency owners, like I was talking to one of the day and he was like, I don't know what I did wrong, like all this stuff. And I'm like, you didn't. You went through a process. You thought you made what you thought was an educated bet. But now there's two mistakes, right? Which I actually tweeted this this morning, who the unrelated to this, like there's two mistakes you can make. One is hiring the wrong person. The second is continuing to employ the wrong person. Which mistake is worse? Right? It's that and then I think the last piece that everybody forgets about is like, and something I have to work on too, right? Like, if you're the founder or like the executive or the person in charge, like you always want something done to a standard that is your standard. But to grow the business, you have to accept for a time a standard that is your standard minus something. You have to step back to allow people to step into the next role. And they will never be able to step into that next role if you do not step back first, you have to figure out your margin of comfort for, okay, my standard is the moon. Am I willing to accept the upper stratosphere? And if you're not, then you're never gonna grow, then just don't just don't hire people. Like just don't grow your business. Like it's cool. Like that then you what you have is a consultancy. Nothing wrong with it. But if you're going to scale any service business, it's always like, you have to accept a lower, you have to accept that that quality comes down a little bit. But you have to help people build themselves into, but it's like, you know, you have to kind of go down to go up again. And I think that's really hard because the temptation is always like, and I've had it is always like, Oh, great. Something's fucked. I got to step in, I got to do it right away. I got to jump in like, that's those are the learning experiences that you have to be willing to invest it to grow. Not forever. It's not for the faint of heart. I've lived that experience, both sides of it. And it's torturous. And I came up with a really simple method. I think I bought probably it's probably someone else's but I literally came out of habit really experience. And it's just a simple three strike rule. So if someone screws up, it's a verbal and making them aware that they've had a verbal warning. And I say verbal warning, it might, you know, might if they made a mistake, it's you warning them, but you also put an arm around the shoulder. The second time it's a formal warning, I am going to write you an email that says you've done this for a second time. And then and then then I'd say, look, this happened, this same thing happens for a third time. We're gonna have to go our separate ways. And I only had to use it once. And it was still really hard. It was really hard to fire that particular person for three strikes because they were a nice person. And I felt like the evil guy, the easy ones to fire, the people that were taking advantage, you felt like, well, they're easy to fire because they're not performing and also they're swanning about and clearly aggravating of a team members. Right. That you did, you raised that point. And that is so critical. And I think we forget this because a lot of us are remote working now. But if you've got an office, and I've never had this situation of remote working where it's been a problem. But if you've got an office full of people, or if you've got three people, and that's your full, if one of them is not pulling their weight or doing something that's upsetting the other two, it will damage their morale performance, longevity with your business because they want to get the hell out because essentially they're seeing the baseline and the baseline is that person not pulling their weight. And it's so detrimental. But it's so difficult to fire people. It's horrible. It is. It is. I think the way that I have managed to get over that to a certain degree is by saying, no matter what decision I make, somebody will be unhappy or hurt. There's two kinds of hurt, right? There's disappointment, and there's like regret. And then there's something that's like more malicious. You never want the second, right? No matter what you do, no matter how you do it, take that off the table, right? But okay, no matter what I do, somebody is going to be hurt. Okay, then my next question is, who should that be? That sounds like a horrible question to ask. But the thing is, if I leave the person in the role, if I do the easy thing, the people who get hurt are my top performers, the people who are doing the good work, because they are now being asked to carry, carry somebody else, they're being asked to take on more. They're being forced to deal with somebody like you said, Ed, who is unpleasant to deal with or doesn't work with them or gives them stress or anxiety, they will be hurt by me not doing the right thing for the business. So by not by choosing to take the easy way out on the employee, I'm choosing to make my employees do the hard thing. And that's not my... And in that scenario, you're also asking multiple people to be affected rather than one person. Yes. And I think that's the mental shift that you have to make is like, there's two sides to every coin, right? There's two ways you can look at everything. You can look at it like, I'm hiring this person, I'm getting rid of this person, that's terrible. Or I am doing right by the people who have consistently done right by me, aka my other employees, my other team, my clients. And I think when you flip that mentality and you're like, you know what, I'm going to make the hard choice now. I always come back to this quote, I don't even know who said it, but it's like, it's like seared in my brain for decades. Hard choices, easy life, easy choices, hard life. Yeah, that is very true. Right? Like, this is just one of those things, this is one of those moments where you could make the easy choice, which is let it slide, don't worry about it, don't rock the boat. And you're going to have a hard life because your team members are going to be upset, you're going to have to deal with Ed, you mentioned churn, you mentioned lower dissatisfaction, potentially inferior client work, potentially more headaches, potentially more of these conversations, potentially more sleepless nights, what you're worrying like, oh my god, is so and so going to actually do the thing. That's a hard life. Or you can make the hard choice, which is, Hey, this person just isn't a fit for me right now. And you'll have a much easier life because it's like, okay, great, all my top people are happy now. They're not stressed out because so and so is dropping the ball or not communicating with the client or not telling you what to do or not checking his or her ad accounts or dropping the ball all around the Facebook ad account or whatever, right? Like, you just pick your heart. For me, she was was always if you make the same mistake over and over, even if I try and teach someone or massage it out of them. Thank God, I don't have a HR department. We have one of those now. That's a whole thing. No massaging. So all slapping. No. But if even if you try that and it doesn't fix it, and then they still it's a recurrent thing, then that's where it's you got to be quick with it because I've had it with budget overspends, a particular employee many years ago, did it multiple times to clients. And it's just, I should have been quicker. I mean, to be honest with you, unless there's a really good excuse for a PBC agency, it should probably be a single strike. It's like, if you overspend a client's budget, you're out the door because I'm going to have to refund it. I had I actually have refunded a client for overspend before. Yeah, it was nearly 10 grand. And I, you know, I was a small, small agency, I've always been a small agency. And at the time, 10 grand is not something that I want to be refunding them. And they dragged me to their office over the coals to give me what for. So hard life. Yeah, give myself the hard life by not getting rid of that person soon. It's always a question, right? Like, it, I think there's, it's always understood. It's always a, especially with like ad overspends, right? We've had those, they do happen, unfortunately, I've refunded people, it sucks, you get over it. If what you said is like, it's multiple times, and that's a big problem, especially, and it's also knowing the client, right? Like, I've also had, you know, like, for instance, we have one client where we have actually overspend, but the client's like, we have this budget, but we also have other money, like over here in this little other line item. So if you can spend more, just do it up to this amount and call us. So like, yeah, they were like, Oh, hey, I exceeded the budget. I'm like, okay, but did you communicate? And you were like, of course, and they didn't say stop. So we just kept going. I was like, okay. And the client was like, yeah, we'll go with that. Like, okay, so you, proactively communicated with the client, you did the thing. And then we overspend the allocated budget, but we pulled from the, we'll call it like the special slush fund of marketing dollars that kind of gets sit over here for promos, specials, deals, etc. Right. They're like, yeah, okay, so, so this is not actually overspending. This is you being responsible and doing your job versus what I think we're talking about, which is like, Hey, I was just careless and asleep at the wheel and I let Google ads, you know, run up a 10k bill. Yeah, well, it was actually worse than that because that person then tried to make out to the client that that it wasn't wasted spend and the performance was there. But the worst thing was the change was on a Friday. And obviously, everyone got off home. I remember one of the changes because it's so painful. It was a single decimal place shift in the wrong direction on a Friday and then walk away to come in on a Monday. So instead of the 500, I think 500 pound budget, it was a five grand a day budget on on a campaign that would spend it. And yeah, it's and then to try and say sort of say to the client, well, we made you money. And it's like, we didn't know that and it's just don't, you know, only right, got a mistake. Yeah, I think that that's a nice segue into the other point that we mentioned like accountability, I think is the the rock of foundation of everything that we have to do in a service business, right? The end of the day. I mean, it's one of the first questions I like to ask in interviews when I do them, I try to avoid interviews these days, but tell me about a time when you royally screwed up. You can tell a lot about a person about how willing they are to take accountability by what kind of stories they tell you about that. Like, there are some people who do like the fake mistake. Yeah, I left the office lights on. Oh, yeah, basically, I'm like, okay, so you're not. Yeah, I care too much. I was so invested in this client that I worked nights and weekends and didn't tell my manager like, bro, miss the point, like this will not be a fit. I don't really care how old you are. Every one of us by the time we are 25 or so 2325, either you have lived such a sheltered life that you have never made a high stakes mistake, in which case I don't want you working for me. Or you aren't ready to admit that you had made some pretty significant mistakes because you haven't actually thought about them, in which case, when you make a mistake working for me, you won't miss you won't be willing to admit it either. So it's one of those questions that I think reveals a lot about a person if they're willing to sit down and be like, look, so I completely screwed this thing up. And here's what I did. And here's why it was bad. Like, okay, you know what, that's, that's accountability right there. Because I mean, you're actually willing to say, hey, I made a legitimate mistake. And it was a mistake, right? Like, that's the kind of, that's how you avoid, I think, the situations that you guys are talking about is like, you have somebody that's willing to step in there, like, yeah, I screwed up, I put the decimal place one to the right. Whoops. That's a really good point, because the whole premise of this show is how do you avoid the expensive mistakes in a PPC career, but you can't avoid all of them, like you're going to make a few every now and then you want people the ideas that they get less expensive with experience. So that's, I feel like my mistakes have gotten more expensive. Like, I feel like that's like you make fewer expensive mistakes as time goes by. I guess, I mean, you guys are from the other side of the pond to put like a Harry Potter quote, like I always feel like that Dumbledore quotes always right, where he's like, something about, I've always been clever than most people. So my mistakes have been commensurably larger. Yeah. I feel like that's how it kind of goes in PPC, right? Like, when you're in a more junior role, I think the mistakes feel bigger because you haven't had as many of them. But once you like are like running an agency, you're like, Oh man, I make a mistake and this is this, this goes bad real quick. Because people's livelihoods get affected. It's not just 100%. Yeah. Like, you know, before it's like, okay, you know, you're a PPC manager, cool. You know, you make a budget mistake, cool. Like what's the worst that happens? I mean, it makes it feels horrible. Your boss pays the bill. Right. Your boss pays the bill. Right. Like the worst situation that happens is your boss pays the bill, the client fires you. And maybe there's a bad post on LinkedIn. That is the local maxima of bad things. Okay. I mean, that's not good. Like don't do it. But stakes are limited, right? But then I think you go to like the agency owner side, right? Or like the agency manager side, and it's like, okay, or take a step in the middle, right? Like a team leader, like a PPC director, etc. You make a mistake. You screw up an SOP. Well, now it's not just one client that's affected, it's potentially dozens of clients that are affected. Your mistake is commensurately larger and the surface area of that impact is exponentially larger to the business, right? Even then, you know, go to like the agency owner and tailor holiday and Andrew Ferris said that that interview and tailor is going on about, well, I screwed up basically how I structured this buy out of other partners. And I had banks calling me on Christmas saying that I was in breach of my debt covenants. That's another level of fuck up. So, you know, you go from okay, one kind of an isolated impact at a lower level to a maybe a systematic impact at a higher level to an existential impact at the highest level. And obviously there's layers in between. So do I think that as you get older, your mistakes get less in frequency, I would hope. But I think they get worse in terms of potential severity, the higher you climb. You sound as cynical as me. But yeah, I guess that does make sense to a certain degree. If you especially if you climb to the point of being a director or business owner. Because then typically all the all rolls up. Well, yeah, it comes to you, doesn't it? The the shit rolls up the hill or it should do. You can't. I mean, at the end of the day, the bucks, you know, the bucks stop somewhere. And it's usually with the guy who's right paying the bills or the gal who's paying the bills because not trying to get canceled over that cancel me over something more interesting. I do that. While we're on the topic of passing the buck. So I know, Sam, another thing that perks you is this whole past the buck culture where, you know, you said it's like the single most destructive thing that you can allow us to build in your culture. Right. So like, let's talk about that as a mistake. What I mean, we talked a little bit about accountability, but what do you expect of your team when they make a mistake? Obviously you want them to own up to it. But what is the resolution typically look like at your team? I mean, there's there's kind of two rules that I like to live by. Or she probably three, I should say three, because there I think three is the better answer. The first one we kind of covered, which is don't make the same mistake twice. Life is too long and too interesting to be that fucking boring. So we'll assume that's table stakes, right? The second is the only way to solve a problem is to admit there is a problem and to acknowledge how we got here. A problem clearly articulated as a problem half solved. So if you are unwilling to take accountability and say, Hey, this is how we got here. And this is what the situation is, then we are, it's going to be exponentially harder for everybody else to solve the problem. Right. So you have to be willing to do that. And then the third thing is we don't deal in problems, we deal in solutions. What I don't want, like what generally speaking annoys the shit out of me is if you're like, Hey, this is a problem. Like, I call it the accountant mentality, and that's probably not fair to accountants. But if you've ever had an accountant, right, they're like, Hey, that's not right. I'm like, Okay, cool. How do I fix it? I don't know. But that's fucking wrong. Like, okay, well, I'm good at you. Like, bring me solutions. So that's what I expect of our team. I expect you to own up to the mistake. I expect you to be clear and honest and transparent in how we got here. Because again, it's never the crime that gets you. It's always the cover up. Like, have we learned nothing? Just be honest about how we got here so that I can we can manage the situation going forward. And then come with solutions. Like if the answer is, Hey, we overspent the budget because I was careless about a decimal point. Okay, so how are we going to fix this? Well, we can x y z, you know, this spend was actually more profitable. So what we can do is refund them half and then show them all the sales they got and connect it or maybe, you know, we can do something like that. Okay, that's one solution. Second solution, we can implement, you know, checks or make sure that, you know, whatever tech we're using is actually monitoring sending alerts if we essentially, you know, $500 to to $5,000 a day, basically, they did the whole monthly budget in three days. Like, okay, that's the case. Cool. Well, we should probably have a system to make sure that when that happened, if the if the spend goes, we should probably be on top of that and have a system in place, right? But I think the second you tell people, like, look, you are empowered, you are expected to come with solutions, not just problems. I think it creates more ownership for them on the situation. Because I mean, I think you probably been in the situation like as an agency owner, firefighters don't scale. No. Small agency owners. Well, I'm assuming because I've been one of them. And I think we're guilty of being the solution. So my problem was, I'm always right. So people knocked on my door to come and get the solution. So they'd bring me a problem. So they'd literally come in with a with a bucket of turds, and then dump it on my my carpet for me to mop up. And the problem is I didn't push back. And I sort of welcomed it. Because I guess I want to say I'm always right. It was it I was being flipped. I can't 100%. You have that mentality that you're the boss, you're the expert, you can fix it, you built this agency because you were the expert, and it's expanded beyond you now. But yes, bring it to my door, I'll help you guys. And that was relentless. And I think I built the wrong culture doing that. And when I reset the agency, seven years ago, I think it was 2017, when I say reset, I mean, I fired everyone. So they all hate me apart from one and change the way I operated. And he essentially became the head of operations. And he was the solutions guy. So it was the perfect fit in that. And it completely changed the agency, to be honest with you. Yes, I think we can be a victim of ourselves, we get in the way and it's very difficult. That's down to delegation and delegation is very difficult. And we all at the end of the day, if you are good at something, you've got the knowledge, the expertise, you like to share that, what most of us do. And so you just need to learn to step out of the way and shut up as well. It's like, don't give the chance. Yeah. Hey, really quick, if you're enjoying watching this interview as much as Ed and I enjoyed putting it together, just leave us a like and a subscribe. It's going to go a long way in making sure that we can keep bringing you awesome content. If there's anything you want to hear that you haven't got an answer to in this, leave us a comment and we'll see if we can get Sam in for a follow up like a lot of people who are watching this, I am at that stage where it's like, okay, I'm consulting, I'm doing well. And now I can take some of my earnings and earn a lot more by paying somebody. So right. So I've been working with freelancers, I've been working with white label people. Now I'm kind of thinking like, okay, I could bring somebody on full time and really ramp this up. Two questions. So the first one is you talked about like needing that mentality change to go from being like not getting hung up on the problem and focusing more on the solution. But when a business, particularly a PPC agency is working with really fine business and like financial margins, there's often a situation where it's so the problem is so big that you can't wrap your head around the solution because now you have to find 5k, 10k, 20k to offset this mistake that your employee has made. So on the business side, like, do you have any advice for people who are getting started? What should they do with their cash flow, with their cash reserves to have something to kind of like insulate them from this that will help them, you know, like change the way they approach it? Yeah, I mean, I would say there's a few things that are really helpful. And this is not financial advice. I'm not a yada yada yada all the bullshit disclosures that you should have to do in the US because we're a litigious sociopathic culture. Right. Number one is what I did. Okay, let me let I don't want to say first half to you, right? Let's start with this one here. What I did personally and what worked for me is number one, I have a physical piece of paper where I have written down exactly how and exactly when I invest and how I invest in what I do with my money. And the reason I think that's so important is because for me, writing it down made it real. And it was no longer this abstract thing in my head that I could rationalize my way in and out of at my convenience. It was something like, no, I can just pull out the piece of paper and I can look at it and be like, okay, am I doing this? And if the answer was no, then like, great, I just don't fucking do it. That's easy. Right. I created a system of accountability for myself knowing myself. The place where I saw a lot of people flipping up was always like, at the beginning, they were super tight and super frugal and all this other shit. And then the cash flow starts coming, right? Because then you get to this place in the agency business where, all right, like, I start to see the margins are going up and up and up because I'm doing a lot of the work, right? So that's good. And I've got a couple of employees who are doing the work and I'm like, okay, great. So now your cash flow is going like this, and you're like, okay, time to go buy that Porsche. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. Right. But that's look at agency culture online, like that sounds like an extreme thing, but it's not like you have like these random dudes on LinkedIn who have like six clients, and they've made their first 20k month and they're all onto the Porsche dealership. Like my service business is paying for my Porsche. Like, no, it's fucking not. You don't even have a service business. Right. But that's how you get yourself into traps. So what I did was number one, created rules for myself. Number two, I was very clear and intentional. And I still am about, okay, like, how do I make sure that I'm protected on the downside? So, you know, don't get over your skis kind of thing. Like, number one, always have like some kind of credit facility. Like you have to have something that you can lean on and trust. Like I've always used amEx. So that's what I've used because they, for many reasons, I'm very fortunate, yada, yada, yada. But I get amazing deals from my ex where they're like, Hey, you want to borrow 100 grand, it's $125 a month in interest. I'm like, Okay, I can live that because you run so much money through our stuff. Okay, like I can or whatever 120, I don't even know it's it's so nominal that it's ridiculous. But I mean, they're also doing all of this other business with us. So it's like, Okay, cool. Right. Like that was an easy one. Before that, local banks and credit unions often give really good like lines of credit for entrepreneurs. Use one of those. You don't don't draw on it unless you absolutely have to but you sleep easier knowing that you can do that. And then that the corollary to that for me was I then take all of the cash flow that I'm making and I can either reinvest it into the business or reinvest it into the market. Right? Like that's kind of the corollary to this where it's like, Okay, what I don't want to do or put myself in a position for is to be a forced seller for any of my investments. Because for sellers get fucked. So it's like, Okay, well, have a clear plan for how you're going to invest in for some people. They're probably not as aggressive as I am. But you know, they have like, Hey, I want to I want to index invest, I want to, you know, put money into bonds, I want to pay, I want to save my down payment for my house, like whatever, have a very clear plan what you're going to do with that cash flow, write it down. And then on the backside, so that you don't have to deviate from that plan, have a some kind of credit facility, a line of credit securities back loan, a personal line of credit, whatever that you can draw on in the event that you have to do a refund or in the event that somebody a client's late with payments. Because that way, you're never in a position where you're forcing yourself to compromise. And I think that's that compromises where I think people people wind up like, Oh, it's just an extra $100. It's just an extra 1000. It's just it's just it's I think you have to stay focused. And there's a couple of things I would add to that. Probably a bit more risk averse than you because I made sure I don't even know if I planned it, but I waited till I had six figures in the bank before I took on an office and employees, which is probably too slow. So I was probably too risk often and therefore slowed my growth. But then I'd always operate around about three months, at least cash flow, like a doomsday clock. And I afford to survive if we lost all our clients tomorrow, can I afford to live to my standard, which isn't very high, I'm quite frugal myself to be honest, but I have no debt or anything. So it's quite different to you. I'm sort of a debt free hippie. And can I pay the salaries and can I pay the rent and can I pay that the other thing that crept in and I only found this out after when I actually my accountant did something positive with software subscriptions soon rack up when you've got staff. Yeah, they do. And I think when I was a small agency, and I mean small, I think we're doing like 400 grand turnover. So in US dollars, 600 ish. And we were up to like four and a half, five grand a month in software. And I was just like, no, no, no, no, no. What is this? We're even using a href. So we're using some, you know, and so on. So there's that as well, it's just keeping like keep it looking after the pennies and it's after the pounds, the cents, look after the dollars and so on. That's really critical because you can lose sight of that once you've got three or four people on your team, you've got an office or maybe not in this day and age, but whatever and you're clients. The other thing, ask for money up front. Yes, works a treat. It does. And I've had a lot of people push back and say, well, the other guy I spoke to or the other company, they wanted to, you know, and it's like, well, okay, but you're talking to me or pay quarterly and give them a small discount. So I remember with a couple of decent sized clients, we offered 5%, which is bugger all, but if they pay up front, and these were retainers were like five to 10 grand a month, so they're juicy retainers. And so to them, they're like, well, yeah, I mean, we can afford to pay you for three months in advance. So we might as well shave that 5% off. Yeah, right. But for a small agency, it's like, oh, wow, just got that wedge up front. So there are, there are actually probably going to start billing me in advance three months now. So we'll scrup that bit out. I'm a good payer. But yeah, there are always around it. But in hindsight, I probably could have grown the agency quicker if I had been less prugal at the start, but then I made so many mistakes that I wasted so much money anyway. So it's kind of, that's why I reset it. No, I think we do the same thing as you my explanation for this to clients when when we do get the pushback is we bill all of our invoices are due right in advance of the month, right? So for the month of July, for the month of August, right, our invoices are due between one in 14 days, depending on the client and their billing cycle and all the other stuff before the start of the month so that, you know, we're not doing work before we've been paid is the idea. But the reason I tell them that I was like, okay, great. So if I go in there and you know, we do SEO work for you, we do PPC work for you, I go and I manage your ad account, I get you all these sales and you don't pay me. I can't go and untake those sales. I have no recourse because really what you're paying for is my knowledge and experience and expertise in managing your ad account. And once I've deployed that there is no, there's no reverting it. It's not a car that I can repo. And they were like, yeah, that makes sense. I'm like, okay, good. So now you understand. So different than a lawyer who's getting a retainer and the ask the lawyer why and it's like, well, because once I start working on your case and I tell you a legal strategy and I put together a brief, I can't untell you the legal strategy. I can't unwrite the brief and be refunded those time that those hours spent back. There's no recourse for me. I'm a service business. I've been stiffed by a couple of clients in the past and yeah, it's like it very quickly became one of my first rules. It's like, I'm going to bill you and it's different like with Ed and a couple of my other clients, I have that trust now. So it's like, okay, I can just keep doing the work. But at the beginning before we establish that trust in that relationship, you've got to earn that you earned that by paying on time and up front. Ed's 100%. Right. Like the best way to run a business is to be paid upfront in advance because then you are actually getting the cash flow that you need. And then the backside of that is obviously you have to manage that cash flow well. The downside of being paid in advance is that the delivery must follow in order for you to essentially earn that money. So if you put yourself in a position where great, I got the cash, but then I blew the cash, now I don't have the money to pay the people to do the stuff. Now you are in the problem place. Take the Porsche back. Yeah, go return the Porsche. I don't want to Porsche. I'll probably, actually, that's not true. I will definitely at one point in my life own a Porsche because I've always wanted one and I just want to be able to tell like 13 year old Sam, yeah, we got the Porsche. Work good. I'm never going to tell anyone what I own or what I buy because it's not their bloody business. 100% it's not. But you know, 13 year old me would be really proud of that. So I'm like, all right, you know, I'm not going to tell you what I had on my wall because it's they are now eye watering. But if I buy one, I'm not going to tell anyone. Is it a classic Jaguar? It's not a Jag. It's Aston Martin. One of the things you don't have to say. I don't. Well, I'll tell you what the other thing on my wall was it was David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson in their Baywatch outfits. And I don't really want to buy either of those now. So those have not those have not aged like French wine. Not not. Yeah, not sure my wife would agree if they both turned up either in a crate shipped from wherever. I'm looking for you now. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, come for the PPCs takes stay for the human trafficking. Yes. And probably get the billing wrong because you know, charging by the hour and stuff. That's another thing this industry we we because there isn't a set standard for finances and building and stuff. That's why it is all over the place. And that's why clients and prospects probably get confused because they like they want half what you want. You want it upfront. Yeah, it's it is. We've called it created a rob for our own back. And I think a lot of people are desperate for the money so they will lower the price and yeah, slacken the terms and it makes it makes it bad for the rest of us. But it is it is what it is course it seems. I mean, I feel like every like six months this debate pops up on either LinkedIn or X about you know, what's the right way to bill for PPC and anything but hourly. I feel like generally speaking. Yeah, that I mean, in fairness, you know, we bill hourly for some stuff, but like we bill hourly for stuff where we can control it more, or where the hourly is actually like, you know, let's me control my labor cost, which, you know, when you have 50 people, I have to like make sure that I'm actually balancing not retain. Correct. Well, I mean, some of our retainers are based off of a total number of hours. I will say that some are based on, you know, a set of deliverables, some are based on what I generally avoid is the percentage of ad spend. Yeah. But that has always been like a pet peeve of mine that I don't like. But when you charge hourly, you don't literally, you don't tell the client they've paid for x hours, do you so they come knocking for the remaining hour in the month? Oh, no, we do. I mean, whatever we agree to, we agree to and we'll fulfill whatever we agree to, right. What I've never liked about percentage of ad spend, which I think is like the predominant model is that the amount of work that I have to do does not always scale in proportion to the amount of spend. No, it very rarely does. And in general, it usually scales against the client's interest. Yes, as in, if I have a meta account that's spending 100,000 a month, and you increase it to 200,000 a month, the amount of work that I have to do has not doubled, it has increased. It probably has not doubled. It may have increased 25 or 30%, but it hasn't doubled. So you my fee shouldn't double. And conversely, if my incentive is to maintain your ad spend at a current level, that's different for me thinking like, okay, what's the best way to grow this business? Hey, I need client x to spend 100k this month, so we can collect our 15% $15,000 retainer. Well, maybe it's not in the client's best interest to spend 100k this month. Then if I actually make the recommendation in the client's best interest, I'm shooting myself on the foot in the short term, which I've never liked. Yeah, it's a conflict of interest. That's why we moved for e-con class, we moved to performance based, so essentially based off ROAS, which meant we couldn't build those in advance, which was my only drawback. But when it did come to billing them juicy numbers, there was never any pushback because they understood how it scaled. And once we got to a certain retainer, so 10 grand a month, which is significant for most businesses, and a small agency, 10 grand chunky, we literally ratcheted our performance feed down to 2.5%. It was 5% of ROAS, properly tracked as best we could. And also using a, we did it the right way, we used a attribution model that was fair, at the time we were using position based. But yeah, we'd ratcheted it down, so there wasn't the shock that there'd be another 10 grand on top of the existing 10 grand, it would ratchet down. So they would then outperform in terms of ROAS, and we would then start to look cheap because it's like you're going to a peak season and the spend might triple, quadruple, whatever it may be, but our fee nowhere near caught up. And but then I always liked a value based fixed fee. And a lot of people push back at this because there's no up, there's no scale. But if you're delivering value and you're, and you've marked it enough to be happy that you're getting covered for the work and making profit, then if you retain the client for many years like we did, it's perfectly reasonable to keep a fixed fee. It's like how much you need to get paid and do the work and have something left over. So if you need to do landing pages and all the tracking, bill it in, set a fee that covers that. And of course you can stipulate to the client, look, if something significant changes in the future, well adjust, it doesn't have to be set in stone. I think, you know, we've moved, we've done some engagements like that where it's like, look, we have what I have never, I've done this before and I've gotten screwed royally because I mean, we have econ clients, we have a lot of lead gen clients. So like I've done this performance based thing off of lead gen. And the one experience I have was a major law firm here in the United States. It was a performance based agreement based on the number of cases signed for a particular matter. And we went off and we generated a ton of leads for these people. Did everything they wanted, sent them the leads exactly to their intake team, yada, yada, yada. You know, we're thinking, okay, great, this is gonna be a good month because, you know, we're looking at the leads as they're coming in, these people are qualified, they need the criteria for the class, etc., etc., etc. And at the month comes the managing partner and I are talking, he's like, we can get a damn thing from all that marketing you did. I was like, come again? I was like, here's all the leads we sent. He's like, let me find out, calls the intake person, she comes in, she's like, oh, I didn't think those were real. So I didn't call any of them. I was like, what the fuck do you mean? Like, there's literally hundreds of these leads. Oh, for God's sake. She's like, why didn't they were real? So I didn't call them. So we didn't sign any of these cases. So your fee is now zero. Brilliant. And I was like, okay. I mean, a deal's a deal. I'm a man of my word. That is what we signed and that is what happened. And that was a very expensive lesson that I learned. The real kick, though, the real kick is I obviously, we obviously had a record of all these leads come in. This was a very public matter. It was a very, very, very significant class action lawsuit here in the United States. And as the cases were filed, right, what you could see were the names of all the plaintiffs as the as these these cases got filed. And sure enough, if you went down the list of the leads that we generated and the list of the plaintiffs that were represented by other lawyers, who boy was there a lot of overlap. So I was like, okay, so we generated the qualified leads because they were so qualified that other lawyers, not you sign them, vetted them, deposed them, found their stories to be true and credible, sufficient that they were willing to sign their name under penalty of perjury that this person was a vow was a legitimate member of the class. So yeah, my experience with value with a performance based has been mixed. Yeah, I think in ecom, it's easier to be honest, because it's a lot, it's a lot easier. There are still obviously nuances like in returns and stuff. But I think it's easier because to your point, there is pretty good tracking, you know, you can pretty much be like, Hey, this person came to Shopify, they came via this ad, they converted here, it's $100 purchase. Pretty straightforward. In lead gen, it is much more like, okay, great, so we got the right people in the door. But if your sales team drops the ball, if your ops team drops the ball, if that, you know, if you're working in senior living and the tour sucks, you know, all of these, my chain of control versus the levers on the decision, don't overlap to a point where I often feel comfortable. I never did it for lead gen. Yeah. Yeah. So that's where I'm like, all right, like, performance. Again, ecom, sure, SAS potentially. Yeah. You know, because again, like for some SAS, it's like, great, did they come to the website? Yes, did they sign up? Yes. Let's go. I mean, or do like a base fee plus a plus a kicker if you hit performance targets, sure. Those I can get behind. I don't know. I feel like we've everybody has this debate once every six months, and we all eventually agree that there's nothing perfect. And if there was a perfect billing model for PPC or paid search or paid social, we would have probably figured it out by now because there's enough smart people and enough money flowing through it that the incentive is there to get it right. But I do have a formula for it. But I'm not going to share it because I don't bore anyone. But it did it. Yes, there is a formula for value based bidding that I've used to great effect. But I will not bore you. Okay. So scenario is that I've hired a couple of people, things going well, I'm able to scale. I've followed all your advice so far. So I've got my little pocket of insurance. I've got my line of credit. I have my SOPs in place, all that stuff. Now, the next place that people fail is as they're starting to get bigger and they take on more business, biting off more than they chew. One piece of advice above all else from each of you for people to avoid that mistake. I could talk for a long time. You can talk. Go talk for a little bit. I've got a whole bloody video about it. Agency priorities. How to cock up. So you've got to be really selective. Once you get to a critical mass, which for most people is like 10 grand a month, whether they've got someone full time or 15 grand, whether they might have one or two people full time, then you're in this such a finely balanced situation where your next hire could really screw you over because if they drop the ball, there'll be a big chunk, big investment. So I would be essentially every couple of months, every three months, do my profit fix formula matrix and literally grade your clients on how much you like working with them. Are they profitable? Are they communicating positively, negatively, neutrally, but also do that for your team members. You might only have one team member and then you don't need to do it because they're either a fire or a rehire or keep them on. But do this thing where you are, say you've got 10 clients, I don't know, or eight, it doesn't matter. You need to find the worst one and find a way or two or three of hiring new clients, prospecting and finding more clients to replace those because they'll pay you better with less headache because the headaches are what drag the agency down and slow your momentum. But you don't want to lose the money. So it's like, okay, well, try and feed this engine. But don't be scared, essentially, of firing clients that aren't a good fit. Because they really slow the whole process down. Yeah, it's the same thing with team members, right? Clients are just the other side of the equation. Yeah. Right? It's the same thing. Yeah, I think that's right. I think the other thing that a lot of people that are just getting started in that position, what they're afraid to do is once they've gotten to add your critical mass, so to speak, of, hey, I've got eight or 10 or seven or however many clients, right, whatever. And they've gotten to this point where, okay, like I feel comfortable. There is a tendency, a very strong tendency to be like, okay, well, I've gotten here by charging one K2K, five K retainers. That's what I'm going to keep doing. But that's not how you get to the next level. How you get to the next level is by looking, and I kind of do the same thing you do, but I do it on the inbound side. I mean, most of what I do today is honestly, like, I obviously run the agency, right? But so much of my focus is on new business and it's on thought leadership, and it's on conference speaking engagements and doing all this other stuff, because I have a team that can actually execute and they're phenomenal at what they do. So I can just go sell and, you know, they can execute and they do a phenomenal job and I'll still get involved. But going back to my point, it's, I have a sheet. I literally keep it and it's in HubSpot now because HubSpot partners for tech explosions, right? And I look at our win rate. And the second our win rate on deals gets above a threshold, I raise prices. Okay. And I've done it for years. The second we get above a certain level, up go the prices. Because that's the only way if I'm winning too much, that means that I am underpricing the market. And if I underpriced the market on this on the sale, I'm either going to increase my churn when I have to raise the prices to market, or I'm going to basically be subsidizing a loss, which isn't sustainable at scale. So the only option is this is the market telling me that that we are underpriced relative to the value we provide, because as smart as I think I am some days, I recognize there are plenty of other smart and very capable and very talented agencies out there. And if I'm winning a disproportionate share, the only real reason why is because I'm underpricing the value that I'm creating. So then I have to increase my prices. Yeah, I like that. Just it's just a simple increment. It's just a tree. 100%. That's it. You've leveled up, you get to pick a new skill and your new skill is charging clients more money. 100%. And then you just rinse and repeat this. Right. So like, you know, you, you got you had $1,000 retainers amazing. Now we're up to 1500. Great. Then you get to the point where you feel comfortable and able and and you can deliver on that service promise. Amazing. Great. Now we go to 2500. Great. And you just keep going. But when you do this, then those paying clients that you mentioned that those become super obvious because you're like, wait, this is a 1k client. And they're a pain in my ass. Yeah, gotta hear. And now you don't have to feel bad about it because you're actually making more money to do better work for people who appreciate you more. Yeah, I think for a lot of agencies, this happens by osmosis because it did for me. I mean, I'm not my first retainer was 195 pounds, which was about $300 back in the day, which is ridiculous. And we had then we ended up doing 10 figures a month, you know, mid mid right, all figures on average. So yeah, I think it maybe I just looked into it, but it does happen by osmosis, but having an actual plan and a mechanism in place makes more sense. And then when you get to like 25k a month, I'd be or 30k, I'd be trying to find your ops person, that one person that you could literally give the business, and they will run it as well as you, and better in parts, because you're stripping away the lead gen and the sales, which now becomes your job. And then all of a sudden, you've got the confidence that the business is sustainable because you're out there selling, they're doing the operations. They're doing the operations. Yeah, I think that's, I think that's right. The other lesson that I would say, Ashwin, the thing that I when I was getting started in this business, the very first conference I ever went to was HeroComp. And Dan Golden, he and I were just shooting this shit. And he was like, you know, you're like this, I'm just like this bright eyed kid, just happy to be here. I'm like 25 years old. And he he was like this veteran agency owner, he had just exited. And he and I were just like talking and he goes, I'm going to tell you something that you're going to tell me right now that I'm full of shit. And in 10 years, you're going to look back at this and say that I was right all along. I'm like, all right, what's up, old man. And he goes, I'm going to tell you the rule of one in three. And it's always true. And you never believe it's true until you're there. He's like, so basically anytime you go from a number that starts with a one to a number that's a three, everything breaks and you have to reinvent how you do things. So when I went from one person to three people, everything broke, because I had to figure out how to delegate and how to do ops and how to how to hire and all this. Then when I went from three to 10 people, everything broke again, because now it wasn't just me and two people that I knew now it was an actual team. And I had people who were overseeing other people and I wasn't directly in control. Then I went from 10 to 30 and I had to start building these big systems and taking on more clients and everything broke again. And then I went from 30 to 100 and everything fucking broke because now I had middle management and I had an HR team and I had a finance team. And instead of me being the guy who I knew every person, people were getting hired and I wasn't even aware they would walk into the door and I'd like, fucker you. And they were like, I work here now. And he's like, I have no idea because we have 100 people like, I can't be involved in every hiring decision because there's 100 people and there's 300 clients and there's a finance team and there's an HR team and they're doing these jobs. But it's all broken. Everything to get from 30 to 100 people just broke every part of it. He's like, then went from 100 to 300 and the same thing happened. He's like, so if you go into it with that mentality that every time I go from a one to a three, everything will break and I will need to reinvent how I do myself, how and what my role is. It will feel much more like a scavenger hunt and less like a surprise party. Yeah, I love that. And it I mean, it even works the pricing, doesn't it? If you're charging 1000 a month and you go to three, it breaks it. Correct. You can have you can have to deliver more or change up what you're delivering 100%. But one to three, yes, I remember that and three to 10, I only ever got to 15 and they nearly killed me and yeah, went back down to five. But yes, I remember three being really tricky, but I'd never properly I'd managed people before, but not that and run a business. Yeah, it's just different. It's so different. It's like, we're in the middle of this 30 to 100 because we're at 50 right now. And I'm starting to see it happen again. And I'm like, God damn it. Dan Gold was right again. You say this and I'm imagining like I was I've been at teams where I was part of the group that was going like when I joined Optimize, I think I was like the 32nd higher. And then it was literally around the 50 mark that everything started to break. But it had already broken when I joined. And then as we got to 100, I remember, you know, I'd have my one on ones with Fred and he'd be like, Oh, who was that other person on the call? Like I didn't even know we hired someone for that role. I was like, Yeah, well, we brought them in last week. And it was, it's true. Like the people at the top don't know everything that's happening. And that disconnect rose. So like I can only imagine what they were going through. If I'm sitting here as a senior employee going, what's going on? Yeah, I mean, it's true. It's just it's the natural part of growth is that you don't scale exponentially, but your business can. So you just have to, I mean, the other thing that I've always tried to put instill in myself and like I've tried and occasionally I fabbled at it, but I think I've done a good job on balance is you know, one of the first when I worked in finance, one of the first billionaires I worked for. Dude was self made billionaire, like literally started by buying row houses while he was in college and built himself into a billionaire. Amazing guy. He looked at me and he was like, there's two ways you can evolve in this life. He's like, way number one is you can let evolution happen to you and way number two is you can make evolution happen to you. He's like, and I've always chosen the latter. And for me, and for you, what that means is every two to four years, you need to put yourself out of a job. He's like, and let me explain how I did this. He's like, you know, I started in college. I was 20 years old. My first job was painting these houses for a rich guy. In two years, I learned everything that he had to teach me. And then by the time I was a senior, I was buying these houses. I put myself out of a painting job so I could have an owning job. And then he's like, once I got good at that, then I started buying apartment buildings. I put myself out of a single family job and into a multifamily job. And then once I had gotten good at the multifamily, I started to put those into, you know, my management company. And then I started to look at development deals. I put myself out of an apartment owning job and into a building apartments job. He's like, and this is what I have done every two to four years since the day I turned 20. Wow. And at each, each time he did that, he elevated the risk significantly. And it could all come crashing down not 100% of breaks. It all could. But he was like, I, my choice was either let evolution happen, or I can make evolution happen. And I think that's true in the agency business too, right? Like if you get too stuck in that role, okay, I'm just a PPC manager, I'm just in Google ads. Well, when Google ads evolves, and it will evolve, evolution will happen to you in an unpleasant way. But the solution to that is not to not do Google ads. It's to say, okay, great. What other skills can I teach myself? So that when this evolution happens, clients will still come to me and say, Hey, Sam, you have a lot of knowledge about X and Y and Z. You're still valuable. In fact, you're more valuable to me now. Right. And then once I've gotten those skills, then how do I scale that up? Right? How do I build the agency? Right. And once I built the agency, how do I scale the agency from a smaller shop to a bigger shop? Right. How do I continue to put myself out of a job? So that number one, I create space for those other people to, to grow and to learn, right? Like I took myself out of managing accounts day to day. So that our now vice president of digital, she could step into that role and she has and she has grown tremendously. But the only way that was possible is because I willingly put myself out of a job and said, I'm no longer going to run this team. You are going to run this team. I am not going to come to the meetings. You are going to come to the meeting and you are going to run those meetings and you are going to own those meetings. And you were going to be accountable for those meetings. And if you need me, I'm always here, but I need to put myself out of a job in this particular context so I can go build myself a more potentially exciting and lucrative job running and building an agency. And I can't do that if I'm working in the business. It's just terrifying. You don't have to scale, of course. No, you don't have to scale, but I think you have to, you have to put yourself out of a job in some way, shape or form. Yeah, I think if it's, I think if people are happy that freelancing and consulting, I think if you, if you want to run a business in an agency, you should at least try go from one to three and see how it feels. You might hate it and then you can just be done. But I think even if you are, you say, I am very happy just freelancing and consulting, this advice is still true because what you should then be thinking about is instead of how do I scale my business, you should be thinking, how do I increase my expertise and my value to my clients? Right. You got a future proof everything at some point. Right. You're basically, you're basically saying, okay, great, I'm amazing at Google ads and I really truly enjoy this. And I still love playing Google ads accounts. Yeah. But I'm still thinking like, okay, great, like what can I learn about customer experience? What can I learn about SEO? What can I learn about LinkedIn ads? What can I learn about Reddit ads to make myself a more well rounded marketer, to make myself a more valuable resource to my clients? And in some ways, that's putting myself out of a job because I'm saying, Hey, I'm not just going to do Google ads, I'm going to do other stuff. At the very least, you gain an understanding of how these other things work. And so you're able to collaborate with these other people who do those things as specialists in a much more effective way. Correct. I think you're basically just saying like, Hey, I need to make a commitment to myself first and foremost that I'm going to continue to push and grow my skill set even once I've reached a place where I'm comfortable and especially once I've reached a place where I'm comfortable. Because when you do that, the person who continues to learn and pushes themselves to grow is the person who becomes more and more valuable over time. And the person who gets comfortable and complacent is the person who is still running Google ads like it's 2015. And then wondering whether getting their teeth kicked in by somebody smarter, like one of you. And I think that's sort of a final note. The I think there's a tell as well, if you've got that an entrepreneurial bite is that if you become comfortable, you feel uncomfortable being comfortable. You have a nagging thing that I should be doing something. You always feel like something. Yeah. Yeah. And not everyone has that. And it's not a judgment on anyone because quite frankly, I wouldn't wish my first 10 years on my worst enemy, I don't even have a worst enemy, I've got too many. My first 10 years were horrendous. And I wouldn't, you know, I put myself through it, but I can I understand completely why it's not for everyone. And if you're doing well, consulting all power to you, you don't have to rely on it. Quite frankly, or in house, if you're in house and doing what you want to do. But do think, as Sam said, how, why would my boss replace me in six or 12 months? Why? And then, okay, how do I build an armor around that? Because if he or she wants to replace me, and I get another job, they might want to replace me because of that too.
