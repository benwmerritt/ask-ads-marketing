A lot of people out there like introverted people because they're not shouty, salesy, pushy. For everyone that responds to someone shouting to spend money with them, there's someone pushing back who would much rather talk to someone like you who's a bit more reserved. The route to the fastest results is getting someone on the phone call with you, which means sometimes you have to not get a foot in the door, you sort of have to kick the door down, which on LinkedIn is a message, here's my offer, can we talk about it? The reason why cold messages and cold emails have got such a bad rap and bad name is because people spam them out. But if you pick only companies that actually you could work with and you give them a very specific message that's appropriate to them, your odds are massively increased and the odds that they're annoyed with you are massively reduced because it's for them. Well, I go to spam, we all do, and you read it and go, why am I getting this? What is this crap? But if something's actually for you, I mean, I do get spam emails where I read it and go, oh, I could, yeah, I could kind of be, that's kind of interesting because it's something I've got a problem with. But most of them are not. Now imagine if all the bloody emails that weren't just pure spam, they were actually very tailored and specific. I'd have a problem because I'd be like, oh, actually, that's for me. The worst thing is spamming relevant emails. It's like, you kind of hate the guy, but he also wants to know more. Yes. Which is the right way to cold email. People that do that typically do manually or it appears that they manually vet you, which is the way you should do it. I don't know why people send 1000 emails out and hope that one will hit when they could just do a little bit of research and send 20 and five of them will probably hit, which is the same as LinkedIn. So yeah, it'll work. If you've got a deal, I think your offer's decent. I think if you do what you say you're going to do, you will start to get some traction. But the fastest way... I think really, I try not to do too much from the beginning because I just get overwhelmed that I also have my operations to take care of. So I try to just say to myself, okay, what do you need is just to be more active on LinkedIn posts one, two times a week. And then you can sort of, it's easier to up my games from there. And I've been an entrepreneur for quite a few years, but I never really had big success. And I know a lot of people that are new from the early years that has great success now. They have companies that have revenues of like 20, 30 million US dollars, which is a lot. And then for many years, I've kind of done the ostrich thing, just walking, ducking my head, not communicating that much. And then I was thinking I would be more sort of outgoing and networking more once I got success. And now I realize it's the other way around. So it's kind of a way of creating a new persona for me. A persona I can also go with in the sales calls. A lot of people out there like introverted people because they're not shouty, salesy, pushy. For everyone that responds to someone shouting that and to spend money with them, there's someone pushing back who would much rather talk to someone like you is a bit more reserved. And yeah, I know it is a confidence builder. So you don't have to feel like you should always be yourself is what I'm saying. Don't feel like you have to do anything that puts you out your comfort zone, because there will be people out there that like your approach if it's a bit more softly, softly, or you know, quietly. But again, if you're talking to an audience that needs your thing and your things half decent, it's, it's only a matter of time. The problem is when everyone talks to everyone, you know, Sam put a video up about what was it a solar panel case study on YouTube, you got a lead from it in a week. Why? Because it's a very specific thing. I'm not interested in a solar panel case study, but I haven't got a solar panel business. Create your list. Create a list of who these are. 50 people, 100 businesses, whatever, keep keep a sheet. Like who's my contact there? What do I need? How do I need to get in touch with them? Is he or she on LinkedIn? Yes or no? If they're not, where are they? They might not even be on social media. Okay, well, I need to send them a letter. Like literally my offer in it. Simple, like literally posting something. Because if they're not on social media, they might not be, which is per, you know, it happens a lot, particularly in these more traditional businesses. So again, don't get hooked upon the, the, the medium. Like if LinkedIn doesn't work, don't worry, you don't have to start doing videos on YouTube, just go literally create a list and find where these people are. How do I contact them? Because by the time you've done 10, 20, 30 of them, you'll know if your offer's good. And that can happen in a week.
