Hello, I'm Ed Leak your time's precious. So that's the intro done I'm going to start off by talking about a couple of common scenarios and questions Just get the fundamentals out of the way about using smart bidding on new accounts and campaigns Because these questions come up regularly in my private group and then I'll walk you through the step-by-step Framework the flow charts. So a question I often get asked is can you use smart bidding on a brand new account? So it's never been run before and honestly, there's no right or wrong answer to this It can there's too many variables essentially. So if anyone tells you there's a definite definitive way On the type of bidding you should use on a brand new account They're lying I've seen managed worked on ordered to hundreds if not thousands of counts over the past 12 years I know smart bidding something around that long The fact is there are so many variables every website every brand every product service is there are nuances. They're all different So it's a trial and error situation I've seen accounts tank in performance going straight for smart bidding I've seen some accounts work perfectly fine manual biddings the safe bet We know this so you can set a limit to your bid and you can ease into those impressions and just test the water So you're dipping a toe with manual bids hopefully to get some conversions there is a tell that smart bidding might work from the off and that's a established website Company brand whatever we want to call it that already has direct and organic traffic converting So if you can look back over the past three six months and you see that the organic traffic is converting at say 3% Then it's normally a good sign that smart bidding might be okay out of the box But again, it comes down to keyword selection and targeting ad copy landing pages way send people and all the bits in between So if you do that job well, then you put the odds in your favor for it to work obviously Because target CPA really is quite simple It's a case of if you're hitting your budget limits, then you can lower it to get more Incremental conversions in that budget. So if your budgets up here, you keep hitting the roof drop you TCPA and on the opposite side if your Cost conversions are too high and you're not even able to spend the budget then it's more of a diagnosis Situation to understand why which is why I created the framework now target row ads is even more particular because it needs revenue data needs that Monetary data coming into the account so rise is even more finicky In fact, I wouldn't start on target rise very rarely on target rise target CPA maybe max conversions Some people say well start on that The thing you need to understand that max conversions is your budget is essentially your cap on your bid So if you set a $10 a day budget, that's your cap Theoretical cap Google won't always bid up to $10 But it can so if you set your budget to a hundred or a thousand dollars a day You are lifting your maximum bid considerably and it's a surefire way particularly with a large campaign to burn through the budget very very quickly Max clicks is similar And you could argue well You can add a cap to it, but a cap is a target CPA or target row ads So therefore they are no longer maximize conversions or maximize clicks they are essentially a Smart bidding to a row as or a cost conversion target However smart bidding on a brand new campaign in an existing account is Okay, if that account has data conversion data then and you say it's all manual So you've been running an account for three months six months six years Whatever on pure manual bits and you decide to run target CPA on a campaign Well, the smart bidding will use the conversion data the metrics the hidden layer In Google's black box behind the scenes from the account to Help bring your target CPA up to speed and that's true of target rows as well So it will use the entire accounts data so it can work in that respect and finally a Question that comes up is well, we've only got ten conversions a month. We've got a very small number of conversions we're on manual bidding or on max conversions or whatever and Can we move to target CPA or target rise the answer is? Maybe So it's a test you have to test these things and no one can tell you specifically what to do But target CPA will typically work it used to require a lot more data It's got a lot better Google's improved over time So you can now jump into top target CPA a lot quicker than you did before so ten conversions across the account might be enough It might be sufficient Target or as I'd still say you want 30 40 maybe 50 you need more data for target rise to be Reliable and consistent whereas target CPA Is a lot more Elastic is probably the word. I mean you can set a target CPA of 50 and have a budget of 25 a day Which doesn't sound logical. It's like well my target CPA is higher than my daily budget But it might actually work and I've seen it work like that So those are the sort of Q&As out the way and let's now jump into the framework Which is the interesting bit and the bit that you probably came for not me rattling on
