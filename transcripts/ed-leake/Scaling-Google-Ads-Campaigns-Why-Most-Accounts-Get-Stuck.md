Hey, I'm Ed. So if you've ever had trouble scaling Google ads, then it's probably one of these things. And have you ever asked yourself, why, when I spend more on a converting keyword, does performance drop? Or do I not get more conversions? It was converting before. Why, when I find converting search terms and I add them as positive keywords, do they not perform anymore? They don't convert. Or they might convert, but the cost conversions sky high. And then puts you in a position where if your client or your boss asks you for forecasts, then you sit there going, what the f**k am I meant to do? Well, let's work through that and to these things. So I've never seen people visualize the auction like this. So I'm going to try and explain it through some beautiful visuals that I put together myself. So the situation of spending more. Let's consider smart bidding. So you've set a target row out or a CPA or perhaps you're using max conversions, whatever it may be. When we're looking at an account, particularly over a period of time, what we see is the smoothed average cost conversion. But when in reality, if you look at individual conversion costs, they are up, down zigzagging all over the place. And a lot of people forget about this. And this is where some of the problems starts. This zigzagging is a product of the search market. So how many people are out there physically looking for the thing that you're advertising? And of course, your competitors, how they impact the auction, neither of which you can really control. And this is part one of the problem. That's why sometimes bidding more doesn't have the impact or spending more doesn't have the impact that you desire. And that's why things are very chaotic. You might even have situations where you up the bid and budget and you don't get more impressions or you get more clicks, but you don't get the conversions coming through. And you sat there going, well, why? I've literally doubled my budget and my impressions have done nothing. That's because the auction isn't linear. So as you can see, with my beautiful visual, there essentially is a sweet spot, which is a moving target, just to make things harder. And this moving target is dramatically different depending on the market. If you're operating in a local area, so you're doing plumbing services, advertising, typically, the target is less dynamic, should we say, and the auction remains quite stable. However, for wider markets, I mean, if we think of something rather large, like finance, then the auction is and can be very volatile. And particularly in the mid to larger markets, the auction is not linear. None of this is linear. This is the thing you've got to remember. So when you bump your budget 10%, you're getting 100 conversions before you're expecting 10 more doesn't always work that way. Unless you're in the sweet spot or the lower easy street of the auction. So essentially, you are nibbling around the lower regions of impressions and therefore cost. Now, why why is the cost lower down there? Well, it's because the bid engine can be selective. So if there's a million impressions, and you only need 10,000 to hit your target, your target being your budget divided by conversions, so your CPA, or your ROAS target, or your maximize conversion target based on your budget. So if you can only spend 100 pound a day or dollars, whatever, it doesn't matter. And that only grants you about 10,000 impressions. Then you're a percent of the auction, essentially, which means that Google can be very selective with their automated bidding, and it can drop you in and out, and essentially cherry pick for you. I guess what I'm trying to say is, when you're at the bottom 20% of the market in terms of impressions available, it's very, very easy to have success in advertising. And it is at the top 20%. It's much harder because there is no cherry picking. You are literally when you're at the maximum of the available impressions, the maximum of the available market, you are literally saying to Google, through the bidding system, I want to be there every single time doesn't matter if it's inefficient, or if that person's not right for me. And this is where you can find that inflection point for many accounts where you might want 100% impression share, you might have the budget for it, but you start to get over the 70%, 80%, 90% impression share range, and your cost conversion goes through the roof, or your ROAS just tanks. And there might be a couple more conversions up there, but they simply aren't efficient, they simply aren't worth the spend. And that's your big advertiser where volume is the concern. And it's an aggressive approach, but most advertisers are able to literally pay whatever for a conversion. Again, we're dealing with a very chaotic thing, human beings for a start who do whatever they like. And I've tried to visualize that here and explain it to you. And I hope this does help. Just remember, things are not linear. And you will find a sweet spot somewhere in the middle. And as soon as you start encroaching on the higher volumes, that's where spend can go up. It's not true of every single market. There are some markets that do in industries and niches that do respond a lot better than others to simply bumping the budget. Hey, how are you? Hope you enjoyed the video. I'm just going to ask you straight up, can you just click the like button for me? I'd appreciate it. Thanks. Bye. Now, how do you fix this? So what do you need to do to be able to get past the sweet spot and spend more or get more conversions? Well, from Google's perspective, they won't click through right. It's as simple as that. And it's never going to change. Because at the end of the day, if they put an advert in front of someone, they want the click because that's how they make the money. So all this fancy stuff about your ad rank, your quality score, your audiences, all this other good stuff, it comes down to click through rate. It's business sense for Google. So increasing click through rate is better ad copy. But you know that already, which will show favorability in the auction. Negative keyword management simply cannot be skipped. Even with today's automations, it's non optional negatives, negatives, negatives. The harder way, of course, is to improve or increase your conversion rate. But that's rarely done inside a Google ads account. Your website's job is to convert people. So that's another way, an incremental gain in conversion rate. Whilst I was editing the video, I completely forgot that I actually have a free tool for you. So it'll scrape the search results for a specific keyword, any city, town, zip code, if you want to put a country in, whatever. And then it'll output that to a sheet for you with the 12 factors that in my opinion, you can use to leverage your click through rate and your ad rank. And in addition, there is free training on the back of this. And it's probably the best 25 minutes training that you will find for free. It's something that I've never seen people talk about. And it's super valuable. So grab that as well. And hopefully you'll thank me later. So what about that second question where you have search terms that are converting and then you add them, and they no longer convert, or they simply don't convert as well, I they spend more money, but the cost conversion goes up because the conversion volume isn't there. This is what I call the broad match paradox. Just give it a name. AKA, why are my broad match keywords outperforming my exact match keywords? Ed, people like you for years have said exact match keywords are the way to go. Yes, that's true. But go back and watch the start of the video auction. Anyway, broad match paradox. So what's happening here, particularly with smart bidding is that Google has way more data, way more data points in the auction in the bidding, which is why it's better than manual bidding. And manual bidding is dying at F. And we have to trust that this machine learning this automation is amazing and does the job for us. But this is actually a glimpse into it, doing its job. So you've got your exact matches, your phrases and your broads, this is more typical behavior of a broad. And you see all these search terms come in and some of them converting and you're thinking, brilliant, I will shift that to a exact match keyword in its own ad group, perhaps the same ad group itself. And it doesn't work or it doesn't work as well, or the cost per click, that average CPC is way higher. This is the automation dipping you in to the auction at the right moment. Google has got all the data, they say, this person is more likely to convert against that search term at this moment in time. But the next person to search that might not convert and the person after that. And the problem is this 10,000 people behind them. And we know that there's 17 right now, again, you know, against these data points that are going to convert. I'm being explicit. It doesn't work like that. But I'm being explicit, for example. However, you completely ruin that when you add the keyword, ironically, as a target, because you say, no, no, no, I want to target the keyword, regardless. And this is why I have been favorable towards broad match, teamed with smart bidding, so target row as in CPI typically, for a few years now, I've done other videos on it, because it works because it uses the data that we don't have, it uses the signals that we don't have access to, to essentially cherry pick. So it even in a busy auction, where you might be halfway to the top, two thirds of the way to the top, it's doing the cherry picking actions for you, which is really important to remember, because you can't really do them on your own. I mean, crikey, yeah, you could stop layering audiences and doing some fancy shit. But quite frankly, are you really going to beat the machine? I don't think you are. So that's the broad match paradox. That's why these things happen. And you might be sat there going, well, okay, but I do want to target that keyword. Well, it comes full circle to how to fix things is, well, if you can't afford to pay, then you need to reduce the cost, which means you can afford to pay more for more clicks, if they have a propensity to not convert as frequently. And you can only do that with an higher click through rate, a higher converting landing page and negative keywords and also potential optimizations like location bidding, segmenting by locations, devices, audiences, and so on. But it's not an option for everyone because again, if your market's not sufficiently big enough, all you're going to do is limit the data in the account by over segmenting, which would then hinder the smart bidding and you're in a catch 22. So I think the key takeaway is here are understanding why things happen. You know, what's going on in the background that you perhaps haven't thought about or hadn't considered or didn't even realize. And don't assume because Google is giving you with this impressions number, this reference number, oh, there's a million people available for you that you can a, get in front of them all and be do it at a cost conversion that suits your business or your client's business. And secondly, understanding how broads work now and have been working with smart bidding and can and using them together, which is very simple to do to maximize the cherry picking. It's caveat time. I don't want you to misconstrue what I'm saying here. In no way am I saying you should stop using exact match keywords exact match terms that convert will typically outperform their broad counterpart. And the same goes for phrase. The issue of exacts is that you are limited by impressions. So for a lot of people, this can become a problem. Now, if you've got a tiny account, then you can live quite happily on exact match and manual bidding alone. Now what constitutes a tiny account? Well, rule of thumb for me is less than one case spend a month or 10 to 20 conversions at most a month. That's a tiny account. You might find small accounts spending say a few grand a month can live on exacts to, but typically they will start to see restrictions in the volume. So if you need more volume, then this is where you have to start leaning on the broads. And this is where the broad and smart bidding gives flexibility in the form of the cherry picking and that additional volume. So I just wanted to clear that up. And then finally, hopefully this video will give you some more context around explaining why forecasting is a false errand to your clients or to your boss. Can we do it? Yeah, of course we can. But we simply cannot second guess how a budget or a bid increase will impact essentially our impression share, how we fare in the auction. And this all goes out the window if impressions drop as well, because essentially it makes things more competitive, i.e less people looking, supply and demand. And if a new competitor turns up, so there's more pressure on the auction. So projections are very difficult indeed. So predicting the future is let's face it impossible. I mean, just look at the financial markets. The professionals get it wrong for a living and they get paid to do it. So when your client or your boss asks you for projections, I think the safest thing to do is to exaggerate the cost impact. By that, I mean assume that your CPCs are going to go up factor of two for every increment in the auction. If you're at 50% impression share and you want to get 10% more increment the CPCs or the projected CPCs for that increment by 20%. So to make the math really simple, let's say you're currently going at 1000 impressions a week, 10% on that is 100. So 100 more impressions, you might get two conversions, whatever, and your CPC might be $5. Well, don't assume it's $5. Assume it's $6. That sort of approach where it's a scaling, exponential scale of cost to take part in the auction to gain those impressions has served me well for many, many years. And at the end of the day, you sort of under promise and potentially deliver what was promised or over deliver as a result. And you might scare some people off from spending more money, but it's about it to play it safe, particularly true if it's not your money. Yeah, so as ever, this was an unscripted video hence all the cuts. But I hope it was useful and it explained the situation for you. Never really seen anyone explain this properly. But if you've got any questions, please leave a comment. If you're wondering why I don't post many videos, it's because I'm busy. I have businesses to run. I've got an agency to run. I've got Advolver, which is a Google Ads automation tool that you should definitely check out. I've got God Tier Ads and I've got the private group Forge. So I have quite a lot of jobs. That's why I don't post videos regularly because I simply don't have time. But I do appreciate you watching my videos. Even more so if you are now sat here listening to me talk about why I'm not making videos that often. Well, I think that deserves a like. Cheers.
