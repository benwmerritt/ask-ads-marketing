Since 2017, our revenue has increased by 42% every year on average. We've answered the what is a micro agency, but I don't know if we have tackled how you scaled and what challenges you faced when you scaled. A micro agency to me, like as we discussed this, it's not really about revenue, it's about headcount. How we have scaled is, I am a very numbers oriented person when it comes to the business side of things. So I spend way too much time just pouring through those spreadsheets. Counting your money. Yes, exactly. Counting my pennies. Our average since 2017, our revenue has increased by 42% every year on average. Our slowest year was 2020 when the world just like locked down and we still had 12% increase in revenue that year. So to me, the scaling part is revenue while maintaining profitable margins, like good margins. We sat with the same headcount as well, so you didn't hire any more people. We've had freelancers and contractors over time. We've gone away from that. But it's yes, just with our three full time people right now. So that growth 42%, that sounds pretty handsome. Did profitability go up in step with that or better? Yeah, it's pretty much maintained because at first we had smaller clients, but we had literally no overhead. Now that we have full time employee, she's expensive, but she's not like leadingly expensive. So we've also scaled, she's helped us scale to much bigger clients as well. So it's pretty much maintained. I think actually if you have any business downs and you do a paper exercise of looking at how, how do I get to a half million agency or how do I go from half million to a million in revenue or a million to three million? And if you actually do the paper exercise of what that looks like in terms of additional hiring and overheads, it should scare a lot of people off. We've been in six figure profit for, I don't know, five or six years now. Never seven, but how much money do you bloody need? I'm cheap to run. And also I know for a fact we wouldn't get anywhere near the profitability I'm at for the past few years if I had double the clients and double the staff or double the staff and five times the clients. No way, absolutely no way. So then you have to ask yourself, well, why do you need that number then? Is it an ego thing? And if it's an ego thing and that's your bag, fair enough, but life's too bad. You bloody sure for that crap? That to me is like a numerical honesty that people have to come to grips with. And at the end of the day it's your take home. And I'm all about, I love to buy nice cars and have trips and things like that. Money is valuable, but at the end of the day you have to be honest about it. And a lot of people want a big number to say that they just have a three million dollar agency. At the end of the day, maybe they're not, you know, what's their profit margin on that number? It doesn't even mean anything unless you're bringing some of it home. And that you're bringing home, how much do you actually need? To be honest with you, sorry to interject, there's only one reason really I can see that someone would try and achieve that is to as an exit strategy to sell, to be acquired. A digital agency is going to be valued on profits, you know, EPI TDA and not necessarily its revenue.
