search first, what question is the person that you want money from asking? Number one, what are potential angles to sell hyper competitive services? Google ads? Yeah, cold outreach. I actually answered that one to be honest. So here's one is like, if you're saying it's hyper competitive, that's probably a problem. 17,000 subscribers. Yeah, it should be so use a search first strategy on your YouTube channel. But equally, are you talking to other people that do Google ads services? Or are you talking to people that might buy Google ads? Very, very different content you'd be making there. So while you've got a YouTube channel, if you're basically talking and talking to your competitors, you've probably got a problem. You've built a shit audience. I don't know if YouTube, John's work can't comment, but if you were talking specifically for butchers, barbers, coaches, that'd be very different content I'd be making than just talking about Google ads to appeal to your peers. A lot of people do that, by the way, weirdly, they want to be respected in their industry by their peers. So I see copyright is doing content talking about nuanced stuff that only other copyright is going to appreciate. But if you're trying to sell copyright and services to business, I would look out what businesses I'm trying to sell copyright and services to and tailor content. What questions would that ideal client be searching rather than what questions would copywriters be searching? Does that make sense? It does. And I think it's an experience thing because I see it a lot on LinkedIn now, people posting thoughtful stuff and they might be a PPC manager, so they might be a Google ads manager and they're talking to their friends, their peers. Yeah, wrong way. And I get it. Sometimes you need to do it to show knowledge and skills to your ideal client, right? But I always go back to all roads lead back to this. Search first. What question is the person that you want money from asking? Answer that. That should always be your priority with content. I could write content here about how we hand draw our animations and what software we use to design them and what kind of filters, what gradients we put in our videos. But I'm going to then talk into other video owners, right? Another agency owners. So I don't make that content because that's arming my competitors with things that we do. It's not as impressive or important to my ideal client. My ideal client wants to know why should I have an animate explainer video? How many more sales is it going to generate me? What's the key to creating a great elevator pit? That's the stuff they're searching for. So that's it. I think it's important because it's so easy to get into that. There's two paths and you can need to take the wrong one and go all in on it. And I think it's been identified here, the two different paths.
