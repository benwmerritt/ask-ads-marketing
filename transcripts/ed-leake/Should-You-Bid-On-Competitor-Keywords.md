Hey, it's Ed. This is an extract from an hour long video on keyword research. Should we bid on competitor keywords? That's it. Role VT. I think that's what they say. So bidding on competitors. Okay. As far as the law goes, if you don't mention trademark terms in your ad copy, then it's fair game. So a few things to consider when bidding on your competitors. So if you're a me too, i.e. you're the same, if you offer or do the same thing, it's quite common to bid on competitor terms, especially in the commerce space. But be very mindful of brand preference. You have to think like the searcher. Are they looking for a Hoover or a vacuum cleaner? Are they looking for the brand or does it not matter? And then the other brand, sorry, the other competitive bidding would be a scalper. So you're similar. You do something similar, perhaps from a different angle. And you want to lean on this other brand's demand. So that looks like brand plus product or brand plus service, i.e. their brand. Then there is the just going straight for the exact brand. So yeah, bidding on a competitor's exact brand term. The pros are if you're it's an easy win if you're an established brand and you're genuinely an alternative and people would be considering you. The negatives are high CPCs is going to cost a lot. But also the probably the biggest one people clicking your ad by mistake and then you get your competitors support, phone calls and requests, which does happen. In addition, if you're bidding directly on brand, you need to be aware of their ecosystem, which adds to your workload. So so when they have a problem, you stop bidding or when they run and offer, you're aware of what's going on. You can't really automate this sort of thing. You have to keep an eye on, you know, your ear to the ground. So the other option is RLSA, win them back. So remarketing against your competitors keywords. So you're remarketing list. It's an entirely different topic, but this is a no brainer really. You can dedicate a campaign to competitor terms where you target your audiences. So they're not observations. The only way your competitor terms will trigger your adverts are if you're there against your audience. If that makes sense, let me say that again. So the only way that your audience will see your adverts is if they search for the competitors and they're in your audience. All of this can backfire. If the brand is much bigger than you and has a bigger cash pile, they'll just turn their guns to you and start advertising on your brand, which is not always ideal. So it's pros and cons. I think the best one is the RLSA. So if people are looking for alternatives as well, then certainly try competitor bidding, but don't just do it as a matter of course. All that jazz. Cheers. See you on the next one.
