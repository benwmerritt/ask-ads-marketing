What does that number look like? Is that still attractive to you? Yeah, that's pretty good, isn't it? Okay, well, fuck you, pay me then. You've got two solid case studies. Well, you can show it before. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I use. That's what I use, that's what I use also in the ad. I tell them, I can get you like 30 to 40 people who are interested in your services essentially. Yeah, there's no guarantee, but you've responded to me because I'm offering essentially to generate you more business, more leads. You've obviously got to sell to these people, so you've got the capacity to take these leads on. This number of leads, what does that mean for your business? Oh, okay, that's how much money. Okay, well, let's do it conservatively. You're worried about this is not gonna work. Okay, let's drop that number down 20 leads. Let's drop the amount that they pay way below your average. What does that number look like? Is that still attractive to you? Yeah, that's pretty good, isn't it? Okay, well, fuck you, pay me then. I really want to see Enrico. I wanna see your adverts. I wanna see these emails. I wanna see, what I really love is call record. I know you can't do it now, because it's after the facts, but the sales call recording, just to hear how they went. In fact, everyone here, if you do sales calls and you've got the confidence to share them in the group, I would happily listen to them. Well, happily listen. I'd be interested to listen to them to give feedback, because I'm just intrigued as why, you've got 10 calls and why they're not buying. And if they're all fixated on price, it makes me wonder if, like that very quick value positioning I just did there as an example, is the key that's required. It's the stop looking at how much I'm gonna charge you, look at the frigging outcome, look at how juicy that is. And let's even lobel it, is it still juicy? That's what I do on every call, actually. You may do it already, but do the performance forecast to the point where you do a really pessimistic one, and be like, it's still pretty good for you. I client email this morning. Like you have to show them how to, show them what you're worth. For example, I had last week, I had this SaaS company that are doing finance software, something like that, loan management. Within a few minutes, I showed them how I saved them 2,000 euros worth of ad spend within just few clicks. So when they actually understand what are you doing and where is your value, they're like, oh yeah, fuck yeah, that's no brainer. Yeah, the problem with SaaS is you've got, you've then, depending on the product, you've got to, the tracking's gotta be amazing. So I've got a shitty little SaaS product, I'm sure you guys are aware. I would wanna know where my trials are coming from, what's the trial to paid ratio, what's the KAC, what's the retention look like, which channels are bringing me this, what's your funnel for entertaining these people? Cause my website's rubbish, so I need you to create something that's actually gonna get people into a funnel, what lead mountain we got, what offer we got. That's my issue with SaaS. I think they're very, very difficult. You've gotta specialize in them is what I'm saying. I've gone off on a tangent there, I'll go, but the tracking's gotta be next level. You've gotta know all the steps.
