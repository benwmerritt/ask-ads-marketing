cheat a lot of value for a very low price compared to what you get. Hey, my name is Daniel and in this video I want to give a quick testimonial for Ed. As you can see on my back end, this year from January 1st on May 4th, which is today, I managed 2.25 million US dollars, which is quite a lot of money. Most of it profitable, some of it not so much, that's the game. 80% of the profit, okay, maybe not 80, but 30-100% I will attribute to everything that I learned from Ed League. He's a cool guy, he's very knowledgeable. Anyway, he knows his shit, I bought fucking everything he offered because he's one of the very few on the internet in this game for a very long time who provide value way more exceeding or how you say. Anyway, cheat a lot of value for a very low price compared to what you get, right? And he's one of only three guys who I trust in this space. There are a lot of gurus out there, most of them don't know what the fuck they're talking about. Ed does. So yeah, whatever it's got here, odds or the forge or basically anything Ed does, run to your bank, set your house, take a mortgage and go buy his courses, I don't know. But yeah, definitely a worth learning, taking action and executing for some of most of the strategies. And for me when I started to learn from Ed, I was already doing this sheet like for a couple of years. And I can say that it definitely leveled up my skills, my client results and the amount of money I'm making every month. So super happy, Ed, I love you. Yeah, I hope it's a good testimonial. That's not something I usually do. So very unprofessional shit. Thanks for watching. Have a great day everyone.
