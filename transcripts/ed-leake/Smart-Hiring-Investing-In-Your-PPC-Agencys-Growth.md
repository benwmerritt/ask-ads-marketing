actually going to hire someone for 120 if they can do 80% of my job. Yeah. Because I've got the confidence I could bring in that money. And then it's like, hold on a minute. Well, what about 100% of my job? You said it's going to change your business. How, how in the next three, six months? Oh, well, when I was over there, and I think Liam knows this because we chat quite a bit. I hired my first full-time person. So they're literally just going to be taking over all the client fulfillment and retention stuff. So I'm just purely on leads and sales for now. And obviously, and support, but even just today, like I spent most of the day just finalizing some process docs, optimization docs, all these stuff. So it's literally like, here's the client, you do it. And I hired like a senior person for like a six figure salary. So I'm not like messing around from the start. Like I just wanted to get this done right from the start, not like cost effective. So that happened when I was over there, but I was already, that was already in the works, but it kind of actually finalized on my second day there. And then just being more focused on being the business owner, operator, rather than the fulfillment person. Because I really do want it to be like a boutique consulting firm. But then realistically, I'm not just wanting to get cheeked. I want people who stay and stick around and retain clients. So that's just kind of, and I'll say for all of us that I'm willing to make the financial investment and also just like, I know mentally now that's exactly where I wanted to be and it has to be. There's kind of no other options. No, I like that. And I think this is, so when you've got money, you can come from a place of more, you don't have to be as risk averse. So if you've made, if you can make, let's say five and a ground a year revenue. And you don't need that to live on unless you're really wasting the fucking money. Then you could take more risks and say, well, actually going to hire someone for 120 if they can do 80% of my job. Yeah. Because I've got the confidence I can bring in that money. And then it's like, hold on a minute. Well, what about 100% of my job? Okay, it's going to take 80% of my own money. But that's very short-sighted. If you're in this for like two or three years and you want to make a quick book, fair enough, but it's the hardest part for most people to get the money. Past is really missing that mother business. It's a really difficult thing to do, especially if you're doing like 10, 20 K a month, you might actually invest most of it on a senior person and think, shit, that's all my income. But then it unlocks you to carry on doing what you know works, which is generating the leads and the business.
