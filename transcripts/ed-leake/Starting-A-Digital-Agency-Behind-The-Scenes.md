It's everything. You're lead gen, you're marketing your sales, you're onboarding your technicals, you're reporting your strategy. I'm a principal and co-founder at Scoob. Essentially, we help e-commerce companies drive more gross profit through paydads and analytics. That's essentially the essence in terms of what I currently am more responsible for sales and marketing for the team. I still help out with some more complex problems that the team members encounter. Maybe a bigger account, more complex account, maybe there's some technical element that the team needs help with. They typically ask for my help in that area. Just overall, strategic direction in terms of how we move forward, how do we take it to the next level. I've noticed that you have to have a yin yang between different team members. You have to have someone who is good at coming up with direction, coming up with products or services that one should sell, having frameworks or processes in terms of how they should be delivered based on your observations in the market, then sell them. The other team member has to be responsible for operations, essentially making sure that team members stay with you for a long time, making sure that the client retention is high, making sure that we deliver what we promise. I'm that first part of the team. It is the perfect split. It's essentially front of house and then operations. It's the sales versus the work. Trying to mix that is a nightmare, especially for the agency owner. I think the agency owner can get the most out of doing the sales, not the operations. We cling on to the operations because I think a lot of us are technical, especially in the SEO or PPC space. We start off as technical or the doers. Initially it was both. Well, that is the solo founders addiction, isn't it? It's everything. You're lead gen, you're marketing, you're sales, you're onboarding, you're technicals, you're reporting, you're strategy. I think that there's not necessarily a revenue number, but I mean, I've looked at my own flow chart. I have a flow chart for agency priorities where I believe that you should be prioritizing in stage two of my flow chart to split operations out from essentially front end stuff. I do believe that agency owners should be at that stage, like the 25k a month kind of agency, so still small. Should have a dedicated operations. Now, you might have a co-founder that does that. How long have you started? What's your turnover roughly at the minute? It's close to 1.2 mil a year. How long have you been around? Oh, since 2009. Close to 15 years this May. 100 grand a year of perfect growth. The beginning was choppy because when I started, I was actually doing this on weekends, like for four years. It was almost like a hobby, a little side gig. Then in 2013, I started actually at full-time. Officially, in 2013, we'll say the agency started. You went from freelance to agency. Yes, we could call it that way. Since 2013, full-time, then in 2014, my wife joined because then I was like, I think we were doing like 200k a year or something like that. I could not handle everything because it was a ton of stuff to handle. At the same time, I did have some free lancers that did not, some did work out, some did not. Maybe it's a big lesson, I would say, if you can, either get a co-founder or hire someone full-time to help you. The big problem with freelancers is that sure, they're temporary, but at the same time, there are points, especially when you're a young agency, the temporary factor is not a good thing because actually I've had freelancers raise rates like a few times on me and I'm like, shit, I can't afford this anymore. It's important. But yeah, then in 2014, she joined B. And then there was a pretty much like two person team. Then next year, we had two more full-time employees and physical office. I think like four years, we were doing like less than 300k a year, something like that. But then there were a few jumps, which is actually I started focusing more on marketing because I realized actually up to maybe when was it, I think up to 2015 or so, I fully relied on referrals and my network wasn't massive. And at the same time, it's like, well, how do you know people, I mean, you're not going to ask your neighbor if you need like PPC services. Not unless you want a bad client. Yep, exactly. So yeah, so I think that when I started to actually market like, implementing some marketing, our company, then things started changing, started getting more leads, then I realized actually I'm not that good in sales. So I needed to train up on some sales processes and some sales activities. We were offering too many services to pretty much like almost like everyone. So that's kind of like a, I'm sure you have talked to and, but if you have others have talked to, but I think that you don't realize until you actually do it yourself and then you actually kind of, you know, burn from your mistakes. But in 2015, we actually had a, you know, we actually redid our brand and we did our kind of like, we established a more specific specialization. So we essentially got rid of SEO, like social media stuff, like websites, and just focused purely on PPCs because we actually this sounds very much like my journey. Yeah, I went to service, hit 300K. Okay. Did you plateau a bit at 300K prior or after specialization? So after, so did you all specialization? So, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So you went down to being PPC. Yes. So two things happened actually, and it was, it was actually bad. Okay. So what happened was we had, we hired this branding agency, you know, out of Brooklyn, New York, and they were actually cool. They actually helped us to kind of come up with that because they were, you know, doing like, you know, brand positioning and all of that, you know, they came up with like a new logo, helped us actually to come up with a new name and stuff. And, you know, they did this exercise and throughout the exercise, we like, we did it kind of like an 80-20 analysis. And we have realized that pretty much like most of the revenue was coming from PPC. That was like one thing. We were getting most results from PPC. And actually we enjoyed it most. After this, it kind of like felt like, you know, we're doing favor, you know, to some clients by helping with other areas because we're, we're like, maybe we're not as good as we could have been, or maybe like we had like the wrong clients for, you know, back at, you know, back in the day. But, but yeah, that helped us to actually, you know, focus. The other thing that we have done is that we have realized it's like we actually had to say no to, to, to lead young clients. So we said, you know what, we're going to do this for e-commerce because we've noticed that, you know, back then, we were not able to help problem solve the lead quality issues. So we would get a bunch of leads, you know, things would look good from our end, but then clients would say, well, it's not quality lead, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And, and, and, you know, back then, since there was not a lot of specialization in the team, you know, we didn't have like the mental capacity or, you know, or, or expertise just to kind of problem solve for that. So we actually dropped as like the, the lead gen side. And what happened was that after we announced it and we, after we fired a few clients, we lost a couple big clients. And it was like, Did you think you'd made the wrong, did you think I made the wrong move? Yeah, because we were, we almost reached like 300k that year. We announced it, we lost a couple clients and actually two team members left. So then there was like two of us left. And our revenue dropped like next year by like almost like 100k. And it was just like, shit. But we shot ourselves in the foot. Everything became easier. Yes. And, and, but then it was like, there were a few things that started happening. So I still continued on the, you know, the referral route for, for, so, so we, you know, we, you know, I partnered with some agencies that are full service, because, you know, previously you could not, you know, talk to anyone, you know, who's full service, Hey, I'm full service too. How about you send me some clients, right? But with our specialty then, we were able to start partnering with some agencies that they were full time, for us, you know, full service, they offered everything. They had a wider client base. And, and, and, you know, we were kind of like a specialist arm for those agencies to help them with more complex PPC accounts. We all have different paths. My, I am, my path is very unconventional, but it, it has taken 14 years. I wasted about seven years. I, well, I hate to say I wasted seven years. I, I didn't have a coach. I didn't have a mentor, no experience. So those seven years were very experiential, even a word. I don't know. But I learned a lot. And I learned pretty much everything I shouldn't be doing. If only I had a time machine, but yeah, maybe I should have got a coach when I first started. It was Rocky.
