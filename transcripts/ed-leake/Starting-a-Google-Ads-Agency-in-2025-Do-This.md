I've got this, it works. You want this? This is the outcome. Look at this. Like, it couldn't be fucking easier. His agency is going to be infinitely more scalable than mine, the way he set his up. So yeah, he has to get more to compete revenue wise and profit wise maybe. I dare see he could be as profitable to be fair, but his is way more scalable because we do both lead gen and ecom. If I had my way again, I would not do that. I would not do that. In fact, start again, I'd probably scrap it ecom and go lead gen just because of the control you can have. Yes. All the call tracking, lead tracking, landing pages, even funnel work if you had to do it, email. Right, just the value. Like the client for a lead generation business is worth so much more than ecommerce. Ecom is a bit harder because you just can't, there's so many things you cannot control and there's a whole supply chain, there's a whole product line, there's so many elements that you can't, the platform you can't really do much. Yeah, you can do, you can add apps and plugins to Shopify. It's not the same thing. It's literally compartmentalizing a plumber and controlling their whole experience, the landing page, the follow up, everything you can literally control everything for them. All they've got to do is pick the bloody phone up. Yeah, it's a very different experience.

I'd put a structure together that is specifically for that type of business and just make it fucking work. I've got this, it works. You want this? This is the outcome. Look at this. Like, it couldn't be fucking easier. You've got to get there, but getting those clients on is so much easier because you're like, look at this. Do you want it? I mean, it's like speed dating, that sexy case study. Ring the bell.
