G'day guys, my name is Casey Jones. I run a company called Cijanco out of Australia. We help businesses grow faster than ever. We're a team of 17 and growing rapidly. First came across Ed through God Tier Ads and it's pretty wild. One guy who has that much knowledge on Google Ads and Harry was able to collate that into what is God Tier Ads. So I've seen that the Agency Forge popped up on my radar. Ed was running it. I'm like, man, I've got to get this. I want to be part of this because Ed is just such a genuine dude and such a knowledgeable guy as well. I want to steal all of his secrets and see if I can make myself more money through him. So that's what I did. I joined The Forge and by far the best part for me is just engaging with other agency owners in that space and of course all the course material as well. I had been burnt in the past through courses. I spent an obscene amount of money last year on one specific course which ended up just being this platform for this guy to sell his third party tools and there's a very little value in there. There are just so many sharks in this industry that are happy to take your money. Ed's happy to take your money too but he wants to give you something for it. He actually provides so much value. So yeah, absolutely love The Forge. Love being a part of it. Very privileged to be part of it and very much enjoying my time. I've only been here for a little while but looking forward to the next 12 months.
