If you've got the results, previous results, you've got the credibility there, you then add credibility by saying, I can't guarantee this, but look, I'm capable. It saves your and theirs. So you agree, you agree a fixed fee and a fixed budget and essentially a fixed amount of stuff. So you say to them, look, let's start low ball. Let's spend a little with me, spend a little on your budget. But you have to set the ground rules that if things go well, it expands from there. And they essentially agree that if the pilot is a success and you have to both agree what success means, there might be a number of leads or whatever, but they have to agree that if it's a success, your fee becomes X and their budget will likely be Y. So they know that from this is a stepping stone and it might be 500 euros all in. It might be a little baby campaign, might be one campaign with a landing page template that you've used before, just to baby it for the first month, it might be two months, but the trigger is it hits that success metric, whatever it is, and that triggers the full retainer. It's a lot easier to sell that to someone that's a smaller size business because it's just a baby step. And also it's, they will feel a bit more confident in you that you're not trying to lift their leg and get 1500, 5 grand and 10 grand out of them for the first month or whatever, because you just say, look, let's test the water. First date territory, see how it goes. Setting those expectations too early is probably pretty critical. If anything, most of the time I spend on the phone with leads is talking them out of working with us. Like honestly, I play things down massively because you want to set those expectations because you have six weeks in, the last thing you want as a client going, where are my five million leads that I ordered? It's like, well, bro, that's not how it works. So if you can just say like, yeah, no, that's kind of not how it works. Three months is the golden rule of thumb. And thereafter, we'll talk about it sort of thing. So I think- What do you say? Do you say three months? Worst case, you won't have any phone calls or any leads for three months? Or what exactly do you say? If you know that you can get results in that niche, then you can go, well, look, typically this is what we see, but we always say three months is the golden rule of thumb, no matter what happens. And the other thing that I also say to people is that, hey, at the end of the day, things don't always go right, but you want someone on your side who's gonna walk you through this and get you to the other side where things are prosperous. So things do, you know, shit hits a fan, something goes wrong, it's not working as well. You can say, well, hey, you know, we're triaging it, we're trying to fix this. I'd add to that, you need to have the confidence to say that there's gonna be more, it's gonna work in three months, otherwise why are you taking them on? If you're on a position where you don't think that in three months, or there's a chance in three months, it's not gonna work. I would question, is that the right account for you? And if that's just a confident thing, you have to assume you're gonna make it work, otherwise you're in the wrong job. Also another thing to explain to the client is to say, like, look, if you don't have any historical data, you don't know how it's gonna go. Like that's the thing, but one thing that you are gonna make sure is you're gonna have the ads up and running for three months. No matter of the results, you have to pay for the job to get the ads up and running. I feel like people have forgotten about the work that we do, even setting up the ad on the internet and making your business visible is a job in itself. Getting results, it's the next step. And you can't assume, like every day or every time, we are gonna be a millionaire when we start running ads. No, you're gonna pay me for getting your ads up and running on the internet. We're gonna collect data in three months. We can see, like we have optimized the campaigns and we can see where we are at. How many leads have you got and all that stuff. Like you have to explain that to the client. If you have a hundred people and you can't convert even one of them, I have no words, but yeah, you have to explain that. Like even like, put the ad on the internet is the job in itself. And that's what you ask for, like that's your fee, right? There is a thing here, of course, that we're missing. And it's the fact that you've got a case study, hopefully. That's the thing that cements the deal because it's like, well, look, this is what happened before. You're like-minded, you're a similar business. This is the potential. This is what we're able to achieve. Is that good enough for you? And if the prospect says, no, that's shit, it's like, okay, you're talking to the wrong person because that was a good result. But most people go, oh, well, that's why I'm here because I looked at that case study and the before and after is me and the after is where I wanna be. And you've got that example. Because if you just go straight in by saying, there's no guarantee, you could waste all your money, then most people are gonna be scared of dealing with you. But if you've got the results, previous results, you've got the credibility there, you then add credibility by saying, I can't guarantee this shit, but look, I'm capable. But know it, there's no guarantee. I will try and reproduce this for you. But these are the, there's a moving target here. Here's the things that can go wrong. Here's things that can go right. Let's do a projection for you. Here's the low ball. And here's where I expect to be in three months. Is that low target? If we get it, you know, if everything goes right for us, is that gonna be enough for you? That's where you need to get to. They need to see that your sort of low ball is good enough, but you're actually aiming for more.
