to interrupt someone on their entertainment time to go ahead and think about something else. It's a tough slog. Well, I was going to ask actually another thing and it's about our offer. We're looking to do more than just Google ads now and we have started doing it based on I think it was accountability called from a month or two months ago. We're now starting to roll out Facebook ads for all clients up there monthly with that. And so we've got enough clients to get to where we want to do just by upping them. The question I had is do you think YouTube ads for trades works because I only see big brands doing it. I'm really curious to figure out if it'll work for like, I don't know, people do lots of conversions like will it be similar to Facebook in results or is it just doesn't work like that. I don't really know. My opinion of YouTube is it's a bit like display because the targeting is a lot looser. So I think it's a lot easier to spend lots of money. Even if you go after in market, it's sort of I've never done trade. I don't think I've ever done trade on YouTube. So I don't know. But my gut tells me it will probably be a bit pricey. I don't know if anyone else It's not the fact that it won't convert people who are in that mindset. It's just the targeting is a bit more broad than Facebook's targeting is really good for audience behavior. It's really good. Even the iOS bullshit. Everyone's like, Oh, Facebook. It's not no, it's still really fucking good. YouTube's a bit blobby. And it's like, Oh, are you telling someone in market for this topic? And it's like, Yeah, but it's it's their child playing something on the fricking iPad or the data's not right, or Google's taking a bit of a punt or a guess or trying to expand past your targeting. It's just I don't know. YouTube's actually thinking about rolling out some kind of like YouTube specific offer. To existing customers. Sorry, Liam, your hand. Sorry, go on, Liam. What I was going to say is you're going to have to have a red hot offer dude to like, to get somebody off their YouTube video, to get them through to a website, to start thinking about their house and home or whatever, you know, like to interrupt someone on their entertainment time to go ahead and think about something else. Like it's a tough slog. But personally, what I would do is turn off all your ad blockers, go on your phone, do all the hot keywords out there, do some competitive research, type into Google, go to like 50 different websites on home restorations or whatever niche you're servicing, and then go into YouTube and see what you get remarketed with. You know, if there's nothing that might be a reason why there's nothing. Great advice from Liam. There it is. The other two things for you, Sam, is I would try to test the waters. I'd try and upsell it to an existing client and probably do it for free. If you've got no experience of running it and say, this is why we're doing it for free, we want to generate a case to test it. We just got a pain 2k to do all the video work. This is the other problem. So it makes me think, are you going down a difficult route when there's probably an easier route? Do you get many leads that are already advertising? The good ones are, yeah. There are often a lot of our best leads are people who they might be tapping into Facebook ads, they might be doing Google ads. It's not where they want it to be, or they're doing Facebook ads and we get success in Google ads and then they're like, oh, what else can we do? We're like, sorry, Search Network only has so much demand for your service area, then we get attacked out on the Search Network. Well, what I was going to say, it's probably harder to, it definitely is harder to dislodge an incumbent who's spending and been spending for years and they're relatively happy. They're like, yeah, why would I change agency? To me, you're in the perfect position for a really good foot in the door. You must have landing pages that work really well and you could plug that, you could do a pretty non-disruptive test with them. So here's a foot in the door offer, a few hundred quid or whatever to set this up. We'll test our landing page against yours. If it doesn't beat it by x% we'll give you whatever or walk away. But if it does, will you entertain us and we'll talk about working with you because we can take over your Google ads and everything else. The landing page thing is the easiest foot in the door if they're an existing advertiser, if you've worked in that industry, you've got a template, you've got the experience because you know that if you're getting like 20% or whatever conversion rate or 15% that you can probably beat what they're doing, especially if you check a few of their ads out and it's such an easy foot in the door because it's like, we'll beat your results and then we'll sit down at the table and talk about working with you because they're not going to do that if you beat their results. Super quick, super cheap, low pain, let's beat it and then rip you off that agency that you're currently paying.
