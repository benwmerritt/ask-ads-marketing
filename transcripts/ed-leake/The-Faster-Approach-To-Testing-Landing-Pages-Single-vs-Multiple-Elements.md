Particularly for these smaller businesses in lower traffic, if you split these tests out because of the volume of traffic, yeah, eight months just to test three different things. When did the 3D plan start? Was that added when you fixed the page for the door company? We had always included the 3D design. I'm down the bottom of the page. There was an offer, he said you don't just get the quote, you get a 3D design plan and a quote and I wondered if that 3D of the 3D design impacted the concrete, not to say that your page isn't amazing, but I just wondered when that 3D plan 3D was added, was it there the whole time or was it added with the new page? Oh, I see what you mean. So that section has always been on there on both pages, but I suppose with the new design that we had, so you can see here in the hero we're leading with the get free quote, but then if I go to the new one, we lead with the here in the subheading as well. Yeah, that could completely be a valid reason for the increase. I find it's actually so hard to define what exactly does improve it. Yeah, but it wasn't like that 3D plan offer started with your new page, so it wouldn't have impacted it hugely if it did. No, I wouldn't imagine so it's because yeah, we didn't exactly lead with it up here, but they were both kind of there within the vicinity and that's what we'd run within the ad copy as well. It's the same thing for a quote and free 3D design. Is this toss up between, as you said at the start, some statistical significance and picking the winner, the best horse? Because particularly for these smaller businesses and lower traffic, you might say, I want to test the headline, and then I want to test the offer, and then I want to test this. And if you split these tests out because of the volume of traffic, eight months just to test three different things. And sometimes you've just got to use your experience and say, I want to tweak the headline and put a new offer in and test those as a unit. And yeah, one might actually be worse than the other, but the better offer pulls it through. And I think sometimes you just got to say, well, that page as a whole is better than because if you try and you need a lot of traffic to test individual elements and do more totally. Yeah, yeah. I think that's the thing as well, which may hold a lot of people back or may hold you back from actually making the right changes is always thinking, especially if you've taken a course or something like CXL who will very much be in the mindset of, okay, it's going to be of a certain statistical significance for you to then prove it to be the right page and stuff. And then what I found when I've tried that kind of approach, I've just got nowhere and I've just wait around for ages. Yeah, if you back end, if your metrics are saying conversion rate is going, costs going down, you just keep pursuing it. Sometimes you just know, like in your gut, you just know like this is a better proposition on the page, it's a better for an after image, the form is easier to use or the questions are easier. There are just some things that you know.
