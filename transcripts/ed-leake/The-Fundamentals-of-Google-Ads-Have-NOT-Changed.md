But if it doesn't work, don't worry about it. Use something else. It's like, I can't get Pmax to work. Okay, use your search campaigns. What, you know, don't go back to what works two or three years ago. What else has changed really? The use of the psychology, the fundamentals remain the same, regardless of the features that Google adds to an account. And this is something that frustrates me a lot because I sell a training product, God tier ads, the performance framework. Which I've bought. Michael is bought, which I do get a few emails about. It doesn't I rarely get refunds. I think I've had, I could check the spreadsheet. Actually, I think I've had four this year, which is trivial. But I've just had an email from someone saying it feels out of date. And I'm like, why? What have you read? What have you watched that is telling you that something's different now? Because the fundamentals of a good ad campaign. Hamozi, what are you saying? Hamozi? God damn you, Al. And that's just me having to not lecture someone, but just educate them on actually just forget that the buttons have got different colors and different names on them. Like the biddy, the same bloody system is has it improved? Has it got worse? Who knows? But it's the options are the same. Campaign structures are still the same. Extensions are generally the same keyword selection and how you research keywords the same match types of thinned their behavior has changed, drifted, whereas exacts are less exact. So but still the principles remain the same. So performance max, you don't have to use it crying out loud. It's just it's there as an optional thing. Yeah, particularly for Legion, you do not have to use it. Yeah, that's pretty wild. Unless we've got an insurance client that they use it for Legion, but they only their conversion points is offline data feeding back in. So it's real tangible data, not just like cooked rubbish bot leads like the legit leads. But unless you've got a high volume of data, I think lead generation Pmax is your your cowboy. It's fucking. We use we only use it with offline data. And I wish I could show you a back office report from one of our insurers. Yeah, a track lead through the application, through the approval, through the policy and that all that feeds back into Google ads as different version types and Pmax is it's half. So the conversion rate from 10 and the CPA is about where you'd expect it to be. But the quality of them going from a conversion to a lead to closed is half. Not 10 percent worse is 50 percent worse. So there's a lot of shit. The other problem with these leads from Performance Max is that they waste the business's time because they're lower quality or spam on a junk. You've got to remember someone's got especially a business doing thousands of leads a month and they've got a team of people on the phones, on the emails. Someone's time is being used up with this crap. So yeah, Pmax is optional. I'd say I dare say it's optional for. Ecommerce as well. Just quickly with Pmax for Legion is the elements of it are dynamic search ads, which will mostly be branded traffic. Most of the time, if you get leads, the second part is YouTube videos. So to what extent does that actually work? I run YouTube ads for clients, get great results. But you have to run them like a laser like that. That's unforgiving because that's like a display network. That's like Facebook, but harder. And then you've got like Gmail ads and then also the rubbish. It's like, what the hell is going on? Like when you talk about a black box, it's like, I'll open the black box and it's just filled with dog turds and empty wrappers. And then there might just be like a dollar in the corner. Like it's mostly rubbish, low quality at inventory by Google that they just want to spend. Sounds like under my Christmas tree. Empty wrappers, dog turds and the dollar in the corner. You can't even spend a dollar in this country. Yeah, I think that's fair. YouTube's 80, 90 percent ad. Offer, ad, offer, ad. Yeah. What you do inside Google ads, you can throw a doll. If you've got a good advert and a good offer, you can throw a doll in Google ads and it will probably work. If you've got a pretty shite advert, it doesn't matter how good you are at Google ads. You are going to struggle with YouTube ads making it work. So definitely when you then see what performance Max puts out with the sort of like soft porn music and the slide shows, these automated YouTube ads it creates, they are terrible. They are a terrible experience. And it might cynical self says that Google knows that these are terrible. But what it does allow them to do is to fill that bottom 10 percent of inventory that's not getting sold, that's junkie, that's crap, that attracts no clicks or low clicks. And then pushes the market up then because it means that if there's more advertising, the market, it means that the base price goes up. Of course it does. Of course it does like display. So, you know, just business, Google. Yeah, it's not. Yeah. So displays again, it's difficult. It's I'd say Facebook ads are definitely easier because it's a much narrower playing field and you can pick the field you play on displays a lot tougher in that respect and Pmax is just blasting you far and wide. Auto generated ads, auto generated videos, which are the most hilarious thing until you've seen 10 of them. So, yeah, don't don't buy into the hype and don't worry about it. If it doesn't.
