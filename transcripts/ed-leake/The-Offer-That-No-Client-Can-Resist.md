That's a business talking to a business. It's saying, look, we'll do our best, give it our best try, and if we fail, you know, at least there's some comeback for you. When I talk to them, I don't know. They get in to start with, like, they don't know what Google Meet is a lot of times, or they don't know how to use video conferencing, whatever. And then, it might be my sales skills that I just talk too much about the Google thing and not about the easy stuff they can understand. So it might be just a skill thing, but, yeah, just realized they don't really have an interest. I mean, all they care about is the end result, which is fair enough. They want leads coming in, and you can sell that to them. Just maybe in another way. I don't know how you've gone about it. We've spoken about this at length. I'm sure that we've discussed the sales pattern, pushback, and I'm sure there's loads of stuff on this inside Forge. Removals is a tough one, just as an industry, like it's... I have two clients from that space, but they came through referrals, and I thought it would be a good idea because I have results from them. I know the industry, and as long as the two, I thought I knew the industry. I didn't, obviously. But I just thought, all right, these guys, they never want anything from me. They just sent me money, and they're happy. It's easy to get them results, so why not get more of them? It should be easy. Well, it sounds like, with a few tweaks, you could improve this, because they want the result, and you're getting results for two of their peers, but it sounds like you didn't make it clear where the result came from, or why. And secondly, you probably did, and we all made this mistake, and we probably did speak too much about Google Ads in the sales call when it should have been about, where are you now? Where do you want to go? I can get you there. This is the offer. There's no guarantees, and then you could throw them in a sweetener or a softener. If I can't get it to work in 30 days, I won't take your money, because if you really want to get sales over the line, sometimes you do have to put a guarantee in there. Which I think is reasonable. I don't know if Sam still uses guarantees, but I think that's reasonable. If you can't get it to work, then why take... That's fine. I'd be totally up for doing that for offering that. Yeah. Break even guarantee. If you don't break even from jobs in the first X, then we refund you your setup and the bull fees that you've paid us. And it's really fair. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Totally. I think so. That's a business talking to a business. It's saying, look, we'll do our best, give it our best try. And if we fail, you know, at least there's some comeback for you. So... I'll put an image of the ad in the chat, by the way. Oh, sweet things. Yeah. And notice how it uses a Google Ads interface and Reco. So if a client is familiar with Google Ads, a prospect, sorry, they understand the angle of this, that it's coming from Google Ads. But I probably would mention it somewhere in there anyway. But yeah, the sales call... The sales script inside Forge that I put together, I don't even think it mentions Google Ads. I don't think it mentions any of the technical things whatsoever on the actual phone calls. It's all about quizzing the business about where they are, where they want to go, what it means for them, what problems they've had before. And then you can talk about, oh, well, I've achieved X for this company and Y for this other company.
