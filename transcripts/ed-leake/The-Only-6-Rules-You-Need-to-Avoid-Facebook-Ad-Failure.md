Okay and we're live. Welcome to the only six rules you need to avoid a Facebook ad failure. Can everyone hear me? I've got a yes from James, hello James, Gabriella, nice name, Amit. Happy to be here. Good, I'm happy to be here too, Amit. Hank, Debbie, Tom, Brill, Hank, that's a cool name. We don't get that in Britain. No one's called Hank over here. Cool. Never understand why people actually ask on a webinar, can you hear me? Because surely the people can't hear me, won't hear me to reply. Anyway, so yeah, this is a hopefully highly useful webinar and we're going to go over six rules to avoid a Facebook ad failure. I'm going to have a very quick intro for you about me. If you've never watched anything from me before, you don't really know who I am. I'm Ed, Ed Leake, so the intro will be very quick, I promise, and we'll jump straight into the good stuff. So essentially our goal today is, like I said, this is the first time you've watched anything of mine. I want to make sure you have a great first impression. So I would consider it a failure if I can't help you today, if you don't take some value away from this. So by the time you've finished watching this webinar, you'll be able to advertise your business on Facebook with confidence and greater understanding of what doesn't work and what does, what makes you money, or at the very least, be on your way to much, much better results. If you stick around to the end, I've got some bonuses and also I'll be answering your questions. And also if you stick around to the end, I'll send you the slide deck, the presentation today, but otherwise feel free to take a few notes, of course, if you so wish. So quickly then, who the hell am I? So I'm Ed, Ed Leake, 34 years of age. I live in the UK, as you can probably tell from my accent. I know a lot of people on here today are from the States as well, United States and Canada, of course. So I actually built and monetized my first website over 20 years ago when I was about 13 years of age. So I've been doing this internet thing quite a long time, a bit of a nerd in my youth. I founded MyDysmedia, which is my pay-per-click ad agency six and a half, seven years ago now. We've grown the business by 100% to 200%, essentially doubled, if not tripled, our growth every year. And our agency, we manage, well, millions in dollars, pounds, euros. Don't think we've got any yen, but yeah, essentially millions in ad spend every month. And we've helped companies across the world 10, 20 times their ROI, and even some of them as close as 30 times ROI, which is pretty crazy and very rare. So yeah, essentially, I must be doing something right. Just one more thing. I'm not a bloody guru. So I just want to put that out there because I'm fed up with seeing gurus, talent, nonsense. And you can trust me, I run a bloody business doing this. We manage millions in ad spend. Literally the stuff I show you on video, the stuff I share on my Facebook page, Twitter, so on. Anything that I do is tactics from real life, you know, stuff we use day in, day out to help people grow their businesses and sell stuff. Essentially, I wouldn't be in business if I couldn't do this. So I'm not a guru. I'm a bloody business owner. It's as simple as that. I'm also in a bit of a privileged position because we get to see companies of all shapes and sizes across the world in different verticals and industries and niches. So we get to see what's working on Google and Facebook and YouTube and all sorts of different things for many, many different businesses. So it gives us quite an insight. Probably one of the best things about running an agency, I can't get my words out, running an agency actually is that you see so many different people and their businesses. So that's me. Told you it'd be quick. What was that? A couple minutes. Right. Who is this for? Who is the avoiding Facebook ad failures webinar for? So obviously it's for business owners and entrepreneurs. Do we have many business owners in here? Richie, Richie. Sorry, I was about to say surname then. I can't pronounce it. Richie. Yes. Sorry. There's another warning as well. Crap, with pronouncing names. I do apologize. Mine's really easy. Ed. Gabriela. Yeah. Running a business for six years like you. Cool. Yeah. Loads of people in here. But also this is good for professionals, the marketing professionals. You know, if you want to improve your craft or if you market your boss's business or whatever it may be and freelancers doing the same thing. Amit. Yeah. Freelancing all the way from India. Hello, Amit in India. Cool. Okay. So essentially I've been through our goal today. But yeah, by the time you've finished watching, I want you to have the confidence to know what does and doesn't work, but ultimately get better results from your Facebook ads because there are some rules that you need to adhere to just to make things work. It's very easy to blow money down the pan and wonder what went wrong. And then also you start to think that Facebook ads don't work, which isn't true. So we're going to sort that out today. Also, my assumptions are you already have a decent product that people actually want. So this is definitely not how to create a product. You've got to be, you know, you've got to have a market, a supply and demand for what you have. There's no point trying to sell something that no one ever wants. That's just the reality. That's life in general, not just Facebook ads. That isn't a fault of Facebook. This is certainly not a get rich quick nonsense webinar. This is not a silver or a magic bullet. This is a set of rules that will definitely help and improve things. But it doesn't mean you've got to do a little bit of work. It's not a magic bullet. And of course, I can't guarantee that you'll get the same results as I have. You might even do better, quite frankly. But you could do a bit worse. But one thing I'm pretty confident of is you will be better at Facebook ads after the next sort of 35 minutes or so. Your attention, please. Okay. Just before we start, put your phone on silent. Just checking mine. Close off your social media accounts. Remove your distractions because let's face it. If you're serious about improving your performance, you owe it to yourself just to close off all your distractions and just give me your full attention. There's no point being here if you're one hand on your phone, one hand on your, I don't know what else, other phone or tablet. Cup of tea, hand on your cup of tea or coffee is absolutely fine, Jake. You're allowed to drink tea. I don't have one because I'd need to go to the laboratory. So lol. Yes. Thank you, Jake. Yeah, it might just change your life, hopefully. Right. Straight in them. I say straight in. I've been talking for seven minutes. Sorry. Right. Or crack on. Only six rules you need to avoid Facebook ad failure. Rule number one is your offer. So the single biggest mistake is not actually having something people want, which I said before. Now, these rules are in no particular order. I would suggest that these six rules go hand in hand quite frankly. So, you know, don't read too much into the fact that this is rule one. What's a good offer? The right product to the right person at the right time. It's got to be the right price point. That could be free. And the messaging has got to be appropriate for that person. So you've got to remember that when people are on Facebook, they're not walking around with their credit card in hand. So you've got to think what's in it for me. What is it worth it? Why would I click your, you know, why would I click my own advert and take myself away from what I was doing on Facebook? That's crucial to remember. What's in it for me? And that's true of Facebook's own delivery as well. You know, lower click through rate. And we'll discuss this later on. A lower click through rate essentially bumps your price up anyway. And you know, so the Facebook algorithm is essentially, it thinks the same. You know, if you can't get people to click you around, there's something wrong with it or the offer's not good enough. Or they don't want to, you know, the audience that you've selected isn't interested. So just think what's in it for me when you create an advert and an offer. And consider a very simple tactic of using state of mind. This is literally taking someone from pain to resolution, you know, a frustration of fear, an issue to resolving it. It's in a similar way that got you onto this webinar essentially. You know, I was talking about Facebook ads not working for your business. So I was calling out to people like yourself. Tanya says, yes, that was me. I will hope everyone Tanya that's on here. So that was the pain point, wasn't it? It was the that my advert was all about your Facebook ads aren't working frustratingly. And the resolution was six rules to fix that. So that's me in this example. Now, it's all well and good me telling you, well, just you stayed to mine, you know, the before and after, you know, how do they feel now? And what how are you going to make them feel afterwards? But here's some ideas for your your advert copy. And not wishing to teach people to suck eggs. But when I say copy, I literally mean the writing, you know, the copywriting. So there are six elements to a good offer. The tangible emotion, the life benefit, as it were, the status, proof and speed. So tangible is something getting something, you know, what do they get after they take action? Are you giving away a physical free product? For example, the emotion? Well, how do they feel? What how does it improve things for them in their life? And status is similar, you know, does it elevate their status? Does it improve their their professional status, their work or life status? You know, do they look better amongst their peers or their colleagues? And the proof is similar people to your audience who are getting a benefit. And speed is perhaps one of the stronger emotions in that, you know, get it done quickly, done for you, template, fill in the blanks kind of thing. Speed is is one of particularly in a modern world where we're bombarded with information overload. Speed is is something that people are very keen to achieve. As I say, using me as the example, because you've already seen my advert, clicked on it and you are here. Thank you. The before state was the poor performing ads. So how can we use those six elements for my ad? And you may have seen some of these in the advert itself. So the tangible is that you're going to get six rule system. The emotion is that it could lower your anxiety and your frustrations with Facebook ads. Tanya is giving me a whoop whoop. Is that? Oh, you agree? Okay. So I should probably stop reading the comment flow because I'm getting distracted. Sorry. The life is to improve your business, reduce your cost, you know, the burden on your business, which has an impact on your life, particularly if you're a small business owner, like myself, you know, you are very much entwined and integrated with your business. And then you can see the other things. The proof and speed are pretty much the same thing as the tangible, you know, it's a six rule system. So the proof is examples and the speed is a template that you can use. So that's a good offer. I also found this on the Tintel web. I'm not going to run through it all. This is from digital market. This is another sort of example of their trigger and then action and then the next step. So filling in the blanks for you. So that's rule number one, the offer. Does that make sense? Aaron says, yep, I think I know why my last ad sucks now. Ha ha. Is that a happy laugh, Aaron, or crying into a coffee cup laugh? Both right? Okay, bro. Okay. Rule number two, moving on. Like I said, I'll tell you what I do. I'll start reading the chat at the end of each rule. You're called to action. You're CTA for short. So what is the one thing you want people to do essentially? What is the one action you want them to take? If you're not getting clicks on your ad, then your call to action could be failing you. How does someone take action today? So what is a good call to action? Well, it's the solution to the offer. Sorry, a solution or an offer, but also the solution to the offer. But keep it simple. You know, it's get this download that by whatever, you know, keep your call to action simple to start with, because your your offer is where you're using the the tangibles and the benefits and the emotions and the speed, etc. So the call to action comes after that and literally says, do this thing. A couple of quick tips. Be human in your copywriting. Don't overthink it. Just be yourself and write it as you'd say as you'd speak it to someone. That's always a good idea. When you've written an advert, read it out loud or read it to someone you know. And does it feel awkward if it does soften it a little bit? Avoid looking like an advert. I'm going to cover this in one of the rules later, actually. So I won't hang around too much on this test emojis to add emphasis to words. That does depend on your market. If you're a more mature market, not to generalize and stereotype people, but emojis might not be appropriate. Or if you're in a sensitive market, again, might not be worth using emojis. But for everyone else, you could try it. If it is genuinely time limited, then do sprinkle a sense of urgency. But don't fake it. Don't say there's 24 hours to to get the offer. And then the same person sees the advert a week later and the same bloody offers over 24 hours to go. It's just crap. It just it'll burn your bridges and you'll be fine. So don't do it. So again, think benefits. What do I get? So here's a quick sort of table of call to action words that you could use. I'm not going to go through these. This is just here to give you some ideas and benefits. Like I say, if you stay to the end, you'll get the slide deck anyway. Or you could screenshot it now. So if you're not getting clicks, you probably don't have a good call to action or it's muddled or not to the point. Jess says, I didn't even know what a call to action was. There you go, Jess. So you don't even have a call to action. So this one rule could improve your advert considerably just by adding in your CTA. Yeah, so also include your and we've tested this quite a bit include links within your text, particularly if you've written a long advert or a lot of texting, i.e. a long form ad. If you include your your link wherever it may go early on and at the very end, it does actually well, it typically increases the click through rate from people who expand the ad and view the text. So it's just a very simple tip there for you. So that's pretty straightforward. Rule number two is your call to action. So rule number three, I'm just going to take a slip. Just going to take a slurp of water slip of water. That's better. Right. Rule number three, the right audience. What do I mean by the right audience? Well, a great ad will fail on an average audience. An average ad will work on a great audience. Simply put, if your audience is misaligned or not appropriate or just not right, it doesn't matter how good your offer is, or the call to action or the advert, it won't work. Whereas you can, you know, there's a lot of people that labor the point about copywriting and creative writing. But at the end of the day, if you have a solid audience, you don't have to overthink your copywriting. I'll be honest with you. If you have a good offer and a clear call to action with a good audience, you are nine times of the way there. Okay, so the right audience, you've got to understand where your audience are. So are they at the awareness stage? Are they interested? A consideration stage? Or are they existing customers? And this is just understanding where you are in terms of who you're targeting. So I'm going to, I'm not going to, again, labor this slide because hopefully, well, I should probably ask you, but hopefully most of you understand this sort of concept of cold, warm and hot audiences, essentially the more someone sees you and engages with you, the warmer they become to you. And they're therefore require less convincing to convert to take your offer. So thinking about that and sort of levels of audience. One big issue I see very often, frequently, frequently with customers of mine and our agency is that often people will go for acquisition, i.e. new, so new customers, new sales before considering retention, so existing customer base and existing audiences, because your existing audiences already know who you are, they've already committed some time, energy, potentially money to you. So do use them first. There's a stat here that I pulled from, I think it was statistical, but six to seven times more likely to click and engage with your ads on Facebook, your existing audience. So that's pretty potent. That also makes them cheaper, because the higher the click through rate, the higher the relevancy, the lower your cost per click. So it works in your favor. So the low hanging fruit is to test the water on your existing audience first. Now, if you've got a small audience, then it will be a little test. But page likes is the obvious one. Facebook allows you to create custom audiences based on engagement. So people who have recently engaged with content on your page, again, low hanging fruit, friends of people who like your page, if it's appropriate, of course, for a company like ours, it would probably be inappropriate because people who like our page, you know, we're very specific marketing agency B2B with their friends really engage with our content, probably not. You're, as I just said, you engage users past website visitors, you know, people who have visited you in X days 30, 15, 100, whatever it may be. And of course, past customers. So there's two things here you either do or you don't want your existing or past customers to take your offer. If you do, then you can upload, you can create a custom audience and upload all your customers email lists and it will create an audience based around those people. And of course, you can track people who've been to your checkout your converting page and create an audience of those people too. So like I say, this is the low hanging fruit. Use that first. So when you're, so rule three here is audience, use your low hanging fruit first and then scale from there. So you've beat me to it, Debbie. I don't have an audience. In fact, if I show you the slide, you've actually preempted the slide. I don't have an audience. A quote by Debbie. So what do you do in this situation? You might be tempted to look at audience insights, which is fair enough at all that allows you to build audiences. Rich says, what is it? I'm not going to show you today, Rich. I don't want to go through it because actually, again, you're preempting my slides. If we go to the next slide, it says you might be tempted to look at audience insights, but it's complicated, which means it leaves too much room for error. Now, it isn't complicated once you've got the hang of it, but that's the same as anything. Also recently, Facebook have removed a feature called audience affinity. I don't know if it's coming back, but this was a powerful bit of data or metric where if you added certain pages, it would tell you the affinity between them. So the likelihood that someone liking one page will like the other and so on. And that was probably one of the most powerful features. There are literally essays on this subject which help and hinder. So we're not going to use audience insights today. Instead, we're going to Google it. What? Yes, Google for Facebook. So literally, well, this is one of the tactics anyway. So when building a new audience, a very simple thing you can do is literally Google your topic, your product, your industry and find the top websites that come up in the, you know, in the, don't necessarily look at the adverts, but you can look at the adverts, but the organic top 10 listings, you know, find the top sites, the brands, the people, if that's appropriate to your niche. And then can you target those? Can you put those brands and websites? Can you first find them on Facebook and then can you add them as targeting in your audiences? So that's the first step. There's also a nifty little tactic called audience layering, which is simply going to your, I'm using MailChimp here as an example, because hopefully most people know what MailChimp is, but essentially going to your competitors pages or a product that other people would like if they liked your product, if that makes sense. So going to that page and then finding people who also like other pages or pages liked by this page. So for example, MailChimp likes all these different pages here. And we can literally use MailChimp as the top level audience interest and then layer it with each one of these additional pages. I'll show you very quickly what I mean in a second, but we can also use Facebook search, which is graph search to find pages liked by people who like MailChimp. And that will show you, it doesn't have to be MailChimp. It can be obviously any page that is appropriate to you. As you can see here, I'm not sure what the second one is to be honest with you. If we just ignore that, but we've got things like five minute crafts, Texas Holden poker, a web, a USA today. So how do we layer an audience or what do I mean by audience layering? So here's Facebook ad manager with the targeting to include MailChimp to the US and the UK. And it's nearly 900,000 people in this age range who are English. Now 900,000 people is quite a large audience. So a few years ago, I was of the mindset that you start with a couple of hundred thousand to 300,000 as an audience and build out from there. But, you know, things change. You learn stuff. And whilst that's still okay, actually, I like to go now that the Facebook pixel is really quite sophisticated. I like to go much, much tighter. And as you can see in the next slide, layer, multiple targeting interests and behaviors on top of another and get right down to sort of like a 10, 20,000, 30,000 at a push sized audience, which is super, super targeted. And essentially what you're doing there is targeting this very tight audience for a small period of time. You know, it might only be a week to get to the result really quickly. So you know that your office right, your call to action right and so on and so forth is working because you're targeting a very tight audience. And then from there, you break out into a much bigger, broader audience and you know, you take it step by step. So you go tight and you literally open up. So in the example on screen, MailChimp also matching a web and then also USA Today, you could, you know, in a week's time, if you're hitting your target, whatever that may be, you can then take off USA Today and open up this audience again and get your next target. It may be 100 signups or, you know, 50 offer purchases, whatever it may be. And then you take off a web or you literally open up to MailChimp. And that's because the pixel, the Facebook pixel, which is tracking all this progress and tracking your conversions and so on, learns with time and the more data you feed it and the more conversions you get and the more offers that are taken, the more it learns. So when you start really tight, it keeps things nice and precise, let things learn, let the performance come and then slowly open up as you go. And then two of the simple things you can do for audiences is literally sniff your competition. So visit their websites so you get cook it and they start retargeting retargeting you on Facebook showing you their adverts, like their page, of course, and then you can see what stuff they show to their audience. But you can also check their ad targeting. So if you see their adverts, which you might not do if you didn't visit their page or website, and you simply do that by when you see their advert, clicking on the top right hand side and clicking on why am I seeing this? And it will actually show you the targeting that your competitor is using on you. So in this example I've got on screen, it's showing that this advert has been targeted to me because I'm interested in Google Analytics, which is true. And I'm within the 18 to 55 age range living in the UK. So by doing that, you get to see how your competitors are targeting you. And over time, you can build up a picture. In fact, build up a scrapbook, you know, as you go through this, go through this process and start seeing adverts that you like and adverts from your competitors. I just screenshot them, stick them in a word doc or Google doc and just put some notes against them and just over time build up a little scrapbook of good, bad and competitor adverts just to keep your finger on the pulse, essentially. There are tools out there such as addicted IO and so on that will show you competitor adverts. But there's also the free route of just creating a little scrapbook. So that was rule number three, your audience rule number. Did that all make sense? I know I'm covering quite a lot quite quickly now. Mainly yeses. If you wait till the end, oh, how do I say your name? Good Trudge. If you wait, that'll do. Sorry. If you wait till the end, I will answer your questions. Cool. OK. Right. Rule number four, negative audiences. So the opposing side of people you're trying to target, you also want to exclude people who are unlikely to take your offer. So this is something that people often don't talk about and they should. It's equally important. So let's think about logical exclusions here. So you need to exclude people who have already got your offer. So if you set up a custom conversion in in Facebook, say you have a thank you page for the offer, then you want to create an audience for that and exclude it in your targeting. If you're targeting multiple interests in your campaigns, you want to exclude one from the other. So you don't have overlap. So going back to my earlier example, we had MailChimp and Aweber and USA Today will say that you had one campaign targeting MailChimp and Aweber. But then you wanted to target USA Today, you wouldn't include MailChimp and Aweber in the USA Today, and you'd exclude the USA Today in your MailChimp and Aweber campaign. I hope that makes sense. That does reduce your audience size, but it just stops overlap. And I'll get into that later because frequency is a bit of a killer. Also, subject and interest bias. What do I mean by that? Well, someone who likes fast food is probably not going to like health food. So let's say that you are, I don't know, Burger King or McDonald's or KFC or whatever. If you're running an offer, you probably want to exclude vegans and vegetarians and people who've shown interest in health food and health products and healthy brands. I mean, it now sounds like common sense when you think about it, but you'd be surprised how many people don't think about it. So that's what exclusion is about. You have to use your your sort of common sense a little bit, but think logically around this. There is another way to do it, and that's in Google Analytics. So you can use on top of demographic and behavior based negatives that are in Facebook. You can use your demographics, so age, gender, country, region, city, etc. So in your Google Analytics, if you go to your audience, demographics and age drop down and then you can add a set. I haven't done it here on the screenshot, but you can add a secondary dimension of gender. So you then use the comparison tool in the top right hand corner highlighted here. And essentially what I'm showing you here is the total number of sessions by age range and then the e-commerce conversion rate based on the age range. So as we can see here, anyone that's under the age of sort of 45, 40, 4, are converting much lower than those above 45 and particularly much lower than people of 55 and upwards. So you could exclude the younger generation to give you a bump in your conversions and you're hitting your goal on Facebook by removing your weaker demographics in analytics. So I love using analytics for this sort of thing. It just... Well, if you think about it, you essentially will half the size of the audience here, but you could double, if not triple, the conversion rate as a result. And you won't... you'll probably pay less per conversion as a result too. So, yeah, logical exclusions, negative audiences. So people who already got the offer, targets that you're using in other campaigns, subject bias, and of course, people who are less likely to convert from your Google Analytics. So negative audiences, really key. And that's rule number four. OK, there's not a lot of comments going on. I'm assuming you're listening to me because not many people... I actually had only one person leave in the past sort of 15 minutes. That's good. That means you're all either asleep or paying attention, not asleep. Thanks, John. Not asleep. Yeah, Debbie. Furiously writing. Yes, good. I will give you the slides. Don't worry. I'll give you the slides. Rule number five, your images. So as I alluded to in rule number two, call to actions and the offer, you don't have to stamp things like free all over your images. And you don't really want to look like an advert. You want to do your best to look like content on Facebook because people often scroll past adverts as a sort of second nature now, unfortunately. So don't make your advert smack of advert. Anyway, images. So there used to be a 20% max text rule. Which meant that you could literally only have 20% text on your image. Facebook has removed this rule. However, I'm highlighting it because there's still an algorithm that deals with text. Essentially, if you can get away of having little or no text on your image, then you will get a faster delivery and you will typically pay less per click. Now, it's normally a very small amount of text has a very minimal impact. But the more text you add, the worse your delivery, the more you pay. It's very important to remember that. The other thing I want to point out about your images on ads is that they do have a dramatic effect. So I'm going to show you a bad example here because this is what I would call a crowd pleaser. So your your image attracts engagement. The right image will attract clicks, which is what you want. But the wrong image will also attract clicks. Let me show you an example from our own experience. This is my agency, my media. As you can see, this advert is unusual. You can buy anything online, but you can you sell it? So this was for a big content piece that we did on e-commerce marketing, essentially. And there's a kitten in a shopping cart or shopping trolley, as we'd say, in the UK. 11.7% click through rates. John says that's a whopper. Yes, it is. That's a that's a big click through rate. That's pretty impressive. However, as a result, we got 173 clicks before we turned it off, which is actually irrelevant. We got them for 6p each. That's what's relevant. That's really, really cheap for a cold click from a cold audience. Never seen as before. 6p is mega cheap. It's about 7 cents, I think. Or yeah, about that. Same for euros and dollars. However, look how low the engagement on the advert was. So 173 clicks and just a handful of engagements. Worse still, the landing page metrics were atrocious. The bounce rate, I think, was 100%. And this was a multi-page content piece. So the conclusion was, because we found out, when we moved to a less click happy crowd pleasing image, the click through rate dropped down much, much lower. But the and the cost went up, unfortunately. But the engagement metrics at the other ends at the time that people spent on the website and they actually browsed around and consume the content just went up and up and up. So this image attracted loads of clicks. Yay, really cheap. Yay. But all the, for all the wrong reasons. So it was crap. So be careful. In fact, I'm going to reverse back up to that slide. Remember, the right image will attract clicks, but so will the wrong one. Don't be a crowd pleaser for the wrong reasons. So how do we test images then? Well, I like to keep two to three ads per ad set to start with. And that normally means you write one ad and you test two or three images. So the same advert, but you cycle the images. So you then get to test the image instead of the text. You can also text the same image with text on it or without, you know, text overlay or without text overlay. You can try a little trick. I don't know if you cast it as a trick, but what is classed as a or what's known as the gender swap. So don't overdo it, but showing a female to males and male to females. I just saw a comment in the chat that I'm not going to repeat, John. But yeah, the gender swap is essentially it's the natural thing. Men are probably more likely to look at an image of a woman and so on and so forth. It is what it is. You can try it. The one thing that's better, pattern breaks and social proof. So a pattern break is essentially changing the form and the and the feel of an image based on its surroundings. So Facebook's very square. It's top to bottom grid like. So if you actually put a diagonal cut or a circle or something, you know, a cylinder shape or something's rounded or diagonal in the image, that's classed as a pattern break in terms of an image. So you're essentially cutting across a very formulaic arrangement like Facebook, which is grid. So on the desktop, you've got a grid on the left. You've got a grid down the middle, which is your feed and you've got a grid on your right of options and right hand side adverts. So yeah, pattern breaks good. Social proof is probably the best and that is things like, you know, testimonials and that kind of thing. And I'm going to show you an example because you might be thinking, well, how the hell do you do that? I'll show you an example. So this is pattern breaking. This is another advert from my agency and this did really well. So this was for a download of a guide, a guide that I wrote personally. It was converting at 58 percent, 58 percent over a thousand conversions. So that's phenomenal. And I believe the cost per goal, I haven't actually put it in my notes, was around about 60 something pence, so about 70 cents. That's really good. And we tried this image, you know, just straight and a couple of pages just on the horizontal. And literally by moving it to a sort of 20 degree angle or whatever it may be there, the click through rate literally doubled. It's crazy. So it's because it's a pattern break. So as you're scrolling down your news feed, this diagonal piece stands out and it honestly doubled the click through rate, which dropped the cost per conversion down. Brilliant. Really simple. So here's an attention grabbing image, which I have saved from a guy that I don't know who is Larry C. There's a good example here because I thought it was quite interesting to use a bit of provocative wording. And again, a lady looking at the text. I just thought it was quite clever. So it's for a free MIDI course, but he's using a attention grabbing image and not necessarily pattern break here, but a bit of humor, depending on your take. So I quite like this image. I thought I'd share that, share that with you. But where's the social proof? The one thing that failed this advert is that there's no engagement, which is really rubbish because we are creatures of sort of herd mentality and people do follow one another. Cheap like when you see this has been proven in psychology has been proven in tests. But when you see engagement on ads, you're more likely to engage with it because essentially it's proof, you know, well, other people like it. So there must be something good about it. So on this subject, you might be thinking, well, if I start, if I create an advert right now at this minute and time and I put it live, it's going to have no engagement on it. So what I would suggest is that you create a very quick engagement campaign as well. And, you know, for $5, five quid, whatever, don't have to spend a huge amount of money on it. And just fire it to the same advert that you're running for clicks or conversions. And, you know, use your page likes, use the people the most warm to you and most likely to engage with your ad just to give it that initial kick. So you're essentially paying for a bit of vanity, but in the long run, it does help. So that's social proof of one form. Here's social proof of a different form. And this is your OTPO. I really like this. I'll be honest with you. So there's a LinkedIn ad and a Facebook ad here. They're using the same theme across the two platforms. But I really like this idea. I'd give this quite, you know, nine out of 10, 10 out of 10. The inclusion of people, star ratings and, you know, accompanying quote or social proof. The fact is it's not a real testimonial, but it gives you that feel, that look and feel. And it stopped me from scrolling and interested me. So I thought I'd copy it out here and give you it as an example. So that's kind of a different social proof. The whole, you know, we have the whole engagement social proof where people are literally engaging with your ad and then social proof in that you're using testimonials and reviews and so on. Okay. So if you don't have a scrapbook of images and you don't have any tools because you don't want to pay for them, then you could get some image inspiration from Google. Literally using Google's image search. I'm not going to try and explain the way that Google image search works. It's a complicated algorithm, but essentially the, when you type in a topic or a niche, the images that you're seeing at the top of Google's image search are considered to be more relevant and more engaged with than the ones further down. So you could literally start putting keywords from your ad copy and finding the kind of images that Google image search considers relevant. And that will help hopefully give you ideas and help get your creative juices flowing. So the other important thing to do is remain on brand. So when you're doing image tests and using images, try and keep and stick to a certain look and feel. Because over time, if you're, you know, unless you're one and done and closing up shop tomorrow, you want people to become familiar with you. So include your brand logo where possible, stick to a certain color palette, feel and familiarity. So people get to understand what you look like over time. Because the people that do want to consume your stuff, they want your content, they want your offers, they want to buy your things, they will automatically gravitate to your adverts if they recognize them. I mentioned this slightly earlier, but I'm not affiliated with this tool in the slightest. It is one of the cheaper tools on the market. It's quite good. It does have some free examples, but addicted IO is, I can't remember, I think it's $30 a month or something like that to start with. But it allows you to find viral ads, ads by topic and type, the amount of comments and engagement, video ads, recently published ads, you know, so you can find stuff that your competitors are doing or bigger competitors are doing. Excuse me, just adjusting on my chair and get the soil bottom. It's a nice little tool. It's not too expensive and it's got a very big archive of ads. So if you literally run out of ideas, addicted IO is pretty, pretty good. I mentioned this earlier. See ads you like, keep a scrapbook, annotate it. It's, you know, it's free, doesn't hurt. And we're all guilty of it. We're probably on social media far too often. And this goes for Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter ads, you name it. If you see an ad that stands out, it makes you want to click it, grab a screenshot, annotate it and just leave a note of why you liked it. So rule five out the way images really important. The last but not least, rule six is landing page. So the destination page. When someone clicks your advert, where do they land on your website? What page? So continuity is king when it comes to ad to landing page experience. And what I mean by that is that if your advert is great, your offer is great, you've got your call to action right, you've got your image right or you're testing some different images and they're working, you know, you're finding a winner and you pause off the losing advert brilliant. But then if your landing page doesn't look, feel, talk, sound like the advert, you will literally kill your conversion rate, you'll be leaving money on the table. And low conversions essentially hurt your pocket, they hurt your goal, and they do impact your performance because Facebook is also measuring your goals. And if you have a lower conversion rate, it will impact what you pay. It's as simple as that. Yeah, I mean, most people know this by now, hopefully, attention short, people need to be grabbed within sort of five to eight seconds. So that's another thing. If your page doesn't grab someone's attention, to be honest with you, if you get the continuity right, this is less of an issue, but it's still an issue. So make your headline clear, crisp, concise, make it fit with the advert, make it look like the advert. What do I mean by that? Let me show you an example. So here's a bad example. Sorry, nutmeg, which is a UK business. This is a great carousel advert. I really liked the advert. You know, not ignoring the copy. I didn't even read it. I just saw it and thought this is a cool little carousel. So there's a visual, lovely visual carousel. Great. Click the advert. And what is this? Not only is the headline different to what the advert is showing us, they didn't replicate any of the imagery from the advert. And I don't understand why. So it feels like a completely different experience. So remember, continuity is key. Well, they've got the images wrong. The only thing that flows is the name nutmeg, really. The text isn't the same. The advert says set a risk level. We'll build you a diverse portfolio and so on. You get to the page and it says smart online general investment portfolio. It's got a picture of a mobile, which doesn't even have the same image on as the advert. So this, I think this is a missed opportunity because the adverts really visual, simple, clean. If they just put that one, two, three step under this headline or, you know, instead of the mobile image, I just would have pulled it back in for me. I don't want to labour this one too much. Here's another bad example from people that should know better. Sorry, Nanagans. Nanagans are a very big company. But the reason I don't like this one is because of the image. So look at the difference. The image is completely odd with the landing page. Completely odd. Why didn't they include the image on the landing page or include the image of the book on the ad? I reckon, in fact, I would bet that if they tweet that, they'd increase their conversion rates on this landing page because the page itself is not too bad. Although I would also test having a form on the right because in the West we read left to right. Yeah, we always put the forms on the right because they seem to convert better. We did try them in the middle on stage and even floating and all sorts. But yeah, the convention is that forms on the right convert better. But hey, we're talking about ads here. So yeah, there's another bad example. What was even worse is this happened. So I tried to leave and they slapped me in the face with a bloody pop up that wasn't even relevant to the ad. So God, don't be like them. You've probably got a smaller budget than them. So you've got to be more precise than this. Gets better. Another big boy, Adobe this time. So very straightforward, striking advert, special offer. Essentially get 10 images, search and find your images. A couple of things here that that don't quite match up is the headline to the ad. But also the image. Why are they not using the image from the advert in the landing page? Really simple continuity thing. And why not try overlaying the search box on the image as well? Just so there's that pure continuity when you get from the ad to the image. Really simple ad, very striking landing page. Yeah, just continuity. It makes so much difference to conversion conversion rates. Okay, so as I said, attention is short. Hence, I'm showing you bad examples, slightly better example, and then some more attention grabbing examples. Like I say, if you if you want to keep it simple, it's just to replicate the ad copy on the landing page, you know, visually and textually replicate, keep it simple, keep it uncluttered, remove distractions, just put what was in the ad or very similar on your landing page with similar visuals and your halfway there. And if you also want to improve things with attention grabbing stuff, then here's two examples that are doing just that as a GoPro. Really simple and elegant product shot with a simple title, and then a moving obviously you can't see it moving, but a video in the background portraying the product in action. Really simple, really visual, instantly captures your attention. On the right is Nest, which is a thermostat, not a very sexy or exciting product. But they've done a very good job here. The headline's great. It's essentially saying that it's going to pay for itself, but they've made it look sexy. So they made the product sexy, attractive, but the attention grabber is the ticking sort of energy saved clock, which ticks up and up and up kilowatts per hour. So that you know, two different ways of grabbing attention. There's something moving on the pages in a video or something moving as in a ticker, a timer, whatever that may be, you could even do that with a countdown timer again, so long as it's genuine. And there is a genuine urgency, or perhaps you've got a countdown timer for shipping, so you can get your offer, you know, within 24 hours or whatever, if you order it by X time. So think about it that way, how to grab attention. However, I can do a lot better than this. We've actually written a big, filterable landing page templates, examples, inspiration, design guide. If you google it, landing page examples and look for Midas Media, it's called the complete landing page examples. There's over 60 examples there. And the reason I'm asking you to google it is that it's on the bottom of the first page roughly and the more people that Google it and click on it, the more it will help it come up the rankings. So that's why I'm asking you to Google it a little bit selfish there. But if you want some landing page examples in great detail, all of them are scored out of 100 with pros and cons. This is a great piece. So again, rule six is your landing page, focused on continuity and congruence. If you want inspiration, jump across to that and you will find loads. Okay, so that's it. Six rules. Let's just quickly catch a breath and recap before I lose my voice. So the six rules to avoid Facebook ad failure are number one, your office, the right product to the right person with the right message at the right time. Number two is the call to action. So you're the one thing you want people to do the action they take. Rule three is the right audience. So test your message on warm audiences first. Rule number four, remember your negative. So exclude those who have or won't take action. So they've already taken action already converted. And those who are unlikely to rule number five is your image. So no gimmicks, keep it relevant. And that is true of rule six. The landing page continuity is the critical part of that. Okay, so that's the six rules. But what happens if your performance isn't where you want it to be or it's tanking? So here are a few quick tips to support the six rules. So what happens when it all goes wrong? These are like the cherry on the cake. I can see there's lots of questions coming in. I'm going to answer questions at the end. So I'm just going to rattle through these quick tips for performance for you. Number one is my targeting right. So three big giveaways that you're targeting is off is number one is your click through rate. So when you're looking at your campaigns and your performance, your click through rate is below 1%. That's really quite poor. The average in the Western world at least is roughly 1.5% or thereabouts. You want to be better than that because you want to be better than average. Relevant score that we've touched on. And I'm going to show you more about that very shortly. You want it to be above five because relevance is essentially saying that Facebook is measuring how relevant your ad is to the audience based on many different data points, but the lower the relevance, the more you pay. And if your engagement is sucky, so if you've got no engagement or very low engagement, that tells you that your ad and audience match could be off. So those are the three telltale signs. AB testing. Is everyone familiar? Got a few yeses. Split testing. Yeah, split testing, variation testing, AB testing. So here's three rules of thumb for AB tests. So let's assume you've got one campaign, one goal, and one ad set. And you put two adverts in there. So you've got your AB, you've got your AB test, you might be testing the image. Well, if you're on a small budget, so something like $5 a day, five pounds a day, then a very quick test would be to get to 100 clicks or conversions of your goal. Or 500 impressions is a sort of looser target. So that's essentially a very quick AB test. You set your budget, you let it run, you let it get to your 100 data points, and then you declare a winner after that and optimize from there. So you let it run. Now, if you've got a sort of mid size budget, probably, you know, five to 10 times that size, then your goal should be in proportion. So more like 500, excuse me, 500 clicks or conversions, or 10,000 impressions or more. But again, I prefer the actual goal metrics of clicks and conversions. And then you declare a winner after that. If you've got a big budget, then the rule is that statistical significance becomes more important over time. So the more data points you get, the more statistical significance you get. So 1000 clicks is a very nice number or 1000 conversions is a very, very nice number to achieve to definitely declare a winner. If you've got two ads running, and you get to 1000 conversions, you will probably find that one beats the other. So why do we have these simple rules for AB testing? It's essentially to stop you from making too many changes, trying too many things and declaring a winner too soon. So don't skew things, set a target, set a budget, let it run, let it hit the target. That's the best way to do a test. Next, big audiences is another problem that I see. Going too wide too soon, we touched on this earlier when we spoke about layering audiences. But if you have a really big audience, for example, we were looking at MailChimp, weren't we? And I think it was something like 900,000 people, then you typically lower your relevance, you lower the clicks, and you pay more as a result. The only exception to this is when you've got a really solid lookalikes. So say you've had 1000 or 1500 conversions, then you build a lookalike off those. That's the only time I would consider that to be a not too big but pretty solid audience because that might be half a million if it's US or UK. And I would say that that's an okay starting audience if you've got that seed data to start with. So of course, quick hint, remember your exclusions and your negatives to narrow. Next problem I see, auto placements. Okay, so yeah, desktop is often the better converter, but it can be more or is more per click. So mobile often wins the CPA battle. What I mean by that is desktop and mobile feeds because by default, Facebook, the recommendation is that it will optimize for you. Now in our experience, actually, that's probably too soon and too presumptive. And we like to start off with just desktop or just mobile feeds first, measure the goals, measure the metrics, get to the point where we want to be. So we hit our 100 goals, let's say, and then expand. So start using Instagram, the audience networks and so on. Right hand side ads, we typically use those for retargeting because they're not as cheap as you think because the impressions on the right hand side can go quite high. So the frequency can go quite high. So we use right hand side as normally for very warm audiences that are close to converting, they might have been to the basket and not quite committed. That's how we use those. Okay, and then how should I beard? I hear this question quite a lot. Two really simple rules here. Let Facebook optimize it for you. Simple as that. If you've set a goal, it does a very good job, quite frankly. Or secondly, if you've got a campaign that's working really well, you're hitting your goals, you're doing your thing, then overbid. Overbid by at least half. I like off numbers that aren't round. So I like things like if you're going for 25%, I like 27%. If it's 50%, 53%, or whatever it may be. Now overbidding is because this teaches the algorithm that you're prepared to pay more and you're prepared to pay for the best. If you underbid, you're essentially telling the bid engine, the algorithm that you only want the crap. The people that are less engaged, the people are less likely to do your thing, because no one else wants to pay for them. So very, very rarely. In fact, I can't remember the last time we underbid on a audience. It's either automatic or overbid. Now overbid, you, of course, but not necessarily will pay more per click, but those clicks are typically of higher quality or higher standards of people more likely to do your thing. And over time, that actually does reduce your cost per conversion cost per goal. So it might seem counterintuitive, but that's just the way it works. You've probably seen this, your performance drops with time. That's because frequency is a killer and you should watch it like a hawk. So frequency is essentially how many times the same person sees your advert over and over again. Here's a quick image taken from our espresso and our results are very similar to this, to be honest with you. Once you get to sort of frequency four or five, the click through rate not only drops significantly, but the cost per click rises at a more, I don't know if exponentials the right word here, but it rises at a higher rate than the click through rate drop off, if that makes sense. So you stop paying more and more and more as frequency gets higher. Essentially, frequency is telling you people are getting bored of your advert. So the stats are that when someone sees your advert twice, the click through rate drops by 9%. At the point they see you'll add four times the cost per click, that cost per interaction was 23 and a bit, you know, for all intents and purposes, a quarter higher, 25% higher. So how do we avoid a fatigue? We like to set our limits around about five on the frequency scale. So once things start hitting four to five, we're looking at them, watching them like a hawk. We set rules in Facebook, which is very simple to do. So once your frequency hits a certain number, you can pause an advert or an ad set or even entire campaign. Another way to get around it is to refresh your advert. So simply changing an image can work. A tweak of the text, the copy, the headline. You know, I had to remove a question. Remember the offer, you know, positioning, are you struggling with X, get Y to achieve, so on and so forth, you know, that kind of questioning. So that's how to avoid fatigue. And you do want to watch it, set up your rules, keep refreshing your adverts. And this becomes less of a problem the more you expand your audience, of course, but you've got to get our audience to work first. So those are a few quick tips on how to avoid further performance issues. And taking breath. I'm noticing that I'm just going to take a swag of my drink. Bear with me a second. Oh, it's better. Kate's enjoying a cup of tea. Kate, surely that tea will be cold by now. We've been here quite a while. I'm getting lots of comments coming in, which is brilliant. And lots I won't be replying to straight away because I think I've got to go back through. I'm noticing a load of questions around the rules and these tips. So if I don't get to your question, I'm going to answer them very soon. Just send me an email. And I'll do my best over the coming week to answer those for you. So learn at edleak.com. Right. What next? I promised if you stuck with me to the end that I'd have a few offers for you, special offers, and these are for your eyes only. I'm not offering these to anyone else anywhere. So firstly, if you're running an online store and you're advertising on Facebook, well, that's why you're on this webinar. I've got a secret sales weapon. I've shown you six rules and now I'm going to show you how to get sales on autopilot with pixel precision for e-commerce. So what is pixel precision? It's a mini course that I've done and it's to show you how to install the pixel, how to use it correctly, how to season it, set up conversion data, but also how to set up your product catalog and get your products on Facebook and set up the one campaign that every store owner, every online shop owner needs to drive sales on autopilot and in a very short space of time. So that's pixel precision in a nutshell. There's also some advanced retargeting tactics for the Facebook pixel in there as well. This is sort of like a no brainer course. I mean, if you run a store and you advertise on Facebook, you need this course, honestly. Today, for you, it's a special offer. It's normally $97. It's a one-time payment, 30-day money back guarantee. It's a great little course and you can get it. Special one-time payment, $47, sales on autopilot using the Facebook pixel. But there's more. That's the little offer. Here's the bigger bonus offer. So this is giving you the Facebook pixel precision course completely free access to a brand new members only VIP Facebook group. It's only for people who buy courses off me and work with me on the courses and so forth. I'll be active in the group answering questions. The whole point of this group is that store owners and e-commerce people can come together, marketers, store owners on, ask questions, give feedback, give advice, show their wins, show what's working, what's not working because you learn way more from failure than you do from success. Just a feedback loop for us all to help each other grow, get better, and I'll be there answering questions and dipping in as well. I'm also completely free. Each month I'm going to do a round up a recording where I answer specific questions in the group and questions that I've received off the back of the courses. So I'll be doing that to just add extra value to the group. I want this to be a really great little Facebook, well not necessary little, but a Facebook group that we all use and we find super valuing. Then I'm going to give you my flagship course which is analytic secrets that get every sale from AdWords, which again it is for e-commerce people, store owners and marketers. So what is analytic secrets for AdWords? As I say, this is my flagship course and she helped a guy called Jim who's selling online. He set up a store and for a bad year he struggled to break a few grand a month and he went, we took him using this course from 39 odd thousand dollars to 1.1 million over 1.1 million in just 12 months and he's now doing around about 200k just over a month using not all just some of the tactics from this training course. So it works, it absolutely works and it's essentially all my expertise and experience distilled into all the best bits from over the years how to use analytics and AdWords together and remarketing and a few other bits and pieces. So it's not the basics, it doesn't tell you how to set up AdWords, it's not about that, it's about ditching the theory and me showing you real world examples, hands-on how to use analytics to extract all this stuff that helps you sell more and you can literally apply one or two videos in the next day or two and you will make your money back. I'll eat my hat, I'll eat my chair, in fact if you buy this course and you don't make money, tell me and I'll send you a picture, I'll send you a video of me in my chair, I don't know how that's going to go down but I might cook it first.

Okay right before I lose my voice let's dive through some questions, I've got one from Lily, just scrolling back through, when I run split tests I get loads of ads but sometimes my best converting one doesn't have any comments and likes, how do I move my comments and likes from one ad to the other? Hey Lily, so each ad set you create creates its own advert essentially so you need to use an existing post, an existing ad instead of creating new ads each time and you do this when you go to your ad manager menu at the top then you click on page posts in the top menu and what you can do is find your post which is actually an advert, your best performing post, two things here, first publish it to your wall if it's appropriate so you publish your advert to your wall so you get organic engagement also but then the id at the top of the ad in your page posts dashboard or area of the menu, that id you use that when you create your ads in your ad set so it allows you to instead of creating an ad there's a tab when you create an ad set that says use existing ad or use existing post sorry you put that id in there and you can do that for every single ad set and it will always use that single ad or post and like I said quick tip post it to your wall you also get organic engagement from your ad and of course people can then see the ad and the engagement building up, hope that answers the question. Tommy my ads keep getting disproved but there's no text in image okay well this could be more than just image in the sorry might not be an image issue then Tommy make sure you're not identifying individual audience characteristics in your ad copy but also make sure your destination page is legal and by that I mean you've got contact information at the very least in the footer like a trademark or a copyright or a privacy you know statement definitely have a link to your privacy policy in the footer that's the single biggest thing that will get your ads disapproved if you send someone to a page that doesn't have a privacy policy and if you're manually getting manually vetted then the person vetting your ad will look for signs of life on your page to make sure you're not a scammer so they want to make sure you're a real business so Facebook are very protective of their platform have that as they should be so just make sure you've got your company name perhaps a contact address or a link to a contact page and 100% always have a privacy policy link in there as well that might be a problem you don't have oh right so you do okay that's probably a problem if you don't have a privacy sorry yeah Tommy has just replied don't have a privacy policy google privacy policy templates Tommy you'll find loads also go and look at Facebook's privacy policy and you can literally you know write a few lines to do with that you can even link to their privacy policy to say that you comply with this and people taking action on your website are also you know adhering to that and sorry I just whacked the microphone um Kate do you find ads perform better at night do you mean Facebook ads Kate oh god you asked this question ages ago um I'm sorry I can't scroll back up to to find your reply to that I'm going to assume you mean Facebook so you can actually report on this in your ad manager and your analytics as well because you can drill down by what's known as day parting but in Facebook under the breakdown tab in your ad manager your you can do it by time so your performance will be different to mine so to answer your question we use the default delivery of 24 7 do we find the ads perform better at night not necessarily it really just depend on what you're selling into who so use your own reports in your breakdown tab and then if you find that that's the case you want to start scheduling your ads to go out at specific times a day again that's a facility that Facebook now offers so you can essentially look at your reports find your sweet spot and then schedule your ads to go out word of excuse me word of warning if you've got a small audience you will essentially cap your reach because not everyone will be on at the times that you are targeting so just a quick caveat there Tony bought the course doubled our sales oh awesome Tony bought the course doubled his sales in the first few weeks it's pure gold ed i'm watching everything you put out now dude thank you dude seriously that's awesome in fact Tony i'm going to send you send me an email because if you've doubled your sales i'd like to do a little bit of a testimonial with you or just get you on a on skype or something just to discuss because that's brilliant i don't know when you bought the course Tony Tony i'm trying to think i can't see his surname so but the course hasn't been live that long so if you've doubled your sales already that's pretty awesome thank you very much rehan how much time do i need to invest in the course to see results okay so the pixel um i don't know which course you mean if you mean both well the pixel perfection course can be rolled out in literally an hour the analytics course is around about three hours or so but take it step by step so invest an hour or two a week um or whatever pace you feel suits you i mean literally take a video or two focus on those you know test them roll them out uh and and go there so just improve your performance in increments you know you don't you don't have to do everything at once just take it at your own pace get inside the facebook group as well and um make sure you start asking questions in there as you go through the course because i'll be there to help and everyone else too that'd be good nice group sort of feedback and i can't remember who i said it to but i'll eat my chair if you don't get some results from just doing even a bit by bit piecemeal angeloce hey ed great to be here uh what would you do with a limited budget if you can't afford too many clicks okay angeloce there's quite a open-ended question if it's a if your budget limited if you literally don't have the money to spend then go for video the reason being video is cheap you keep people on facebook so facebook allowed you to build an audience on facebook for cheap you know for pennies on the dollar per view and don't don't be um blinded by the fact you can get a penny view you want views that are 25 50 75 percent and beyond which you will pay more for but you can build that audience on facebook and then you can remark it to those you know a week later or whatever it may be and in theory they should be more receptive so yeah i if you can start with videos even if it's just you doing videos about your product or your offer whatever it may be rio has said i'm signed up love your videos can't wait to get started that's awesome rio thank you very much thank you thank you uh james tea james tea you've got a new student ed this is the best thank you thank you james that's awesome uh and debbie as well brilliant that's great john um not signed it up yet we sell high end products spend around 10k per month on ads but we're not sure which channel is working because the sales cycle can be very long will the analytics secrets help us fix this 100 percent yeah i show you multi channel funnels uh time lag uh lag path lengths attribution models all sorts of stuff in there that helps you um understand how channels work together and your different campaigns work together so yeah definitely uh john definitely for you laura what ad placements do you recommend for a newbie so as i said earlier in the tips at the end after the six rules laura i don't know if you asked this before we got to that uh what's the time on it anyway if you're just starting out laura pick mobile feeds they're typically cheaper than desktop and they've got you know you've got a bigger audience on mobile feeds um and to be honest there's less nuances than other options you know mobile ads are pretty straightforward so keep it simple to start i am really close to losing high voice now folks uh david i've been using google and facebook ads for a few years now i feel like i've got the measure of it is your course for me well yeah two things not being no disrespect but you're here today so you're obviously still thinking that you can learn more which is great because we can all always learn more so i'd say 100 percent um you in fact you're in the same boat as one of uh my other students who he runs two two stores uh two shops he's been doing it for years making good money within hours of purchasing the calls he literally said it opened his eyes to the opportunities so yes 100 you could definitely learn something from this and remember there's a 30 day money back guarantee so the risk is all on me i hope that answers your question and neil says i i need approval from my boss but i don't want to miss the offer okay now that's fine neil if you're worried about missing the offer just send me a quick email learn at edleek.com and just put in the subject something like uh extend offer and we'll sort something out if you need to get approval from your boss then not a problem at all i'd rather have you on the course then you miss out just take another drink bear me a second oh my voice is really about to go sam has asked how advanced is the course i'm pretty new to online advertising okay sam so the facebook pixel perfection course is pretty easy in fact i'd say it's very easy um i hired a junior member of staff and i gave them the course and they went through it pretty much flawlessly so they had no experience really of the contents um so yeah it you'll be fine now because it's step by step so the analytics secrets course is of course that's more in depth it's a bigger course but i show you step by step how to do things literally take you through on the screen navigation uh around analytics and everything so i i suggest that i take intermediate and advanced subjects and just make them achievable for everyone um in fact i'd like to think that i make them more simple than they would be if you were trying to research and do them on your own and dave how long until i start making money smiley face dave as soon as you put the material to work you'll make money action take action my friend and you will make money smiley face and another dave i'm in is that the same dave i don't know oh no it can't be because that's after dave okay brilliant thank you dave dave too maria um is this lifetime access yeah see this this is an earlier question yeah this is absolutely you get lifetime access and free updates when i add them um this is essentially i see this is just the start of a journey and i can only see it getting better and better as we head along and go along this journey together i care a lot about what i do and the results you you guys get you know i'm a business owner myself and it's all about the results so this this is a journey i want this to be i want you to look back in the year and go you know that was phenomenal thank you so much wouldn't miss it for the world kind of situation quite frankly and that's not not a an ego thing that's just would please me immensely i like to see people succeed quite frankly um same for my staff same for my clients and same for people that are with me on this journey i'm going to finish off one one two more questions jr best metric that isn't a conversion okay jr well it depends on what you're doing but frequency is pretty high up on the list uh of best metrics because it's it negatively impacts your your advertising you know it it impacts so many things your cost your clicks your conversions so i'd have to say that frequency creeping up is a very important metric to watch and i've got russell um uh matthews is that right both signed up brilliant that's great to hear thank you great to have you on on board russell uh matthews and everyone else as well so okay i think we'll call it a day there because otherwise we're gonna um eclipse the the two hour mark and my voice is literally gonna vanish so thank you for spending your time with me today it's been great i'm incredibly excited uh to see all on the other side and get started and um yeah keep an eye out for your emails because i'm going to send you i'll send you the links to the offers and i'll send you the
