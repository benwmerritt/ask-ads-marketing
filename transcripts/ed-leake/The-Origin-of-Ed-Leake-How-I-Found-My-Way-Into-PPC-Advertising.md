I remember that my entire career was friction. So I was, I was never punctual, hate being punctual. Um, I hate being told what to do. So I'm a nightmare employee, absolute nightmare. I'm good at the job, but I'm, uh, cock sure. Stubborn and don't try and pin me down to you must be here at precisely 9am or five minutes before because some mornings I might spend an extra 10 minutes on the toilet. So it's, yeah, I'm a pain in the backside. So the delivery was there. It was just the other bits that didn't fall in line. Um, and I remember calling my inner group meeting, my head of department, um, Hitler and, uh, the literally the, the room, the room for falling silent. And I was like, yeah, I should probably look for another job, which I did. Then I went into contracting because I was like, ah, so now I can be my own boss working for other people. So our contract, cause it pays better. It's more flexible. So you go in and you do short term contracts like three to six months or whatever. Um, the first one I did was 18 months cause it did such a good job. And they were paying me so well, but I hated it. So I couldn't leave because I was like, oh, but I'm getting paid well. Yeah. So it's that mindset of, well, better than double, you know, uh, I mean, that kept going on for years. Um, in between all of this, not to bore you, I was still dabbling in technology, building websites. Um, I was still doing stuff. I ain't built built websites for people like on the side and things like that. So I was, I was still doing the bits on the side. So it was, there was spark was always there to do something more than a job. Um, a nine to five. So yeah, uh, it all came to a head in the, okay, what year are we in? So 2010, 2009, 2010, uh, a job I was, I felt stuck in. They all hated me there because like I say, I was outspoken. I was good at the work, but I was outspoken and they didn't like it cause I didn't tow the line, but they couldn't quite fire me cause I delivered. So they just got this frustrating person called Ed, which I knew I was and they were paying me a lot of money from my age and 10, you know, 15 years ago. It was a lot of money. Yeah. So I felt like I couldn't leave that until one day I was just like, you know what? Sod it. And I literally, I left. Uh, it was Christmas Eve Eve and I walked into the director's office and I said, I'm not coming back. Um, there's a long story up to this point, but he essentially said he had an open door policy, apart from for me, cause I would email him and ask him and his door was never open for me. So I was just like, you know what? Bollocks to these people. Yeah. Um, and yeah, I walked in and said, I'm going for Christmas and I won't be coming back and he sort of smiled and laughed. And I just went, I'm serious. And then I walked off and I never went back and they paid me my three months severance. They didn't even question it because I think they realized, Oh, he's a pain in the ass, but also we probably drove him to that as well. So yeah. Yeah. And then out of nowhere started an agency in quotation marks. I started building websites and doing a bit of marketing with my friend. Yeah. Um, my God, the first year I made, I think 6,000 pounds. So essentially I didn't make enough to even pay basic rent. Right. Um, uh, I was nearly a victor in fact. So I've, I've had the ranks to riches story. Um, I had to go to the local council and I don't think I've ever told him on this. And I had to claim, uh, benefits for five weeks to pay my rent. Um, and I remember ringing the guy five weeks later, uh, and I rang him up and I said, Oh, you can cancel my benefits now. I've got a new contract came through a new client. Sorry. And he was like, what do you mean? He said, people don't just claim for five weeks and just, he said, you can claim for three months or six months. And I'm like, no, no, no, I don't need the money. I've, I've now I've got through this patch. And he was literally trying to tell me to keep taking the money. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, I, I'm not, I'm not, my mind is not that way. So I don't need the money from the government. I'm now self self sufficient. Um, and literally from that day forward, it was self sufficient. The first year was rough though in the agency, really rough. I love that story. And, uh, I, I definitely, so much of it corresponds to like, you know, my story. And I think most people's story, when you end up doing your own thing, a lot of it is, well, I'm impossible to work with in any other context, you know what I mean? So it's like a lot of that I really relate to. I'm curious, like in that, in that moment where the agency isn't doing well, and it's before you get that client that kind of rescues you and you're going to get benefits and all that. Were you thinking that you had made a mistake or was it like, no, this is definitely going to work. It's just a down turn. I think, um, I think I've always got that monkey on my shoulder telling me that I've made the mistake. I still to this day have dreams about my final job. Uh, and I'm in a, I'm always with the same people in an awkward scenario where I'm trying to get out. And I think it's my subconscious reminding me that no matter how hard it gets ed, you can't go back there. So you just got to wrestle your way through this. Right. So, um, yeah, I think every single day as a business only or every other day, you think, oh my God, I've made a mistake. Um, but I'm being a little bit facetious. Perhaps in the first six or seven years, I thought that all the time, the past six or seven years have been very good. Cause I finally figured it out. I didn't have a mentor and so I had to figure it out. Um, so yeah, the, the first year I, I don't know, I was naive. I was like, well, it'll come good. It'll come good. All I've got to do is hard work. And to be fair, if you've got a natural capacity, then hard work can scrape you over the line and drag you over the line and then, you know, build momentum. So yeah, you can just apply yourself and work 20 hours a day and the money will come eventually. But it doesn't, it doesn't always work out. And I think my mindset was just, well, this is what I got to do. I can't expect a free lunch. Right. No one's going to give me this stuff. So I will just battle through it. Um, fast forward about three years. I did actually collapse at the top of the stairs because I'd overwork myself. So I'm not suggesting that the hustle lifestyles are good, good route. Um, but I did, yeah, I went all in. Um, I didn't take any training. I didn't get a coach. I didn't do any of that stuff. So I was literally just learning as I went. So I was putting myself under a lot of pressure in hindsight, but look, hindsight is a wonderful thing. I mean, if I had a time machine, I change everything, not one thing, everything, but that's life. Life, isn't it?
