I work when I want to and don't work when I don't want to. I now just listen to my body, you know what I mean? Because there will be days that I just don't do jack shit. You know what Liam's probably gonna tell us that he doesn't feel fatigued and he just works 20 hours a day and he's absolutely fine. Oh yeah, I look so mosey it so yeah. Yeah, what does uh... Now to be honest what I do is I wake up late, start late and work from when I want to to when I want to finish and that's about it. You know, I work when I want to and don't work when I don't want to. I now just listen to my body, you know what I mean? Because there will be days that I just don't do jack shit and it could be a Monday, it could be a Tuesday, you know? And then there'll be days where I'll work all day from 8am to all the way to 9pm and it's just some days I like that, you know? And it's just that freedom that owning an agency that kind of allows you, you know? So that's my kind of perspective. Yeah, I agree though. I've moved more towards that now. Do you get guilt? Because I get guilt if I don't work a day. Not at all, not a single fucking, not an ounce of guilt at all. The whole point of business is to kind of provide the freedom of the life that you want to live. Like I love my life every single day because I'm doing what I love, you know? I'm not waiting to retire at 60 to, you know, sit by the pool. I'll go sit down by the pool right now and work, you know what I mean? And chill out and do whatever. So it works for me. Yeah, it's weird that I feel guilt. Yeah, I don't know why. It's weird. The days I don't work, I'm like, oh, I should be working. And I don't know. It's weird. Something I need to fix really because I certainly, if anyone else feels that way, you shouldn't do. I need to take my own medicine really. I tell people to simplify things and this, that, the other. And I've gone away from that. And over the past six, 12 months, I've gone away from simplifying things. And guess what? It's having a negative impact. So I need to eat my own dog food and not be worried about feeling guilty about not doing certain things. Yeah, otherwise it's counterproductive. A couple of things for me that make the biggest impact in the world that have nothing to do with work. Is working out like four times a week. If I don't do that, I will feel like shit no matter what I do. Like if I work 10 hours or 50, if I don't work out four times a week, I will feel terrible. Staying really hydrated is also another one that I find is like really easy to forget. But if I don't drink a lot of water throughout the day, again, I start feeling terrible. And so there are little things that I have found like that, that just make it way easier to feel better. I think working out is the biggest one for me. Stuff like that is really easy to forget. But man, if you start just waking up every morning, going and sitting down at your computer, sitting there for eight hours and then going and sitting on the couch or walking around, I mean, I'll just feel terrible no matter what I'm doing. Yeah, yeah, you can't do that. Christ, if anyone's doing that here, you cut the whole doing a bit of exercise, even go for a walk. I think I said it in the mindset bit in the framework. Yeah, I feel like crap if I haven't exercised. And I look and I feel like it looked worse if I haven't exercised. I haven't exercised this morning because I had to empty my office. But yeah, the unlike you, Christ, I'm five, six days a week, gotta be doing something. So I have weights or I'm rowing or walking or whatever. It's you can get away with it when you're younger in your 20s. You could sleep till you, you know, till midday. Wake up and have a McDonald's breakfast and then plug yourself into your computer for, God knows how many hours, but the older you get, the more your body just rejects that lifestyle and you've got to do you got to do something.
