Hi everyone, this is Gabriel. I've been using God Dear Ads for a year now and I wanted to share my thoughts. The content is excellent. It's well structured and super easy to access, whether if you're a beginner or a seasoned advertiser with many years in PPC, I think you'll find the material really helpful. A big plus for me is that the content is updated. So even though Google Ads is always changing, you can be sure that the information that you get from the material is going to be up to date. I definitely recommend you to buy this. The investment for me was totally worth it. If you look out online, I'm pretty sure that you won't find anything like this just because there's not much people with so many years of experience, I think. So yeah, that's my review. Still a lot of content to go over, which I'm really, really excited about it. Thank you.
