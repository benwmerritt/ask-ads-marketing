Well, member of Forge down down by out he hires based on his essentially his culture is mission statement and the cultural value of the agency and a small agency. I thought that was actually really good angle to add on top, you know, to say what we're about. And it's quite rare to see that in job specs. I know that I didn't ever do it really. I mean, I'd say some sort of fuzzy things about client comes first and we're all about the performance. There's something about, yeah. Well, you know, I think there's probably an intangible there about the mission and the culture, which is it kind of comes down to your gut. And, you know, I had some good interviews with folks, but I didn't really like it. And if I'm going to be working with them for, you know, I want to enjoy this person. I want us to have a convivial attitude with each other. So that's so even if you have 10 qualified candidates, how many will really, really like enjoy talking to you every week? For the next three years, you know, you have to, you have to enjoy talking to people that you work with. So That's how I felt every time I entered the office years ago when I'm not in other faces and I just thought, I think they probably all hate me. So your situations, I don't want to say it's cheating, but it's slightly different because you've got an year. I guess if you didn't have an year, she would be the first time on technical. So essentially, it's a balance of your skills, isn't it? Essentially find someone who is your opposite is the is the easiest answer, isn't it? So I'm more technical. But then I've always done the sales and what have you. Well, I've hired salespeople in the past. But I think I had, if I was hiring today, I try and find someone that was really good at the soft skills. Someone that really liked talking to leads and prospects and clients. I don't enjoy it. I have to. I don't enjoy it. I think I'm good at it and I have to but Same as me. It's only because I'm brutally honest is the only reason I'm good at it. I don't, you know, I don't mix my words and I'll tell them that the way it is. But yeah, so essentially higher your higher for your weaknesses is probably the obvious thing.
