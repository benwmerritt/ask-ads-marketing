Hey, it's Ashwin Annette again with episode four of Overbudget. Before we introduce today's guest, make sure you hit the like and subscribe button to our notifications on. This is going to help us get more and more brilliant guests like today's. We're joined by Ben Kruger, who is the CMO of Event Tickets Center, an online ticketing platform. They spend a very large amount of money on Google Ads across Search and Performance Max. Say the number. 120 million. Yes. 120 million dollars a year on Google Ads. So yeah, Ben knows what he's talking about. And he also knows what he's talking about because he used to work at Google as an e-commerce growth consultant. I genuinely believe that if Google had more people like Ben, we'd be complaining a lot less about their ad reps. And then he's worked in direct to consumer. He's worked in SaaS. So Ben's done it all. He's all over the digital marketing landscape. So really happy to have him on board. And I think one of the more independent thinkers in digital marketing, which we need more of desperately. Ben, thank you so much for agreeing to come on the show. Yeah, likewise. Happy to be here. Thanks for that. Awesome intro. I appreciate it. Ben, are you the, I think you're the third? Fourth. Fourth now, the person that's done this. So we're the shitest podcasters in the West. Well, we're not even in the West because Ashwin's sort of in the Middle East-ish, mid Asia. Okay, we're the crappiest podcasters on this two thirds of the, no, that doesn't work either. We're just not very good podcasters. In the Commonwealth. In the Commonwealth. Yes. Oh dear, we're all Britannia. Give me back my tea. So Ben, as an ex-Googler, you're accused of selling the Kool-Aid with P-Max and Automation, but you genuinely believe in it. Tell us why. I do believe in it. We use it to find incremental pockets of growth for us. It has done very well in identifying new angles or themes that we can capture via search, things that we perhaps hadn't historically bid on because it was too competitive or just too challenging or things that we just would have never thought would have converted for our business. P-Max has been able to shed light into and then we take that learning from P-Max and go build a whole search strategy against it. So it's always learning for us and then we're stealing from it and then building it into search where I think people think I drink the Kool-Aid because I think a lot of advertisers think of it as like all or nothing. They look at P-Max and like Google saying use P-Max, use P-Max and all the reps are doing the same. They take the suggestions or the documentation from Google too much and they're interpreting that they need to use P-Max for everything and everything should move over to P-Max where there's a middle ground and even less like I think it's like 10 to 20% of our spend. So I think in the way that you use it there's a better opportunity than having to use it for everything and it being like the one and all campaign for Google. I don't think that that's where we're at and maybe we'll go there and we can talk about like the future but as for now think of it as a dynamic search ad that just finds new search terms to go after. Do you use TSA as well or have you just replaced that with P-Max? We've replaced most of it with P-Max. Oh you heathen. Still a fan of DSA. That's interesting and I take it that's just because it gives you your level of spend it just gives you a broader spectrum of reach and more data because you're going across multiple platforms. Interesting, better than DSA. I think a DSA definitely still has its place. We have as you can imagine a very granular and well built out search structure so we like to think we cover most of the queries and then P-Max we just run pretty much across everything. When you spend 10,000 a month your account obviously is probably quite large and segmented because obviously you do lots of different things. I know you do all sorts of sports and theatrical stuff and just for sort of like a bit of context because obviously we can't visualize it because it's a private company and but I mean how many campaigns and ad groups are we talking about hundreds of campaigns or even bigger or multiple accounts even? Yeah lots of campaigns. We've got for just for any given day there's probably like 120,000 events in the country that are being advertised. Yeah we try to create specific content for as many as we can. How many people manage that? 45 people right now. Yeah but like you know there's a lot of work that has to go on with one example is just like fitting an artist name that is 20 characters into 30 character headlines. There's a lot of work that has to be done there to trim them and you know so make them legible and relevant etc so a good chunk of work and ideation around that. So you've gone from seeing hundreds of accounts to a essentially a single account? That's right yeah yeah. Are you allowed to say how much you spend a month? Yeah I mean we're at like 100 to 120 million a year. Yeah. You know we're selling tickets to events so it really depends on what's going on in the country and it's all US based events but I'd say like probably 10 to 15 million a month about average. A little more when Taylor Swift is on to her I bet. I was just about to say you fucking stole my joke. Oh he's gonna say Swift. I was spending I've been spending too much time around it. I knew exactly what direction he was going. Yes. It's true though. Just to point out an example with like something like Taylor Swift if we were doing CPC bidding or anything but ROAS bidding in my opinion we'd get either get burned or just leave a ton of sales on the table right because the fluctuation in prices and the search queries were so different and you know the intent wasn't always there. People just wanted to see the prices and decide if they would go etc. It really changed things and especially people were traveling for that event more than we typically see right. People were going international or across the country and that changed a lot. Like if we were manually if we had like the old school manual approach to Google ads we'd get burned but because we leaned so heavily into like we call the modern search playbook we were able to fly at the ROAS that we needed and not have to do a ton of work to include or exclude. You know we kind of let the machine do the work there and we had an awesome year during that time. This is not a question that's on the list but you've just called it the modern search playbook. Does that mean stick 10 million quid sorry dollars in P-Max and let it rock? No not at all. P-Max is a low percentage of our overall spend. I personally look at P-Max as like a glorified DSA dynamic search ad that we used to just pick up anything that we're not targeting specifically in our search structure. 80-20 do you think 20 percent of the budgets in P-Max? Probably 10. Oh even less. Yeah it's probably less. We don't have shopping though right there's no there's no shopping so it'd be higher with shopping. So it really is incremental for you guys. Yeah that's how we've set it up yeah and we regularly go through fine search terms in there and then put them into search specifically so we're really just trying to use it for new to find new pockets for us. So I got a question specifically because you said that you have a pretty robust and granular setup so in addition to P-Max what other types of automation do you use to keep everything running because I imagine at that size and structure it just becomes nearly impossible to do it all by hand? We're big proponents of broad match target row as bidding and sharing budgets and a big portfolio bid strategy really just trying to give as much consolidation as we can to the machine for it to make its decisions and then we have some processes you know mind search terms and and make decisions on if we want to add them or exclude them probably really relevant to add a lot of RSA optimizations to try to make you know our ads as relevant as compelling as we can to stand out against the competition so a bunch of different work streams going on there we've got a number of people working on on various aspects of that sort of process. Have you or has the business replaced anyone with automation or AI yet? We haven't replaced anyone and it's not our intention there's so much work to be done that if AI can solve one problem we would love to to move people on to more challenging things and just keep that that rotation going you know. Love that. Yeah there you go there's an optimistic answer yes for anyone listening. Yeah I don't think I mean I've tried a bunch of stuff like it's good enough it's not great. When your boss hands you a nine figure ad budget he or she doesn't expect good enough they expect great. That's fantastic and yeah AI's it's just not there yet. Yeah it's to get you up and running from walking to sprinting but Linford Christie's still going to overtake you and now Linford Christie that's a proper throwback name you might not get the reference uh British track star Usain Bolt would be the modern alternative. Got you. Yes. I think Linford Christie's got a bigger lunchbox but we'll leave it there. I know Ashwin does but I don't normally talk to client side because most of my audience is I'd say it's about 80 agency and freelancer so you've got a completely different take which is good you're less anti and less combative towards Google. Correct. Just by nature. Yes yeah yeah our whole business or most of our business or 98% of our sales come through Google so yeah it doesn't surprise me. Yeah so I'm very pro obviously. Ben came across Mayradar for the first time and he was still with Google and he was basically telling all of us that we're we're stupid for crapping on Pmax and we should just trust the machines and everybody got so mad at him like I still remember people were like who is this guy he has no respect for agencies and I was just like this guy's a fresh breath of air like I may not agree with everything you said but dude it was so nice to hear somebody just be like yeah this this shit is awesome. Yeah I mean I appreciate that and yes I came in hot I think just trying to make some noise but you know when I was at Google I worked with I've seen hundreds of accounts maybe thousands of accounts and like a lot of those people aren't on Twitter and I see it working and so I was just trying to bring that to light in my own little way but yeah that's why I was so pro and trying to call out things that people weren't considering or thinking about. That's the scary thing with PPC pros and their opinions some of them are managing two accounts and this statistical significance is quite low and this is not to poo on them because everyone starts somewhere and everyone has a finite time and resources but yeah you get a lot of strong opinions from people that might not have the data to back it up. I've got Ad Evolver so I've got a lot of data which it does help it does help and I have in the past queried things just to see you know what's the best bidding strategy well there isn't one for a start so that's that answered you don't need data for that but it does prove it so yeah it's. The other thing I wanted to ask because a lot of our viewers and listeners don't manage that level of budget is it specifically because you have that much budget to play with is that why you lean into all of this automation like would you approach it differently if you had one percent of that ad budget? My thought on budgets and Google ads is that budgets should not exist with Google ads I think it's all demand based and you should spend as much as you can at the target that you want to hit and you know we see this every day like demand changes and intent changes on a daily or even hourly level and if you're setting budgets you're either going to leave a ton of sales on the table or you're going to overspend when you don't need to be so we you know I've always been and a lot of my time at Google I was always a proponent of uncapped budgets and using your ROAS or CPA target as the lever to spend versus an artificially made budget because there's no way you could set the right budget and be able to forecast these things like we've seen drastic changes on an hourly or even daily level so budget is not something we even consider or talk about we want to spend as much as we can at the target that we want to achieve. Very different to a local business where there's maybe you know a team of three HVAC engineers or whatever and the limit isn't how many tickets can we sell it's physically booking in the time I think there'd be a lot of small business owners going no budget bends crazy but I get where you're coming from in that. For the HVAC guys like I would probably just set my CPA targets or like whatever target you're setting. A bit lower. Yeah exactly make more margin lower the volume but make more margin I don't know I hear you and like you have limited. No I agree I kind of agree. If I see a limited inventory sure but just make more margin on it. If I see a limited budget in a on a campaign there better be a good reason because I'm like well if other budgets are being spent elsewhere why is that campaign limited at the top that's your highest spender. Surely that should be freed up and the others should be paused off. Which is why I also am a strong proponent of a shared budget where setting a budget per campaign to me is nonsense unless it's unless you have different strategies like truly different strategies or different margins or products at the campaign level where sure there's a case but if you don't you should just share a bunch of across all the campaigns and like Google spend where it wants to spend. It makes perfect sense when you put it that way actually. I'm not going to agree with him. No I mean okay it varies my industry. If you don't have those restrictions or limitations then yeah. Yeah yeah yeah which comes back to the if you've got a budget limited status it's like why and if it's a case of that you don't have the inventory or you can't physically service it okay. If there are significant splits between the campaigns for example across different services then I'd say shared budget might be suboptimal. Where it makes sense it is a nice unlock. This is the problem isn't it like everything with Google ads it's gotta be caveated because there'll be someone sat there going oh I tried it but and then it's it's blowing up and it's like you know I've got 127 broad match keywords and when and it just didn't work for me and you have to be careful with advice sometimes. Yeah we take no responsibility for anything you guys try based on the advice you hear or not necessarily advice. Yeah 100% entertainment value. But I also feel the same way about a portfolio bid strategy right so having a shared budget and a general ROAS target across similar campaigns to me makes the most sense where your campaigns are just organizational buckets where you can keep the themes and the targeting perhaps the similar and bucket them all but share let them all share together and get more volume into the into the objective you're trying to hit. Yeah agree with that. I've always been proponent of portfolio bids and I have often used them in a slightly perverse way where a lot of people will set a max bid I'll set a min bid higher than expected to essentially force force you into an auction not as efficient but essentially where you can be aggressive if you if you've got a bit of an edge particularly on a product or something but yeah portfolio bids make a complete sense. Shared budgets though. Well the two together are like I feel like they have far more sense. Yeah yeah yeah let's move on to this quote from Ben in the Wall Street Journal which I really liked. So the article is about performance max campaigns delivering higher traffic numbers than traditional search advice and Ben's quote is as long as it's delivering profitable sales to us I don't really care where it's running and what it's doing which is a stark contrast to practically every other PPC professional I know who wants to see like every little detail and you know I want to know which keywords and which asset groups and which ad combinations of the RSA and you know they just want to see everything and I get it like especially if you're running ads for a law firm where the CPCs can be hundreds of dollars yeah okay it makes sense but for the average account do you really need it I think that's up for debate. The original question that I was going to post to you Ben was what is your setup like that lets you approach it this way but we already covered that part right many many ad accounts and you treat Pmax as an incremental campaign that brings in things that you normally wouldn't want to target or think of targeting so I'll ask you this instead talk to us a little bit about the mentality behind that because it seems to me like you're treating Pmax like a really high level employee and it's like hey if you're getting me results I don't give a crap how you're doing your job. Yeah that's a good analogy I think the need and this is definitely going to piss some people off so I apologize ahead of time but I think the need for these granular or the desire for the granular insights are from PPC consultants, agencies, freelancers who feel the need to like they're trying to justify their existence in the ad account. There is probably a fear a rational fear of automation taking a lot of the work away from agencies and freelancers where you know as Pmax improves and is able to do a good or a better job than someone managing the ad account of course people who are getting paid to manage ad accounts are going to be or are going to try to not use it and fight against it so I think the need for all of these insights are to help give PPCers like a means for existence and being able to control or report back on what's working and what's not working where I personally don't think the end client really cares which keyword match to which ad or which which asset is running the most etc etc like of course maybe the channel level splits or audience insights is useful but it's not a need I think it's just like something to show to end clients or be able to talk badly about Pmax like can you believe it spent $100 on this click instead of it actually just driving the business results that someone's looking to achieve agreed that was a that was a 50 caliber shot like if you had an actual report of what you're looking for it's like overwhelming and you're not going to do much with it like maybe you'll take 20% of it and make some new campaigns but that stuff's there like there's enough there there's enough meat there and what they report and that's improving all the time that I think you can get away there's enough there to use verse like completely bashing it because I think that's just defending their their job to be honest most of the work is making sure it's going it it's working and trying to extract that extra one or two percent increment is is the same amount of work again if you can get reliable data and I've been preaching this for years now so is is your time really worth that one or two percent is your clients spend really well or should you be looking outside the account I've did a video on we should probably link it the ultimate solution and it essentially talks about all the things all the things is like six or seven pillars and only one of them is google ads and it's all about managing google ads but only one pillar is google ads because there's so much other stuff that goes on that impacts google ads therefore here's a 20 percent increment here's a 50 percent you can't do that in google ads unless you're making a fundamental error and I'm completely unbiased in this because I sell a bloody framework which you know trains people out to optimize google ads so even I will say I agree with you Ben people overthink it they don't want to trust the back box and I understand why but ultimately if you actually had 100 percent of what you wanted I think most people would be overwhelmed by that data anyway and there are so many more increments and compounding benefits you can get from working outside the account anyway even if you weren't overwhelmed by it like how much of that can you really action I mean you're you're not going to be able to do everything if you're doing all the things that should be done and so the perspective I come from is you know my background is as an agency copywriter but not like a digital copywriter a mainline traditional copywriter I didn't look at the inside of a google ads campaign till like 2019 and I never managed one until my first senior in-house role in 2020 I've always approached google ads as like it's just a vehicle for core traditional marketing right if I don't have a narrative or even if I'm in a more commoditized industry like if I don't have my product and my pricing down if I don't have my targeting if I don't understand my consumers and their behavior and what's important to them where they spend their time like if I don't show up with that I could throw as much money as I wanted google ads it's never gonna like deliver the results that's right at the same time I do think some of the clamor for 100% data visibility I understand it because people are used to that that was like the the promise that google ads made from the beginning so if you've been in this game for like 10 years or 15 years and you're used to that it's difficult to make peace with the fact that things are going this way 100% but I mean look at it look at everything everything's getting disrupted right now I mean oh yeah literally everything so like why just you know people you can sit around and complain and just get smoked by people who are leaning into it and that's not gonna happen and in 10 15 years there's been a ton of shifts in google ads this is a dramatic one for sure but it's continuous and I think the best marketers are those that that can pivot and adapt and and keep it going and those are going to be the people that are in demand not to be honest anyone who's uses the term ppc to me is is already toast but because you're not paying for click you're paying for row as in my opinion that's how I think about it and I think you've always just got to be shifting and evolving and you're foolish not to and also let's not forget I mean I've been in the industry 15 years and bit of nostalgia I mean I like the old interface but the automated bidding when it first came out wasn't you know it was a bit wonky and broad has had peaks and troughs but a feet again for years I've been saying you know if broad's appropriate for your industry trust it or at least try it because it will take a lot of work out for you automated bidding I mean really if you start on manual cpc fair enough especially on smaller accounts but your ultimate goal should be to offload that onto automation bloody hell we used to have multiple scripts and all sorts of databases bases running on bidding years and years ago to adjust manual bidding based on loads of data inputs this that now google just does it in a heartbeat automatically for every auction we used to do that we we thought we'd built AI it wasn't really AI it was algorithms but the amount of effort we went to to be to perform in industries like insurance and stuff like that we you know we went that extra mile and then as soon as google got the automated bidding into a high gear just smoked all that work we didn't need it at all did not need it and I look back and think good because it was a pain in the backside the more things they take away so long as the performance is there I wouldn't complain too much because there's so much we can do outside the accounts even for small business if we think about where this is going to me it's very clear it's going through a keywordless future you know with something like search max I don't know you guys have played with search max at all it's it's using your ad assets and your landing page content to match the search terms so it's it basically is is the first taste that in pmax but that's just dsa but search max to me truly is like a step toward this keywordless sort of concept where you just give it a url and a row as budget and then and a row as target and it figures it out so like if you're still stuck complaining about lack of search term visibility or whatever it is and then this stuff starts to roll out and people are leveraging and adopting it you're going to get left behind and you've got to be thinking about what google's trying to do and thinking 10 steps ahead so that you're ready so when it rolls out you can take advantage of it yeah I've got a um piece of training called ad recon and it is it is novel I've never seen anyone do it before it's probably been replicated now but essentially helps you scope out the search market and work with your client to come up to help them with their positioning their offer that doesn't revolve around the google ads account whatsoever it revolves around the market you know the search market the the industry um and the audience and what you know what people are looking for what competitors are doing so yeah it's work like that that's going to be far more important and I do I've said it as well Ben that we're going to have to give them a budget and a url and that will probably be it when does that come I've we're probably a few years off it but I think that's the inevitability isn't it you get we'll get to the point where it's give me a website give me your I don't know how they fix the conversion tracking situation first party data and stuff like that but again that's another tool that we have to be in control of first party data ensuring tracking solid and that we're actually vetting and verifying that data outside of google ads again instead of just being inside ads trusting the data trusting the conversion metrics which is not something we're going to discuss so I won't take it there but I'm sure you have your own business data and don't look at google ads going oh well I trust everything metric in there yeah of course and even for like e-commerce businesses that I've worked with the direct correlation between meta or facebook ad performance and google ad performance is like crystal clear when you look outside the ad account and you're looking at all the different levers that are moving there all these platforms are taking way too much credit for what they're delivering in most cases so you've got to balance it out with what you know what your bank account looks like at the end of the day and be able to take that outside perspective to look at things and because there's no one source of truth you know there's just I mean the bank accounts the source of truth but looking at in platform you it's way off usually so there's a lot more going on there and we brought this up when we spoke to gill gildner as well many google ads marketers have a tendency to just like look at the data and nothing else and I feel like that does hamper your decision-making I feel like we've had a period now of let's call it 15 18 years where this concept of the data-driven marketer has come to be like a I don't understand the fundamentals of marketing and that might be a bit of an extreme way to put it but you know if you're not looking at well the stuff that ed mentioned in his ad recon right your offer your pricing and all this other stuff the things that you called out the landing page like if you're getting to a future where google ads is going to take your landing page and your budget and your roas target and work off that like if you don't have a stellar landing page and you're not super clear about what audience you want to go after and what problem they have and where in the journey they are like you're just not going to be able to to make it and I feel like we're now going back to this old school marketing where it was all about the customer and what they want to do and where they are and what motivates them and getting more of the the psychographics and the psychology of the buyer and I really look forward to that because you know coming from a traditional creative background I've really despised the amount of math and numbers and statistics that have permeated marketing and I'm not saying that it's all bad it would be great to still have that it's come at the cost of creative thinking and so I feel like moving back to that is going to make us all better marketers if we lean into it absolutely yeah I've gotten into tons of fights on on twitter and linkedin about you know I don't think cpcs matter I don't think ctr matters I don't think any of these like ancillary metrics really matter I'm willing to pay $500 for a click if it's going to get me $2,000 in sales like I don't really care how much the click costs and I think people to your point are obsessed with data and optimized towards those things where there's not a correlation between what your blended cpc is and your blended row as it's like you know it's on a query or an auction level and you'll you're chasing the wrong path if you're trying to optimize towards anything but the end result that that that you're telling google that you care about yeah see high cpcs with respect man because you've got a big budget and I know you haven't always had a big budget you've worked on the other side with google but there will be there are lots and lots of small businesses out there where they've got maybe two grand to spend a misplaced click should we call it that's $50 or $100 really rattles their affordability so I get why a lot of people stress and threat over these high cpcs but only if it's happening frequently and then there's obviously the conspiracy theory that google likes to slip with them in just because a few I think I started this one because I was like you know what if I if I ran google do less evil or progressively do more evil I think is the new term um I would just have like a ratchet system so I think I described it as like a big screen with a big number on it and you walk into this room and you just pull the arm on this gambler and then across 50 million ad accounts it just randomly inserted a 10x bid on one one random search term and everyone had to pay an extra 10 and you just see that you'd see the revenue outcome and you'd be like whoo it's a few billion in just those spurious clicks I'll take that today and then you go off and have you cup of coffee so now people probably have a conspiracy complex that uh google keeps slipping them in to make extra profit every quarter yeah maybe I mean cost of doing business is the way I look at it yeah pretty ruthless but yeah all right let me pose this question to both of you if google ads is getting prohibitively expensive for small businesses and SEO is dying because everybody is suddenly searching through LLMs which is not the case people are not gonna stop looking for their problems on a search engine right and people are still gonna expect to find products solutions services all that other stuff like realistically what happens like can you think of anything else because there's still a group like millions of people searching for things on on google or whatever search engine people are gonna buy tickets people are gonna employ a plumber to fix install fix a boiler people employ a carpet cleaner because they spilled that cup of coffee after they shouted at the screen because google sent them a $200 click that comes down to business optimization not google ads if you're up to you if your google ads account is 95% there essentially you've got it too easy you've got it on too easy mode good landing page the right keyword selection the right approach the bidding budget your ad copy's not you know out of whack there's not a hell of a lot more that needs to happen if you if you've then got issues it's the business that needs to be optimized how are we handling handling the phone calls are you even picking up the bloody phone you're getting back to people e-commerce is the product any good are you is it price sensitive is it priced well are you do you have customer service issues is there a return customer problem it's and that is i think going forward that's that more consultative approach is far more valuable to a business than hey i do ppc and i'm just gonna say ppc ben just to wind you up i couldn't do more yeah it's gonna piss people off to hear this but you're not entitled to results from google ads or seo or whatever if you put in the work and a lot of people think that the work is what worked 10 years ago but if if you put in the work today and your demand is there you're gonna capture that demand whether it's through organic results or paid results and if you're not capturing it like you both said the business needs work and and traffic from google ads should be extremely expensive like it's people literally looking to buy your product or service right now it should be the most expensive ad placement i can think of like there's nothing better than it and the platform's job is to get you high intent traffic they're not promising that they're going to convert that that's on you right to ed's point pick up the phone return a phone call pass the right data back into the system like i see all these people complaining about poor lead quality but they're not even passing back like offline conversions or lead scores or anything right like there's things that need to go back into the system and also be optimized in your business to convert that traffic profitably and that's that's outside of the account entirely oh it reminds me years ago i had a lead come in for the agency and they said google ads doesn't work wasting money was wasted money with some guy that consulted or whatever a nice line oh god one of them let me have a look at the account no conversion tracking 10 grand a month crazy and i was just like okay like what what what you just not even doing the what didn't work with them because the owner was an absolute tosser but uh yeah he can't he's arrogant to something along the lines of oh i should you know i should be able to just throw money at it and customers come i'm like well you're not even tracking like basic conversion like just a basic sale of your thing and this should excite people because there's the threat of ai is looming and everyone's like we're going to get wiped out but there's so many things we can do and it is more work this is the problem and i was like this for years if you're quite happy being hidden away in your google ads account you're going to hate the next two to five years because it's going to require more than that the fundamentals of google ads are still going to be uh you know imperative so you still need god to tear out obviously a solid framework throw it on the screen but it yeah at times are shifting you're going to have to expand your your knowledge base which leads on to the question beautifully which is the first time i've ever managed that which is ben's advice for someone coming into the industry right now it's a google ads today without the biases of you know someone like me the old-fashioned guys the you know the oh jesus some people call us who have had to change but yeah if you're coming in today i mean what would your advice be to someone like you might employ for example or hire for the team i think quality really really matters in all aspects of the account so i would encourage someone to manually write like fill out all of the rsa assets site links etc all by hand to get a really good grasp on on what's going on and make sure like like really have three screens up you've got your keywords on the left whatever you're working on here and you've got your search terms on the right to see what people are actually searching what's matching and truly understand the the sort of themes and angles that that are converting or are not converting for you and by hand sit down and and write out you know if it's a hundred ad groups and you're doing two or three rsa's per just bang it out by hand and then start to move into more leveraging more tools or automation to do it but really understand the fundamentals and and and and like literally see the change like when you're building an rsa you can watch your i know that the what's it called the ad strength doesn't doesn't matter per se but like as like understand what makes what makes that that score change like if you add a keyword into your headline you're gonna see the score go up and understand those things and see all those dynamics of how that works and then just continue that over time and then optimize them and see the whole life cycle of where you started this rsa and where it gets to as you optimize it over time and do the work understand the levers and what ticks and how it's all working before you try to automate or use ai or anything for it so no shortcuts essentially the fundamentals the unsexy thing that no one cares about anymore because everyone wants to go to zero to sixty yesterday and everyone that skips them will will they might initially get the leg up on the person doesn't skip them but the person that commits to the fundees will out compete out and they will beat everyone else because they're actually putting the effort in there's no free lunch there's no easy work and i you know i remember when i started the i used to work 80 hours a week killing myself trying to start a bloody agency i put in the reps and now it does seem and i sadly i see it when people email me i do and maybe i'm politely to blame because i sell a product that has shortcuts in it and but they're shortcuts to knowledge they're not shortcuts to the performance you've still got to put the reps in so yeah um i do like that answer if the if you had to compliment and i know you're going to be biased because the industry you're in now but if you had to compliment google ads with another skill set let's say you're hiring someone for your team tomorrow and they they appear with a little bit of google ads knowledge they're just getting into the game but they've got something else that compliments it what's that thing that you think is critical now or really attractive great question yeah i think data data analytics just being able to interpret reports and metrics and there's a lot of theory i think that goes into interpreting performance and and analytics so i would want someone to have a pov and just a grasp of what all that of what it all means and entails and which ones matter and which one which ones don't and you know you put those two together and you can start to become more dangerous of understanding how the system works precisely like all the inputs and outputs that you're getting from it and then be able to match that with performance in and outside of the ad account to me i think would make someone really sharp pretty cool thinking i like that you said interpret data and not read it because you know my complaint about data driven marketers is that they read the data and they just kind of parrot what they see back at leadership and it's like okay anybody can read a chart but like what does it mean you know where the gaps where the opportunities you have to know your industry and your customers and their pain points and if you don't have that background all you're going to see is numbers if you do have that like you look at the numbers and you could see like desire hope ambition whatever this is why i hate reports this is why our client reports were one page and i hate these 20 page reports they've got all your all your metrics of this it's like it's nonsense that our clients used to get spend and whatever their north star was if it was conversion volume or revenue or whatever and then we might have some complimentary metrics sprinkled in but it's like how much did i put in how much did i get out right are you doing your job based on that and all these people sharing these report templates and sorry to people like report gardens to apply that if anyone works there and watches this because there are lots of tools out there selling reports and the amount of times i've been approached like oh you we've got this wonderful client uh whatever portal thing and i'm like no fucking way yeah just i don't want to give them all the data i've got because even i don't understand all the data i've got it's not that is just a big hurdle a 20 foot high hurdle yes but even to build on that a major problem i saw when i was at google and still persist today with our reps and probably everyone's reps is i don't think that they also understand the concept of cost of goods and margins so you know they'll tell me why is your row as at at 3.5 or whatever it may be right because because i have like costs to deliver this product and they're like oh if you put it to three you'd make more money like well actually i would lose i would lose money on my bottom line because of this so i think agencies ppcs whoever also need to understand the cost of of doing of their business like the cost of their client's business and what will actually make them more money and all of those dynamics on the pnl and i think that's also really over over uh like an oversight in reports when you just report on row as and revenue it's it's not it's you need to get to the granular aspects of how much money they're making because i do teach people so i shouldn't say this because there are no bad questions but there is bad thought and that is something that triggers a question what's a good row as i mean what the hell does that even meet what what every business is different like you just have profits margins static costs whatever that's where critical thinking is lacking because people are like oh what's a good cost for conversion you know what bidding strategy it's just these throw away oh think for me oh can you just think for me it's like no it's it's such a big reason why lmms are touted as like the next coming of marketing christ think for me yeah but again it for the people that we're going to put the work in it still means that they get to remain relevant and a little bit of critical thinking goes a long way so it does well that's a great place to wrap it up critical thinking i think we we all could use a bit more of that some more than others well thank you for tuning in again make sure you like subscribe and turn on notifications ben thank you so much for
