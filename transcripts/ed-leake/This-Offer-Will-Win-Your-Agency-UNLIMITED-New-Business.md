We put all these things in place that make your business bulletproof compared to your competitors that make our agency bulletproof against our competitors. Join us or die with those guys. You're watching a highlight from Agency Forge with me at League Exclusive Community for PPC Agency owners to stop f**king about in those other groups and join agencyforge.com application only. Terms and conditions apply etc. If I could distill the offer to the client to that business that's already challenged is we are delivering you the qualified warmed up leads. All you've got to do is ring them back. You haven't even got to pick the phone up. We've already picked the phone up for you. You don't even have to read the email. We've already done that for you. This is fueled by Google ads. We're a Google ads agency. You've still got to do that thing that you're doing now. But we put all these things in place that make your business bulletproof compared to your competitors that make our agency bulletproof against our competitors. Join us or die with those guys. That would be my offer like like brutal. We put all this legwork in to make your business in your industry awesome. And we you'd have to be exclusive as well. So in London you can only work with that jurisdiction. Manchester have got one client there in the US. You could do one per state whatever it'd be big enough. I completely bought into the value of it and how sticky it makes you as an agency. And like you say, why would you go with someone else if you're offering this complete solution? If somebody else audits it, they're not going to want to touch it at all because you've gone to say great debts. But I always thought we wanted to be 100% Google ads. And the way the reason I stepped away from that is introducing landing pages because having zero control. And also if we're working on clients websites, it just became completely unmanageable. So we brought that in, which was a big aspect. But also you create a landing page that works. You maybe do run a test or two on it a month. It doesn't take that much legwork. And I also like the idea of these email follow-ups you're saying. And if you know the industry well, you can create something once that probably lasts a year or so. Again, might want to run a couple of tests on it per month. Where I think it then becomes really hard to manage is this qualifying all of the leads. If you're thinking of leads that are coming through an industry's home improvement sectors where these are tens or hundreds of leads per day. I think that becomes incredibly time consuming in the middle more so than the landing page or the email follow-up. Agreed. There are baby steps, of course. Sheets, Zapier, basic tools. Just people opening emails, people clicking on emails could be qualifiers. You could take baby steps. So you could automate it to the point where a qualified lead is passed through if they engage. So you don't have to, you've got to walk before you run. Taylor, the landing page thing, I think that's integral to Google Ads anyway for lead gen. I think if you're not doing landing pages, you're on the back foot. I really do because a crappy Google Ads account, good landing page, the landing page can make it a good Google Ads account. An incremental win on the landing page could be a 20% uplift in conversions. If you then do something to monitor and improve the quality of the leads, that could be another 20% uplift. And you've done sweet FA in the Google Ads account, but the client is realizing these uplifts because of the lead quantity and quality. Stop trying to scale your agency on your own. It's a lonely pursuit. It's boring. It's tiring. It gets you on blood meds. Join agencyforge.com, a community mastermind training from like-minded PPC agency owners and myself, Ed Leake. I was going to follow that up with a dot com, but I'm not a dot com on a real person. Go check it out.
