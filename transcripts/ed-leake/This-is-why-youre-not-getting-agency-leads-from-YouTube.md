Does it do you need it to start up? No, I mean cold email might be enough. Certainly people letters might be enough just to get it off the ground In an ideal world in a perfect world if you have the time and resources you'd be on so you'd have a brand wouldn't you as well? You do the YouTube videos But again, it's can you do it? With don't do it like me stop start can you do it with a cadence? Can you turn up do it consistently and look good and commit to it for six months not just you know three weeks? So it's another commitment Does it do you need it to start up? No, I mean cold email might be enough Certainly people letters might be enough just to get it off the ground But then when you've actually got some momentum behind it and you want to dominate and you might be thinking okay I want to go grand scale this we're gonna do the YouTube thing. We're gonna do the social media thing We're gonna do the freebie funnel. We're gonna do the paid trading funnel perhaps And it's starting to get complicated so You're in you're in a sort of the fork in the road a transition which means you need to test and iterate And I worry that you could make yourself a list of a hundred things that you want to do and Then it makes it very very difficult to test Very difficult to iterate particularly quickly because you're trying to do all the things at once Yeah, so I do bare minimum, but with a long-term view, but perhaps YouTube YouTube works, you know, let's be honest, but it's it's effort and Then you've got a question. Well, who's the face of the brand or the many faces what happens if they leave the business? And so on and so forth. You know, do you want to be the face? Well, is that your job? Are you going to enjoy that? and so on No, I can't say I enjoy it particularly but some you know, I just force myself to bloody do it. So Yeah, it's it started at very complicated. I think you've got enough to keep you engaged and busy For a good few months at least before you even have to consider the whole the Grant Cardone trip You know being on your private jets and social media and Instagram Yeah, look social media can amplify an already great thing and if you do it well and put the look at Alex Hormosey Put the energy into it And you can clearly see it works, but my god, there's a lot of energy for me. He's a social media Persona now it's it's what it's what identifies him for me put you know as a as a Bystander and I don't want to ever be considered a social media personality I'm a business person at the end of the day. So there is that you know as well You your ego gets in the way because you might not want to be known as that I think if you've got a good business and a great offer you don't need it, but it can amplify it once you get up to Critical mass pass him was literally banging on on YouTube and all these social platforms and About if you saw the latest if you saw the latest past podcast about two months ago He signed off and now he's not on the social platforms anymore He signed off from per special traffic the main Perpetual traffic. He's no longer a part of that. He signed out. He said I'm not gonna do it He said because my business was solely relying on my face And I don't want that to happen that rang a bell to my mind He was like, okay I don't want to be a business that should be so reliant on my face That the moment I go away or back off things started crumbling Yeah, and you also you gotta understand that he's in a different position now He sold the business so he can say oh I'm off now So it the dynamic for him has changed dramatically He sold the business so he doesn't have to be on social media because it's not it's not required to generate the lead So I think if he was still running solution eight and hadn't sold it I think he'd be very prolific like he always was but he he deserves the rest now I know the bloody feeling but hey, here's another thing. You know email has been Super powerful so if you've got good freebies then you could bypass the social media thing and Just you know, organically attract people to your freebies so And that could be free training it could be free tools that support the specific niches you go after so there There is that avenue as well But again, it complicates it because you've got to build the tool or the freebie you've got to have the email flow that's That converts so that there are many avenues There are many of you and of course social media does supercharged the emails as well because you can share your tools and stuff and Advertise them on social media. I'm not suggesting That you wouldn't do that But it wouldn't require a personality in front of the brand And Perry said don't advertise your free or low-ticket offers I would disagree I used to advertise my free audit Only because I could get a conversion for $3 so every five in a hundred would turn into about a four or five hundred dollar purchase So I knew I could afford to spend $3 to capture an email. So I disagree with him on that I think you can you can afford to pay up front if you've got a converting funnel
