What are your top tips for just advertising moving forward? Because we've gone from you and I agreeing that you could just be a performance marketer and that's not enough anymore. You need to have that brand aspect, especially for e-commerce, niching down rather than just being like the Google ads for everyone, being Google ads, landing page and full service. Any last advice, tips of advice, just you seeing how businesses and people can be more successful with advertising in the future. Shall I share it and talk through it? I don't know. Yeah, yeah, good on you. That's a value. This works for both sides of the fence, business owner, PPC agency, PPC manager, in-house, marketer, whatever. So just take this on board and see how much outside of the traffic pillar can be done. And I don't need to talk through all of these elements, but just we've got the Google ads bit, which is the traffic bit. We've got the best keywords. We've got industry negatives, the stuff we do anyway. But then we are leaning a bit more towards conversion. So we're looking at best offer. What does that mean? What it means you go out into the marketplace and see what other people are offering. A little bit difficult for Ecom or Harder, because it might be price driven. It is often price driven. But for a service-based business or B2B or SaaS, what's the offer? What are they offering? What are we missing? That enables you to start testing the optimal call to action. What are the buttons on your website? And don't have 20 different bloody buttons. Have one. Take the action. Beyond that, we've got the capture, landing page. Most people should be doing landing pages and experiments with landing pages. Again, testing forms, testing call to actions. And a lot of people don't. A lot of advertisers still don't do this. So you're giving yourself another step up. Also, when you're capturing this, qualify the data somehow. Get it into a spreadsheet and qualify it. Was the person submitting the form or on that phone call, are they qualified or unqualified? Are they in the right place or are they in the wrong place? If they're in the wrong place and are unqualified, you need to match that up with your Google ads data or your traffic source, whatever it is. And if you can't get the tracking down to this level, well, you should be able to use UTMs or a cookie or something to track even the campaign name. You can put, you can give the GCL ID and upload that, but you don't even need that. All you need is like an ad group name or a campaign name. And then you, if you've, as long as you've got tight ad groups, you'll know what type of topic and keywords are in there. Is this chunk of my account spending money and driving quality? That's what you're looking for. And yeah, you can get more nuance than that, but it's just barometers like KPIs, which is into the, sorry, punch the microphone into the nurturing side. So you're monitoring those KPIs and then go beyond this. So again, there's so, I'm talking solar panels and what have you, because I'm literally experiencing it right now. I put on here in the nurture pillar, automated follow up. You can do this for a client, especially if you know the industry. So my inquiry was about solar panels and a battery, battery backup. What's an obvious automated email to fire out pros and cons of battery backups? Best, you know, the best brand and the best product in the industry. Here's the top five reasons you should be using this product, which we happen to install stuff like that, just educational nurture stuff. Because most people are not informed of the product. They know what they want, but they don't necessarily know the intricacies. You know, we're all lay people. We're coming to you as a professional to provide that service. I've put on their call handling, review collection, diary bookings, we're going extreme now for an agency to be booking in site surveys and stuff for a client. But if it's qualified and it's in the catchment area, there's no reason you couldn't at least trial it. I mean, imagine how much time that saves you or client if you're doing all this for them, helping them collect their reviews as well. And then what does this all mean? Well, for the business, it means it simplifies the business owner's role or the business, the staff, because you're delivering these warm leads, excuse me. And then yeah, this is more for the agency side. And the PPC manager, the growth one, which is where you're iterating this process and you're rolling it out to many accounts. You might have all the solar installers across the UK, for example, or all the best ones that you want to work with. And then you have essentially perfect templates, perfect landing page, perfect process, case studies, just imagine how easy it is to talk to people. And if a business owner sat here watching this, they're probably like, yeah, I'd like a marketing company that could turn up and do all this for me. Fucking hell, yeah, I can just get on with my job. So it works for both sides. Yeah, we could go into great detail about each one of these and all the nuances. But I think that image there, which is from my forge training, captures a lot. And you can look at that and go, oh, it's low to work. Yeah, well, don't do it all at once. Take a pillar, optimize your process around it, do the next pillar or take a chunk out of the pillar and just build up to the point where you become, you know, hard to beat, shall we say, and that's true for the business as well.
