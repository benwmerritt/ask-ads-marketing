I mean, crikey, yeah, you could start layering audiences and doing some fancy shit, but quite frankly, are you really going to beat the machine? I don't think you are. You have search terms that are converting and then you add them and they no longer convert or they simply don't convert as well, i.e. they spend more money but the cost conversion goes up because the conversion volume isn't there. This is what I call the broad match paradox, just give it a name. Aka, why are my broad match keywords outperforming my exact match keywords? Ed, people like you for years have said exact match keywords are the way to go. Yes, that's true, but go back and watch the start of the video. Auction. Anyway, broad match paradox. So what's happening here, particularly with Smart Bidding, is that Google has way more data, way more data points in the auction of the bidding, which is why it's better than manual bidding. A manual bidding is dying your death and we have to trust that this machine learning, this automation is amazing and does the job for us. But this is actually a glimpse into it doing its job. So you've got your exact matches, your phrases and your broads. This is more typical behavior of a broad and you see all these search terms come in and some of them converting and you're thinking, brilliant, I will shift that to a exact match keyword in its own ad group or perhaps the same ad group itself. And it doesn't work or it doesn't work as well or the cost per click, that average CPC is way higher. This is the automation dipping you in to the auction at the right moment. Google has got all the data. They say this person is more likely to convert against that search term at this moment in time, but the next person to search that might not convert and the person after that. And the problem is this 10,000 people behind them and we know that there's 17 right now again, you know, against these data points that are going to convert. I'm being explicit. It doesn't work like that, but I'm being explicit, for example. However, you completely ruin that when you add the keyword ironically as a target because you say, no, no, no, I want to target the keyword regardless. And this is why I have been favorable towards broad match teamed with smart biddings and target row as in CPA typically for a few years now. I've done other videos on it because it works because it uses the data that we don't have. It uses the signals that we don't have access to, to essentially cherry pick. So it's even in a busy auction where you might be halfway to the top, two thirds of the way to the top. It's doing the cherry picking actions for you, which is really important to remember because you can't really do them on your own. I mean, crikey. Yeah, you could start layering audiences and doing some fancy shit, but quite frankly, are you really going to beat the machine? I don't think you are. So that's the broad match paradox. That's why these things happen. And you might be sat there going, well, okay, but I do want to target that keyword. Well, it comes full circle to how to fix things is, well, if you can't afford to pay, then you need to reduce the cost, which means you can afford to pay more for more clicks if they have a propensity to not convert as frequently. And you can only do that with an higher click through rate, a higher converting landing page and negative keywords and also potential optimizations like location bidding, segmenting by locations, devices, audiences and so on. But it's not an option for everyone because again, if your market's not sufficiently big enough, all you're going to do is limit the data in the account by over segmenting, which would then hinder the smart bidding and you're in a catch 22. So I think the key takeaways here are understanding why things happen. What's going on in the background that you perhaps haven't thought about or hadn't considered or didn't even realize. And don't assume because Google is giving you with this impressions number, this reference number, all these a million people available for you that you can A, get in front of them all and B, do it at a cost conversion that suits your business or your client's business. And secondly, understanding how broads work now and have been working with smart bidding and using them together, which is very simple to do to maximize the cherry picking. It's caveat time. I don't want you to misconstrue what I'm saying here in no way am I saying you should stop using exact match keywords exact match terms that convert will typically outperform their broad counterpart. And the same goes for phrase. The issue of exacts is that you are limited by impressions. So for a lot of people, this can become a problem. Now, if you've got a tiny account, then you can live quite happily on exact match and manual bidding alone. Now, what constitutes a tiny account? Well, rule of thumb for me is less than one case spend a month or 10 to 20 conversions at most a month. That's a tiny account. You might find small accounts spending, say a few grand a month can live on exacts to but typically they will start to see restrictions in the volume. So if you need more volume, then this is where you have to start leaning on the broads. And this is where the broad and smart bidding gives flexibility in the form of the cherry picking and that additional volume. So I just wanted to clear that up.
