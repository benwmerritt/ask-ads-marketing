Within about two to three months of actually being in the forge, my company revenue increased by 150%. Hi, I'm Michael Nadeland from Market Lead and this video is actually a very different video from what I usually do because it's actually a testimonial video for Ed Leake and the forge. Now this is the first testimonial video I've ever done and it's probably the last one I'll ever do because I don't ever recommend things because I don't actually think that everything works for everyone but I thought it was unfair for me not to give my honest review on the forge. The reason why is it's made such a significant difference in my life personally because it's made such a significant difference in my business. Simply put, I've been in forge for about six months. I was a bit late to join which I'm so glad that I did join it from when it was because it's getting way more exclusive now so when you're seeing this you actually have to go through like a process. Within about two to three months of actually being in the forge, my company revenue increased by 150%. So for example, if I was making $2, now I'm making $5 or if I was making $5, I'm making $12.5. So you see how it is. Now the reason why that is is I do a lot of things online. You can probably see my videos and I've been doing Google ads for so long but this actually gave me a framework to unlock what success looks like and how to actually get to my own success and it was actually quite effortless. The reason why is the information in the education is so clear. It's made for PPC agency owners, not PPC specialists. He's got other information on that. PPC agency owners, so the business insights, the business operations and how to do it for PPC. So many business courses are just so generic and the info course is made for everyone so they're made for no one. So this is why the only reason I joined this mastermind is because it was specifically for me at Google ads or a PPC agency owner. I cannot recommend how good this is. The information, the videos and the training in there is outstanding but what I think has been way more important is actually speaking to Ed 101 who I've been following for about seven years now but also the next level is having that community around of actually really high level like-minded people who firstly you become friends with but secondly have the experience that you get to leverage off. These are real people. You get to ask them specific questions and you get specific personalised feedback. That is so important. Now when you take on info courses or you learn stuff online you're just getting information and it's a shotgun approach. You hope it sticks. When you jump me on the call Ed's asking you how are you going with your goals? What are you having troubles with? So every week you get personalised feedback. That has been the most important thing for me. I've spent years going through courses and books and yes I've learned stuff but I guarantee you that I've actually grown my business way more in the last three months from Forge than the last five years from doing agency work and freelancing and everything else between. I'm only doing this testimonial for Ed not because he asked me to because it does work. Now I don't want this video to go on the internet too much because everyone's going to jump in and become my competitor but Ed's actually helped me out so much. I've spent a lot of one-on-one time because of Forge speaking to him. I respect him so much but I value that input and I consistently ask for his input no matter how much my company is growing at the moment. So if you are watching this I would say the Forge would be the greatest investment in your PPC or advertising agency because it will give you the keys of what to do, why to do it and you'll be around people who are actually doing it as well. There are no starters. There are no beginners. There's none of that. It's only PPC owners only and it's a community. Everyone's here for each other. It's fucking awesome.
