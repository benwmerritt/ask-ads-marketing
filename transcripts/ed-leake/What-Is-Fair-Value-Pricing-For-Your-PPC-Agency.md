this is free to start with then it's x then it's then it creeps up and then you'll get them to the point where you can if you were going to charge 1500 a month you could probably get them to two instead so you can actually set the 100 percent higher oh no i quite like that uh that is proper guru sales bastard isn't it isn't it i watched a video last week because my wife is starting a home company and there was a video from alex or mozi so i know it's like a guru stuff and things like that but it was like finding your first clients and he made sense in the kind of the process where you do pro bono for your first clients for a time then you do 80 percent off then 60 percent off all the way to zero and then you start to charge even more than what you thought you would charge because your demand is limited and i know the guy is controversial but the funnel at least the process what made sense so for someone who is starting or doesn't have this kind of testimony on itself when makes sense no i like that to be fair i like um yeah i like the ratchet sort of this is free to start with then it's x then it's then it creeps up and then you'll get them to the point where you can if you were going to charge 1500 a month you could probably get them to two instead so you can actually set the 100 percent higher i know i quite like that uh that is proper guru sales bastard isn't it um which yeah it's seen again this is my this is my product but at least it's practical it is very practical but that's my that's my issue with him he's like it feels it feels a bit dishonest doesn't it but hey if it makes money and you if you get the results and you deliver then it's not stealing money it's turning down for fair money so and what about you think you can get some of the value but but also the you know there's always this question isn't it what is fair value for what we do because some people charge percentage of ad spend the other so actually there is no there's no um there's no rules that you have to get started with yeah yeah well we charge on an ad spend of 10 grand me yeah for anyone depends like what what are we what are they going to get out of it like if if that 10 grand turns into two million quid i'm going to charge them 15 grand a month you know if it that 10 grand turns into 50 then we'll probably charge them a couple of grand um have we got any 10 grand clients yes we have we've got a small e-con that does 10 to 15 what do they do they do about seven six and a half seven times a row as and we build them two and a half for 10 grand spend so we're probably under charging because they make 50 60 on average a month from their ad spend yeah row as row as not uh their margins are good though they're like 47 percent something stupid yeah so yeah it's that they're turning 10 into 25 gross profits um yeah so it's always that it's the balancing act this is why i like performance figures five percent of row as which they're not on um because you don't have to worry too much about this it's like oh we made you more money we get paid more we made you less money we get paid less i can't i kind of like that it simplifies it but i know we've leached you and it's so difficult to charge defeat you
