500k mark was when when things started improving significantly. 50k a month is that critical mass point where you should be in this position where profits going up, not just revenue. So how did it take you to get to one mill then in rev? So we reached one mill in 2021. I love the way you're checking your notepad. Well, actually, by the way, thanks to you. Because like you asked me some questions. So actually came up with like eight pages of like reflections. And actually I did the timeline hall. Let me show you. So pretty much like this is like, Oh, brilliant. On the start, which is like, you know, revenue, new clients and new team members by year and then, you know, some few milestones. So then it's, it's, it's easier to have a conversation because I didn't want to ramble. I should probably do that because I tend to ramble. So sorry, you, so you went from 300k what year? Uh, it was like 286 in 2015. And then we actually went down to like 200 and then 217 and you know, 16 and 17 after we specialized. Yeah. Yeah. But then we started marketing and then it was like, you know, 315, 507, 725 and then 1 million and $1. 3.5, 4 years later. Yes. Yeah. Which is a transformation. That's like ignoring all the nonsense you see on social media to to double for three years straight. They double. No, sorry. 50% not double. It's 50%, 50%, 50%. Yeah. Either way, it's very impressive. It's very good. I haven't asked you about profit, but I'm assuming your profit levels were sort of steady or did you cut into them? I'd say things became better. Maybe like, I'd say maybe 500k mark was when, when things started improving significantly, uh, because you have an overhead, right? So pretty much like you have to reach enough people who are pretty much like enough clients and enough team members who are purely focused on service, service delivery. Cause initially when you think about like, you know, I like to break everything down into like sales and marketing and then there's like, you know, someone responsible for operations. Um, then, you know, you have a team members who are responsible for service, service delivery. So I think that maybe like 500k is something that is, uh, like I would say maybe a breaking point because then, you know, let's use a founder pretty much like you have to, you know, pay for, you have to pay for, you know, all of like overhead expenses and all of that. So you have to reach a certain point. I haven't taken notes on this. So, but I would say like roughly, I think that that's kind of like the point where, when, you know, when things get better for the agency owners before that, you know, if you're investing, re-investing everything back into the business, cause like that's what we did. Depending on how you look at the, you know, gross profit net profit and also, you know, how much salary you take or, you know, you know, do you take actually, you know, a market rate salary, all those factors, but I would say like 500k would probably be a good breaking point for you to, you know, see decent profitability. You are very similar to me. So on my flow chart, I've got 50k as that critical 50k a month is that critical mass point where you should be in this position where profits going up, not just revenue, and you should be quite removed from doing all the stuff. So that's very interesting. And this is the problem that everyone has when they're a freelancer or a solo agency owner and they might get to seven, 10k a month. And then they, they're starting to hit the ceiling of their output, you know, physically, I've run out of time to go and do marketing. And it's taking that step of saying, which is what I did. Well, I can't have that 10 grand a month. I've got to give someone five of it to then to take, to step back essentially financially, I'm going to reduce my financial winnings or whatever. You unlock me to go and do the bloody marketing. And if you find the right, find the right person is the tricky thing. And it's, it's taking that risk, that leap of faith to do that. Yeah.
