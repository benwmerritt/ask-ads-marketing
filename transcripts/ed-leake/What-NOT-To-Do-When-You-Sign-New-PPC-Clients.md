because the client is also feeling like well we've had all this communication I put my money down and bang we go live and then add its crickets and then for two weeks don't hear from these boogers so they've just robbed me they're taking my money or whatever. What kept me up at night was like we were actually taking a lot of new clients on board as well but you have to like set them up for success and it's going to require a lot of work but you don't have you don't have that much time anymore to actually manage your current clients and then you get stressed out because of that because you know that there needs to be like you need to work on the client but you don't have time because you are managing the new clients to get them on board to get more money you know it's a vicious cycle but like at some point if you when you get your hand on a pause or a pause on a hand then like things are getting better you know. Yeah you've got your onboarding's got if you're going to be seriously generating leads and onboarding people your onboarding process has got to be rock solid which is why I put that process together in the training because most people screw up the onboarding so they go through all the hard work of getting a sale and then their onboarding's crap or the biggest the biggest issue is people don't continue the communication through the first few weeks so you have you have this sort of climatic moment of where you've built up a rapport with the client you've got this new client and you've been speaking to them probably for weeks if not longer and then when you actually launch you just go dead silent because you're sat there doing the work and the amount of agencies that forget that actually you need to communicate in those first few weeks is so critical because the client is also feeling like well we've had all this communication I put my money down and bang we go live and then add its crickets and then for two weeks don't hear from these boogers so they've just robbed me they're taking my money or whatever so critical onboarding checklist simple as that really. Shimon have you got you haven't been on a call in ages and I'm just wondering if you got anything you wanted to share sorry to Argo I'm not just running off from you but. Yeah it's kind of what Argo just kind of mentioned thankfully I've actually signed a new client like two weeks ago so I'm actually going through a similar process of like onboarding this new client but at the same time it's just that existing clients obviously are just having a bit of difficulty managing so yeah I've actually followed your guide in terms of onboarding process so I think that's helped me out a lot so yeah try to set expectations right really for the first 90 days try to stay consistent communication with the client you know so we'll see how that goes yeah good man so yeah
