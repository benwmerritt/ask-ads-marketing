Have you ever googled, what's the best time of day or day of week to generate a sale? Hi guys, I'm Ed Leake and today I'm going to talk about day parting and looking through your AdWords data how to identify and answer that very question. This question actually came about in the idea for this video from a client who requested that we turn off their AdWords at certain days and certain times of the week and I wanted to look through their data and make sure that we weren't doing that based on assumptions. So I'm now in the AdWords account in question and I'm on the dimensions tab. So what I want to do is drop into the dropdown over here and go to time and day of week and what you can see is you get your week, each day of the week including weekends and it gives you a really quick overview of your key metrics essentially but you'll notice here I've got all conversions and converted clicks so there's a disparity and this is a question that I've been asked before. Why are all conversions higher than converted clicks? We typically use converted clicks for most accounts because they're trying to consider a single visit as a conversion even if there's multiple actions. So for example if I click on an advert I come to your website, I activate the chat facility to ask a question about your product or service and you're tracking that conversion. That will go into the all conversions column. If you then check out, buy a product or pick the phone up and you're tracking phone calls that will be added to the conversion total. However it was one visit so for us a lot of the time the most accurate thing to do is look at converted clicks. Okay and this accounts target CPA or cost per conversion is actually £20 sterling should I say. Saturday is already over but that's for all of Saturday. Let's look at the drop down again and go to time, hour of day and then you get a view of each hour in the day but again this can throw up some problems because you've got, you're taking into account every single day of the week here and then all of a sudden your conversion values are starting to go all over the place. So let's get a bit more clarity on these numbers. What we want to do is download this data and because we're on hour of day we want to segment it by day of week. So we go to time, day of week, grab that download and then open that in Excel. Okay so now we've got the data in Excel. We want to highlight all fields or cells, go to insert and pivot table and that's just confirming the range click OK. Then we want to construct the pivot table. So there's three components here, day of week in your, I'm going to do that in columns actually beg your pardon, day of week columns, hour of day in the rows section and then I'm interested in cost converter clicks. So I just want to edit that field setting to be some which gives us the absolute value and then just quickly tidy this up. So to click the drop down on the first column here and remove any blank, there we go and for the weekdays so we just don't want the total or the blank, we just want the weekdays here. I also like for some reason, I don't like the table touching the side of the sheet, yeah weird, I don't know why. We want to get rid of these grand totals because they're meaningless to us so go to the design tab at the top and off and that just tidies it up. But even so, this is quite a lot of data to analyze as is. So let's highlight the days, an hour of days, go to conditional formatting and let's put a sort of color scale on here. So we're going from red down to green because red being a high cost which we don't want. I'm also going to just tidy this up a little bit like that, centralize it, it's a bit easier. You'll probably find this, if you've got any zero conversion data or naught, if you're British like me, some naughts in here, it's going to skew this conditional formatting because it's done on a percentile basis. So let's just sort that out so it's more visually useful, more visually appealing to us. Double click that. So as I said, cost per acquisition on this account is 20 so I'm going to set that as the midpoint. I'm going to set the lowest values in percentile so I'm going to go for the bottom sort of 15% so that bumps the color range up so these zeros don't take too much sway over that and the same at the top end to compensate so I'm going to do 85. There's no rule of thumb to this, this is visualization essentially so you'll see what happens if you see now, we've got a much clearer view and immediately Saturday and Sunday are not looking too good are they? And also as you can see here across this row we've got 6am. So every single day of the week 6am is underperforming, we're over our target of 20lb cost per conversion. So what would I do with this data? Well, oh yeah crikey look at that midnight, that's not a very good time of day for this account. This account is limited by budget so I would immediately scrap the weekends personally. There's a couple in here that are under but compared to the rest of the week it's clear that the weekend is pretty safe to disable your ads on the weekend and in addition 6am is not looking too great either. There's a few other refinements we can do here in that Monday, Wednesday and Thursday and Friday we can actually start those days an hour later than the rest because they're not looking too good. You'll see some other little issues, we've got a weird one, not weird Friday 7am everyone's going home surely so sorry 5am, conversions do actually pick back up there which is interesting, people get home can't wait to convert, brilliant. So we've got this data, we've now visualised it and we understand it and there's a clear course of action in that we need to sort out these timings and this is where we go back to the schedule in your account and tweak to suit. Okay so I've just jumped back into the AdWords account here and I want to go to the settings and add schedule and actually this wasn't planned by the way I haven't looked at this account but if we just jump back to our data so we saw that 6am in particular across the whole week and 7 with the exception of Friday but let's say 6 and 7 because this account is limited by budget so we want to move that budget into the stronger areas. 6 and 7 were failing this account and if we just jump back in here it looks like my team's actually moved this, moved the goalpost on me because this is actually now 8am but you'll see here a total removed so historically there was some spend in those alternative time ranges. But that's good so we're on top of it. However the one thing we aren't on top of is the weekend. Again we've got Saturday and Sunday running here, jumping back to our spreadsheet we can see that Saturday and Sunday are pretty rubbish, let's face it. Now this is a business case for you, do you want phone calls, emails, transactions that weekend, fair enough. This client kind of does but I think we could argue to them actually unless they want to spend more because their budget limited in the week we're better off letting them have a quiet weekend which they probably appreciate and getting more conversions in the week so we could literally jump in here and remove those but I'm going to discuss it with them first. Yeah this is live. The other thing I need to warn you of, don't start making too many changes too soon. I'd go for a more broad strokes approach, so finding particular hour ranges or day ranges that just don't work and remove those because they will have a knock on effect to your remaining active hours of day, day of week so just you know baby steps. Also when you change your ad schedule this button is a little bit misleading because it says you know plus ad schedule. So when I do that what this is actually showing me is the current live ad schedule so if I remove these in here thinking that oh I just want to add in something for Tuesday and I'll remove the rest and save it. You will overwrite your live schedule so you need to add to this and another thing as well let's say I wanted to bid up Monday at 2am for whatever reason. You've then got to set a pre 2am period and a post 12am period on your Monday so you'd essentially have two or more Monday schedules and what that allows you to do is you'd get an additional time slot in here which you could increase or decrease bids and that's when you go really granular so you're literally selecting certain regions of the day where you're increasing your bids to suit this. So for example there's a few areas in here that are excelling like what is this 10am looks pretty good even through to sort of 11-12 so you could take that region across Monday through to Wednesday and add a schedule in to suit but let's go in quite granular. Pick out these dirty red points first that are wasting your money and sort those out and then come back and do this whole scenario a few months down the line when you've had time to collect the data and that's it and that answers the question of what's the best time of day and day of week to convert so don't Google it, don't listen to best practices, don't listen to other people because they're not looking at your data. If you use your own data it takes 10-15 minutes of your time at the most even if you're not an excelling aficionado to identify the facts based on your business and that's important. There's a lot of conjecture out there and a lot of best practices that just don't suit everyone so do that and listen to yourself, listen to your own data. Okay so I hope you enjoyed the video and I appreciate any likes, shares and of course drop any comments in if you need any assistance so I'm here to help. Until next time, catch you then, cheers.
