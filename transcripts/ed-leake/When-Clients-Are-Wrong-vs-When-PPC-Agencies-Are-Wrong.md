You need to look in the mirror quite a few times and say, what could we have done better? Where did we fuck up? All those things that we can do proactively, like you mentioned, just going beyond the landing page, but, because I'll go touched on it, but proof that we, what we are doing makes sense and is working for them. The client ever comes to you questioning the results. That's on us. That's our problem. It's like, well, we need to, we need to verify this then. It's like, oh, well, we're not making sales. So, okay, well, we've driven all these leads. What the fuck is it? Well, that proactive cause prime example. We need to monitor them. We need to validate them. And then this data is telling us the answer. So the clients are lying or they're wrong or we're wrong. So I think probably, you probably need more calls around that in the new year about the little bit more technicalities around it to prove to clients and to verify yourself that this makes sense, because it's not just about Google ads and I've seen more people doing Facebook ads for remarketing to compliment Google ads and stuff like that. And like you say, it's not about just upsetting. It's about what makes sense for the service for that for that client. What should we be doing? I'm giving them so much value that if they leave, they try to do it themselves. They were like, instantly freak out. Like I don't I never I want to simplify things enough, but not to the point where they think they can do it. But if they left, I know all of these clients would not be able to get the same results. I think that is the that's the gold at the end of the rainbow. If you can get in a position where you feel that confident about your service, then there's no reason why you can't make this work. And you're completely right. If you're tracking the quality, you do all that side of it. You're feeding that back into Google ads. You're making budget and bidding decisions on that data. You're managing the landing page or testing things, you know, yada, yada, yada. Or even in Sam's case, chasing up supposed dud and cold leads that the client can't be asked to ring. Then you've got all this ammunition to say, this is actually working really well. If you leave, you're the fool because that's the default we take, isn't it? You know, for client leaves, we often think, oh, they're shit. It's their fault. Well, that's not very introspective. You know, you need to look in the mirror quite a few times and say, what could we have done better? You know, where do we fuck up? Yeah, they were paying the arse. But come on, what was it perfect? What can we add to it? So I think I think we need more conversations in the new year around that because that's the new way. It has been the new way for a while. And I know I keep blabbering on about it, but having a template for this and tell them a lot easier if you only focus on one industry, obviously, but it can be migrated across to many industries. But yeah, having that structure in place that isn't just pure Google ads, which is a bit risky. The same is just doing SEO, just doing Facebook ads, just doing well, content writing. Good luck with that. Chat GPT for pro turbo, whatever. There's been many times that I have heard from other people that they lost a Google ads account to another agency that didn't do Google ads because that other agency was doing their Facebook and SEO and website. So it's not about creating more services, but it's becoming like just that one place for them where like they get the best consulting, they get the best results, they get their best everything. So then if they do have to leave, they really are in a worse position. I would say like my response to that would be, why did that client leave to get someone that could do a website for them? Because in theory, if you're doing a job and you've got mega landing pages and all these this is all linked and doing its thing, they wouldn't need to be concerned with that shit. Oh, this isn't this isn't me, by the way. I'm perfect. No. Yeah. All right. I know you're smiling. I can't see your face. But do you see what I mean? Like if the client has the fields that way, then there's a small chance that that client is just that way or you're not doing. You're not filling all the gaps and there aren't too many gaps. Leigh quality and landing pages are the two big gaps for Leigh Jen.
