Where do you see the future of Google Ads and paid ads advertising going over the next few years? You know, with JA4 performance max, search terms kind of like hiding away now, Google's changing things. Where do you just intuitively, or just what are your little conspiracies? Because I think a lot of people would really value hearing where you think it's going, the future of advertising. It's not really short timeframe in terms of technology, but I think within the next couple of years, I don't think it's going to go very far. I don't think it's going to look too different to what we have now. Tracking is still a bit of an unknown quantity. In terms of Google Ads, I think performance max is the big bang that we've experienced now. And I don't think we're going to get another big bang for some time. The reason I think that is because from, you have to look at it from Google's perspective, the performance max is a significant change to their ecosystem. It was not without risk for them. It's not entirely working for people. There are a lot of complaints around it. Google is admitting that they need to refine and improve, refining and improve. So that process of iteration takes time, even for Google. You know, they make mistakes, they'll take a step back, they'll take two steps forward. So I think this P max is going to be with us, iterated for many years. I don't think we're going to lose manual bidding in that timeframe. I'd be surprised. That depends on the enterprise clients that Google's actively talking to. So that will depend on their appetite and if they're still heavy into manual, that Google doesn't care about anyone else. They're not really in the equation because they can force them onto smart bidding. All their videos are about looking after the small guy and launching a big dream. So that's, I think that's the tripping point for things like manual bidding. Keywords are, I think we're kidding ourselves if keywords go away in the next two years. Because why would Google kill the cash cow? It works. People know how to make it work. If they don't, they've got P max, which will automate it. I can't, from a business perspective, I can't see why Google would change that quickly. Yeah. Because P max, as I said, is a big bang for Google. It's a significant step change. So next two years, I do think we will have, we're in a recession, even though the US administration changed the meaning of it, but we are in a recession. Europe's in a recession. The UK is crawling, I think we're 0.6% growth the past quarter. So we just, I think we just scraped it of not being, but we ain't growing. Winter is coming. Thanks to not just Putin, it's not just his fault. You could blame a lot of world leaders for what's going on in the energy market. But there is, thanks to the idiots that run many of these countries, we're going to have that whammy. So in terms of the outlook for Google agencies, I think it's okay, apart from industries that aren't recession proof or particularly cyclical in recessions. I think for generalists and more generic agencies, I think they're going to have a bit of a shock. I think there's quite a few zombie businesses that will be essentially they're treading water. They're like I was six, seven years ago. Hey, look, I'm making all this money. No, you're not. You're turning over money. You're creating revenue, no profit in and out, in and out. So there's going to be some hard truth there. And then going off slightly on a tangent, all these gurus will disintegrate and disappear because they're living off people having spending money. And the freedom to spend, which is drying up as well. Yeah. So those are the three things that I think will shift and change. And I think the influencer market needs to needs a good shakeup. I don't have an Instagram account, but from my understanding, it's full of bollocks and tick tock as well. Like people selling dreams to kids and getting them to spend money on training all this shite. That needs to go. That needs to really fuck off. They can't delete the app. That'd be similar. We don't we don't need tick tock. We don't need it. Doesn't that doesn't improve anyone's life. Yeah. So yeah, I think don't be worried about the Google tech and the Google ads technology, the ecosystem. I don't think in two years will change significantly. I think there's a bit of panic. But Pmax is a big chain. It needs to iterate. That will take time. What do you think? I reckon I agree with everything you say. I think there's a bit of a panic at the moment because there's a new product out, which is Pmax and a lot of people are going to be like, Pmax and a lot of people are really interested in it, especially in the e-commerce sphere. And people think if they're not on it, they're missing out. And I think because there's such a big change, like I think we were saying on the other call the other day, there'll be a lot of agency owners or people in this field who are the ones who are worried about it. But clients aren't worried and other people aren't worried. So I don't think that's a big issue. I think in terms of keywords, like over the last few years, obviously the keyword match types have changed definitions and how they operate. So that kind of people kind of got annoyed at that, you know, with the standard ads and expanded text ads and then now RSA ads, they're changing. I think lead gen terms are just search, you know, can kind of remain really quality. As long as you just start doing good keywords, like, you know, they're really pushing towards the automation side. And I think that's the change now going from like the human controlling everything to like Google ideally wants you to just be fully machined. I think the benefit is when it's like, I call it like cyborg Google ads, where it's like half man, half machine. The other unfortunate thing about Pmax is like they're not being transparent on search terms. You can't clean up the traffic. And, you know, that's why at the end of the day, a lot of big e-commerce companies like ASOS or big enterprise search agencies will never go to automation because they do need either brand branding control to make sure they're not showing for the wrong things. I've got financial clients that I've got to get every ad and every keyword approved. And I get that. And I think Google, that's the only reason why Google hasn't like pulled the rug out from everyone because they're like, oh, we do know that these big clients require absolute control. I think, but like, apart from that, I just see that there's a lot of people just running around Google going, what's why this Pmax stuff I need to do? It's like, you actually don't need to do it. You don't. If your standard shopping is going well, you don't need to do it. Yes, you can actually make a lot more money from it. But like when I'm auditing accounts and doing paid audits now, most people are doing it really wrong. But if you're trying to do it yourself, you're a fool because I think like there's more to it than just like what people think. I simplify it in terms of how I tell people to do it because, you know, I've got to be palatable. And you paid a lot of money to get results. You're not paid a lot of money to do the work. And this is the distinction that people need to make as well. It's like, oh, what, you know, what do I need to be doing today? Well, fuck all if it's working. And that's the important thing, you know, in recent years, I haven't had a client ask what are you doing? I just wanted to highlight that because I think there is a lot of this. Oh, I need to be seen to be working because now Pmax is doing all the work for me. It's like, well, there are a lot of other things you can be bloody doing. You've said compliance, you know, having to sign off, add copies, supply that particularly in insurance and finance. How think about it? How does Google automate any of those industries that are very sensitive? That's an incredibly complicated situation. I won't. I won't because they're probably the clients who are paying a spending of $100 cost per click or a hundred pounds cost per click, spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions a month, like they're the cash cows. So let's do this and do the question then. In how many years are keywords going away? Keywords will go away and add creation, you know, writing stuff, keywords and add copy. That will go away when Google can crack compliance issues. How is that 10 years? You know, AI, it's more law, isn't it? It should get exponentially better. Compliance is only getting tighter. Like there's no regulations or compliance that's becoming more lenient as time's going on. So it's like, you know, even with Google Analytics or the data stuff, like they can't even do it themselves to their own product, let alone are they going to be able to do it for other industries that they don't even understand. So keywords are here today for a good time is my take on it. 75,000 years. Like reverse engineer the business environment. Like don't think about Google as a load of functions. Think about Google as the business is like Pmax is a big thing. They've got to iterate this. That takes time. Resources. Think about the wider businesses that use Google ads and what the ramifications for them are, because some of them wouldn't be able to use it. They're not going to Google is not going to let that happen. It can't, can't afford to, unless Pmax becomes absolute beast, sells all their inventory across all the platforms and they just go, ah, we don't want the complication of you lot on our platform. So we'll just stop supporting you. Yeah, which they do. They've done it with many medical, medical, Nisha's nutrition stuff like that. And just gone, no, we don't want that on here by killer. But yeah, that's why I don't belong Google ads entirely. But killer.
