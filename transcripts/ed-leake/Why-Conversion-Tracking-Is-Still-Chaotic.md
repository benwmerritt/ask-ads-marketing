and third party tracking, all they do is move the goalposts a little bit. And it's just, I don't know. The other couple of things that I think have changed, audience is in conversion tracking because of privacy, GA4. The technology has been trying to catch up. So tracking is sort of, we've got enhanced conversions now in GA4, which has some interesting audience data and properties. But I don't feel like we're in a better place. I feel like these products, these features have been added to keepers where we were in terms of data so Google doesn't lose out. So I don't think these are necessarily adding a lot to the table. It feels more like sticky plasters to keep us having reliable conversion tracking. It's never going to be 100%. Can I ask the question there, sorry, is when you do conversion tracking for your clients or recommend it, do you recommend it through Google Analytics 4 linked back to the Google ads account or using the Google ads conversion tag itself? Both, but probably primarily tag. If you've got multiple channels, I don't know. I'm starting to lean on GA4 being quite reliable, honest. Interesting. Compared to, do you have any other business? Every business is different and you get to make a decision. Most people need to use Google ads tag. Simple as that. Not a third party at all. I've seen people say this before. If you're using Google ads tag, you're a noob. I completely disagree with Kassim on that. Kassim from Solutions 8. It did post that. I think I saw it pop up on LinkedIn. For small medium businesses, they don't need that level of third party tracking. And third party tracking, because we've got a couple of clients that use it, what converts and then there's another one. I can't remember the bloody name of it. All they do is move the goalposts a little bit. It's just, I don't know. The Google tracking is pretty solid. It's reliable. If you face Google ads off against analytics and you compare and contrast, you do get a decent amount of comparison. If you're spending tens and tens of thousands a month, get a third party as well. Only if you multi-channel. If you're doing pure Google ads, even then I'd say, well, third party tracking, all it's going to do is shift the budget around a bit. I'm just not that sold yet. We've got an enterprise client we work with who has Google ads tracking, Google analytics tracking and also a third party and they do not match up whatsoever. And it's really challenging because they're spending hundreds of thousands a month and I'm there to consult on what the accurate data is and that's when we've got to go back to Google. It's like ID offline data, but still I just find for most businesses, Google tag manager using Google ads tag, set it up in there. Just do, that's your fundamental 101 bread and butter. I started off with analytics, by the way, just linking them in, but Google analytics, it was the beautiful free software of like, what a software? What a amazing analytical software. But then obviously over time with ad blockers and then data privacy, it's that conversion data isn't as powerful as it once was. So Google ads. I think GA4 has improved that situation reliability, but yeah, GA3 UA, whatever we want to call it, did definitely tail off over the past year, like 80% as accurate or worse sometimes, just counting conversions. I think GA4 is definitely caught that up. I don't know if some of it's through modeling. I'll be honest. Don't understand the underlying technology well enough to know, which means why are you using it? Well, I don't understand the third party trackers underlying technology. That's why I'm not using them. And a prime example is last quarter for a big retailer of ours, a decent side retailer, moved a lot of budget to Facebook ads because this third party tracker said that Facebook ads actually was converting more than Facebook than analytics was reporting net result, no more revenue net result. They got more budget and we the budget just moved. The client got no more revenue. So it was an exercise in futility. It felt like I think these third party trackers and for a lot of data at the enterprise level, it shouldn't be used for tactical decisions. It should be strategically where you're placing budget at what stage and why, maybe campaign level, but any lower than that is probably too granular because then you are really trusting in that tracking being Bob on. And essentially we're measuring chaos, which human behavior is completely chaotic. You know, I might run to the crapper and buy something on a whim. I might sit there on the sofa every night looking at something and never buy it. It's so difficult to, it sounds like a leader, pretty trivial life, doesn't it? It's not my buying habits, by the way. They're more like a Stein post. Like they're not like, as they say in Zen is the finger pointing to the moon is not the moon. So maybe conversion data is pointing us in the right direction, not actually what the tangible outcome is. The Google ads tag why I like it is the data driven approach. While some may over attribute, it actually does attribute where attribution is due because you, if we're doing the old school last click model, once if something was the middle click or the first click and you start turning that things off and like now the start of that funnel is dead. That's why I find it relevant, especially for Google ads. And I do the same with Facebook. Now the data does overlap, but I prefer to have overlapping over attributed data that gets results than under attributed data that doesn't like if you're really getting to the point where you're trying to save pennies, like just relax, like stop being so stingy, like just run ads, get results, get on with life. There's more than life than just like lead generation and e-commerce. Like have it run your business and focus on those things as well. Yeah, I think that's a golden nugget. You prefer over attributing to under attributing data or analytics because one will make you spend less and that's compounding because then you'll spend less again because you're getting less revenue through less conversions and that's a downward spiral. Whereas over attributing, yes, but it's kind of forward looking, isn't it? It's fortuitous. It's like, oh, well, I'll spend more on that. And then next month as a result of that, you've actually got more, you know, it's not quite as much more as the attribution is telling you. So yeah, there's a lot of that at play.
