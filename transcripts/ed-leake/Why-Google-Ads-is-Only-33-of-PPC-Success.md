God tier ads, it is so thorough, but and you've done that to make sure that you tell people everything you can do and you're always evolving that. It's a complex framework because there's literally hundreds of moving parts in it, but it is a simplification of the thought process of Google ads. It's like dot to dot because it will get you 90, 95% of the way. And that 5% at the end is really hard brain work that actually you could probably use that same brain work outside of the account to generate a much bigger increment. People are like, oh, should I be layering audiences? And I'm like, no. You know, just stop trying to think about Super Mr. Advanced unless you've got a really big account which spending hundred thousand dollars. I get it. That's a month. You know, if you spend a hundred K a month, I get it. You can 5% increments pretty good. If you spend a couple of grand, it's going to take you a year to feel, notice, see anything doing that. You've got a Zag when others are zinging and too many people are zinging inside their ads account. You're talking about Google ads is Google ads is probably let's just say it's even let's just say it's 33% because the other 33% will be the website, the landing page. The other 33% will be market forces being at the industry, competition, Google settings and all of those things because one thing I was just speaking to two agency owners today. One I went for a walk with and got lunch with and another who's a business partner of mine. And we're just talking about this stuff and everyone's clients like, oh, you know, five years ago, my CPA was this or my ROAS was this. And it's like, dude, firstly, cost per clicks are going up like 20% each year. Your product price is the same. Your conversion rates going down because of more competition in the market. You can't fix market forces in a Google ads account. You can't fix a hiring like CPC is going up. Doesn't matter what your quality score is, doesn't matter what your costs are going to go up. Full stop. More competitions coming in the market. Google's taking away settings that make it in Google and Facebook are taking away settings that you have more control. People just need to get real with that. Like advertising is getting more expensive. The truth is more than ever, they need a good specialist or agency running it because it's actually as it gets harder, agencies are needed more. But this is why I think you should that's it. Specialized and I don't mean Google ads. It's not that's not specialized. And I've had this argument on LinkedIn because obviously that's what you do. It's very professional. You go on there to argue. But people say, oh, well, I do e-com and lead gen for Google. I'm a specialist. No, you fuck up. It's what my agency does and we're not specialists. I mean, specialize, work with solar companies only and own it. Own the landing page. Own the lead capture, the lead scoring, the nurture, the whole for owning. Like I call it the ultimate solution. I just did a thing inside forge about it. But only, you know, to the point where you're delivering leads, qualified leads to that client on a plate on a platter so they can't complain. And when they do complain that they're not getting the fleet, you have all the metrics to prove otherwise. And if you prove that you are wrong, then it's your fault. But at least you know, because you're controlling the whole bloody process. But also every country in the bloody world is is deflating away the currencies by printing it, you know, 10, 15 percent a year. So the price of everything is going up because of the value of a pound. Yeah, the $1,000, a US dollar, a Canadian dollar, Euro, whatever. It's going through the floor and people. That's why people are feeling the pinch, but they don't really know why. It's not just inflation. It's that pressure of printing money. You've got more money in the system. I had this conversation a few months ago with a chap in the trade. Our cost per clicks are double where they were three or four years ago. And I'm like, OK, and what's the cost of your labor now? Oh, well, yeah. But, you know, price of bread's gone up and I'm well, hold on, hold on. Answer the question. Is your price doubled? Well, yeah, probably because, you know, making excuses. Well, why do you think? Well, Google's doubled, but yours has. So you're sort of balancing each other out a bit on you, you know, inflation rewires, it's not great. It's just the reality of the economic environment we find ourselves in. But that is often the case. Yeah. Round to awesome.
