Let's just start off with for the reasons for why you feel that traditional ad agencies are dying or we can also expand that to why the vast majority of freelancers agencies never really get to the levels of sustainable success. Oh, where do you start with that question? So I think it's two key components to that. And it's the foundational bit. It's the lifestyle versus entrepreneurial. You mentioned what was it 75% of people don't they're earning less than 5k a month. That's right. Which is okay. You know, if you're in that lifestyle business where you want to get enough work to pay you 60 grand a year or 100 grand a year, whatever it is, then that's perfectly okay if that's your long term vision, if that's your goal. And we should not look down on people for doing that. No, the entrepreneurial path is completely different because the ultimate goal is to offload the work. You know, if you're on the lifestyle, typically you're doing the work entrepreneurial, you're typically building a business, hiring people, putting a process together for it. So I think people get stuck sometimes not knowing which way they should go and why and sitting in the lifestyle component where it's like, okay, I'll just freelance or consult or whatever contract because that agency thing sounds a bit risky. I've got to hire people don't want to hire people. And it's I think it's that it's that step. It's quite a big step can be quite risky, especially if you have to give away a big portion of your revenue to hire. And it's not for everyone. So I get that. So that answers that component. And then apologies to everyone I've got a tickly throat today. So if I keep clear my throat, and I'm annoying you just mute where I'm talking and look at Aaron. That's what my editor would do later anyway. So we'll get rid of it. We'll get rid of as much as we can. And he's promised that he'll make us both look at least five years younger. So Christ, So on agency for you mentioned that I say agencies are dying in my sales pitch traditional agencies. And it is essentially it's in the pitch video it's in the the gum text. It's a little bit hyperbolic but I also think it's it's true and it's relevant to this day and age simply because we can't ignore the fact that the ad platforms are trying to automate as a way they're trying to squish the component that is the Google ads manager, Facebook's doing it, everyone's doing it. You then have the concern of heavy automation in the industry, AI, which is it's okay, but it's getting better, it's getting better. And at what point does the AI get so good that it strips out the button pushing. So if you're only doing button pushing for everyone, you're essentially doing nothing in the very near future because that can be automated away. So my take and look by the way I made this mistake. My agency is lead gen and ecom. We essentially work with many different industries. So I used to say we're a Google ads specialist agency. There's nothing special about what we do, like literally holding my hands up because we aren't talking to specific audiences we aren't saying insurers, we literally work with you and we have a process for you. And that's where people should head towards because it simplifies it as well. It's the old niching down but I have a solution that's more than just niching. But in principle, it's talking to one or two specific audiences that you know you work really well with and not just in Google ads but controlling the whole be a ecom or lead gen process for them. So you become essentially integral to their business, not just the Google ads guy or gal. So you're not like, oh, I'm a specialist at Google ads. It's notes. It's the all the additional components all the different pillars that support that. So it's more, it's niching in the niching but with specialisms that are prescribed specifically get the best outcome for that industry, not just doing everything. One of the comments I probably like to pick up on and just reinforce and then you spoke about your personality. And I think that's one thing that a lot of people, I guess, don't appreciate. And that's the whole thing of these, you know, they'll see an idea from Ed, they'll see an idea from Aaron, they'll see an idea from someone else and they go, well, that's the way to do it. So I've always tried to, you know, when I was forging my own path into freelancer, I'm all worked around. Like for me, what I really loved is I got into Google ads because we started our own business and we didn't have money from marketing agency. So I had to figure out how to use Google ads for me. So for me, it was always about how much my spending and how much is my business growing. So every sales pitch that I went through that was the problem that I wanted to solve. So when I came to start pitching to clients, that's what I always spoke about. And I think that's one thing that a lot of people, I guess, shy away from is that you don't have to be a seven figure agency. You don't even have to, you don't even have to hire people. It's really looking at what do you want this agency to look like and what skills can you best serve the marketplaces where I think I've always tried to sort of encourage people to really focus on.
