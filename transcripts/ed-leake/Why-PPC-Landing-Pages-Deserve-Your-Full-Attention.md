280 something percent increase. So that's colossal. And you cannot do that inside the Google ads account unless the Google ads account was an absolute show. With the cost of leads dropping down, are you finding that the 80 20 of this is coming from landing page being a lot cleaner, a lot better rather than maybe the campaigns are set up wrong? Or are you finding this actual landing page that is what drives the hardest 80 percent of these results? Yes. So if the search terms are all pretty clean, you're getting good quality traffic, then I'd usually kind of lean to that and say, yeah, it's the landing page, which is really making the biggest difference in the account because I know from other forge calls we've had, there's only so many things you can do. And Google ads to shave off the price of your CPCs or find it a bit more efficient bidding strategy. And while there are some major breakthroughs you can get in the Google ads account, I find that you can find even bigger ones on the landing page.

You can see like it's, you know, there's decent information, but it's, you know, it's not exactly optimized for Google ads traffic, especially when you've got technical specs as your bullet points or benefit points. Here's what we converted the page into. Yeah. So a minor change at the top. So you can see, yeah, and you can see it's, it's pretty similar with the content that we include, but it's just a bit more logical in the information that we include. So shows social proof. And then you've got a very simple pop up here. Really nothing too fancy. And then you've got this kind of simple transformation or what you're going to get from booking that consultation or getting a free quote. You can kind of get an idea that you're going to get a free 3d design as well. It just shows a bit of the transformation.
