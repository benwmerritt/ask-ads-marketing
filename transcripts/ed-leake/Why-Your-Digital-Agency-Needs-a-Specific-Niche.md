A lot of people worry about being specific or niching that it all, you know, they'll lose customers, they'll lose business from other places. The world's a very big place and that's a very safe place to be to go, oh, I'll serve everyone. So, but it also means you'll serve no one because you're just doing the same as most people. So being very specific makes your life easier because you can really tailor things and get to know that industry. But also you don't have to just serve that industry. You could go, right, I'm doing really well with plumbers, so now I'm going to do builders. I don't know. The processing Google ads, for example, and a good landing page is very similar for that kind of business. So you could just start essentially rins repeating this business. And then you might be like, oh, well, I wanted to be a freelance, so now I need to be an agency because I can't, I've got a flood of leads. And it does sound a bit sort of hyperbolic that you get a flood of leads. But if you stand out like that, who is the beautician going to knock on your door when she sees you talking about plumbers? No. She'll go and find someone else. Is the plumber going to look at someone that's talking about e-com scaling? Oh, they do Google ads? No. Okay. Or the guy that's literally talking about plumbing? It doesn't even know you do Google ads. You're just talking about plumbing ads. Could be Facebook or whatever. The other thing that I always try to say, and this is something I repeat to even just clients, is in your ad copy, so you're saying treating your LinkedIn profile like your landing page ad copy, is I always go to say, what can we say that no one else can say? So rather than just saying we're the number one agency on the number one freelancer, by putting in there, our last three clients have reduced acquisition costs by 57%. Whatever the situation is. That's why I always try to wherever possible put a percentage or a dollar value on it, rather than just saying, I hate seeing any ad that says that we're the best or we're the number one agency. Because it's a bullet. For me, you don't want to say something that anyone else can say. Yeah, because it's a bullet. It's people saying, oh, we're the number one agency. It's like, that's just walking. Not in the metaphor, but that's walking around with your manhood hanging out your trousers. No one wants to see that. Yeah. People don't want to be told about how good that you are. Oh, we've got all these awards and I'm certified and you're certified. What insane. Yeah. No, that stuff just needs to be sacked off. Talk about the prospects like you say, like the wins. The specific numbers are great. It's like, what do you mean you can increase my leads 57% why 57? Well, yeah, I've got a very specific. Case study here it is. Look, before and after case studies as well. Yeah. Like a good case study, a good before and after to a specific industry is 90% of what you need to get people to buy off you. You know, that Mr. Plummer or Mrs. Plummer is 2024. And, you know, it's all they need to see that specific industry relevant piece of content. And they're like, oh, I can do that. I could get that brilliant. Like people overthink it all the time.
