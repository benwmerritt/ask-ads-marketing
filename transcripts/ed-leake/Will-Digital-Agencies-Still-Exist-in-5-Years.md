I see some people who say, look, we're going to get automated away. The platforms don't want the middleman. When you think 10, 15, 20 years from now, are you still seeing digital marketing agencies? Right. I'm going to have, give you a cop out answer because, because. It's a really good reason for this. And you're only on this planet once. And if you spend your time and energy worrying about a decade ahead or, or more that you probably have, unless you control a nuclear weapon, you probably have zero impact on the direction. That's true. Then I would suggest that's a lot of wasted energy and potential. And you're not living today. You're not living in the now. You're not enjoying the fruits of your labor. Hopefully if you've got some, you're, you're in a permanent state of fear about the future. So that is a bit of a cop out answer. So I, I'm a five year guy. I look ahead because I invest quite a lot. So I'm thinking five years, five years. And this is probably the hardest time in my relatively short life that I've, I'm struggling to see what happens in five years. Yeah. What does an agency look like in five years? I believe we'll still be around. Um, unless the singularity of that, uh, journey or that ride on the hockey stick to singularity that we're supposedly on, I don't know if we've started or not yet. Um, if that does arrive, then none of us will be correct. Uh, what we're suggesting today, this is the problem. Everyone's trying to give an answer. Everyone's trying to, you know, scratch the, the barrel to get an answer to sound smart and informed. Or I'm, I'm just obviously not that smart or informed because I have no idea where we'll be in five years. I think in the next few years, not a lot changes. Yeah. Realistically, the platforms change. Yes. Yes. But the fundamentals don't. Yes, there'll be more automation, but that will bring problems that you need to resolve. Yes. AI will get better. It needs to get better. AI is not good enough yet. It simply is not good enough. Um, not if, if AI is better than you, you need to do better at your job. Yeah. I'm not. I'm frankly. Yeah. Um, I'm saddened by feeling, uh, yeah, I'm with you there. Uh, it's okay. It's a shortcut to, it fixes, it's sticky plasters. AI at the minute is a few tools that help you speed up the process. Brilliant. Take a few shortcuts. Fine. Does not replace you. This kind of technology, it either takes 50 years or it takes five years and it's, it'll be a light switch moment. It'll be a sentient AI. I'm sorry, Dan. I cannot do that. Um, so, you know, that day that it comes, well, all bets are off. So I don't want to worry about it too much. I, I'll think about the year ahead. I'll think about five years from a, some of my investment thesis and where I put my money and, you know, what, you know, and health, also health, you know, I eat well and I exercise today because it will repay me in five years, not next week. Business now, okay. You probably have to shorten that duration. What you do today will probably repay you in six, 12 months or whatever. But yeah, five years beyond no idea. For most people, don't worry about it. Try and be happy in today. You talk to agency owners, uh, basically every single day, probably too many times a day. Um, you know, you have your own agency that's running along in the background. You have run, uh, software for agencies. You've been involved in so many different levels of the industry. You are investing your own time and money in the form of your business into agencies. Right. Like you are working with agencies. I suppose if you thought five years from now, agencies probably wouldn't exist. You wouldn't have the forge, which is your community for agency owners, which is just paying me. Yeah. They're, they're paying you, but you've got a lot of energy probably be shifting your focus to like, I don't know, forage for dentists or whatever it's going to be. Yeah. I will say, I think I'm more pessimistic than you, but I'm sorry. Don't, sorry, Dan, you got me wrong. I am incredibly pessimistic. No, the, uh, the pessimism is there. I think I actually honestly think there's, there are two, I think is a very binary outcome actually. This is why I didn't want to talk about it. I do believe it's a sadly, I think it's a binary outcome. It's either utopia or it is the opposite.
