I really want to focus on the agency more because looking at all the numbers, the course, it did make a lot of money and it does, but it's extremely stressful. It is a completely different business. You're watching a highlight from Agency Forge with the Ed League exclusive community for PPC agency owners to stop talking about in those other groups and join AgencyForge.com application only in terms of conditions apply, etc. And the training course. So you are using that as essentially a downsell to people that you couldn't work with because they weren't the right shape or fit. How has it worked in the opposite way now that you've matured the training over the past? What are we on? Two years? Are you finding it actually generates more leads now? So it's having the opposite effect of what you used it for originally? I'll be candid since this is Forge on YouTube and the whole world will see it. For people thinking about buying Forge, like I did for a while. It's like, oh, there's a new YouTube video. I'll watch it for five minutes, but I won't buy Forge yet. But hey, no, that was a really, really long drip feed. And I said, these are so good. Why don't I just buy this thing already? These five minute clips that are gold. I'm like, what was the rest of the hour of the video? I should really stop getting free samples and just buy it quickly and that guy. Yeah, the hook. Yeah, the fight. That was incredible. I wonder what the rest of the video said. But no, I'll be candid here. It's really a mess. And I've been trying to get focused. And I really want to focus on the agency more because looking at all the numbers, the course, it did make a lot of money and it does. But going back to me, not motivated by money, it's extremely stressful. It is a completely different business. And a lot of friends that are entrepreneurs, one of them owns five franchises, much more successful than me than that. So I think it's brand a lot. And I told him the idea years ago, he said, that's a completely different business. You're going to run two businesses at the same time. I said, no, no, no, no, I do PPC and I'll teach PPC. It's like two different businesses. Well, I know you don't know what you're talking about. And they are, my attention's divided a lot. I have to go back and forth and I don't really have an answer. I haven't. There's some people it's a down fell. It brings a lot of traffic to its own domain to YouTube. It gets sales. We get white label clients from it. A lot of people that are SEO or web design. And I see their emails, you know, it's webdesign something.com and they bought everything. And then I track their progress and they get to 30% and then they usually send me an email. So do you do white label? It's like, yes. So that trickles in some people, I went through your course and I hire you now. It's like, well, great, you should have a good setup. I can just take it over if you watch the videos. And then some people just buy it and a lot of international traffic, just random stuff. It did get pirated. So, you know, I'm very honored to someone thought it was worth stealing. So I had to deal with lawyers and it's like, wow, it's on a hundred different sites. It's just whack-a-mole. So that hurts sales quite a bit. And, you know, talk to attorneys. It's like, look, there are another company that shuts them down and then they're going to pop up another site tomorrow. I don't know how you wouldn't know watching my video, but I've got a trading course as well. And yeah, it is whack-a-mole and they just appear, I think it's some kind of syndicate or crime ring where they literally, someone gets it and they just sell it to each other or share it. But my mindset is after trying to try and the legal route of squishing some of them, my mindset is the people that are prepared to download that for free or for $30 or whatever are not my customers anyway and they wouldn't buy my thing. They're the wrong people. When someone sees something and then Google, you know, torrent or PDF for free, you're kind of going to lose the sale anyway. And with technology, it's nearly impossible to not cut and paste, record the screen, export. There's a way to rip off anything. So I don't think it was that big of a hit. It was just frustrating. It's still, and it took a lot of my time, a lot of time, a lot of frustration, and it just kind of going back and forth between the two is frustrating. So I'd say dividing my attention wasn't the best choice looking back. So you're, I mean, what do you think in terms of hours you put into the first, we'll call it version one of the training, the first version of the training where you were like, yeah, this is done, but it's never done. I mean, what in the hours do you think roughly like 200, 100, 500? That's pretty embarrassing. Two or 300. Oh, yeah. That's not embarrassing. I mean, I easily did that with God Tierat. So that's the other thing. If you've got the agency to run, as I did at the time, it is a massive distraction. Yeah. It's a lot of energy and then the upkeep and support as well. Stop trying to scale your agency on your own. It's a lonely pursuit. It's boring. It's tiring. It gets your blood meds. Join agency for a community mastermind training from like minded PPC agency owners and myself at leak. I was going to follow that up with the dot com, but I'm not a dot com on a real person. Go check it out.
