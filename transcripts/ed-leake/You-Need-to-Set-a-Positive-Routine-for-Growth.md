There's three elements to it. It's so simple. It's like, what do I want to achieve? How am I going to go about it? And what time am I going to dedicate to it? It's no longer hard because it's routine. We are creatures of habit. Once you have to force yourself to get into a positive routine because bad routines are, you know, they surround us. And once you get into a positive routine, it's like, I force myself to get up every morning and exercise every single morning, apart from some days. And I've been doing that for nearly a year. And some mornings, I've got my, I forced myself into this routine now where it's a habit. And it literally, if I try and lay in bed, my brain says, no, this is not what you're meant to be doing. And literally my legs swing themselves out of the bed. It's like, get up. It's incredible because a year ago, there's no way I'd want to get up in the dark and do exercise. I've got into this rhythm and my head's like, no, this is what we're doing. And it's exactly the same with communication. I've just put two things live. Sorry. In Forge, the 1690 day plan. It's so simple. And it sounds like you should do that. You literally put these three elements to it. It's so simple. It's like, what do I want to achieve? How am I going to go about it? And what time am I going to dedicate to it? And then if you stick to it at the end, and I say 60 to 90, because 90 is sometimes too long for some people. 60 is kind of nice. It's bi-monthly. And then at the end of it, you literally have one sheet to assess yourself to say, what did I do good? What did I do bad? What did I like? What didn't I like? And it sounds so stupid. But if you force yourself to do the simple things, it will break you out of the anything that's getting in the way, which is another things tend to fall away as well. When you get in a good routine, you kind of realise bad things also start slipping off. Like we start one thing and you stick to it. Other things that you want to do, you'll start just naturally sticking to because it's like a muscle. It's weird, but it kind of works. And all the crap that isn't important, you just don't make time for anymore. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So all those things you put in your day, they take all the time from the stuff you don't want to do.
