No fucking button that says, hey, schedule a consultant call as the first call to action. No. What is holding you back right now? Do you think it's a good time to scale your business? You know, asking all these kind of hard hitting questions, because what I'm trying to do to filter out that traffic from TikTok, because I can't control that algorithm on the TikTok front end, I can't tell it where to go. I get leads from all over the world. They come through, and if they've downloaded their ebook, they've visited the VSL, and then they're filling out the questionnaire, I'm actually trying to put up as many walls of friction as possible. Only the cream of the crop pops out the other end. So I'm doing the opposite of conversion rate optimization. I'm trying to. No fucking button that says, hey, clicked for a schedule a consultant call as the first call to action. No, like once you can get the volume of leads up, because you're doing some good things and you're showing up like you are, you need to go hard on the qualifying. You need to stick hurdles in people's way, because the business owners that are hungry, they'll tumble and stumble over those hurdles happily, get a bruise, wipe themselves down and jump over the next buddy heard on crack the head open and then carry on.

Right, I'm going to make it 30 minutes. Oh, there's three questions on the form. Right, there's 30 now. Yeah, I think I counted 17 the other day or 17 or something on that form. And then there's another form previously. And then as soon as they check into on my onto my calendar, I make them do the best question for sales ever. I am the only decision maker in this business. You know, that is a golden key. As soon as you book in on the calendar, get that question answered, they can't book it in unless they answer that. Because I'm sure any kind of any person in sales, I just got to check with my partner. And that's, that's a, that's a sales killer. Got to check the bot with the boss. It's like, okay, they even know you're on this call. No.
