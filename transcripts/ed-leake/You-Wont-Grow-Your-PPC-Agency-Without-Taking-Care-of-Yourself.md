It's been hell, but it's just been bouncing off me. And I bet you a few years ago, well, three years ago, when I stopped exercising, it would have been. I finally got my first landing page is done. And if everything works out fine, I will start this week testing my first Google ads. I know this has been a topic in the comments lately. People have experienced doing that. I want to try to go into a niche where people are looking for experts and consultants, because from my experience, this is where most of my best clients that I have right now came from when I just went on as a freelance on LinkedIn and then turned them from where by the thought that we're only looking for freelancer or some guy who consults them, turned them into a real agency client. And so this is what I'm trying right now. I have one issue and one priority that changed because of, let's say, I can be honest about it. I just didn't feel that great and more like from a standpoint of fitness. You know, this is what you always also said in your video class. So can't fit before you need to be on point regarding your fitness and sleep and stuff like that. And so well, I had a holiday with my family and saw a lot of friends and drank a lot of booze. I just ate a lot of shit. I gained weight. And so after the holidays where I thought now I should be in, I should be like in the right mood to get back to work. I felt like, oh, shit. I really, I felt tired and I felt like this is this. I wasn't really happy about getting back into my office. I said to my, to my employees said, just keep doing it. I just took the calls that I needed to take it. And I felt like kind of like burned out. And, and then I realized that this might be because I'm not treating myself the right way. So I'm not getting, I get like five hours of sleep every night. I, I, I drink beer at night. I go to my dolls because it's right around the fucking corner of my office. So, and what I did now is I need to change this first, or at least I need to treat this part with the same amount of energy as I treat the Grow Your Agency thing, you know, because I feel like there's not enough energy. And I need to change this. I know this is probably not what we expected in this kind of accountability call, but I just wanted to be honest about it because I realized, okay, I need to change this. So this is what I started like four weeks ago. And I feel a lot better. I get more sleep. I, I changed the way I eat stuff. And I'm very happy. I got a coach extra, actually for this who, who supports me. And this is not like a diet, but I really want to change the way I, yeah, I, I live, you know, from get, get back from this junk food lover thing to, to find a way to, to eat healthy and normal and get enough sleep. So this is my priority right now. So this is so super important. And I'm glad you shared this, Moritz, because I went through this a bit before COVID, where I felt we were having, we were only having one takeaway a week, but we were letting ourselves slip. We'd buy a bag of Harry bow and eat a load of Harry bow. And I fell out of my trading regime. I used to row a lot and, or just walk, just walk for an hour in the morning. And I like getting up early when it's dark. There's no one around. Because I'm part-time burglar, obviously. And just having an hour's swift walk is a changes your outlook. The days, and we've spoken about this before with Bryce, the days that I don't exercise, I feel it, I notice it. If I eat, I don't eat McDonald's. I hate the stuff. I wouldn't feed it to a dog. No offense. But if I eat a takeaway, I know the next day and it does. And I don't want to sound like, like Mr. Perfect, but I've just cut all that out. We don't eat processed food. We grow all our own veg. Everything's whole food. If you want mayonnaise, you've got to make it. It doesn't come in a bottle in this house. If you want a sauce, you've got to make it. Just doesn't, we don't have a bottle of it. And honestly, it has transformed the way I feel. I don't get, so I used to always get tired about two, three o'clock in the afternoon. I just feel like I'm shutting down. My eyes are shutting down. I didn't want to work. And some days I'd get up and just be like, oh, I can't be bothered. If I exercise and eat well, that does not happen. Even on a shitty day. We've had a shitty day recently because we've got a client migrating to Shopify. Plus and the branding agency they're using is a bloody nightmare. They don't appear to understand what Google ads, shopping feeds and conversion tracking is. I just don't. Anyway, it's been, it's been hell, but it's just been bouncing off me. And I bet you a few years ago, well, three years ago, when I stopped exercising, it would have been. So, yeah, it's super important. And that's not like, it's not to dig at people that don't exercise, but just even a walk, like a half an hour walk a day, it does change your outlook. So I think that's the most important thing, actually, just keeping healthy. Absolutely no point making money if you're slitherly. You're slitherly ailing. Not to say you were but it's like just like getting sat on the sofa at the end of the night, feeling like crap, chucking Netflix on. That's no life. And I know a lot, sadly, a lot of people live like that. So yeah, super important. All the other stuff can wait really, but I'm glad that that sort of spurred you on to doing your landing pages and also going in a slightly different direction.
