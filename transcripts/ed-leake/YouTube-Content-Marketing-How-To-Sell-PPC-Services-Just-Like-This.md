could be worth 10 grand plus a year. Who gives a toss about view numbers, subscribers, when leads are coming in? The groups talking about the landing page and the offer and what's strong and weak about it. And it's a really good thought exercise. And I think it will help you think about tweaking that positioning. Yeah. Because then if you do YouTube videos, as Sam said, as Michael would, you know, testify as Liam would, we was take top video videos, they do bring in leads, they do bring in leads. So that's the long term play really isn't it? But like, it's also a volume play too, but the with the YouTube, which is saying because like, I noticed that I'm like, I'm not getting a massive amount of views at the moment. But I guess if you're playing to the Google, so the YouTube algorithm, you'll probably get a bit more momentum with it all. Retentions, your biggest the biggest factor is is retention. So average view rate, anything over 50% is considered very good. Nice videos. 60 seconds. But say you've got 1050 minute video, if you can get over 50% retention rate or thereabouts. That's a very positive signal to Google or YouTube. But it's a very positive signal to you because it means people are tuning in and listening. But but also, I don't know what you did videos on but being niche specific, it works. The Sam's alluded to as well, you know, he's talking specifically to that industry about a specific thing. And all of a sudden, I talked to everyone about everything like Google ads. So I'm, you know, I'm just another, another boring head in the Sam, how do you come with with ideas for topics? Does it just come from your daily work or do you like have like an approach where you like the true topics to talk about? Well, before I started doing YouTube, I bought I was like, always wanted to do it. I kept putting off for a long time. I bought a course on YouTube ads. Typically, if I'm like, I'd rather just try to buy something, understand like the basic concepts of what to do, to just accelerate the learning process. So what this course, it was the Sean Canal one, he's probably these what think media is the YouTube channel. But he's unbelievable from his own experience and the stuff they built. So I kind of following them for a while free content is great. What the course and they've got like a seven step formula, but it begins with like researching the topic, you don't want to like reinvent the wheel or create a video that no one's looking for or has an interest in. So they say, and it can be like the simplest of stuff. And I kind of lean towards what I feel I know the best, which would be quite specific, because I know I had 15 subscribers at the time of starting. And so I thought, okay, what, you know, what's what can I create or film, which is going to somehow benefit me or be some kind of utility for getting new prospects in building authority and then potentially lead generation as well. And so I was like researching topics of like, oh, Google ads is probably a bit too broad. What about Google ads for X Google ads for solar Google ads for roofing, landing page for solar landing page for roofing, used vid IQ to do a bit of keyword research to see how many people are looking for it, maybe like two and a half thousand a month, few other keywords bump that number up. Competitive score was quite low. So I just thought, hey, I'll try that. I've published the video ranked pretty much in seven days, got a bunch of friends to just like a watch plus 50% of the video, kind of give it that little boost, add some comments, shared it and then just like promoted yourself. So share on your LinkedIn, your Facebook, email it to past prospects who might even be interested in it, just like give it a bit of love once you've published it because you spent all the time planning it recording it, then you got to ideally add some kind of like similar amount of time in promoting it as well. And that's everything that was taught within the course. I've not gone into too much detail, but it makes kind of sense to do that once you published it. Then it's ranked really well, it's had over I think 600 views for my solar landing page, it's added 50 plus subscribers. So then I created another one to go off the back of it for Google ads build for solar landing pages that ended up being about 60 minutes long, which was a little bit too long, but that's also then contributed another 35 subs and still continues to rack up subs every day now. And it's niche, it's not like hundreds and hundreds of views, but it's like good. Actually, it is like 500 plus views. But how many leads from your YouTube? Do you reckon? Probably five so far. Yeah, so it's four videos. Yeah, four videos, five leads. As long as it could be worth 10 grand plus a year. Yeah, like who gives a toss about view numbers, subscribers, when leads are coming in. So I would worry about retention. If you're getting like 40, 50% good. That means you're talking about stuff that people are interested in because you only need one person to watch the video to become a lead if it's niche. So
