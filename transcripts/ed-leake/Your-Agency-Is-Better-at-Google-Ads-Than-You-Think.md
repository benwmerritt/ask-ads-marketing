I think when you get to a certain level of Google ads, you are doing way better than most people. It's a bit embarrassing how shite a lot of accounts are, sadly. I think the main thing is like, they come back to like the original, what I'm trying to achieve is they're in this position, wants to always learn and get better. Like to like feel that kind of, you know, that feeling of growth and learning, where do you go for it? But that growth and learning can be the agency as well. So if you, I mean, if you get to 20 clients or 30, and you're trying to extract another couple of percent for each of those clients, well, if the agency is in a position to take on another 20 or 30 clients, that's a much bigger gain for you personally than trying to get these incremental magic nuggets of gold into the accounts. I don't want to sound like sort of defeatist. I think when you get to a certain level of Google ads, you are doing way better than most people, because we get it all the time. The company we're with, one of our clients is migrating to Shopify Plus, and they're using a pretty decent like branding agency who does this as their job. But they have, they are sort of like shocked when we ask them to install tag manager or that we need the feed setting up for Google shopping, and they're like, oh, well, what do we need to do? And it's like, what? They literally work. They build. I'm not lying. I'm not lying. This morning, we had a client with a new website, and the developer forgot to get the GTM on the website. So we lost like all the data from yesterday. The bar is low. Okay, can you send me the code? Where do I need to put in the code? It's the bar is no fancy agencies as well. Like with nice websites, they look the part and all the websites looking great. But in terms of everything else, it's like, I can't, I just can't. I said to my guys, I said, they have built like 50, like some of the brands they work with. Like, I just don't understand how the they haven't got a process or they don't, there aren't, they're not aware that a Google shopping feed is required. And this that and the other. But I tell you what, if you're doing a good job and you know you're doing a good job, you're way above the bar. It's a bit embarrassing how shite a lot of accounts are sadly, but it's always the agency to build and grow and prosper. You know, you can only take it so far. Like, what are you going to do? Shave £2 off, £3 off your cost per lead? It's not really worth it, is it? And that's if you're lucky, because of course, tests can go the opposite direction, they can fail. If I was in your position, I would probably just try and expand the agency really. I know, Max, in sense, you do training for, do you do training for the clients? Yeah, some of them. Yeah, I mean, it's really like, it's pushing us to the limit, you know, it's really well, I mean, like day to day management, how to do that stuff like that. Okay. But training is good because, well, even if it's easy, I mean, training gives you some satisfaction because to be able to explain something is quite different than doing the thing yourself. So it gives you at least some fresh air and some extra money. So you're doing it as an aside, so you're not, you don't give the training to clients? Yeah, it's something on the side. And we also have video trainings, but here it's not really our clients that purchase it. It's mostly PPC concertants buying it and trying to get a single. Yeah, because just thinking for Sam, if like another, another route is to add on some training stuff for clients and not as a lead gen thing, but maybe not on the Google ads stuff, but more on the what good email marketing looks like. Here's the process to lead nurture. Here's the follow up sequences, you know, here's how to get close to sale, not telling you how to do your job, but from a, you know, from a marketing perspective. But that comes down to the type of client. Because if you work with a lot of trade, they'll probably be like, oh, I'm not doing all that. So yeah, again, I'm just thinking on the feet about how you can maximize things other than bolting these things on additional services to increase conversion rates and lead to sale ratio. There's always stuff you can do. You just want to make sure that you're not putting hundreds and hundreds of hours into something that is a distraction when in reality, you want to refine your processes to be able to take on more clients and grow and get the money in and buy yourself a castle in Scotland.
