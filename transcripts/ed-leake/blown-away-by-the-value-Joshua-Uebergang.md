And that is huge because when you have a predictable process, you're able to get predictable results. Josh here from Digital Darts. A few months ago, you purchased EdLeaks God Tier Ads course and have been blown away with what value Ed delivers. I run a Shopify marketing agency for over six years, specializing in Google Ads. And the checklist, the step-by-step processes, is flat out better than $1,000 courses that we have purchased. We use the checklist every day in our accounts management and it's taken a lot of this thinking and nebulous kind of management that account managers are expected to do, like left up to their own decisions to a step-by-step way of optimizing accounts.
