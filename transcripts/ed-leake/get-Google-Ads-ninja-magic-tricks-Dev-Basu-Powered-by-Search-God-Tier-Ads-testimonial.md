## Transcript
Hey, it's Deb Bassie from Powered by Search, and I just wanted to share a couple of thoughts on God Tier ads from Ed Leak. I've been a fan of Ed's work for years now. If it comes to Google ads and mastery in that environment, there really is no one better at both being able to be in the trenches and at the same time be able to zoom out and look at macro concepts. So I was really excited when he launched God Tier ads. We bought a copy for ourselves for the entire team here at Powered by Search. Our entire PPC and media buying team is very excited about it because it does a couple of things really well. So if you're considering how to think through strategic decisions, how does actually plan and optimize your ad campaigns on Google ads? And then finally, if you want to get a couple of ninja magic tricks, ways to automate things that are quite menial and quite manual, Ed throws in those as well. So we put it to work for our clients and seen a lot of success with it. We refer back to it often as well. And so whenever we're stuck, it's just a great resource. And the way that Ed packaged this in terms of helpful guides, checklist videos that explain concepts and then turn them into a way where you can take an idea and put it to action is just being really, really useful for us. So if you're somebody who is a consultant or a freelancer managing Google ad campaigns today, or you're an agency and you really want to roll this out to your entire team, couldn't recommend it more, Ed, well done. Thanks.
