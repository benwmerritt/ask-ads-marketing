Hi, so I just wanted to do a quick video testimonial here for Ed's God Tier Ads program. I'm an agency owner and it has been a game changer for me. Even just bringing on a new client is just what I use every single time and it has been phenomenal. You'll see here a new account that came on just at the end of May and they weren't... It was a mess. No other words to describe it. It was a mess. They were using page views as a conversion and they were having that as a cost of, I think it was £2 for a conversion which was a page view and it completely messed the account up. You'll see here that it is just me starting. They were quite a healthy budget of £20,000 a month. Here is when I came on. I started reviewing the account. You'll see the cost perversion go up slightly because obviously I removed page views being a conversion. This is when we started to add God Tier Ads. They weren't even tracking phone calls as a micro conversion or a macro conversion or any kind of conversions. Literally just page views and blanketing the entirety of Google. This is a flight company so it worked to a point but since we've taken it over we've added phone calls as a conversion and you can see here that it's just gradually going up very nicely, very nicely. Once going through the check list for ads and every month I go through a few sections again just to make sure that it is all good and you'll see here that the conversion rate is coming down, down, down and now this client just because of this is asked to increase the budget up to £50,000 and be on in a month. So if you are even considering God Tier Ads and it is amazing, it is a complete... So if you have so much time and onboard a new client it is just next to none and it is a checklist like no other for PPC. It genuinely is God Tier.
