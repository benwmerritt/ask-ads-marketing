This is where my garage sale, yard sale, Wine Library fucking 1991. Get me some tape and a Sharpie and I'll fucking build you an empire, motherfucker. I day trade attention and build businesses. Legacy is greater than currency. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Life documented. Back a little bit? It's got wheels on the back. Yeah, see it. Team, the nature of how much room we have is not conducive to how many of team members we have. So a lot of the time, for a lot of people, is gonna be to be at the other table we have. Edison sports cards where we're gonna set up a whole thing. We gotta get rid of a lot of these boxes and I think I wanna take them to Edison. So we're gonna help to do that. All right, we need a lot of help from you guys on this. So eight base, 16 open, sign, 240 bucks. What's up, brother? Nice to meet you. I'm G-Rocky. I'll see you there. Can't wait. G-Rocky, it's gone. You sold it? Fuck, really? Gone? It's a fucking beast. Let's go, dude. Fuckin' love this card. We've only seen about half the convention. Interesting. There's a whole new section that's massive. Me and AJ crossed it. We went around and just gave 30, 40, $50 slabs to kids. Just being nice. People are so happy. Think I'm giving away too many. Like if I'm thinking now, like one at a time. That's what, tell me. You got it. We are at the booth. We're building three, four, five, six. So 30. 30, 60, 91. 240, so we're gonna be 11 short. Who's got the keys, Mayling? Easy. Six easy, right? Easy, six. Easy, six. I think you're doing it right. Yep, that's it. We're doing it like reading a book. Like reading a book. Perfect, that's it. Corso's taking control of something very important. He's gonna build this wall. Who's got the best handwriting here? James is confident, I think. It's so funny, Allison. All right, you and Allison are doing a fucking battle. Right now. Give me the circle stickers. 9.5 and 9 dash with the dollar amount. I would like to see how both of you do it. Oh, James, you won. I can see it already. When you said it, I saw it in his eyes. Yeah, I did see a little confidence in his eyes too. Okay, you're gonna do the pricing of the characters. All of these Corso have to be a 10. Yeah, we have one. Yep, that's right. That's right, you guys are ready to go. My friend, Jason. Most inspirational. Thank you, man. Men on Instagram. Thank you, brother. Real pleasure, my friend. Take care of yourself. Rips. These are ready to get graded. Right, it's so powerful as a visual. But that's exactly what happens then. How is that? These guys. And what's in there? Series one as well. This is the ZAC, this is garbage too. Yep, let's get it out. These were the original drawings. Then we had to convert them into something I could do cartoons and toys with. Only way these were available was when you got the NFT. There was no other way. These wizard packs were selling for 20 bucks, exclusive at the national. I'm gonna get you started. With a beast. What's that? Of course. But we gotta get Germany into V-Friends cards. This is for you. You're welcome, my brother. See you, dude. How are you? This series one is done incredibly well and fucking series two because of the NFT market. We're starting to get our shit together. I think we should put the play mat against these right here and right here. What a price. This way they don't take up all the space. Like I think we should sell the play mats from here. And literally tape them here and have a price. Yep, all right. This is where my ghetto garage sale, yard sale, wine library fucking 1991. Get me some tape and a Sharpie and I'll fucking build you an empire, motherfucker. Yeah, dude, it's really happening. Like you're gonna look on eBay and be like what the fuck's going on? Yeah, I need this to Edison Sports. Can anybody execute it? So we didn't really get that many. We got like 50 boxes out of, there was only a thousand made. Really? They went into a thousand? There's only a thousand of them. You did not know that. And they've become a whole fucking thing. Okay. All right, let's go get organized on that. My man, I got you. It's for you. Have a good show. My man, I got you. What's up, brother? Yeah, this is where I like better. Thank you. Appreciate you guys. Yes, sir, thank you. This is for you, bro. Thank you. Got to figure out what's going on there. My guy. This is for you. Thank you. Enjoy it. That's for you, for you, bro. Have a great show. This show is so much bigger. What did I tell you? What is it? What's up, buddy? How are you? Nice to see you. Could not appreciate you more. Thank you, man. Man, the show is enormous. Hey, baby. We'll see you around. Hope you guys have the best show. We're set up over there in a big way. Come on. Of course. One each. Got you, bro. It's gonna get busy. One for you and one for you. Dragon's legit. That's a good cab. Cowboy's legit. Real fucking back. You can see them all on the wall. They're alphabetical. See what the prices are. Master back. Yes, I know who you are, brother. No, you don't. Yes, I do, brother. I've been in the trenches all the time. Yes, I have. Really? Yes, dude. I live in fucking content. Oh, wow. So, if that grades a 10, it's 180. 180 dollars. You're gonna bring them here. This is insane. Did you see this, Brandon? It's not that big. It's a lot of y'all. I love my v-friend NFTs, like Jolly Jackal and Gary Bean. I also like to compete and collect all my v-friends physically. This man knows you money. Oh, okay. I owe you this. Okay. I did what you said. I was the superintendent and I opened a shop two months ago. That's my first 10. I owe that to you. I'm proud of you, brother. I'm proud of you. I watched it all and I didn't. It took me two years, but I didn't. I'm proud of you, brother. Thank you. I'll cherish this. Yes, I remember. It's good to see you guys. This is for you. I hope you have a great show, okay? You're welcome. Ha ha ha. Hey, Miss, how are you? This guy actually, I played my first card. Yo, Rips, get that girl. I hope you have a great national. She makes me so happy. This is just amazing. Thank you, brother. Thank you. Great that. Great that. Team, let's use this as a moment to gather our thoughts. What do we feel? What do we need? What are we thinking? Where are we at? I don't know about that one. It's basic. Where is that feedback coming from? People, you just hear it? So we feel like pins all in here. I like it. Okay, pins, please. One for you. Thank you so much. Gotcha. Can you take advantage of that line right now and hook up people? Whoever you think is looking, like just, you know what to do. I got you. Here we go. Here we go. One, two, three. Brandon. Five, six, seven. Big trade. All his hits, including some serious ones, had exchanged for 20 minutes in New York. He crushed me on it, but we need more ammo for the kids. Watch this, Andy. Boom. Woo! It's a big set. This one is good. All right. That's a business owner. I love it. So this one from common to like flying on eBay. Nice. Think about what's happened to this card in the last 48 hours. This is a good card, brother. Would you do D3 for this? No. Oh no. I don't think so. They're too hard to get a great... I don't really care about the greats. We got it. We got it. Yeah, I would. This specific community has been incredibly supportive and consistent. And obviously I've been very behind the scenes working, working, working, working. It's coming together. It's really coming together. Oh. You could trade that for a Plinko board play over there, brother. Good. All right. Yep. He's wearing a Bill's jersey. Make sure his Plinko board does not do well. Anyway. You know what the first one we created was? The first one you got. You know what's funny? I brought that up the other day. I actually filmed me creating the whole thing. I don't actually know. But we're gonna go back and look at it. I watched your garage videos. They started my card account. It's awesome, brother. It's a hair. There's only 55 wizard golds. And it's in here. I think it's in there. I love your garage too, brother. Thank you, brother. I love them. I'm about to go do one soon. Did you look these up on eBay yet? I haven't. Do it right now. Go there right now and put your friend Super Stickers completed. I got you. Wow. Wow. Wow. Smart place. Wow. These guys have no idea. First on my market, 90% off. First guys to take sticker sign. That's so sharp. Thank you for paying for my VIP ticket. You're the man. It's a big one, brother. I got the elf too, man. It's a lot of success, dude. I love what you're doing, man. Thank you, brother. We're gonna keep working. You accept me with your bud? Here you go, my friend. 60 over here. You're going cash or are you going card? I'll take it. I'll take it. Yeah. Can you pull that just now? Check this up on eBay right now. Right now. Before I sign it, you need to pull it up on completed. And I get some more of the advice. Of course. First of all, make sure you make your money in a proper way. How you make your money is more important than how much money you make. That's the first fucking point. Second, try to make money on things you like. Because when you like it, you'll work hard enough to make it happen. Gotcha. Look at this kid. Look at this fucking kid. Get over here. Brandon, look at this dude. Why didn't you roll up like this, dude? He friends Carl and Patrick. Who's taking a photo? Who's taking a photo? I can do it. Yeah, all right. That's great. No, no, no. Who's camera? Last summer, I was going on my first national. I'm like, Gary Vee's going to be there. I want to give him something. And I made you this. And then on the way to the show, you're like, so long, I'm headed to Germany. Will you sign my new tattoo? Woo! Wait, where's the camera? Pretty epic, brother. Pretty fucking epic. I asked you why'd you laugh at your family's business. And then you told me something. And I did it. I started my own company in May. And I've done more insane than I ever did in life. I remember that day in Macy's very well, brother. Think about how you feel now versus two years ago. Now think what's going to be hit in two years. In two years, right? It's going to burn. And eventually, you're going to burst. I remember very vividly. I'm proud of you. I've had a better experience. I saw you in line. And I saw your face. I'm like, I think this fucking guy jumped. I'm so happy. We also like you to sign this back. You pulled it? Yes, sir. Did they say? No, I haven't sold them yet. Oh, oh. I got it. Don't worry. Yo! Very cool. Wow. Any advice? Park-casting? Shopping pieces of it. Yeah. To put out on social where you'll get awareness. Right. Yes. And reaching out to bigger guests that you think you can get and hoping one says yes. Be fine to take an off an hour or what. We're really happy with the way it's going. Very nice. Step by step. Thank you. Bro, here. What are you doing here? Where are we right now? I really want to create this world. Intellectual property. I did it through an NFT launch, but I also do trading cards along the way. Series one and series two. Compete and Collect, which is the predominant execution we're doing here, is a trading card game. We launched our game format. We have a big tournament this weekend. So collectible cards. It's an intellectual property. Think of it as Pokemon meets Sesame Street. What's your line? Happy. First Dustin. I drew all these. I drew every one of these. And then when we knew that we were going to make animated films and cartoons and take it to the next level, I converted them from this to that. That's so cool. Very cool. Yep. Thanks again. Have a great show. I know who you are, brother. It's a pleasure, legend. A pleasure, man. Pleasure, really. One of the 10 best hockey players of all time. Smart. You won. Thank you. Stay well. Have a great show. Let's fucking go. I'm going to do a few bucks for all that. I need you in the fucking B-Prems game. Do you know how many people lack common sense? Oh my God. Like, so I fuck with common sense cow. Do shit you love. That will always work out. Tons of shit I do doesn't work. But as long as I'm not dead, it gives me a chance to do something else. And I just want to keep doing stuff I want. And some people like me like to do a lot of things. You might want to just do one thing. It's all good, but just like it. Because you're going to fucking die and then what? Thank you so much. Of course. I'm going to go to the Wizzards. Oh, bubble gum. Bubble gum. Bubble gum. Fucking grown men getting excited about bubble gum. Team, we're going to have to wrap it up because they're going to kick us out and we got to lock up and I want to figure out our strategy. So let's be nice. What do you need for that? Gary B. Epic. Gary B. Epic? If I get it tomorrow, whatever. No, no, we're going to get it right. Rips. Who's got the key? Gary B. Epic? Whoa. Yeah, it's gone. I'm a little bit upset about that. I told you. Yeah, I know, but I'm still sad. There's only 25 of them. I just want to say thank you. My team has been raving. The work speaks for itself. Let's wrap it up. Let's wrap it up, team. All right. Day one in the books. We are building this intellectual property. Rome is not built in a day. It's something you hear a lot. At this point in my career and some of you might be feeling this pressure because I've had a lot of successes, people expect every new thing for me to happen immediately, but that's not how it works. It takes time, but it's very clear to me what we're building here. And more importantly, seeing the smiles on kids' faces, I think we'll look back at these early days of building this. And I'm enjoying it. I'm really enjoying it. I'm working hard. So big day, and it's just Wednesday. Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday still left.
