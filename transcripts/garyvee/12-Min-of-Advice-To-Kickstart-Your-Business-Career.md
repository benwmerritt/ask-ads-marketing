Too many people get into a place where they think it's all delegation. They always lose. And then too many people don't delegate shit. And they always lose. To me, it's the game of picking the thing that you have the biggest impact on the thing you're trying to do. If you can really get into a place where that thing also is the thing you love the most and what you do, then it's fucking. Attention is the number one asset. How do you feel? Great. Yeah. I feel healthy, I feel motivated. I'm like really busy. So I'm trying to figure out like, I used to travel a lot more, which gave me natural mini breaks. You know, like the 15 minutes before you get on the plane. Now what's weird is like during COVID, it also ended earlier. I was done at seven or eight. Now I'm booked every minute in my office. I'm like stuck, like just in it. So I'm trying to figure out how to like flex out of that a little bit, but other than that, it's all good. What's the ETA? Seven o'clock. Respect. How about you? I'm good, man. Just trying to keep building my name, building my brand, keep working with Yachty alongside him. My main focus right now is like just directing a lot. Like, you know, I've done a lot of work like Dustin, right? Dustin, you said? Yeah, I've done a lot of work like, you know, a lot of work like that for Yachty, documenting his life and stuff. And you know, just obviously music videos on the go. But like this year, I really want to focus on, you know, being a director, really, really like home down on the pre-production side of things and create, you know, just bigger executions. Yeah, yeah, yeah, make sense. Unchartered territories. Good for you. Yeah, so that's really what I've been working on. We were talking today, I love Gary's thoughts, just in terms of like scaling. Obviously, we talked about your socials. Yeah. How do you stay close to the actual work? You want to do the edits always, but also be able to stay on and do bigger things and whatnot. Yeah, bless you. That's the biggest thing right now. You know, I've been doing a lot of this by myself. Of course. You know, obviously, like for specific projects, I'm able to outsource and get a like small crew or whatever. But I've, in the end of the day, like I don't have a solid team supporting me around me. So I think that's also like a main goal for me this year, to like just expand, like to keep expanding. Make it something bigger than what it is. But like that's, it's the whole delegation thing that I'm trying to like learn because there's things that I can't just delegate, which I try, like I try delegating editing, but editing is like, that's my... It's the same way I think about it. Like, I don't delegate the selling. Yeah. You know, like there's things, no matter who you are. You're gonna be the president of the United States. Like, there's going to be shit that you do. And you need to focus on that being the thing you love the most and the thing that makes the biggest impact. Because then that's sustainable. And then after that, you just got to surround yourself with real people. Yeah, yeah. That's the game. Yeah. Too many people get into a place where they think it's all delegation. They always lose. And then too many people don't delegate shit and they always lose. Yeah. To me, it's the game of picking the thing that you have the biggest impact on the thing you're trying to do. If you can really get into a place where that thing also is the thing you love the most and what you do, then it's fucking... That's who I think makes it. Yeah. And then it's all about building family around the 10... At verse one, then 10, then 100 people that are the most impactful of scaling it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because like... Yeah, I mean like the editing and the directing and the... Like those are the things that... Like after I film a video, I go home. I need to stay up all night. I get it. You know what I mean? Like I can't... Well, I don't delegate the copy that I put on every social media post. I believe that the second that somebody else wrote it, it's over. It's not me. Yeah, yeah, just something about it. So... Of course, I'm not editing the video. Like I know I just spit some fire and I hope Dustin cuts it proper. But when I post it, I'm gonna write the copy to fill out the blank. The copy in a social media post is imperative. Because sometimes the video or the picture doesn't fill out all the fucking sense. Like it's like if you want to fill this little bucket and you throw in a bunch of rocks, it looks full but it's not. You need sand to fill out the little edges to get it full. That's what the copy is alongside the video that you put out on social media. Hmm, yeah. That's another thing. Oh my gosh, I hear you. Yeah, and I mean we ended up like, I mean we talked a lot the past four hours but like one of the things that I definitely feel like I can delegate is like my use of social media. You know, like I don't use it the way, I mean I don't use it. I know the way that you would, like you want me, you know, like the things that you say. Yeah, I'm not. You've done it that shit. Yeah, no, I don't. And I need to. And I need to be more sure on my face, I need to talk more. I mean these are like new territories for me, you know. It makes sense. Which I'm still learning and stuff. But I definitely need somebody in my team to be able to. To be the engine, to be your trainer. Yes, to, I mean even to push that, like be able to edit that little content piece of whether it's me like reviewing a video. Yeah, the BTS is real. The BTS. All that. So I mean that's what I'm trying to figure out this year. The BTS is now the FTS, like the BTS is the front of the screen. Like the behind the scenes is what people want. Hmm, yeah I see that a lot. 100%. And I don't know, I'm very, I mean it's hard. I'm like, I'm very introverted too. So I'm like very behind, you know, I'm behind the camera. So now that I'm getting all these like people wanting to see me and hear me and ask me to go on like these like panels and stuff like that, I'm like definitely jumping into uncomfortable territory. Good for you, it's good to stretch. Yes, yes. And by the way, you may decide it's not for you. Yeah, yeah. Like there is no you have to. Yeah. There's plenty of people that win without having social media. Yeah. There's plenty of people that win by doing X1. There's a million ways to cut it, but you should never say no until you taste it. Yeah, yeah. You know, I always think about this shit like oysters. I call it the oyster rule. Hmm. Do you fuck with oysters? I don't. Have you ever had one? Never. Oyster rule. There it is. Andy saw how he walked right into that shit. That's crazy. You see what happened? It's the fucking oyster rule. People are like, yo, I don't fuck with oysters. I'm like, have you had one? Bro, on some real shit? Yeah. Three out of four people that I've done that with in the last 30 years that try an oyster because I usually do it at dinner. Yeah. Love it. I'll try oyster. Seven of them are like, fuck this shit. Fuck that shit. I hate you, Gary. Okay. Just like you trying an oyster is like, you got to go try and do a panel. You got to do a keynote. Yeah. You got to try to do four podcasts. You can do it for a year and you'll be like, you know what? I'm good. I'm behind the camera. And then you're whole. Then you're never wondering what it fucks with people. Yeah, I don't like that. I don't like that. Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out my voice. Good news. Listen to me on this one too. Now we're really cooking. You found your voice. Don't let people confuse you with some intellectual philosophy fucking marketing shit. You know what your voice is? The way you do it and everything. I never for one second said, let me find my voice. What I said was, I'm going to be me. The second people are like, I don't know how you're thinking about this. Not everyone gets it wrong, but so many people are like, I got to find my voice. They start becoming something they're not fully. The more you're a hundred you, it's over. Look, I can go and chop in studio with the coolest kids, but I'm also willing to put out shit that I know everyone thinks is corny. I don't give a fuck. That is my voice. Like I get it that I can chop with the coolest kids. And I got flavor in that and there's certain parts of me that can fuck with that. But I'm very aware that there's certain shit that I do that is corny to people. I don't give a fuck. And I got a voice. I got to get more comfortable. A hundred percent. Yeah, because you're young and you've been around cool people. And like, of course you're a human being. We all do. Yeah. But bro, that's your voice. Everyone's voice is how would you live if nobody was watching? Yeah, it's real. I really believe it's the thing that makes me most happy and honestly is the foundation of my success. I'm not worried about people thinking I'm corny. Like I'll post something with, you know, the coolest emerging rapper in my fucking Instagram and the next post will be some like, nice guys are the best. I don't give a fuck. I know that for some people like, yo, wait, that was cool. No, that's not cool. Like I get it. Red, blue, cool, corny. I don't give a fuck. The voice is you. You're the voice. You don't have to find or develop your voice. You are your voice. But people try to like think they need to tweak it a little to pop off. The best way to pop off is to be fully you because that makes you the most unique. I think I struggle with maybe not it's more like public speaking and that's just hard. You know, like, like you're very, very good at it. And but I want to work on it and I want to get better at it. And panels is a great way to do it. Yeah, I just did one. And panels are like training wheels. Yeah, I just did one recently like last week or last week. It's good, right? There's other two three people there. You know, a little train. That's perfect. That's a great way to start public speaking. Yeah, it was really great. I'm always nervous. I'm always fire side. Good to fire side chat is another training wheels. Have somebody interview you. So if someone's like, yo, we want you, like, yo, get somebody to interview me. I'll do a fire side chat another way. You know, just getting pushed out there is like the hardest. Like here's the like go. Yeah, it's very, very intimidating. You have to either be one of two extremes really prepped out and know your slides and you got it down where you have to be like me, like blackout improv. Like period. Like if I was a rapper, I would never write. Yeah, I'm a free stylist. Yeah, 100. Yeah, yeah. That's how I keynote. Like I got, I know what I'm thinking about, but like, I really like this room. Yeah, I mean, which makes you talk about similar shit at times because it's just what's on your mind. But like, it's some, it's what I'm doing. What I'm doing with you right now, just chopping is how I give keynotes. I'm just chopping with them. Yeah. That's why you got the reason I can do that is I've seen a lot of people try to get into public speaking, talking about shit they don't know. The reason I do well is because I don't, I just talk about the shit I know. I'm not talking about anything other than the shit I live. Yeah. That's why people's first albums are so good. They talk about their life. They talk about their own life. They talk about their life. They know their perspectives, their feelings, they have their whole life to put that shit out. Then when it hits, they gotta come back and like, fuck, that's hard. Yeah, like when I got to, when I, when if, you know, you get on stage, you nervous a bit, but like once they start asking me about like my, what I do, like, oh, shit, this is what I do. Yeah, yeah. And it starts becoming very, very easy to speak about. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a, yeah, it's just new things, you know, new things that I'm proud of.
