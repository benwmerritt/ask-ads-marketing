If you want to gain audience and awareness, the number one place you should be doing live is TikTok. What's different about TikTok? When you go on whatnot, you have three people watching you. But when you go on TikTok, you start to get people to see you in their For You page that have no idea who you are. TikTok's giving me audience. Everybody else is showing it to the audience I've already amassed. That's a level of discovery that is profound. Here we go. I have on my domain account a lot of followers, over 100, 800K. And after that, I did the international account, a dancing account. And now this account is growing very well. The reach, of course, is not that high. Correct. The question is, I should make another account just for a more salesly testimonial sphinx or put it all on my big, on the big account. Both can work. Now, your big account is gonna have more awareness at first. What you're doing right now hurts a lot of people to try to build a business. You're overvaluing the amount of reach on your right hook. You know, in my old book, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. Give content, give content, give content, and then ask for business. Right. When you ask for business, it never gets the reach. For sure. Because you're not giving, you're asking. But that's okay, because you're running a business. Okay. You understand? And I think you're making a mistake that a lot of people make. You may believe, because people believe this, that that post, not getting a lot of reach, is hurting your reach on the next post. It can be. Because you are in your mind. If you do, I don't know, a 10 million views clip and after that, you are going 100K, you are, oh my God, I don't want this to happen again. Correct. It won't happen again. If you go 10 million and then you do 100,000, and the next one does 3 million, it didn't do 3 million because you're 100,000, it did 3 million because of the quality of that. Yes. Once you understand that, Andrew, you will not be scared to post sales in your big account. Because if the sales clip is good, it will perform. If not, it doesn't matter. That's right, but it will never perform like a giving clip, right? Right. It will never. I will not sell, watch, I'm doing all this content for free right now, a thing that many people sell, and yet I will not sell very many $18 mugs right now. Even though I'm providing a lot of value, people will not click down there, and that's okay. Because maybe they don't need a mug. Anyway, selling will never do as well as branding and providing value, and that's okay, but you're also allowed to ask for the sale. Hey, so I'm a realtor. We are in that mid-market, smaller market, but at the same time, we're utilizing everything that you do to help grow our business. We realize we're a media company. Yes, sir. Promoting ourselves. Yes, sir. We're on what not, and I've held two live shows, just testing it out, kind of tasting it right. As a real estate agent, what not is much more a nice to have than a requirement. Unless you're selling a hat or a t-shirt, because you're trying to really brand it. What not is much more for somebody who sells something physical than it is for someone who is, let's say, a B2B SaaS salesperson, or a real estate agent, or a financial advisor. Again, if you're a very creative financial advisor, real estate agent, you may wanna sell some hats, some mugs, some t-shirts, and you might just be entrepreneurial and you wanna learn other things, or it could turn into a side hustle. But for you, LinkedIn, LinkedIn, LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, YouTube Shorts, YouTube Shorts, and number one, by far, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook. If you wanna gain audience and awareness, the number one place you should be doing live is TikTok. What's different about TikTok? When you go on what not, you have three people watching you. But when you go on TikTok, you start to get people to see you in their For You page that have no idea who you are. TikTok gives you audience, most other platforms don't, including the ones I'm on right now. TikTok's giving me audience. Everybody else is showing it to the audience I've already amassed. That's a level of discovery that is profound. So anyway, that's the game. I don't think you need to be on what not, but I don't mind you playing with it because it might lead to another entrepreneurial venture. Great, thanks man. As a startup, I recently started in almost a year, like February 2020, last year when I launched, and so I've been building it out, only last, let's say December, when I started getting really serious with content of social media from your book. When you really don't know who your audience is and creating your cohorts, how would you go about that as like a startup? Common sense. Common sense, common sense. You know who goes to the gym? Yeah. You're gonna need guys and girls, then you're gonna need Caucasians, African Americans, Latinos, and then you're gonna go into, people that care about sports or food or music. Like you get to pick, then you play for a little bit because now you're thinking about them when you make the content. When I make a piece of content, sometimes I'm thinking about that 17 year old dude that's a fucking D student like I was and I'm making that content. Other times I'm like, I'm gonna make this for the moms who are 42 who think their life is over and those girls haven't even fucking started. Another time I'm gonna make it for somebody who's 61 who's literally sitting in their house fucking depressed, watching bullshit television, thinking their life's over and they're gonna live for 30. Then I'm thinking about first generation, you know, Mexican immigrant living in San Antonio, whose parents don't speak English, who's 14, getting straight A's and working at fucking Walmart and fucking, right? Like when I make content, I think about who the fuck am I making this for? Do that. You don't know who your cohorts are. Make, make, make, make, make and then they will come to you. Gotcha. And the key like you said is always as much as you can. It's not like, I know something, oh just one, it didn't do well and then you're like, let me do something else. It's like produce a bunch of variety and stuff. How old are you? 26. Perfect. So you're not, high school was not that long ago. You'll remember. The reason most people don't post enough is they still think life is high school and they're insecure and they're worried someone's gonna make fun of them or it's not gonna do good. It's not gonna do good. Who gives a fuck? Yeah. And that's taking something I've taken to heart that now I'm just posting. Like, you know what? I don't even care what people say. It's like, the ones who's gonna hate, they're always gonna hate screw them. I'm just gonna focus on just creating value. Bro, the ones that hate, you should not feel bad for yourself. You should feel bad for them. Could you imagine being a human being that goes around the internet and leaves comments of hate? That is the most depressing fucking life on earth. I'm not mad at those fuckers. I feel sad for those fuckers. So I'm in the firearms and securities industry. I just opened a security agency within the last couple of months. Just agency just approved me last week or so. How do I tailor content on LinkedIn to kind of reach some of the B2B on the firearms training side? I know how to get the consumers all day long. Been doing that for years. Took your advice on TikTok, killed it. But going to B2B, little more on something. No, it's really good, bro. LinkedIn is TikTok. LinkedIn is the B2B TikTok. That's what I think you're kind of like. My guy, easy. Tell the truth, be like, hey, this is me. This is who I am. This is what I do. A lot more of you need security. You know, the world is much more open. The data, I think I provide a great service. I'm that guy. Hit me up. That's a right hook. As we just said in the last thing, that won't convert as well. Gotcha. Go down the nitty-nitty on it. Absolutely. 100%. And over and over. Bro, I say the same 1740 things over and over in different ways. Yep. I'm not making up new ideas. I don't have that many ideas. I just have that many ways I'm going to say it. In picture form, in cartoon form, in fucking audio form, in written form, in me and video clip form, in me and podcast. They're like, you know, different adjectives, but got it? Yep. I have started kind of a community project that started as a personal project. It gained a lot of traction through the digital art space. And now I've been running it for the past six years and what has started as a personal project has now turned into a business. And I've done it with friends. And for this thing to become financially sustainable, we really need to peel back the layers of that quote unquote personal project and look at the hardcore numbers, right? Of how this business can stay sustainable. That's right. When you go from a project to a business, you need the cash flow and the P&L to be good enough to sustain the business. And that's exactly it. And we found some great success, but a lot of it is our founder love in our personal project and us giving our time and effort to make it happen. But for us to continue this, we have to rejig some numbers and all that. And where I'm starting to run into some issues with partners is that we have different alignments of should things be run as a business or should it stay as a personal project? I love this thing so much that I want it to be sustainable. Who's in control? Like who's the primary partner or are you all equal? We're all equal. That's the biggest mess up in my head. Have you ever... 50 split. Yeah. Oh, so it's only two people? It's two entities. It's myself and then another entity that is consistent of two people. Are both of them wanting to keep it nonprofit or one of the three, one of the two? One. Can you push them out? That is currently what we're trying to do, but I'm being very, very conscious because these are friends of mine. I love that. Don't want to ruin friendship. That's right. And that's beautiful and I like you. Let's keep talking. Of the three people who is driving the impact on this nonprofit slash potential business, what is the breakdown on actual impact on it being alive? Like if one of you disappeared, like what's the breakdown of percentage? How much do you contribute? Do you think? So that's where I feel we are very unequal. I feel like I am in the driver's seat. Yeah. You know, a lot of myself. If God came down and said, here's the impact percentages of the three people. Obviously you're grading your own homework, but like to the best of your ability with as humble as you can be, what is the percentage breakdown? What percentage of impact are you? 75. Okay. What is the person that is on board with you to turn it into a business? What is his or her percentage on the impact? It's percent. I would say that would be about 15. Okay. So now you guys are up to 90 and the naysayer is at 10%. Yeah. I think there is a nice way that will keep a friendship where you're vulnerable and humble and sweet and compassionate and sympathetic at a coffee shop in Vermont, which is perfect setting, can say to this person, look, whether I'm right and that means who's the person that's at 15%? What's her name? Dave. Great. Me and Dave, from my point of view, third person are basically 90% of this to begin with. We both want to do this. Yes. We love you third person. Mm-hmm. But if you, I don't want to lose you as a friend, but I, and I, and you could even go to the extreme and say, to be honest, your friendship matters more to me than this nonprofit slash potential business. I am willing to quit this because this won't be sustainable anyway as a nonprofit and go start something else. Mm-hmm. That's it. It's kind of where I'm at with it too of like, but you've got to be full. Here's a couple options. But you've got to be really candorous. Yeah. And when you're talking to a friend, most people aren't fully candorous. They fucking sugarcoat it. Yeah. Yes. And there's something I learned from you too. By the way, it was a fine candy, right? It was a flaw of mine. I'm coming from a place of experience. Yeah. Wheelie, you're up from New Zealand. What's good? How does someone love myself, market myself to, you know, be on a world scale? Well, you're on a world scale right now. Social media has created the world scale. You're on the world scale. Somebody from a small town or a country from the other side of the world of America, there is unlimited opportunity for people in New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii, and Japan, and everywhere else to reach the global audience with whatever message. So I think the way you reach the global audience is by first understanding that you can reach the global audience. If that's your question, you've already limited yourself by believing, oh, I'm on a small little island. I can't get to everybody. And there was some truth to that in 1974. There's zero truth to that in 2025. My post that I just posted on Instagram talks about everybody, how they use social media. And in there, I wrote just now on the way into the office, how you see the world is how it is. If you decide that you could be the most known person on earth from New Zealand with the tools that we have that we're using right now. Brother, I am in New York City. You were in New Zealand at three in the morning. We are talking to each other live for free on a social shopping app called what not. The world is insanely filled with opportunities. You can reach the audience. Now the question becomes, are you just making that excuse because you're not bringing enough value to your audience to become well known? And so what you need to focus on is providing value. I started my podcast like a couple of years back where I interviewed actors from video games and it's been going well. I got made to partnership from that and it's reached 4.5 million views now. So it's doing very good. However, one of the things that I always worry about is how to get up there and not lose confidence when I'm trying to go there. I know I should not be looking for the end goal but at times where I feel like, can I get there? Because I'm obviously grinding and putting on content. But what's get there? Turn this into a, I don't know, a show that is hosted on Amazon Prime. Got it. So you want your video podcast show to be on Amazon Prime. That's going to come down to how talented you are and how consistent you are, right? That's how that would play out. How consistent are you? How often do you do it? How long have you been doing it? It's been two years and I post every episode, every podcast episode every week because that's how many guests I get, depending upon that. I think two years every week, you've now given enough effort and consistency which I appreciate to give you a read, right? What you want to figure out is, if it's not popping off the way you want, you've got to change it up a little bit. Maybe do a different format, start a different way, rename it, be more patient till you get bigger. Guests by DMing more people. This is about your execution and your talents. And you being not delusional and self-aware. Maybe you're not destined to be that famous or that aware and that is okay. You need to fall in love with doing it. For example, I could speak for myself. When I started Wine Library TV, when I was 31 years old and finally came out to the world because I was working on, you know, so in my dad's liquor store, I didn't do it because I thought I was going to become famous or known. I did it because I wanted to do it. I wanted to educate the world about wine and I wanted it to bring awareness to my dad's store. I think too many people now are trying to do things for the fame. And if they do it for the purpose of why they're doing the show, they have a bigger chance of actually getting the fame. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. I think at the end of the day, it's all about worrying about the fact because I want to turn this into a thing. I think that I can, business, I can, a job kind of thing, but I don't want to go somewhere else, I want to do this. I love that. So maybe you should learn about live social shopping. Maybe you should be doing what I'm doing because I've sold a bunch of mugs while I've been on here. And like maybe selling something, maybe you add a piece of retail to your content. Maybe that will help. Yeah, I'm a business owner and I have an industrial electrical supply. My question is, how will you go to try to sell these kind of very niche products to a broader audience? You can't because it's too niche, but what you can do is focus on your audience that would buy it and I would do that on LinkedIn. You should be a very strong content creator on LinkedIn. It will lead to a lot of business. Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now. I'm focusing on LinkedIn, like, how much? I'm doing like almost two daily. How long have you been doing it? Maybe three months now. And have you felt anything yet or is it too early? I'm starting to get some connections for potential clients. Most of the work I do is like I go into a factory and then I go out. I was thinking, I don't know what's your opinion on this, maybe to fill some of the things that I'm doing once I'm inside. 100%, very good. And I want you to also DM message people on LinkedIn that own factories and just saying, hey, around in 2025, when they click your face, they'll see your content and that will help reinforce the cold call. Okay, okay, that sounds great. So those two things, three months, listen to this, you've been doing only three months on LinkedIn and you're already feeling a little something. Now if you start messaging 10 cold emails a day to owners and managers of factories and saying, hi, just wishing you a happy 2025. I'm around if you ever need anything, very light cold call. But because you have content, they're gonna click your face and see your content. And then three, when you're starting to do jobs, fill them in there, it's gonna help you quite a bit.
