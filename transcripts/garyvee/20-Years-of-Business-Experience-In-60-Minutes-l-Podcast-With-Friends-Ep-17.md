A lot of people are like, Gary, I don't wanna have a personal brand. I'm like, and then you're gonna be 65, and you're gonna care about a non-profit, you're gonna care about a political issue, you're gonna care about curing a disease that God forbid your child got, you're gonna care about something as a human, and you're gonna wake up, and it'd be nice to have a million people be able to be aware of something you care about. Everyone thinks about it as a sellout or a try hard. This is super omni. Attention is the number one asset. Please say hello and you do for a living. Hello everyone, thank you for having me on, Gary. I'm Rob Gronkowski. I'm a former NFL player, played 11 seasons, nine seasons for the New England Patriots, two seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, won four Super Bowls during those 11 years of playing the NFL. Always beat the New York Jets as well. That was my favorite team to go first. I mean, I think I lost one time versus them actually, but it was a tough game when we lost versus them. It was 2011, my rookie year in the playoffs. That was their last time they were in the playoffs. That was the last game of my life, by the way. I went to Foxborough. I thought we were gonna get destroyed. We lost to them on Monday Night Football, five or six weeks earlier, 45 to three in a trouncing. And to say it was one of the greatest days of my life would be an understatement. I enjoyed that day so much, I could feel it in my stomach right now. It was the best. It was not that good of a day for me, but that 45 to three game earlier that season, that was a great game. I'm sure you liked that one. You guys also beat us. I remember Randy Moss was on the team as well. It was my rookie year and Randy Moss had that catch over throughout Revis to one hander, like a 60 yard bomb from Tom. And I was just sitting there like, wow, I'm playing with Randy Moss. Like look at that catch. That was amazing. Yeah, that was. And what are you up to now? And now I'm an analyst, an NFL analyst on Fox. You know, the pregame show with Michael Strahan, Jimmy Johnson, Terry Bradshaw, Kurt Menefee. So it's in Howie Long. It's just a great team overall. I'm just blessed to be in that position, to be with those guys. They've been on that show Howie Long and Terry Bradshaw started the show about 31 years ago. And it's been the number one pregame show on television for 31 years now straight. So it's just incredible and just an honor to be able to be on the booth with them. Thanks for being here. Got it. I'm Ron Shake, different kind of athlete, probably a corporate athlete. I opened restaurants. I probably opened 4,000 of them in my career. I started O'Bone Penn. I started Panera Bread. I'm the founder of Panera Bread. And grew that to 2,500 restaurants and sold it in the biggest US restaurant deal ever done at among the highest multiples. And then I started an investment firm with my own money, my partners. And we were the lead investors. They lead investor in Cava, where I'm the chairman, just went public, life alive, Tate, something called Level 99, bunch of different companies. So I play in a different game, but not all that dissimilar in what you gotta do. Yeah, I actually think you two represent my two biggest passions, right? True entrepreneurship and business and sports. And I do think business, what makes it so remarkable is it's the closest thing to professional sports. The reason I really have a lot of admiration for athletes is they do the only thing in society that has black and white merit that's non-debatable. Meaning, you know, we all, tonight, I will go to Madison Square Garden, I will watch Nixon Pacers play, and someone will win and lose. And so much of our world is not based on merit. The school system, the government system, like how you analyze how your parents did, like everything is subjective. Even business gets a little bit weird. I got really turned off four or five years ago when I saw a kid I knew well say in his Instagram bio, three time exiting founder. Claiming that that was good. Did he win? Did he do well? He lost. I knew him very well. One company sold for a dollar, one company he sold for everybody lost money. Like it raised at $80 million, it sold for $3 million, and the third one was an M&A deal on a nickel on the dollar. So he lost three times, but it looked good. Gronk has to sit here, and you know, obviously he's been unbelievably successful, but you know, you win and you lose, and we all know it, almost every other part of the world, but I do agree with you, at least business is close, it's 85%. You know, we were just talking as we walked in, Gronk and I, that the real key when you're performing in front of hundreds of thousands of people when your whole career is on the line, is how do you stay calm? Of course. How do you stay relaxed? How do you make it a sandlot game, even if you're playing in the Super Bowl? I think that's exactly right. And by the way, I literally, I'm making a poster right now from the front of the office, I don't need leaders when it's easy. I have a lot of people that are my direct reports, and it's all fun and games when it's cruising, but leadership is about when it's fucking hard. And I think that's a good segue, I know, because you've been a leader a long time in yourself. Speaking of tough, I know a Tapperberg, I'm the co-CEO of Tau Group. We have the largest group of nightlife venues in the country, probably in the world, brands like Marquis, Omnia, Tau, Hakusang. We've got... All the places you'd like to take your shirt off. All the places you still like to come to party when you won. I didn't want to interrupt you yet, but I was gonna say, I've been to every single spot of here. I sure has been off at every single spot as well, back in the day. I'm the Preveyor of Good Times here. I do a lot of traveling, run around the world. We have places all over Europe, Middle East, all fun, sexy, high-end places. It sounds like a tough job, huh? That professional athletes and personalities like Gary like to go, but it's a tough job. And I'm a different type of athlete. Yeah, actually, let's go there. We'll go backwards and we'll start with you, and we'll go in reverse, and you know this as well. Obviously, you're very much in the space. Things are changing in our society in a real way. Distribution is such an important part of life. Obviously, in Bronx world, the way sports are being consumed, streaming services, the bidding of the MBAs about to come up, we'll be watching on different channels. How do you consume those sports? But distribution of food and experience is changing. I think the reason, correct me if I'm wrong, no, I think the reason you're saying tough times is in a post-COVID world, the way people are treating nightlife, the way people are treating dining has changed substantially with Last Mile, with private clubs, with people hooking up on dating apps instead of having to go to a club. There's a lot of dynamics in the last decade that have changed in your business, yes? Yeah, I mean, people don't even have to go to the venues anymore to get the experience. They don't get the full experience, but just the fact that people can go online and see what everything looks like, see pictures of all the food, know who's there. It's changed the way people work. And it's a totally different environment now for businesses that are four-wall businesses like ours. I think everybody, after being told they can't go for a couple of months during the early pandemic days, decided I don't wanna have that anymore and figure out ways to at least get those experiences digitally and it's changed how everybody operates. You know, I kind of disagree. Go ahead. The restaurant industry food is the second oldest profession in the world. Well, I don't think, just if I may, I don't think we're arguing that it's trouble. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait, just hang on a minute. The second oldest profession, it's been about hospitality. Yep. It's been about service. People have been serving each other food for as long as we've been human beings. Yep. And the reality of the restaurant industry still comes down to that. Too often we run off on whatever is the flavor of the year during COVID it was delivery or online, they're just means to get to food. Correct. And that what ultimately people want is they want a great experience served by people that give a shit in environments that engage them. And that is really the core. It's been that way for a thousand years and my guess is it's still gonna be that way. And I bet Noah in your business, it's the same thing. The only thing I'll add. I think this we need to, let's double click on this. I agree with you in the macro principles, but let's talk about real life. And what I mean by that not is New York, let's use New York City. So we're just in the middle of it right now. In a world where everybody who surrounds this little island no longer comes to it on Friday because work from home is now a real reality. I'm gonna guess, Noah correct me if I'm wrong, that your Friday nights don't look the same that they did four years ago. Fridays are the one day that have completely changed, especially in cities like New York. Cause you don't have people coming into the office, which means you don't get the people going out to eat after work. You don't get people going happy hour when they're done. You just used to fill up at lunch and stay busy all through the day and to the night. And then people would come into town. Now you're quiet all day on Friday and you don't pick up till dinner time. And it's very strange, very different. Going from Fridays went from being the busiest day of the week overall to the second or third slowest day. But am I right in saying that volume has moved around during the week? That you got young people in the city. I got a son who lives here. Nope, no. Mondays are still slow. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, okay. Thursdays, it starts to get a little bit live. Fridays, it dies out again, which is the weirdest thing. Cause the momentum dies on Friday. So it used to be, you know, it builds up during the week and then Friday, Saturday was just great. Now it just dies Fridays, but it does come back on Saturday. Saturday nights, especially in the big cities, New York, Las Vegas, Chicago, LA, Miami, even Tampa, are like never. But the next weeks are down. Are you in the next weeks now? And in suburbial restaurants, to your point, people are gonna eat. We're in urban, we're in suburban, so it doesn't matter. And you're also in a high scale environment. There's obviously variables of the restaurant. QSR is gonna be different than a private club, than a local family restaurant versus cheese cake factories, a different model. There's a lot of variables, but for example, it's also margins. If you're in rural parts of the country, the fact that you're now giving a big to a door dash and an Uber eats that seven years ago was someone that was just coming for the capital expenditures you put into your building, starts to chip away at your margin. There's a lot of pressure on the new behaviors. Yeah, but it still comes down to having a superior experience. In the end, right, what drives the margin is actually your sales. Yeah, but I think you'll appreciate this. This goes back to the old retail versus Amazon experience. Yes, experience. The issue is as more people choose to deliver with these apps at home, the experience becomes commoditized because a human is delivering the food. Yes, which is why I think, Noah, I know in my business, we're still building a cafe. We're still building an environment to sit in. Because if all we're doing is providing a dark kitchen to support delivery, what value way do we bring? No, I don't think we're, to your point, I don't think we're in all or nothing. But for example, and you know this well because you said at the top of this game, people are rethinking the size of their footprints from every QSR to, right, like people are rethinking the way they're building out restaurants. Some of the people that I see a lot of success with right now they're taking bigger back kitchens to subsidize for delivery and smaller footprints. And Gary, that may be in Manhattan, but Manhattan isn't the country. And if we go beyond Manhattan. I'm not referring to Manhattan. Okay, I'm gonna tell you, we're building larger front ends, larger environments. I'm contrarian. When everybody's cutting down their kitchen and McDonald's is just a drive-throw and every one of these businesses are being overreactive as a contrarian. I wanna provide a space that you wanna sit in. Come to any of my places, because nobody else is providing it. And they're doing better than they've ever done. I love it, I love it. Well, speaking of that though, actually, I just co-founded the restaurant. And I just got into that. Yes, I am, I'm moving to that business. Yes, you guys are playing football. You guys can go run around and get hit and smacked around. I'm gonna join your guys aside. But I just co-founded a business and it's just a drive-throw business. Like you said, the way that things are going, the way that things are trending, and it's called Green Lane. And it's a drive-throw salad and wrap joint. Where is this? It's just started in Tampa. We just opened up our second store actually last week. I actually worked a drive-throw for three hours. And it was one of the coolest experiences ever. But just the way that it's all trending, people want their food fast. They want their food that's nutritious as well. But they're always on the go. I feel like the society now, everyone is just moving faster and faster and faster. No one's just sitting back and relaxing. Everyone's on the go, trying to get in one million things a day that they can do. So therefore we started this Green Lane. You can get nutritious food at an unbelievable price under $10, either a wrap or a salad bowl. And you just go through the drive-throw, you get it within five, six minutes, and then you're just off and on your way back to your job. So I'm getting into your guys' industry. So it's great to sit here with you two and just listen to you two, just chat and learn. Drive-throw salads, that's an interesting one. It's one of the only foods you can eat while you're driving. There's an opera called salad and go. Have you seen them? Of course, it's great. I know the C-C-M-O well. It's actually very similar. It's based off the salad and go. And we're gonna be operating in Tampa and moving along the East Coast. And yes, they're based out of Arizona, Texas, and Nevada. I'm gonna level this up for the audience. What I think the last seven to 12 minutes spoke about is something I think about all the time, which is the nuances matter, right? All four of us are yapping here. And the reality is that there's so many different variables to every single execution, even with the food business, the restaurant business is obnoxiously broad. You could talk about, again, like I mentioned, QSRs, an individual having one location and that's their family restaurant for the last 40 years. They're gonna be feeling different than salad. I said on the board of Bojangles, I also have a restaurant group that operates in New York. Like, I actually have a ton of clients from Aspire Brands and Rourke Capital. We have a ton in that world. Obviously, Noah, you've been at the forefront of premium nightlife and cuisine over the last 25 years. I think for everybody who's listening, one thing I think a lot about is being self-aware and understanding what you're in. Because I know so many entrepreneurs are sitting here. Whether it's landscaping, whether it's marketing, whether it's the restaurant business, whether it's collecting, whether it's being a barber, there's always 47 different variables that go into your version of it. And I think that is how I think about the last 10 minutes. Like, there's just so many ways to attack this. Because I agree with you. Like, I don't even think it's quiterion. I think that there's always multiple ways to play the same game. Right? And I think finding what works for you and to what I'm sure all of us are thinking about with our ventures as we got into this category, trying to understand how to be prepared for the next version of consumer realities. Whether it is, to I agree with you, like, I think there's so many different ways that I think people will be in establishments eating food for eternity. And Gary, if I could offer this up, it's about being the best at something. Correct. In all of our professions. Whatever that is. Whether it be football or entertainment or restaurants, you've got to stand for something. You've got to have authority. There's got to be a reason people walk past all your competitors and choose you. 100%. I think I'm a lot this a lot, brother, in the context of marketing. I think about this all the time here. Meeting after meeting. You know, Apple. Let's use Apple. I think Apple's terrible at marketing. Actually, subjective opinion, but I analyze a lot. But I also think their product is chosen a lot. Right? So, you know. And why? Because two reasons. One, badging. I think Apple wins on brand. I think Apple plays in fashion psychology more than people realize. People want to have it. It's like having a car or anything like that. And two, in the form of Apple, where Apple really separated itself was being the operating system of the app ecosystem. Having access to Uber or Instagram or all these things first was a huge factor. Where they were able to outflank Android back in the day was the apps were the same thing that Microsoft figured out about computers. The operating system was the moat, not necessarily the hardware. So, there's a lot that goes into it. Nonetheless, I want to switch it up. Noah, as an entrepreneur, as an operator, or as a human being, actually, let's switch this up. What do you, and this could go anywhere because I want to change the tone and tenor so it's fun about jamming with friends. What are you most excited about? Like, just in general. I mean, for me at the moment, it's just building what we're doing into new markets like Tampa, like Miami. I love taking what we do really well in one place and scaling it. I like to be the Disney of premium hospitality and doing what we're doing on scale in new cities that are just kind of up and coming is what is super exciting for me. If I hear that right, to break it down for the audience a little bit, obviously cities are changing. A lot is, you know, it will be so fun to watch documentaries and read the books that are written in 50 years when we really calibrate. That eats. Some of us aren't gonna write books on our business. You know, but I do think it's pretty interesting. Like, COVID reset so many things, changed so many things. If I heard you write, because you used Tampa, I don't know if it's because Gromks here, which would make sense. Or, because I know what's going on in Tampa. Actually, one of my favorite restaurants of all time is in Tampa called Burns Steakhouse. I knew you were gonna say Burns. Yeah, I grew up in the wine business. When I was a kid, kid, 21, 22, 23, I heard from people like, one day you have to go to Tampa. There's this restaurant that still has a bunch of old wine that's inexpensive. It was like a place I couldn't wait to get to. But, is one of the things that's most exciting as a guy who played in the New York, Vegas, LA, London thing. As we're seeing people move, different things going on. Do your entrepreneurial juices get going of like, oh, we're gonna be able to see some real arbitrage in some of these places. Yeah, we love cracking the code of a new city. Being the first to bring something special there. Going into a market that's emerging and defining a new neighborhood. I was just in Tampa for the first time in 25 years and was in the area, right? Or your friend, the guy who owns the Lightning, developed a whole new area. Jeff Finick. Jeff Finick, a whole new area. I was shocked. You know, great restaurant. Something I never would have thought existed in city like Tampa 10, 15 years ago. So, going into new places, finding those great locations and figuring out how to take what we do in places like New York and scale it out to other markets is what keeps me going right now. I love it. Do you have any spots in Tampa currently? Or you're looking to do something? We're looking in Tampa, we're looking in Orlando. We're looking to build a hub in Florida, center it in Miami and then out to the other cities. And beautiful. Ron, as an author, as a... Well, let me know, I live in Tampa, baby. I'm right there. I love Tampa. Ron, what are you most excited about right now as a hobbyist, as an entrepreneur, as a professional, as a human? Like what are some of the things top of mind that got you optimistic and excited? Right, well professionally? Please. I'm like, no, I just love when I figure it out. Yeah. And I feel like we've got, you know, through this act three investment club, we've got figured out the most powerful niches of the future. We're invested in Mediterranean. Mediterranean is powerful. It's the number one diet in the country. We got the dominant brand in that. Something called Kava. It's rocking and when public last summer, you know, it's tripled in price. I've got something in upscale bakery cafe called Tate. It's Middle Eastern infused. It's from the Levant, Turkey, Israel, the North Africa. It's got a Thardian coffee. It's got a Thardian baked goods. It's got real chefs. It's powerful. How many units does that have? 45, DC and Boston, but doing huge volumes. We've got another business that is interesting called Life Alive. It's plant forward. It's positive eating. Again, somebody is gonna own plant forward when 3% of America is eating vegetarian, but 40% wanna eat more plant forward. Yeah. Somebody's gonna own that. How do you define plant forward for the ones that don't know? For us, it's all vegetables. It's vegetables that are sourced in different ways. Got it. And so if you wanna eat some more of that, we all do in our nutritional wallet, this is a place to go. And I've got a fourth business. It's a little bit more like Noah's. We were talking about it outside. It's called Level 99. It's 40,000 square feet of challenges. 45 of them, one to three minute challenges, some physical, some mental, with a farm to table restaurant. Oh, interesting. And a brew hall in the middle of it. You know what's funny? You know, we see a lot of these kind of things in London and UK. Yes, I was just over there looking at them. Makes sense. I think you're right on it. You look at Topgolf. You look at all this. Like it feels experiential dining. I think these models are gonna work. Well, I think they, Adult Chuck E. Cheese. I think Noah taught us this. I mean, the bifurcation between dining and entertainment is closing. Yeah. And we increasingly want both. And well, we're doing it. And oh, by the way, it's an OG thing. The Coca-cabana, like, you know, entertainment and dining back to history repeating itself. Like, some of the biggest establishments of the last, you know, era or the last two eras back were fully, fully, fully entertainment and dining. The convergence of the two, I think is also fueled by young people's desire to share everything that they're doing. Of course. When you go to a restaurant, you go to an entertainment venue and it's built in a way that people can, you know, take photos and put it on their Instagram or their TikTok, say, hey, look what I'm doing. Look where I am tonight. That's what's driving a lot of the younger generations desire to go out and spend money. So when you put the two together and you do it well, I think, you know, you're onto something. Ron, can I borrow you for you, brother? Did, you know, obviously you're off of a very fresh moment of a lot of cultural relevance. You know, it feels like you're having like a really great moment. Like, you know, I'm pumped for you. Like, you know, I think, you know, listen, I've hated you most of my life. But that's in the context of like, that's my real passion. I want you to hate me. I want you to hate me. That means I was doing something right. That's exactly right. Yes. You know, I tell Will that hate helped him. Yes, exactly. But like, but like, but I've always enjoyed where like, you always get a sense of like, if you're really passionate about sports and you hate a guy, you know, especially the way I live my life, I've been fortunate enough to get a sense of like, is that a good guy or is that a bad guy? Like, it's really fun for me when I find out an opponent that I dislike is also not the greatest dude. It's like, it makes it so easy. But when you find out like, they're a lovable good human, you're like kind of just waiting for them to retire. So like, that's kind of like, my journey with you and I kind of, it feels very obvious to me what's happening with you. Because I think you have a likability, I'm sure this is why Fox was interested in you of all the choices they could have. I think likability is an incredible God given gift. You got double lucky with the physical attributes. But, you know, I think a lot of people fell in love with you even more this last week. Like, with your entrepreneurial hat on, and I'm sure you must have talked to your inner circle this week, feels like inevitably there's more opportunities than ever for you to do different things. Is that something you're thinking about? Or are the things you're actively doing, like this restaurant and obviously from fall to winter, you're busy, are you busy or are you kind of on the attack for more stuff? I'm not really on the attack for more stuff. I'm actually very excited to see everything that I'm involved with grow now. Okay. Like I said, I'm involved. You got enough stuff. Yeah, so I got enough stuff now. I got plenty of stuff on the table. And when things come to me now, it's kind of like, it has to be like really, really good. I have to be wanting to be involved in it. I wanna be able to love it as well in order to get involved in it. And that's why I started these restaurants as well in Tampa, the drive-thru wraps and salads, because I live a physical lifestyle still. I live an active lifestyle. And I love to live a healthy lifestyle as well. And that just goes along with it. You know, I'm always working out still. I'm going to the beach to go play volleyball, doing whatever and just grabbing a salad or a wrap to go. That fits me perfectly. Are you good at volleyball? No, I'm all right, but I just love to do it. I love to stay active. And then on top of it, I'm invested. I'm invested. I got a dominant yet. How tall are you? 6'6". 6'6". 6'7". He's not good at volleyball. I mean, I'm good at spiking the ball over to net, but setting the ball, like, I mean, it's kind of sloppy. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. Grunt versus Noah and Ron, or Noah and Ron versus Grunt. Well, I don't know if you know this. Noah's one of the great volleyball players in New York. So I would actually go to... We're not like some time-all pro. Really? We're going to play. So I would go with Noah and Ron. We'd be a good combo. I don't know. We may go Noah versus Ron. You can play back. We have a good head. You can spot that also. So you're kind of trying to double down on the stuff you got. Yes. And then also, my dad, he's been in the fitness industry, selling fitness equipment commercially in retail for 33 years now. And when I won the Super Bowl versus Seattle, we actually started a little branch off of that called Grunt Fitness. I remember. And it was all the accessories that we were selling. It was just a branch off of my dad's. And now we're really, really got momentum going and we're going to continuously grow it. And we're having a big launch coming up this September where we have a whole new product line of Grunt Fitness dropping. And I'm super excited about that. And that just fits along with everything that I'm doing. I love this day active. Like I said, love the workout still. My family, they all run the Grunt Fitness business as well. And just Genji Fitness is my dad's. Yeah, you have like 795 brothers, right? Yes. I got four brothers. My brother Dan lives in Buffalo. Runs the whole Grunt Fitness department. Then my other brother. Is he a Bill's fan? Yeah, he's a Bill's fan. I mean, we all were growing up. We all were growing up. Wait, Grunk, I didn't know that. You're a Bill's fan? I grew up in Buffalo. Makes sense. So I was a Bill's fan. But right when I got drafted to the New England Patriots, like I was not a Bill's fan anymore. No shit. Like, of course. Like it just got zapped right there on the spot. My family too. Did they go with you? Or stay with Bob? No, they went with me. But my dad, I swear, was secretly like a Bill's fan a little bit. Like, he loved when they did well. But he wanted me to dominate the Bill's. But then when we weren't playing the Bill's anymore, he was cheering for them to do well. Do you think, Grunk, let's actually have a real moment here. Deep down, do you think that your dad, since he was such a real Bill's fan, when you guys played the Bill's, wanted the Bill's to win, but for you to score like three touchdowns and have 200 yards? No, no. My friends were like that though. But my dad was not like that. He wanted me to win. Have 300 yards. Have three touchdowns still. So can you give a shout out to those friends? I want their full names, because these are real men that I admire. Yes. Well, one of them, I went to Pittsburgh my senior year. And my friend, Barry Layton, he's a Pittsburgh fan. Before every game, he would tell me where he was. And he'd go up to the bus. You know how you drive through the parking lot. He'd be sitting there flicking me off. His friends would be mooning me. He'd be saying, after you to me. And I'd be like, dude, you just f-ed up, brother. I'm going to fucking score three touchdowns on your ass now. And then I would score three touchdowns. He's like, bro, I hate you. I wanted you to score three, but the Steelers needed to win. I really didn't have any friends like that in Buffalo, even though I truly grew up in Buffalo. And Buffalo is my true hometown. There's no one like, yo. Are you a Sabres fan or you don't like something? Big Sabres fan. I'm a huge hockey guy. I'm a big Sabres fan. The Sabres haven't been into the playoffs. They're the longest tenured team to not make the playoffs in the NHL, like what, 14, 15 years it is? But they- No, no, no, it's not that because the Jets are the longest tenured North American sports franchise to not make the playoffs. No, it's longer. And so they're 13. No, no, it's longer than the, I think so. Brock, right now, I want to bet you money that matters to both of us. Actually, I think the Sabres went to the playoffs in like 2012. Be careful, Brock. No, but they might be longer. You're walking into my fucking territory now. I told them for the NHL though. They're the longest tenured team not to go for the NHL. But the last time they went to the playoffs, Lindy Roth was their head coach. And guess what? They just hired Lindy Roth. That was a big hire. I was excited about that big time. And then another thing I'm actually involved in is a new recovery hydration drink coming out that I just got into big time. It's a recovery organic drink coming out. It's all on the West Coast right now. Lance Collins started that. He started Body Armour, sold that. And now he's redoing another thing. So I'm involved in that. Super excited about that project. I think I'm an investor in that also. Are you as well? I had a feeling someone would be here at this table. So I'm an investor. Recovery 180. Yes, Recovery 180. So right here, baby. There we go. So I'll be representing the products. Right here, we're partners. That's what I'm talking about. We've been partners our whole life. We've even though I was at the clubs, that we're kind of being partners. You were a contributor. Yes, I was a contributor. That's more correct. Talk to me. Actually, I'm gonna go around. This actually, I'm gonna be a little selfish now, but I know it's gonna bring value to the audience. What do you sit on social media marketing? What do you sit, Noah, on? How much time do you, all three of you, this will be really fun for me to hear. Let's start with you, Noah. What do you sit with social media marketing, meaning you can take this in any direction. We wanna do more of it. It's the hugest driver for us. We haven't figured it out. Like any mix of that or TikTok this or YouTube that or where do you, Noah, sit as a professional with social media marketing for your business? Let me bring it backwards. Please, please. You don't think Apple's good at marketing? Correct. I actually don't think Apple does any marketing. They only do advertising, okay? We believe in marketing and do no advertising. And for us, all of our marketing is social media. 100%. And in nightlife and hospitality, I think. Let me ask you a question, because I have so much love for you. A lot of people don't know the difference. Fair enough, but I would argue with all due respect, we're getting into semantics a little bit. I know what you're saying there. Let me ask you a question there, all of it, social media. How much does your group spend on paid media and social, not on the organic posts from all your establishments? If anything. Very little. Right. Tiny amount. That excites me. We only do it for things like recruiting, but not actually to bring in people to our places. That interests me as a, for instance, because knowing your business and knowing how strong local advertising is specifically on Meta, Facebook and Instagram. And I'm talking about things like $1,000 a week for a specific location that might have softening customer account, something we're talking about. Okay, so organic social is the driver of your business. It's the driver of everything. Please, please. I'm gonna agree with Noah. Go ahead. But I'm gonna add this to it. Please. All effective marketing is about talking to you individually. The more individual I can talk to you, the more relevant it is, the more powerful it is. Relevance is the game. Therefore, mass marketing is not going to be as effective as individualized social media where I can touch you, Gary, you, Noah, you, Grant individually. Yeah, but if you don't, obviously that's where you're going. Sure, but if you don't pay for media, the targetability of an organic post goes to where the algorithm sends it. So you're not going, you're back into mass media dynamics of going for awareness versus relevance of scale. What you're doing with your social media matters. It's a much more effective, targetable media. And I think that's where you'd be going. You have so many, excuse me, so many startup investments that are pretty advanced. They're not early startups anymore that you rattled off that all have the great ambition to replicate the iconic execution you created at Panera. In today's day and age, those different brands that you just mentioned, Cava, Level, when you look at the four organizations, obviously you're not the day-to-day CEO of those companies. So which is a whole different game than being, me when I sit on boards, I like almost eat, forget about biting my nails, I almost eat my whole hand, because I'm not in control. But I own more of them than I own to Panera. Well that's a different story. That's called growing up and figuring it out. When you look at those four brands, you rattled off. You feel like all of them take it serious, some are better than others, what's your, I mean, every case some are better than others. Some are much stronger, some are larger. Cava is a very large significant company today. There's a powerful organization within there that's driving social media. And that's very different than something like Level 99 that's much smaller, much more intimate. And it really depends on where they are in their curve and their maturity. I mean, using Bronk as a metaphor, some of my businesses are playing college ball and others are playing. Bronk was completely out of control in Arizona. Like completely, like he was so talented, he fully mailed it in. They should have, you know much better that those teams should have been. Bronk, admit that you and your boys were goofing off way too much and you guys should have been better. I actually admitted that last time I saw my quarterback, Willie Tuatama, we were at the spring game at Arizona and we were like, man, we were so talented. But I was like, sometimes we just love the nightlife a little bit too much. Yeah, we all did. You have no idea. Everyone, everyone. You have no idea. I mean, to the receivers, to the defense, to the quarterback. We had a C18 in college. I know football. We did. We did pretty well. We went to a bowl game. It was the first time University of Arizona went to a bowl game in 10 years. We won the Las Vegas Bowl and we went like eight and five that year. We were like number 22 in the nation. You guys could have been 11 and two easily. Yes, we could have. If the Pratt parties didn't seduce you. Yes. So I've got a question for you if I can ask. But, hey, we lived it up. How did they control you from partying, from playing? When you're playing in a Super Bowl, are you out at night? No, no, no. Super Bowl, no. No, definitely not. Like, going to the Super Bowl. Not even rock. After we won the AFC championship game, I mean, you would have, you would go out that Sunday night, enjoy it. But then right when Monday hits, you're back in the building and then the Super Bowl's two weeks later, you're not going out again until after the Super Bowl. So, I mean, that whole persona of, you know, I'm going out every night is definitely false. You know, it's not what everyone was portraying it to be. But I pick and choose my times when they go out and, especially when I was younger, when you could really do it. When you're in your young 20s, I mean, 22, 23, you can bounce right back. You can go out Friday night, bounce back on Saturday, play a game on Sunday and still beat the Jets by 40. Would you watch yourself? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Bro, what about you? Your personal brand, like you and then the businesses, different strategies evolved. Do you do your own social or do you have somebody in your team? How do you think about it? Wow, that actually is a good point. I mean, myself is a brand. Myself is a business. It started when I was 20 years old and got drafted, you know, to the New England Patriots. And I didn't really realize I was a business until everything starts falling out, everything starts playing. And, you know, you got to take care of yourself. You got to perform on the field. That was the number one thing, you know, for my business, which was myself, my body, my mental, my mental, physical attributes, everything like that is going out on the field and performing. And then everything else was coming along, you know, endorsement deals. Let's offer, go over here. We're going to pay you to go to this birthday party. And then I started really noticing, wow, like I'm my own business. How can I grow myself and all that? And I always knew I had to take care of business out on the field. That was always first. And then everything else will come along. I think a lot of, listen, I'm in the business. We have a sports agency. Actually, we literally just announced signing the New York Jets starting tight end Tyler Conklin for our sports agency, back to tight ends of Jets and Patriots. To your point, a lot of kids, especially kids now, because they're much more savvy about business and marketing, don't realize, like, if you're not playing well, no one's coming to you. Like, it's not complicated. Once in a while, someone's attractive enough or goofy enough off the field. Once in a blue moon. Kind of like the DeVito situation. Yes, once in a while. But for the most part, if you're going to do business, if you're going to get marketing deals, if you're going to get treated well in these establishments, winning and performing is the cost of entry. Exactly. You got that right on. Yeah, and I think even knowing some of the kids we recruited for VaynerSports that ended up, I'm thinking about one guy specifically, great guy. That's why I'm not going to name names. But I think was too ahead of wanting to do marketing deals and wanting to be an entrepreneur. And I always thought, like, if the kid just spent a couple extra hours watching film for his game on Sunday, all his dreams would come true instead of trying to get all the other stuff before, because it's the foundation for an athlete. Exactly. Please, success is the byproduct. You know, all the good things that happen. They're a byproduct of the important end. You got to play. When you go out on the field, you got to be great. When we open a restaurant, we got to have food that gets you excited. People that care, environments that engage you. When I go to your nightclubs, I'm not coming for your success. I'm coming because it's a powerful experience. Oh, I thought you were going to say first girls. Like, what's up? I'm just kidding. But that's part of the experience. Yeah, that's true. Why is he allowing the right women in? Gronk, why are you doing your own social or do you have somebody on the team? How do you think about your social? You know, I can definitely do a lot better on my social. But I never been a guy. I think it's a huge opportunity. It is a huge opportunity. But I never been a guy. Does it come natural? It can come natural. It comes natural sometimes. But I never been a guy that was like, hey, I'm going to explode my brand off of social. I've always like, hey, I'm going to explode my brand of just me being me out there in the public, you know, out there, out on the field. What about now? You're not on the field. Now, it's kind of like the same thing, man. I mean, I've definitely picked up on the social since I stopped playing. But it's still not to the level that it needs to be or that I could go to. But I never really wanted to sell myself like behind a computer, you know, behind a screen. And that's why I never. That's how I always saw it. And if you have a product that is getting talked about without even trying to promote it yourself, I think you have a home run then as well. I would not do a service to all my buddies that nerd out about football that listened to this show without getting football nerdy for a few seconds. Couple of quick hot takes. One, has there been a day since you retired? You obviously kind of weirdly retired twice, right? Yes. You know, obviously you came back and obviously there's a lot of circumstances there. That's not what I'm interested in. Since the actual retirement, it seems like you're not coming back at this point. Have you ever woken up and be like, ah, fuck, maybe one more year? No, no, not since I retired my second time. No, I'm good. How about the first time? The first time I always knew I was gonna go back to football. They've got it. Yeah, I always knew I needed a year off. I was beat up, I was banged up, but I kind of started finding new ways. It's kind of like re-innovating yourself. It kind of like you guys do in the restaurant world. You guys gotta react to whatever situation is presented to you. And I knew I had to take a year off of football. I was banged up, I was mentally and physically beat down. Did you consider retiring the year prior even? Even the year prior, I almost did it. I was probably about 80% retired the year prior, but that 20% got me hooked to go back. Got it. And I'm so glad I did because we won a Super Bowl that year in Atlanta versus Los Angeles Rams. But even that year, that was one of my most difficult years. It was 2018, my last season with the New England Patriots. I had a down year, I had about only like 500, 600 yards. And we won that because we came together as a team. And I would say we didn't really have the best team in the league. There was no way. We did not have the most talented team. I had a down year. I was supposedly the most talented guy on the field on the offensive side of the ball, but I had a down year of 600 yards. Like that's terrible for the guy that's supposed to be the playmaker on the team. But we came together as a team. We found out ways to win. And also I would say I found a way to contribute to the team in the blocking game in other ways. And that was blocking. We were running the ball behind me. We're setting up plays where the play action, which set me up on a little dink and dong of just going four yards out to be able to get a first down instead of me going deep anymore either. Who was the guy that you want to give roses to that real, real talk you feel you were such a tough player to defend? Who do you just kind of feel like did a good job defending you? Oh man. First off, in the NFL, I mean, it's kind of how you feel that day. When I'm not feeling good, I see this what a lot of players, that's why you see some guys, 12 tackles one game, the next game they're unheard of or they're just getting burned down the field. Then it felt hard to sustain that high level of play weekend and week out because you're getting banged up. You're getting hit. You don't know if someone is limping, if their knee's hurting, if they got a quack contusion, if their shoulder's out of place. And that's why sometimes you see some guys absolutely fail some weeks in the athletic world because they're beat up and you're like, what's wrong with that guy? And then the next week, you know, they're feeling better and boom, everything's clicking, their body's totally activated and you can't get behind that defender or you see that wide receiver making plays 200 yards that game. Sometimes you see a guy 200 yards in the next week, 10 yards. So I would say that has to do with a lot about how you're feeling yourself personally. When you're feeling like a guy like myself when I'm on top of the game, I don't think anyone can cover me out there on the field. But when I'm feeling beat down a little bit, I mean, I feel like anyone can cover me even a frickin' defense event. I've been covered by defense events before in my career. And then I have had the defense event try to cover me and when I'm feeling good, I blow by them by six yards. So it's all about how you're feeling in the NFL and you can get banged up so easily, even at practice the week, you know, the week of going to the game. Interesting. No, what, you know, anything you wanna bring awareness to or anything that you want the audience to know about that's going on in your world? Just wanna give you a minute for that. Give anybody a minute. I think, first of all, thank you for having me. This is an incredible group of people to be sitting with. You know, it's great to hear Gronk talk about his personal brand and being an athlete, you know, for what I do, going out multiple nights a week, having a host of people being, you know, all over the country, Las Vegas, New York, Miami, out till 2 a.m., up at 9 a.m., 8 a.m., 7 a.m. Maniac. It's a grind. It's a different type of athlete. A grind, yes, people ask me, hey, you're almost 50. How do you go out so often? How do you fly all over? And I say, just like, how does a marathon run a marathon? A marathon, run a marathon. I train my body to be able to, you know, go out late and wake up early. I love saying it's not about who's out the latest, it's about who's up the earliest. And I'm sure with the athletes, it's the same way, right? It's not about who can, you know, cover the most every day, but who gets up that next morning and gets out there early. And, you know, I'm also a big proponent of, you know, paying real attention to my personal brand. You know, I have my brand as the CEO of a company and I have my personal brand. I think social media is very important for that because everybody, you know, feels like they know you from what they see online. So I do think, Gronk, like putting a little more attention into what you're putting out there, you know, especially now that you're not on the field, you know, the less I go out, the more I need to, you know, do things on social to stay in touch and let people stay in touch with me. I think it's really important. Yeah, I think the attention can be deployed to different things, right? Like, when you think about, Gronk, you think back to being 22 or no, you think about your earliest days, like the things you got you cared about in the club in your 20s or the things you thought about your rookie or you didn't know as much, things change. I keep telling a lot of people like, Gary, I don't wanna have a personal brand. I'm like, and then you're gonna be 65 and you're gonna care about a nonprofit, you're gonna care about a political issue, you're gonna care about curing a disease that God forbid your child got, you're gonna care about something as a human and you're gonna wake up and it'd be nice to have a million people be able to be aware of something you care about. Everyone thinks about it as a sell out or a try hard or this is super omnie. Got it? Like, right? Like, I'm super empathetic to where you're at, but again, just like today, you're thinking about totally different things. When you're 70, you're gonna be thinking about totally different things. Please. Excuse me, I'm 70. Are you? You look great brother. I wouldn't have go there. No, I am. I'm proud to say I'm 70. You should be. Yeah, and I'll tell you something. I can't wait to be fucking 70 and rip. Well, we'll still have. You wanna rush there. Yeah, no, I'm not in a rush. I'm half-raised, I'm 35. All right, I wouldn't mind being 35. Yeah, respect. I'm damn good at fiving. Wisdom comes from your experience. Experience comes from banging your head against me. 100%, you know, and there's a certain joy. I share with you this. Please, in the end, I worked much harder when I was younger, but I have much more fun today. I do because the joy is in figuring it out. And one of the things I've learned is the core of everything that we're talking about is tell yourself the truth, actually figure out what matters, and then no bull should get it done. And that's sort of the way I approach all of this and think about it. I love that. You know, actually, here's a fun one, especially for you, Ron, what do you think you, I think about this a lot, even at 48, because I was in the game so early and I had so much success at, you know, this is back to being like an athlete a little bit I've always thought. I had so much success in my early 20s. I was public at 27. Yeah, so I know this about you, so I think this is gonna work for you. What do you think, with all that success? Yes. And when you're 27, you have that level of success, not that you have to be high on your own supply, but you definitely have confidence. You're like, fuck, I know what I'm doing. Let me just get to the, I actually apologize, I wanna get to this. What do you think today? You think that young you had most wrong. Back to experience and wisdom. What do you think you personally most learned? Because again, back to all four of us, and I think I want everybody to hear this, all four of us also were naturally gifted in some ways and then put in the work to maximize those gifts. When you do that, something that comes along is you have confidence. You have confidence that you're good at certain things and what that can do is hide a vulnerability that you later find out through. Let me give you mine. Mine was, I didn't realize that not being candorous with my employees was, I used to think of it as I was really nice, but in hindsight, it left a lot on the table both for them and me and the company. And I've gotten much better in my mid 40s. This is a new phenomenon for me. A much more, as Gary Vee, the public figure, it's my biggest strength. I fucking shoot it. But with my employees, if I care about them, I struggle telling them they sucked because I hate fear. And so I really learned that lesson. What do you think your biggest lesson was in your incredible career? And sitting here at 70 saying, okay, my 20s and 30s, I really thought this and in hindsight, it was actually this. Trust myself. Trust my inclinations. So often when you're young, you second guess yourself. You don't know. You obsess about it. And as you get over thinking, taking some dying on someone else's sword, right? Taking someone's advice. And listen, I've been in this battle for 50 years. I'm gonna keep going as long as I'm healthy. And things are gonna work out. They're not gonna be, they're not gonna fail us. Gotcha. And I think the other thing I would just offer up is strength comes from humility. 100%. World in which it's pounding my chest bullshit. It's actually those people that are strong, incompetent, good, actually know it. Have the ability to be quiet and soft and let their work show. And really own it. Accountability is so attractive. Absolutely. Like, what about for you? You're a young dude, so young still, but like anything stand out. I mean, obviously so much of your career was playing professional sports, but you know, you've done a lot of business. You've been very entrepreneurial back to your brothers and all that stuff. Anything in the, let's use business. Or like, you know, marketing or business. Anything stand out so far? I've like a learned thing. Yes, I like what you said around. You gotta trust your gut. You gotta trust your instinct. There's some businesses. There's some endorsement deals I've taken where I just, I just went to grab the money, but really deep down I'm like, why am I doing this? I'm doing it because my agent is, is forced, it's not forcing me to do it, but you know. Forcing, I'm like forcing. Encouraging me, not forcing, but encouraging me. Deep pushing you in the direction. That's the 10th, I'm doing a tied at. And really, I like that. Tied was cool. I don't tie anymore, but I like doing the tied commercials. Tied, if you're listening, we're interested. But just deep down, doing things. Hold on, I don't know if we know this. Yes. Is it someone's birthday? Yes it is. Happy birthday! Let's sing it. Happy birthday to you! Look at this cake! Look at this cake! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear brother! Go Jets, it says. Happy birthday! Happy birthday, dear brother! I didn't mean that. I was just saying, it says go Jets. This is the best cake I've ever taken. I don't know if I can even take a bite. It says go Jets on it. I don't know if I can take a bite. Well, Gough, if you don't blow out the candles, it's 30 years of bad luck. I could blow out the candles. Come on. Whoo! Woo! Oh! Oh, man, incredible. Thank you, guys. Good work, team. Thank you. I love this office. You want to work out here? I need a job here. Can I get a desk over there? 100%. Yeah, there is no room in this office. We're good, we're good. Enjoy. Thank you. Go Jets, cake here. I'm very happy about this. It's the best birthday cake I've ever made. Well, I really like this combo. I like this combo, brother, of going for the dollars, like not feeling it in your stomach. You know, it's a really interesting one for all four of us. It's funny that this is a topic. I've said to many friends over dinner, in couples dinners we get to hang out a lot. Die, not dying on your own sword is the worst. Nothing, when you lose and you decided, you made the decisions, you tried to figure it out, you can live with that. You fucking, you fucking live with it. Man, when you take someone else's point of view, because you didn't have the confidence in your intuition, and then it doesn't work out, you're dead. You're like, fuck this shit. I think it's a really interesting topic, I mean, I think we all share the same philosophy of, you can't just do things for the money. You have to do things that you love. I can't tell you how many times we've been tempted to open a place in a certain location because the deal was so good, even though in our gut we knew it wasn't the right place or it wasn't the right product. The other thing I would say is just looking back, like 48 year old Noah wishes I told 35 year old Noah to balance things out a little bit better. I was so gun-ho every night, this had to be the best weekend, this had to be the biggest party, we had to have the biggest opening, and I didn't balance what I should have. Noah, you were a crazy mother afer, I bet, back in the day. You can trust me. You can trust me. I totally understand, because I had to run. I lived the same way at one time, man. I wish I could say no. If I could go back, I would have said no about half of the things that I did. Yeah, I still got the rest of your lives to actually live that. But it's not a sprint, it's a marathon. Pacing yourself, not feeling like you gotta get it all in today, even taking care of yourself. Personally, if I had taken better care of myself when I was in my 30s, I'd be able to do more of what I like to do now when I'm going into my 50s. Just that balance, finding, for me, I found a great woman. I'll get a little philosophical for an old man. Something I learned watching my parents die. The key to life is that there is a judgment day. And if you don't die of a tragic illness, you're going to have a judgment day. And the time to have that judgment day wasn't like my parents in the ninth inning with two outs on their deathbed. The time to have that judgment day is when you're 70, when you're 48, when you're 35, and you still got an opportunity to figure out what it is you're gonna respect on your deathbed. I agree. I think about that a lot, brother. You know what's funny? What your legacy's gonna be. Yeah, you know what's funny? It's someone gonna, go ahead. What you're gonna respect. Because what ultimately matters is not what the world says, not how much money you have, not how much they love you, not how well your business did, but what you think of yourself. 100%. It's the biggest opportunity for happiness. Playing, I say it all the time, like when you play within your own cocoon, it's so fun because the reality is that, first of all, here's an important part, let's get philosophical. Nobody knows you. Even the people that are closest to you, parents, spouses, siblings, deep down, we sit here as four men right now, we know there are things that not one human on earth knows about us fully. Definitely not experiences, there's lots of those for sure with this crew, but two, just even actual things. And that gets to the point of most people live their life based on other people's judgments. When at the end of the, I couldn't be a bigger buyer of this topic. Yeah, and I'll share with you something. 25 years after we're gone, nobody's gonna give a shit. 25 hours, it literally. By the way, by the way, there's, by the way, by the way, by the way. 25 days. Family, family, yes. But there's so pretty, there's, all four of us in different ways have plenty of people that know of us, think of us. I'd like to say admire us. There's a lot of love. By the way, this hit me super hard. When Prince died, I remember it very vividly. Prince passes away, 24 hours of incredible outpour, but the world got so fast, right? Like, I just, you know, back in the day, I'm gonna go lose seal ball, I'm gonna go back when I was a kid growing up. You know, things, the world was slower. You'd get a week, two weeks, tributes. I remember the Michael Landon, right, from Little House in the Plurinary. That was like two week media cycle. Now. Bonanza. Right. That's really, right. Now, the biggest people on earth, 24 hours, and like I said, forget about 25, 25 hours. And it's real, and that's great. And that's okay, and to your point, that should make everyone excited, because it should liberate them from overvaluing other people's opinions. And we all do it. We all do it. I have no judgment towards anybody else. Who are we? It's back to your point, brother. Big buyer of a lot of stuff coming out of your mouth. I think humility is the unlock to all happiness. If you're humble enough to know that you mean fucking nothing, it actually makes trying to be something incredibly fun instead of stressful. Abs. Yeah, fun stuff. Wow, well said. Yeah. Anyway, I can tell you, you love what you're doing, Gary. I can tell. Listen, we've got to know each other serendipitously. Recently, I got very lucky. I love people. And I've come to realize, my God, people don't feel that way. People really struggle with people because they themselves are insecure, and so other people affect them. So much of our issues politically, socially. And just, I don't know, I got so fortunate. I'm being serious about this. I really like people. Like, I see people loving dogs like this. I know you love your dog a lot. I love my dog, too. I actually talk about this a lot. We always joke. I always make this joke that's little tongue in cheek. Like, I don't like dogs. And the point I'm trying to make is, I wish people liked each other the way they like animals. Yeah, I do like it, but I like life because I like people. I like all people. I like being out and about. But not like at the club, and that's fun, too, but even at the airport, like being in line at the shop, at some supermarket, like watching what people, this is why I'm a good, I like being a marketer. I like how people think. Why did they grab that cantaloupe? Why did they go to that restaurant? Why are they wearing that jacket? Like, my why, why, why, why? And coming from like a good place instead of like, you know, there's so much insecurity in the world. You definitely like people. You're very curious, too. You're like, knowing what drives people. I love people, too. I would never have done what I did if I didn't love being around people, introducing people. One of the best things I look back on the last 30 years and can think about all the people I've introduced, people who've met each other at my places is one of the things that I'm most proud of. Getting married, business deals, right? Yeah, people who met their wives, their husbands, their business partners, their mistresses, whatever they want, at our places. It's a little late. And looking back, that's part of the legacy that we leave. I love where people say, oh, you know, I met my so-and-so at your place, or it's the best place I ever went to when I was 21, and it's all because I love people. Well, I think in some way, all of us are about impacting other people. Yeah, I think that's right. I would say I love people as well. And we love people that are around us that give us that driving force, that make us want to be inspired, that give us that energy that we've been looking for. But then there's also a lot of people out there that are vampires that are sucking that energy from you. That's right. And those are the people you don't want to be around. And you kind of learn throughout your 20s and your 30s. And hopefully when I get into my 40s, I have a whole cast around me that's just people that are just making me want to drive. When you get really old. Yeah, so that's when I get rid of it. So that's when I get really old. Really grow up. Yeah, you want to be around people that give you that juice. And that's right. And I think if you can be self-aware, one of the things I've done poorly in my life that I'm trying to get better at is I love providing impact and value, sometimes to a fault. I always joke with my family. I'm like, man, if I was born a woman, I would have always gone after the broken dude and I'm gonna fix him. Like, there's a charity component, even as an investor. I had to be honest with myself at some point about three years ago and look at it. I did very well early on when I didn't think I was an investor. Facebook, Twitter, I'm pointing to my stock certificates. I crushed and then somewhere along the line I decided I was an investor and really what I was actually doing was charity work. I was investing in people to help them. Like, and then I was like, no, I need to start a foundation. I can just do charity work. Like, you've got to be, you know, some of us, when you're good-natured, you attract that too. You know, like you're attracting people that are trying to take because you've got something to give. And you're willing to. Right? Don't you think that's enabling? I believe it the most. I didn't think of it back then. Now I think it's fully enabling. It's enabling bad behavior. Anyway, we could sit here philosophically forever. I do want to give each of you an opportunity because over the next several three, four, five years there will be millions of listens to this. So Noah, anything you want to send people to or anything you want them to be aware of? I think I've said a lot. Good. Fine, Ron. Plugged my platform. Very excited to meet you guys. This is a very, very cool conversation. I feel like we definitely had a meeting. We've had a couple shots. We've had a couple shots. We've had a couple shots. I knew it. I knew it. You have to suffer in some way. It's not that special. You've had a couple shots with every person. You've been doing a couple of the clips. This is nice to meet you in person now. He's the best. You guys should be real friends. Ron, anything, I know you have a great book. Like, what do you, anything to talk about? No, nothing to pump. Other than to say, you know, life is short. Do things that you respect. Do things that matter to you and make a difference with other people. That's where the joy comes from. Whether you're on the field, whether you're in a club, or whether you're feeding them. It's awesome. Ron. I mean, we've talked about money, but there's something that my girlfriend and I co-founded that's voomerang.com and it's a online sweepstake platform. You own voomerang.com. Voomerang.com with a V. Got it. And we have a sweepstake going right now actually, and it's to win two tickets to the Olympics in Paris this year. Your whole round trip paid for, your airfare, your hotel, everything you get, get a certificate to spend as much money as you possibly need when you go over to Paris. So if you go to voomerang.com, you enter there, and it raises a lot of money for charities as well. I started the Grant Nation Youth Foundation about 10 years ago, and that's a charity that we are raising awareness for through this platform as well. So it's just all good things, man. And all the good comes back when you give out the good to all those that are in need out there. Boys, thank you for being on the show. Thanks for having us. Yeah, thank you for having us, Gary. This was great, man.
