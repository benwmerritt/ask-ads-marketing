How you feeling? Tell your guy don't get me with this. I will, that's gonna be the best part. I need to go viral. We're gonna zoom in on his toes. Yeah. Yeah. Cause we're gonna be legends. Gonna get their attention. What we're doing here ain't just scary. It's about to be legendary. We're gonna be legends. Gonna teach them all how to say no. What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? I was more than happy to take the snarky comments along of self promotion. I'm like that's cute. I'm like but business is real. You know? Your opinion's lovely. And then what's great is, and this is why I can't waver from it, is a lot of the shit that I said became true. Because I'm tripling down on the one thing I've had. I've always had that intuitive. As a 16 year old, I just sold my entire baseball card collection at the height of baseball cards and converted it into comic books because I could taste the shit and it happened. And so then, that's how I built the Wine Business. I built Wine Library on the back of Australian and Spanish and New Zealand wines while Sherry Lemons and Zackeys and Morales were playing France and California. So it's always been there. And it will always be there. And that's... You know what? We do. I've been in this business a long time. I've probably been in theme parks, TV, internet. You've been in it. But I always the same business as the consumer. Attention. All you do is watch the consumer. Don't get distracted by technology. Don't get distracted by the content. How's the consumer behaving? What is the consumer doing? I'm eating my own dog food. Like I know how it plays out. It's leverage. I want the next Mark Zuckerberg to come to me and say I'm cool and be on the board. This is... People are misunderstanding what's happening. And that's how I think about stuff. When everybody debates all this stuff, all you need to do is build brand with the end consumer. I mean... It's money in the bank. Always. Always. Brands win. Two things win. Brands win and convenience wins. That's right. If you can figure out how to make my life easier, whatever that product is, you're gonna win. Do rock slap. I mean... So I had a feeling... It's obvious for me to see who's navigated careers or who's emerging to navigate careers. And by the way, I actually don't care about anything else than those two things. Speed is how I correlate convenience. And that's why ads are bad. Ads are taking people's time away in a world where people now care about time so much, which is why native matters to me so much because you're integrating within the content and radio is so set for that. And one of our corporate values is urgency wins. We start everything when somebody says we're gonna build something. We start, yeah, let's do it in 24 hours. We make them justify why we take three months to do it. But as opposed to trying to pull people in. Start with 24 hours. Everything can be done in 24 hours unless you have a damn good reason. The amount of money that our potential clients are wasting in a 2017 world is extraordinary. And it's being poured in two places. In commercials and traditional programmatic digital inventory. To buy programmatic on a banner or a pre-roll where you don't know where it's actually being deployed and the KPI is the CPM and the creative has no idea contextually where it's sitting is insanity. I just want to have that in the back of your mind as well. All right, good to see you again. Just get some light for you. Hey guys, it's 2.10 pm. DRock overslept. I'm kidding. Well, the strategy, I should have been recording a little bit in film, but a little late start. Super fun meeting anytime you get to go with the tit-titans of media. It's always a lot of fun. But just trucking along, super productive CES. Just a ton of business meetings. A lot of people excited about the PureWow deal asking about that. But just a lot of biz dab. Some really successful meetings with Facebook. And good to see Snapchat and just a lot of clients and media companies and just starting to reel again in the game. This reminded me very much to when Wine Library kind of hit a crescendo moment. Probably about 2003 and 2004 where the other people in the game started giving you that head nod like, hey, we know you're in it. This is a very big industry. These are billions and billions of dollars worth companies. So took a little time even though I started from a nice space, but I could taste it. And it's exciting. I love the game. I respect everybody, even our competitors, people that don't believe in us, but I want to win. I want to win more than anything. And get a picture with you. Sure, of course. Oh man, I cannot believe this. My friend, you see this? Oh my God, brother, you just made my shift. You just made all of this worth it, man. Thank you, man. What's your name? Ah, Renzo. Oh my God, I'm way too excited about this, man. Thank you, man. Yo, I've been listening to you. I have my best friend, Luis. He's working at the Cosmopolitan and he said, hey, man, like, you got to listen to this guy, man. Because I seen my friend, he was hustling and hustling. I was like, hey, I like what you're doing. Like, you're getting it. And he was like, you don't understand. Like, you got to listen to this guy. He's a monster, man. Like, he's going to turn your life around. Thank you, man. And he said, I want you to listen to this. And ever since, man, it's just been like, it's just crazy, Gary. Oh my God. Are you really busy right now, brother? I'm just going to let you see this picture. Yeah, we might take it. Yeah, we might take it. Yeah, no problem. Oh my God, man. And you know, he said, hey, uh, uh, vanguards media's here. And I was like, no way. I was like, you're going to see him? And he said, oh, Gary wasn't here at the end of the day. It's awesome. And I was like, and then I was like, dude, you put on my snapchat. Yeah. Oh man. This is awesome, brother. Awesome. Thank you so much, man. Appreciate it. Appreciate what you do, man. No worries. Brother. How are you? Dude, so right. You did this one thing about this music. And you were talking about like, oh, Isaac. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. All of our motivation, man. Can we get a quick picture? Yeah, of course. Cool. How are you? Hey, hey, hey. What's your doing? Pleasure, brother. Thank you, man. Where are you from? California. You did this post, and like you posted it, but you did this video like years ago. And you predicted about this music industry, about modern. Dude, I'm making beats right now. And you couldn't be more right, bro. Thank you, man. Good luck to you guys. Good luck. Take care. How you doing? Good, man. What's going on? Life. Life is going good? Yeah. What's up? What's up? You want to walk and talk a little bit? Yeah. Want to get to my next thing? Right, we're in Aria right now. So let's get to Cosmo. All right, let's go this way, right? Yeah, but we won't. DRock, don't film this. He's talking about important shit. All right. I mean, you could film the, like the image of it. Yeah, yeah. Not the audio. What's up, bro? I'm going to give you a real good piece of advice. I came into the game five years ago and was already rich, successful, and a guy. And I didn't care. I didn't care. The work and the fact, like chip out of one way at a time. Don't get crippled. Like everybody will know. Yeah. Right? Like I let it come to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And when it comes to you, you've got a good leverage. It's better. It's better. You know what I mean? Yeah, so I... So you're young and hungry and you want to fucking rip people's skulls out of their bodies, but let the shit come to you. Here's what I know. I know that actions... You've walked. Yeah. We didn't walk in a circle. Yeah, we did. No, we did not. It's fine. Cosmos over there. No, we did not. That's amazing. Did you feel that? We've walked in a circle. Yeah. No, we did not. Yeah, we came out right there. Holy shit. Video and music problems. But what I... The reason why I think is interesting. Oh, this time, but it's fine. Oh, it's about... It's my song about it. Yeah. So I'm gonna go with the song. Yeah. So I'm gonna go with the song. Yeah. So I'm gonna go with the song. Yeah. So I'm gonna go with the song. Yeah. So I'm gonna go with the song. Yeah. So I'm gonna go with the song. Yeah. Take the cello. Take the cello. No one's producing high quality content as rapidly as fast as motivational. And I'm scared. I actually tied into your live the other day. I was like, let me shoot a Jerry spin. You're like, yo. I got crazy. Look up the hashtag plumber for fucking seven hours of it. And I was like, okay. You know, it's like... I'm trying to help. I mean, it's just good, right? You know what it feels like to have somebody call you and say, they're a single email you and say they're a single mom and they made 200 bucks selling eBay shit today and it's changed and it means something to them. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing. The way I break the world up is 90% of the world are they're afraid and they want to be safe and that's okay. And everyone doesn't have to be like, they want to understand your zone. Then 5% of the world, they're entrepreneurial, but they're doing it with the ego and perception that's driving it. It's not true. Correct. I said, I sit in, you sit in that designing life. It's designed, life by design. Everything I do is because I want to. There's no ego, there's no perception, there's no shit. It's because this is what's making me happy and what's feeling just like longer vision. I love it. I love you, man. Let's keep this conversation going. Yeah. I'll see you in New York. Hey, thank you, man. Thank you, man. What's your name? Brian. Hey, Brian. Very nice, man. Oh, thank you, man. You're welcome. On the floor. Fuck. Have you been on the floor? A lot. I was just, you know. Hey, we locked that of our room. And DRock trying to get me to do the update from one year ago. I'm just, I'm just recording this vertically just because I know what I'm about to say. And I just want to document, like it's so obvious to me what's going to happen with DailyBee and Snapchat. Like our execution these next 12 months, it's going to be, it's going to be so fucking crazy what it all looks like a year from today. Like maybe you'll use this video to show the numbers. As a matter of fact, make sure you document my YouTube subscribers and my snap. I'll save right now a Snapchat story, how many stories that I'm going to use. I'm getting and we'll literally run this video. Put it in your calendar right now. A year from today, we will put this out because what a lot of people understand is it's execution and we've put the pieces in place of full execution. Right? Yeah. But the truth is, I'm not worried about how many more followers I have on Instagram or Snapchat or Facebook and it's phenomenally great. It's the impact. It's the fact that you can't walk fucking seven steps DRock without somebody saying, hey, no, hey, like it's pretty cool what like you've done for my life or this and that. Like when I said and you can clip it here like in a year from now, it's going to be so fucking crazy. It's going to be not how many fucking followers I have. It's how much impact I'm having in helping others do their thing because I'm going to get mine. I'm going to win regardless. I was a businessman that won and made millions before there was the fucking documenting of internet and blogs and things of that nature. I'm building an agency. Gary Vee's my side hustle. I'm doing this for legacy. It's brand building. It gives me leverage for other opportunities. But the R-O-Y is the tweets. Go search my username right now and go look at all the people that miraculously have a better life overnight because they're actually selling shit that's randomly in their house and I have 500 bucks to go do that thing. It's impact. It's not many fucking followers. I don't need an update on my followers DRock. What do you mean it's the worst? Where were you? By the way, I have a funny feeling your key is not going to work. Why is your key going to work and mine is not? Please God. Yeah. I forgot my gel and fucking New Orleans. I almost forgot my fucking... I have something. Sorry, I don't need your gel. You can't get around here. You know? Where are you guys? We're probably going to want to do a new front. You should probably... You tell him you'll help him with his if he gives us artists to come to ours. No, we're going to do something else. What? We're going to do a fuck a front and like break the whole thing. We're going to do a... We're going to do a... We're going to do a... Back front. You shouldn't commit your money up front like a fucking idiot. We're going to fucking just... You know what I mean? We got to break everything now. We're going to MGM. You did cancel it. We're here because it's faster. Cancel it. You got a three or five or two or one? Okay, you got it, D-Rock? Yeah, thank you. Wow, she really wants to build her brand like that. Everybody does. That's smart. Yes, I'm nervous about it. All right. Can we make 2017 the year that we actually spend a little time together instead of like giving each other respect through like hallways at four different events a year? Let's have a real dinner. We should have a real dinner. It's like one time. I want to. I'm excited. I'm really excited about what you said last night too. I'm going to send my assistant a message right now. Nice to meet you. Take care, Steve. That would be... That would make sense. Who's that? A player. Yeah, guys. I'm going to kill Bonnet. Okay. Yo. What's up, bro? What's up, bro? How you doing, bro? Good, man. How you doing, man? I'm out of talk. Ryan, how are you doing? How you doing, boss? I forgot. That's amazing. That's the highlight of the whole fucking trip. Right there. Dude. Nice to see you. How are you? Good. Good to see you. What's up, man? How are you? How you feeling? I'm good. I will. That's going to be the best part. I need to go viral. We're going to zoom in on his toes. Yeah. You playing? By the way, we should have... Actually, you know what? That's a... It was the first time I played good in 12 years. I played good. Can you text Tyler and say new rule? I mean, that's serious. CES, South by, Cannes, basketball game. You and I. Yes. And then we'll gather up. Ryan likes to shoot from the outside. I see. You showed me one. You showed me... I played 3 point line, 2 point line. You never played 3 point line. I don't. No, we should still... 100 points. That'd be fun. By the way, that's a real thing what he just said. You don't appreciate me. And if Stefan's following Bonin, Stefan can play a little. He'll go like 1 for 13 from the field, but... That's a real thing he just said. All events. That's a great idea. Just like you guys have that party lesson. That's what we should... That'd be fun. And it'll become a whole thing. That's the best thing. Everyone will want to do that. And you'll bring Lebron. I'll bring Chris Bob. Right? And then if God forbid I score on Draymond, we'll just play it on loop on all social for life. After he kicked your ass. Oh my God. He's the best. All right. But who could? Done. I got it. I got it. You're called. Rich, you know what's crazy? That people still for some reason haven't figured it out. This isn't Bravo. This isn't MTV. You're fully in control. Like you don't like... Practice, make the first episode. It's good enough. You put it out. Plus the other thing is... I actually was just saying this to Pittman, who Ryan used to work with. When there's that much volume, you're not crippled by... You know, we just did an interview together. Sometimes it's one click. When I went crazy and compared Twitter to Ricky Rubio, you know, like that's the moment. You haven't seen that yet? The comp was that Twitter lost its way because it didn't innovate for five years. Just like Ricky Rubio didn't develop a shot. And then I got a little crazy and said, if Ricky Rubio was working on his jump shot during the summer, instead of going to a visa and banging chicks, he would have won. And so it became this whole thing like Twitter was banging chicks. That's what it became. Rule number one, nothing matters. Like if you really take a step back, 99% of shit doesn't matter and how do you outsource. So for example, I produce more content than anybody. It's just that I figured out a macro. Oh, right. I'll just make them follow me. Everything's being collected. Everything's being edited. Now, I do have to take time to watch it. You know, like sometimes there's a subtlety. So there's a little allocation. But it's also like, you know how this is. And listen, you didn't build a business by accident. This I know is important at this moment. Built it in Long Island, not in Vegas. That's right. You guys are building it in Vegas. The pops of this happening in the wild. That's what I need to learn. Listen, I think especially the truth of your story is so fucking real. I'm so excited about that brand part. But in the short term, the one thing we've consistently done for a couple of small, small pharma companies that affiliate and things of that nature, I know we can sell at Walmart and Target. I'm very confident. So I'm excited. I think we will hold our fucking own. But we do need a lot of markets in this business. Oh shit. I'm so glad I get to see you. You look ridiculous. What were you sleeping? I love you, man. Where are you going? Where are you going? Look at this. I'm going to take a picture of this. I just took this image. You did? I was just like... Look at these cool kids. So what's up? What's up, bro? Who's going to win the NBA finals? I have no idea because right now it's wild card leaking. No one gives a shit about NBA. I hate football, man. You took me off before I could say you're the only person who doesn't give a fuck because the jets aren't born. True. You know I'm not even going to watch? I'm not even going to watch. Good to see you. How's it going? Good? I love you. See you later. No, that's not the case. And it could be seven people, Claude. We're not pandering this.
