## Transcript
Hey everybody, I wanted to say that a new book is coming. The follow-up to Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, originally called Jab, Jab, Jab, Left Hook, but I finally captured what I've been doing for the last 20 years as an entrepreneur, as a creator and influencer, as an operator of a marketing company that works with fortune 5,500 companies, and really the punchline of what I'm seeing in society, which is day trading attention, how to actually build brand and sales in the new social media world. I'm really proud of this book. When I read it, and some of you follow my social enough to see the clips, when I read it in studio, it got so neat, it goes so detailed. It goes macro and micro as I like to roll, and so if you've not picked up a copy yet, go to garyve.com slash DTA, which stands for Day Trading Attention.
