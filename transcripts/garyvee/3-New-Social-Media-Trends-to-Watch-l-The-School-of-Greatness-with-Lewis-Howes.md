You've always told me and a lot of your followers ahead of time, this is what's coming. Yes. You know, you were early Twitter, beyond Twitter. This is what's happening. This is what's happening now. Early Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn. You were like always pushing the tech talk. You were like the first one on TikTok, Snapchat. I remember you looking me in the eye saying beyond Snapchat. That was the only thing that like didn't work for me, but everything else has worked for me. Who knows what's going to happen with TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, all these different platforms. When we're thinking of attention in the future. Yeah. AI and freaking mobile devices. And all these things that have a chance. Yes. You know what I'm great at is not predicting but moving so goddamn fast when it happens. And then going all in. Yeah. That I have that advantage. What is what is coming? Here's here's things that have are coming. One, for people like you and I, all of our content in every language at scale. We've got a million subscribers on Spanish on YouTube. In our voice. Oh yeah. That's the key. That's what we're working on now. Yeah. Yeah. So I and you've seen it already, Dustin. Like we're pretty close. We're almost done. I'll be speaking every language in my voice, in my little high pitches and me. That's going to be huge for every through AI. That's right. Is there a tool specifically you're looking at that you're we're using re-speecher. There's a box. There's I mean, it's moving so. 50 of them. Notice how I hesitated and I'm a big fan. Yeah, it may be gone. And yeah, that game is AI eating itself up is just like crazy. Yeah. So AI virtual influencers. Oh, yeah, that's coming. I've seen the people are blowing up already with. You mean just like made up influencers. That's right. Yeah. Hey, OK, very attractive people. Instagram that you're like. And that will go that will go not just right now. The early movers like always are like models and like all that. But it will be full. For the Ricky Thompson, 47 year old marketing expert who's going to 14 million followers and it's job at a Joanna Thompson in Australia that actually owns him. They're crazy. Oh, it's going to be huge. So virtual influencers. Are you getting into some of that too? Yeah, I'm really starting to go deep on that. Live streaming as as a more scaled everyday thing. Let me explain what I mean by that. Me saying live streaming is important. It's not Kaisenette and like Aiden Ross and like ninjas clicks. Like plenty of people are crushing on Twitch and other things. No, I mean what I'm up to now, which is I have a camera in my office on mute for 13 hours a day and I'm just sitting there and entrepreneurial ASMR. It's mute mute because I'm having real meetings. So people are watching you watching me. I was hearing you. That's right. And I try to unmute and that's the good thing for me. He created an unmute counter and I'm like looking at him like I haven't unmuted yet. Hey, everyone. Like literally. Wow. 13 hours a day. That's right. People making pizza. People I predict in five years, someone who loves to mow their lawn. Long lawn mow their lawn dyslexic mow their lawn. We'll go from like that's that classic dad who does it to the modern dad. The 28 year old who's destined to be a 48 year old dad who loves to mow their lawn. Like loves it is destined right now as we're speaking. To one time in seven years as he's on that journey, streaming it for some weird reason. Today, every 42 year old, 61 year old man or woman that loves to mow their lawn for an hour and a half, a big lawn does not think. Let me set up a laptop and stream live on Twitter. Does it cross their mind? I believe it will become known. I believe one of them will do it. I believe for whatever reason it will crush. And I believe that person will a year later retire from being a principal in a high school to making a million dollars a year mowing their lawn. Live streaming it. Live streaming it. Well, you know how different that is than what I predicted would crush it. Remember what I predicted would crush it, which was insane, which is influencers are going to make money. I didn't call it influencers. We didn't have the term yet. People will make money on the Internet being themselves. That was like right now. Somebody's like, wait a minute. I will literally make a full time living by streaming, making breakfast for my family every morning. Let me just say that you know insane. That's crazy, man. Like literally a mom or dad, let's say a stay at home dad or mom is literally going to start streaming her six a.m. to seven thirty of prepping breakfast for everybody. And it's going to capture a fever. And they're going to get millions of viewers every morning. And they're going to get subscribers for two bucks. They're going to get merch deals. Book deal. Pre-world. Yeah. I'm seeing if there's a guy on TikTok who goes live. It must be all day. He's live. He owns a little fruit stand. He's just cutting up fruit. And he's got a massive line every day that just wants to like be in the stream for a second. That's right. Livestreaming, cutting fruit. It's crazy. The extreme version of what I saw happening with crush it is about to happen with live streaming because it takes it to passive instead of progressive. I had to sit down and do the line show. Now it becomes passive. I will stream while I'm running my wine store. But will people watch. Yes, how we're going to when it when you need to be five seconds of videos that people are like losing attention? No, because people are watching long form content at scale right now. You know this. Yeah. You just don't want to be in the middle. You want to either be great at short form or you want to be great at long form. You just don't want to be the middle or you don't want to be bad at long form or bad at short form. You could make people watch a people binge watch an entire season of something on Netflix or sit. I have people that sit with me. You know this. Sit with me the whole day. That's crazy. They sit there the whole day. And talk to each other. That's crazy. Well, that's community. I mean, it's amazing. It's crazy. It's funny. It reminded me you might remember this when I was coming up the game on Twitter and and Vidler YouTube. What was it? Periscope? Well, that was later and Meerkat Meerkat. But what about daily booth? You stream you stream man. Yeah, that was that was big for me. Wow, I remember that. I would have been a huge streamer, but now I'm too busy. Yeah. So my family, a couple hundred people, I have nothing. Because I'm not there's nothing. Right. Now, to Dustin and team's credit, now they're playing my recent videos in the top right corner. During the live stream. So right. So I'm on mute. But on the top right corner, a smaller box is going to be this literally. Wow. And like so, like, you know, like we're figuring it out. And like and again, I think there's going to be way more compelling ASMR. I can tell you right now, it would have been much more compelling to follow me tasting wine all day. What I'm doing right now is really boring. I'm sitting in an office for like 12 hours. They just doing meetings. I'm not even in the old D Rock daily V world where I was moving around a lot. You sit there because I'm in full operation mode. I'm Bayer X and friends right now. I'm in one of those moats. You know, I'm not in Gary V Land as much. Yeah. Yeah.
