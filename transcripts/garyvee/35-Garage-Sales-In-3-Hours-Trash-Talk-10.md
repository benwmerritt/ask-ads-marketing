Just give me five. Just give me five. Fine, fine. Neema, the biggest problem here is $81 in savings. That's $8,000 to charity that I think this kid just cost me. Wow! Come on. Here we go. September 9th, 2023. Trash talk is back. I was at the sports car national back in July. I probably had 40, 50 people mention your garage sale video is my favorite. You're watching your video. It's a freshman high school. I've been flipping my way up now in college for three. I watch your, like, garage videos. It's just great to see, like, somebody like you out there and driving a car. So dusting off some of the cobwebs. We should have a good day today. I'm pretty excited about it. Going to Springfield, New Jersey. The old stomping grounds. Literally home of the iconic Wine Library. Let me get this disclaimer out of the way. I am not someone who's earned his professional career going around and trying to rip off people from $5 to $2. I see the comments out of context in social. Usually when it's a small clip at a TikTok where I'm showing something, people are like, this fucking millionaire is ripping up. So here's what I'm going to do. All money saved, right? When I negotiate, because this show is to show people how to start when they are at a very low financial point. So I'm going to go walk in right now and see a stuffed animal and they're going to say $2. They're going to say, well, you take a buck. For every dollar saved, I'm going to multiply it by 100 and make a donation to one of the comments in the YouTube of which charity or GoFundMe that you're passionate about. Anyway, couple things. It's 8.05 a.m. right now. The townwide sale starts at 9 a.m. We'll probably get there. Avi, what do we got for that first address? 8.30. 8.30. That's exactly right. You want to get there about 30 minutes early because it is an early game and there's people there right now. I like to find a little bit more of a respectful tone. People don't like to be sitting in their yard as they're setting up. I'm going to ask you. Anything that's passed 30 minutes before it starts is too late. The amount of cynical cats that jump into the comments of these episodes and like I see people say, oh, this doesn't work. And they always have excuses. And you're like, oh, what about the gas price? What about shipping? Shipping? You charge for it. Like if you look carefully, some people are clever. They'll sell a $15 item for 99 cents but $15 shipping. Whereas other people are charging $15 free shipping, it's the psychology of selling gas and pay. There's cost in every business. That bullshit job that you hate, you usually have transportation fees too to that. You have train costs. You have gas fees. Let's talk about what I'm looking for. I'm looking for what I love. Stuffed animals, nostalgia, mugs, video games, pop culture, fictional characters, Popeye, Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Betty Boop, and trading cards. There's one thing that you're like, if you see this, absolutely just buy it in odds or in your favor. What would that be? T-shirts that have like pop culture, like NASCAR, Super Bowl, Popeye the Sailor Man, like anything that's like a dollar and under that's pop culture is always great. Trucker hats, hats have exploded. A lot of that thrift store Brooklyn hipster, like Om Cool, like let me go pay $88 for an original Van Halen t-shirt, that shit crushes. What's the energy you look for when you fall up to a house? I'm not overly worried about energy. When I'm garage-sailing, I'm worried about fucking executing. There it is. Ranger's jersey. Trash talk, I see a ranger's jersey. Good morning. Hi, good morning. $30, Jesus fucking Christ. I mean this woman thinks she's running a fucking boutique. Have a great day. I mean I was fucking rip off city. I thought the ranger's jersey was gonna be a dollar. She wanted fucking 30 bucks for a kid's henrik. That's more than it is in the fucking store. King Henry's fucking retired lady. Jesus Christ. Here we go. Let's see what happens here. I like the way this looks. You don't have any Pokemon cards, do you? Um, we have Pokemon cards. I don't think that there are any splinter ones. Okay, thank you. Well, poor games are sometimes good, but older stuff, seeing any of that here. How much are these? I don't know. I... What you offer? Yeah. I genuinely don't know. Okay. $5? $3? $3. $3. Thank you so much. Thank you. Silence is always a negotiation. I'm gonna count that as $2 negotiated for the charity, so... And we are off. Some old Pokemon cards. I have no idea. I'm actually not educated enough on Pokemon. To know if I did well here or not, but we're about to find out. Alright, we're off trash talk. A nice little stack of Pokemon cards with three bucks. We'll see the comments if this did. This might be a decent one. One more by yourself. I'm gonna come and... I'm gonna put the camera. Yo, yeah, for sure. Oh boy. Oh boy. Filming. No video games? Nope. Oh, let's go over here. How are you? Have the best day. Hello, my friend. See how much they want is an eBay. How much that is? Yeah, check it out. 1999. Team collectible trucks. I think this is it, right? The Yankees? Yeah, that's the one. How much they were? 15 bucks. 15? 15. No, you got the wrong information. Well, no, 15 for the Yankees. Not for all. Oh, just for one truck. Just for one. Oh, oh. You feel better now, right? He was worried, Nima. You were worried, right? How much are you gonna sell it for? $400. Good luck to you, my friend. I wish you well. I'm gonna get away with three. How's that? I'll let them know. 300, everyone. We'll let them know. All right, bro. Is that Pikachu? It really looks like Pikachu. Do you have any idea what that is? It's a Pokemon. It is a Pokemon, right? How much is this? Two bucks. Would you take a buck? Yeah, we'd take a buck. Fair enough. $100 for charity. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Okay, I just might have picked up the Holy Grail. Sitting on this little table. Hand-made Pokemon. This kind of unique stuff is pretty amazing. Hand-made, rare, vintage, authentic, 30 bucks. These are fun because you can't price them. They're handmade. Right. So this is just super unique. Like somebody just falls in love with it with a good photo. And now you sell it for 30 bucks because you can't price it. Instagram, what is good? I fucking picked up a gangster item. Hand-made Pikachu. Little fucking glass. Okay. Oh, it's not a Pikachu? What's everyone saying? I got it. It's Eevee. I got it. It's Eevee. I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm fucking 47. I was too old when I fucking hit hard. I guess that makes it 25 bucks. All right, we're focused. This is my next hard director. All right, let's do it. 50 cents for an old Boy Scout canteen. Canteen. Canteen, that's cool. 50 cents. I'll have to take that. Let's see. I got a Boy Scouts canteen for $50. Like, I believe in this shit. Like, this feels at least 10, but I'll do my homework. I got to go to Google. We'll search it anytime you're doing 50 cents. Like, you're in a fucking game. Oh, there's an estate sale. Get in here. Wait a minute. How much is this mug? Whatever she says. What are you filming this? You got it. Wow. Who are you? My name's Gary. Yeah, but what are you? I'm an entrepreneur. Nothing great. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm an entrepreneur. Nothing great. Have the best day. Say, well, all right, this is huge. Nima, mug life, motherfucker, mug life, and the one that I'm most excited about. Starbucks mugs. And guess which one I got? What?

How much is it worth? I looked it up and it said that exact number. But did you look it up in listed price or completed sold price? Because what people get confused on is they see what it's listed for, but that doesn't mean that it actually sold for that. Okay. What about $86? Just give me it for $5. All right, so we got $81 off the board already. No, it's fine. $20. What about $3? $3 is huge money. No, it's not. Just give me $5. Just give me $5. Fine, fine.

It's only $36 for this treasure. This is E6. By the way, this is how I wrote $36 when I was a kid too and it worked out for me. A good feeling that this is going to work out just nice for you. Okay. Make sure you don't listen to the system, okay? $36. Do not listen to the system. This E6, brother, is the best thing I've seen all day. Can you at least just give me $36 for that? Probably not.
