Listen to me. Make content. SEO is good. Page one is better than page two. But right now what you have is you. Sometimes you have money, sometimes you have people, sometimes you have you. Right now you have you. Right. Make f***ing content. The game is about and, not or. And. Boring content, entertaining content. Left field content, new tax law. Yes, yes, yes, and, and, and. Every platform, TikTok, LinkedIn, Instagram. This is a f***ing gold rush of opportunity. These platforms are free. You said get on TikTok in 2019 and I did and it was blowing up. At the time, you know, I'm a single mom and it just was kind of overwhelming. I watched social dilemma. I got freaked out about the big app and I literally deactivated, deleted the whole thing. I had a video. Let's let's let's let's even, you know, because I want to bring a lot of value to everybody who's watching the. This is why I hate when the world sells fear. Yeah. Right. You watch a documentary on Netflix. The documentary's full objective is to scare people about the downside of social networks or technology. There's always downside. There's downside of automobiles. When auto me when cars were invented, people could drink alcohol, drive a car and kill someone. That didn't happen when we had horses. But it doesn't mean that that's the problem. And like, like just I'm sorry to jump in, but it's a big opportunity to help a lot of people. Don't don't let the world scare you. You were building. You were following somebody who was selling love and optimism and practicality. And that was leading to good. Then you consume something that was selling fear for no f***ing reason. And it threw you off. Keep going. Okay. The question is, so now I've got this business. I mean, I read your recent book. I listened to it on audio. I'm like, okay, I'm promoting my my flowers. I need to be on all these different networks, but I'm also promoting my art. Now I'm taking an extra 10 to 12 hours a week going live, which isn't even enough. I need to be going live more. I don't know how to balance it all. I'm a single. You're balancing it. You're balancing it. The reason you don't know how to balance it is because you're judging yourself. Good news. You're f***ing balancing it. Thank you. The end. Thank you. Why are you beating yourself up? What is balance? Who the f***ing, where is this king or queen of balance? Where is this Lord of balance that everybody's been telling me about? Who the f*** is the king of balance? Yeah, I want to be the queen of balance. And it's hard. You're it's no, it's actually easy. You are the queen of balance. Let me show you how to do it. You, Queen Sasha, the queen of balance have decided right here this morning at 907 Eastern that you were good at balance, that you're balancing it. You've decided. Thank you. No, not not thank you, not me telling you. You realize what I'm actually saying. I'm not trying to be nice to you. I'm not trying to be kind to you. I'm trying to get you to wake up that there is no such thing and either you decide you are balancing it or you decided you're not balancing it. 99% of the people that are watching T with Gary V right now have decided they're not balancing it because most of the people in the world live in a place of the reason you were susceptible to that documentary is because most people are prepared to be scared. Yeah, I live in a place of love. I live in a place of love now. Love is different. Love is amazing. I'm talking about fear. Oh, I know. I know because I've been there. Correct. So very simply, you are balancing it. Who gets to decide you're trying your best. You're doing the flower thing. You're doing the watercoloring thing. You're a single mom and doing that thing. You're fucking living. I guess I like, okay, the fear is that I'm taking away from my flower business and that is my bread and butter. So is it your bread and butter because I hear that you're starting to make money on your art online. I think the earning potential online is going to be a lot higher than what it is in my flower shop. So it sounds like you're investing. So keep going. Yes, I'm investing. I'm investing. Yes. No, that's it. And by the way, let's make up scenarios. And then January 19th comes and for some reason, the US Bands TikTok, well, then you'll adjust and then Instagram will have a lot. Like, everything is manageable. Yes, yes. And I walked to you talk about that too because I was like, what if it does disappear and you really brought just it's okay. It's okay if it does and things are okay. Yeah, it's called fucking life. Shit's gonna fucking happen. Somebody is going to wake up today as a seven year old and have their father have a heart attack and change the course of their life. That will happen today. Yeah, I don't understand how people are confused out here. Yeah, we we are all collectively capable of dealing with shit. Our great grandparents laugh. Our great, great grandparents are watching us in heaven and saying these fucking pusses, these fucking pusses, the fuck are they crying about? We had fucking famine. We had fucking world wars. We didn't have shit. The fuck are these kids crying about? Well, I get that. You know, I have a six month younger cousin who passed away from cancer about five years ago and it's like, that's a big wake up call. That's my baby cousin. If you have a cousin who had this tragic event happen, that should absolutely not allow you to be concerned about what you're worried about. Totally. Right? Like, yeah, what's gonna happen? Let's play role play. You're gonna spend too much time in your art and the flower shop is gonna be down 18%. Who gives a fuck? Thank you. As soon as that happens, if that goes on for six months and you're like, oh fuck, the flower shop is down 16%, well, then you can fucking adjust. Yeah. And go back to spending more time on the fucking flower shop. Okay, that brings a lot of peace to my heart. Thank you. Well, good. Good. You needed to hear that. Have the best day. Right, Dustin? Our fucking great, great grandparents are chilling in heaven right now. And they're just like, what the fuck's the matter with these people? They're like, they're, we have anxiety over dumb shit. Like, some girl doesn't like you. Who gives a fuck? There's four billion other girls. The fuck. Who's up now? Hi. I'm doing it by myself. I did listen to your videos forever ago. And so I decided I was just gonna start a brand talk on social media. It took off. I like have coined the term vegan silk on YouTube. It's not using Jesus on Google. So I'm number one for that. That's my term. That's my brand. I have silk, real silk goodies. And it's just all about real silk, like quality silk, either whether it be vegan or real, right? Because if you search it on the internet, you end up with satin. That's all well and good. I've been doing it by myself now for two years. And now I'm pregnant and it's hard to put out congratulations with everything. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The fuck are we talking about business when you have this incredible moment in your life? Congratulations. Baby, baby, baby, you're not dropping your other baby. Your, your baby business is chilling while you're baking the greatest thing that ever happened to your life. I promise you your business will be there. This is everybody's scared, darling. Listen to me, Mia. Everyone, you like that dust? Okay. Thank you, Dustin. Damn, Dustin gave me, Dustin doesn't do that. I very, Dustin liked maybe it's because he's eating the bagel. Dustin's very excited about this bagel. Mia, listen to me. Your business is not going anywhere. This is what everybody's scared of. They're like, damn, the baby's going to come. I'm going to be my eye off the other business. And when I come back to it, it's dead. If you were good enough to get it to this point, you're going to be good enough to do it again. You're stressing. You're being scared. Instead of focusing on the real shit, which is you have a fucking miracle. A human is growing inside of you right now. Mia, a fucking human being is growing inside of you. It's cool. No, it's better than cool. It is the fucking actual best. There is nothing on earth. There's no entrepreneur better than mother. Mother number one, entrepreneur number two, you're about to be that. And you're worried about some dumb ass silk fucking robes. Get the fuck out of here. But like, I still have another person to take care of. So this is like, this is our whole thing, which we do. My other little person helps me with the business now. I have making a new one. How do you I feel like it's time to grow the business so it's not just me and I believe in organic because at this point I tried. I tried to get somebody to help with the shipping. I shouldn't have outsourced. I tried to get somebody to help with the marketing. My organic performs 10,000 times better than any marketing. I just talked to somebody who said SEO is best because I sense I'm on page two of a lot of things. It's better to be on page one. And that's where I need to focus. But I genuinely just don't know who to hire. Listen to me make content. SEO is good. Page one is better than page two. But right now what you have is you. Sometimes you have money. Sometimes you have people. Sometimes you have you. Right now you have you. Right. Make fucking content. Okay, so more. Okay, so if that's the case, then if I do expand, it should be somebody else to assist me with making content so I could just stay focused. On what? On the business. Because like I said, it's I have a ton of content. Listen to me. Listen to me. What if you thought about this being successful in a 30 year window instead of a 30 week window? What if I said to you this, think about this in 30 years of like slowly day by day, brick by brick, it getting better versus you're going to fucking crush it and sell the business and buy an island. You do know that this perspective is what fucks up everybody. Okay. You don't understand how remarkable what you've already pulled off. You're already further along than most. You got something. But if you just listen, you're in a chapter in your life. Give yourself some grace, girl. Okay, give yourself some grace. There's different priorities. There's different seasons in life. How old are you? There you go. You're a baby. Okay, you are. I was 34 until I left my dad's liquor store. All this Gary Vee shit didn't even start until I was 35. Start. You got time. What you need to focus on is stay healthy so this baby comes out right? That's what you should be thinking about. Enjoy the fucking holidays. Listen, you know I love a good hustle and build your shit. It's just like just don't let anything get too crazy. Like, like fucking get it all settled. Like it's not going anywhere. Well, so that's the thing that I think that I was thinking about the most. Like, because I'm doing so much, I already have like thousands of customers. So my thing is I don't want like they get kind of left when I have bad weeks or tired weeks. They get left and I don't know. I promise you your customers biggest thing in their life is not your fucking silk fucking shit. Humility. But it no, no, no, I'm saying but a lot of people have allergy issues. That's why. So listen, I'm you by the way, that's beautiful and I'm I fuck with that. I love that you've got that element. But I promise you if you have a bad week, your customers are going to be okay. It's unlikely they even thought about you. Well, they email. Listen, I get it, but not all fucking 15,000 of them or four thousand or two thousand. Like, I'm telling you, you're just putting too much pressure on your chest. I can smell it from the screen and just if it's cold, that's okay. Yeah, because what about when, you know, again, I don't know how this pregnancy has been for you, but like some days you're not feeling well or some days you're tired. I've been sleeping like if I sit down baby, good. Slow. Okay. If you want to sleep between now and January 1st, 2026, and then hit the ground running and listen to me, if you went to sleep right now, close your eyes and went and slept and you woke up and it's January 1st, 2026. And you're like, yo, what the fuck? And the business was slow and what the fuck you need to resuscitate it. You've got the fire in your belly to have that shit proper by March. So what the fuck are we talking about? Yeah, I will. So what are we talking about? Okay, we're talking about what everybody's struggling with it just for some reason, we all just decided to beat ourselves up instead of loving ourselves for what we are doing. Baby, you're fucking going harder as a pregnant woman at 35 than 90% of 23 year old dudes complaining about dumb shit. The fuck are we talking about? I want to be a good mom. Well, if you want to be a good mom, then you should ask that question, not how to fucking do SEO. I know, but my kid like she loves this whole thing. She does your shoulder. By the way, by the way, and so by the way, no, you're not dropping you've already shown her. Why do you think she loves it? She looks up to you and she sees you doing it. You are winning. Okay, baby, you're just beating yourself up for no fucking reason. Okay, you need to give yourself grace. People need to fucking I'm doing this for you and every all 5000 people that are watching right now, we need to love ourselves more. I got it. I know I know you got it because you're already doing it. You just decided to look at the half glass full versus the half glass. You look at empty instead of full. Not really. I just didn't want to let like, I feel like since I started the problem because of my child and I'm helping other people who have asthmatic children that can stop coughing at night. I can't let anybody down. I don't want to let down my baby. I don't want to let down the new person and I don't want to let down these moms and people who are let me tell you the best. Let me tell you the best way. Let me let me give you the fastest path to letting everybody down, putting so much pressure on yourself to not letting anybody down that you burn out and you do nothing. That's where I'm at right now. No shit. Okay. Well, thank you. As someone who doesn't want to let anybody down either. I focus on me being good and grounded first. How the fuck am I going to help everybody if I'm not good? Yeah. How do I do that by saying I'm just a human and I'm just trying I'm flawed. I got problems. I got mistakes. I'm just a human, but I'm trying out here. Okay. Cool things. Thank you. You're welcome. So I'm 23. I long story short, I got an entrepreneurship about two years ago. I ran a pretty high level business, but I went bankrupt and now I'm kind of just stuck in that phase of like, you ran a high level business, but it went bankrupt. Did you learn from the missteps? Yes. I bad business partners. I was young and experienced and I failed a lot, but I'm carrying that as motivation into my next. It's great. I mean, given that you're this young and you've already learned those lessons, it's a real fucking back to the dude who's like, how do I stop? How do I stop sucking in life? Some people with a bankruptcy decide that they suck. You have decided it's a learning experience. I was young. Let me take that L. I learned I'm still young as shit. Let me build from here and I'm fucking proud of you for that, brother. Thank you. I appreciate it. And the big part from me right now is I've kind of been in this gray area for the past year and a half, traveled the whole nation trying to find my answers on what's next. And I think I finally have the really good idea I want, but I'm not financially heavy and I'm kind of lost on like, where do I go for the capital and like, what's the best way to find these business partners that I can actually trust? I mean, the capital high net worth individuals is always a great place to go. And so it's like literally like Googling or chat, you'd be seeing like 1000 richest people in Utah and then sending respectful messages to them on LinkedIn. And all you need to do is go one of 180 or 250 or seven people always say like, what do I do? I'm like, reach out to people. The then they're like, well, I have and I'm like, well, how many and they're like seven. I'm like, no, no, 7000. Like if you want to live a 1% life, like you want to live a 1% life, right? You want to have your own business and be successful. That's a 1% life. Yeah. If you're only willing to take seven nos via email, then you don't have the stomach for a 1% life. If you're willing to sit down and eat shit for the entire month of January, because for 14 hours a day, you're emailing every fucking person that you could possibly find that has money anywhere in the world because you're doing the research and you're sending the emails and you're connecting on LinkedIn and you're you're just being respectful and doing it the right way and not do spamming and then following back up a month later. So you're not desperate like looking for one person to say yes to start the process. Well, then now you're living a 1% life. Okay. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. It does. You know, you're not going to know if they're trustworthy. The good news is you're not looking for partners. You're looking for investors. So does that make sense? Yeah, no, it doesn't. And what's my first company? I brought in business partners because I Real quick, real quick. Retro Boom 89 says, Why does it have to be on LinkedIn? It doesn't. But LinkedIn is such a professional place that a lot of high net worth individuals are going to respond better to a LinkedIn message than they are on email where they get a lot of spam or a fucking DM on Instagram. Like, you know, you got to keep those things in mind. And then last last question for you, I know a lot of people want to come up. No, my my biggest challenge I have been facing though is not getting burned out after failure because, you know, failure is inevitable in the part of entrepreneurship. But I cannot burn out. I could just tell by your energy. Don't let the fucking world sell you on this burnt out shit burnt out is different than took a gut punch getting back up slowly. Like, everyone, this is the problem with everyone in today's society pushing on the kids. You're burnt out. You're depressed. Like, we used to call this 20 years ago, like sluggish, or like a fucked up day. You know, that video that's viral that like shows the guy walking into the fucking like the side of the door and it's like, if you were born in the 70s, you're like, you don't even read in the 80s like in the 90s like and then like, there's a there. I hate that because I believe in fucking Gen Z and Gen Alpha the most. But what they have and I feel bad for them, they bought into this bullshit. But you're not burnt out. You're fucking on five. You fucking it's fucking 733 in the morning in Utah. And you're on the fucking tea with Gary Vee show. Fucking talking about building your future. You're fucking go getter and ambitious and a winner. But this fucking society has fucking sold you on how do I deal with burnt out? It's not burnt out. You fucking took a micro L and you're fucking like, I don't know. You got punched in the face. You chip the tooth. You got a little blood. You're going to stop bleeding. You're going to fix your tooth and you're going to go back out there. You understand? You're not fucking burnt out. Of course you're fired up because a fucking grown ass man is telling you your face. Stop listening to the fucking bullshit of society. Trying to tell you you're burnt out. You're not fucking burnt out. That's great. You think you're you think you're burnt out? I think I don't think I am. But like I don't think that you're next. You're not delusional. Stop listening to fucking losers trying to make you lose. I've never told anybody you're burnt out. You know those people that are burnt out philosophical fuckers who can't do shit. You know what misery loves company is? Yeah, that's what the fuck is going on. So I just got to block them out. Block out everybody. Block out people like me too. Block me the fuck out who's gassing you up. Block out every fucking person on earth. Perfect. You understand? I do. Listen to everybody but hear no one. Right. Because you got to stay humble. You got to check yourself. You don't want to become delusional. But don't let everybody or anybody excuse me fucking dictate your soul. Burnt out. It's fucking 733 in the morning in Utah. This man is showered with a fucking coat and hat on fucking asking business questions on the fucking live stream on an app that he probably had download for the first time. Bro, you're a winner. I guess my goal is to win even more. You know, good. But let me tell you how to win even more. Fall in love with trying to win versus winning. Okay. That's a good perspective. You understand? Yeah. Fall in love with the fact that you're trying and you're hungry and you're competing and you're in the fucking arena not sitting around saying you're burnt out, everyone. You're in the fucking arena, bro. I'm pumped up now. I'm ready to work. I feel like you got me out of the hole. Yeah. Yeah, dude. It's because you weren't even in the hole. This is the fucking problem with society right now. Trying to tell everybody it's all bad. It's all fucking good. Yeah. Yeah. It's perspective. It really is. Bro, life is only perspective. There is nothing besides your perspective. There is nothing else. There's nothing else. It's all fake. I'll tell you why. Is 150,000 a year a lot of money or a little money? Perspective. Perspective. Yeah. Go ahead. I want to fill you in a little bit with what I do. I live in a small town in middle Tennessee. The population here is about 25,000 people. The US census says that 25% of the community here is Hispanic, which I am a member of. So 25% of the 25,000 people are Hispanic in this town in Tennessee. Go. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And so I started a page called Chevalville in Spanish, which is the town that I live in. Love it. So I update the community about anything that's going on. We've been able to establish relationships with a lot of the schools, the nonprofit organizations and all this, whatever is going on here. So I then took over a local networking group that had been here for the last 15 to 10 years. The problem is that yesterday we were highlighting one of the Hispanic businesses for the first time. We decided to do it in Spanish. And I've just been getting kind of some negative feedback on that. I don't know if it's because... That you didn't... That it wasn't in English? Well, just a video podcast portion of it, but we had an interpreter there. I don't know if these people were... I don't know how to take it. I got some phone calls. What? Just people crying like, yo, speak English. It's fucking America. Some dumb shit like that? No. I mean, we... It was like... I don't know. It was confusing phone calls about... They said they didn't like it at first, but they ended up saying they did. And so I didn't know how to feel about that. You know, like... How about not giving a fuck? Yeah. How about that feeling? Okay. How about taking it in and giving it thought? And if it happens seven or eight more times, maybe adjusting or maybe using AI to translate from into every language? But I think the first... The first piece of advice is how about not giving a fuck? Next time you can do it in English. The next time you can do it in Korean, I don't fucking know. Okay. Like, what are they saying? They're going to beat you up or they're not going to give you money or like, what are we... Like... No, sir. I think it's more of just... Maybe it's not something that they're into, you know? But it's the first time we've ever... Bro, 99% of people aren't into anything, meaning like the biggest companies in the world don't have all eight billion people giving a shit about. Did you feel good about it? Yeah, I loved it. So do it again. Okay. So I guess the next question would be how can I... Because right now, the local Chamber of Commerce has kind of moved their date to the same date that we're doing our meeting. So a lot of our members have gone... So change your date. Okay. How can I go about... What are you romantic about the date for? You mean the second Tuesday of every month? No, I'm not. Great. How can I... If you're the second Tuesday of every month and somebody bigger or somebody that also has attention that fucks you up, does it... You're allowed to make it Thursday of every month. Okay. How do I go about reaching a younger demographic? Like maybe... Tiktoks. Okay. Yeah, those 25 to 30 years... You read the fucking... Bro, you read the fucking book three times. What the fuck are you asking me that for? I'm sorry. I just... I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm fucking with you. Bro, I love you. Listen to me. Put your fucking two index fingers directly in your ear and go fucking execute. Okay. Got it? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Have the best day. I'm a devout follower. I listen to all your content. Thank you. And I've been posting content online. So I'm an accountant. I used to work in corporate America, the chief financial officer of a $50 million company. I live in corporate America, have my own accounting practice. Congrats. And thank you. I have a six month old buying a house and I want to start crushing more online. Okay. So I've been taking advice, posting content. A couple of my videos took off, but they're comedy sketches. Okay. I got like a million impressions on LinkedIn this week, or actually like two million, but I'm not getting to my target audience. Well, that's because that's... Are you making content that would hit your target audience? So it's corporate America, talking about brother, are you making content that has your information on it as well? Like, there's a part for you to put in the copy of your comedy skit. You could put PS. This is a comedy skit, but I'm actually a former Fortune 500 CFO with my own practice. If you have any interest in working with me, here's my email. Should I push the sales part on all the videos? You're allowed to do both. You're allowed to do both. Right? I called out the guy on TikTok that said, Hey, Gary Vee, why are you shilling mugs? You're always selling something. In fact, as you know, because you're a devout follower, 99% of my content, 99.5% of my content has no selling in it. But if I'm on a live shopping platform like I am right now, I'm going to put that up. And I think people should buy this mug instead of a crappier other mug. That's just what I believe because Vee Friends is the next Pokemon. At least that's what my mom says. So you have to understand, like there's you're allowed. Here's the funny thing about selling. You're allowed to sell. It's fucking America. On the other side, people are allowed to not buy. I never expect anybody to buy, but I'm always happy when they do. Does that make sense? Yeah. So of course, it's okay to sell. And some content like I just told you, you can have the content and the selling other content, you could just have the selling, you could literally make a video that might not get a million views, but it might get 100 views where you're like, Hey, this is what I do. I'd like to do business with you. But the good news, you get 100 views of that and you get three customers. That might be better than getting a million views of comedy with no customers. Yeah, both are allowed. The answer to your question is and and and and and and you're allowed to do comedy and you're allowed to have a very boring accounting video. You're allowed to make more content. This is fucking the best part of social. It's free. Okay, so my roadblock I've had was how do I make accounting not boring and you're saying you can't make accounting not boring. It's fucking boring. Yeah, that's okay. Like, like, sometimes I'm very serious. Sometimes I'm silly. Sometimes I'm ridiculous. Sometimes I'm stoic. Like, you're just allowed to like make accounting interesting. They make make you laugh. Like, but then you can come back on the next one and go very detailed and go into a very big nuance of what the new administration did with this tech steel. Don't try to make accounting cool. Just make all of it and let the chips fall. That's what I was doing. I was trying to make topics easy to understand and I felt like I was doing but that's okay to do both. I'm telling you that's okay to because you might have a viral video gets 17 million and you put the PS in there and you did get six clients. What you're missing out on which everyone gets fucked up on is the game is about and not or and boring content, entertaining content, left field content, new tax, yes, yes, yes, and and and every platform, TikTok, LinkedIn, Instagram. This is a fucking gold rush of opportunity. These platforms are free. Yeah, LinkedIn video has been going crazy. It's really a great opportunity and I appreciate you sharing more. I'm from Poland, but I created this motorbike rental app, you know, and we started in Indonesia. Basically, it works like Uber, Airbnb. We connect the motorbike owners with the clients like tourists, you know, very nice. Everything is done in the app. So we can book rental motorbike, like, like, like, you know, on the spot. I understand right now in this moment, you know. Yeah. So basically, I have a question like how to market like to tourists basically in Indonesia because I have like a problem in Indonesia. Yeah, for people that are going to Indonesia. Yeah, basically, how much how much how much organic social media content are you making on TikTok and Instagram for the business? A lot, but only in Indonesian language. Because like I understand. Yep, I understand. You've got to make good. I know we're going. Yeah, no, because because I thought that we'll have problem like with we're getting the partners to the app, you know, to getting the motorbike. But no, no, that's good. I'm glad that you did the Indonesia thing. But just like I told the gentleman earlier, it's an and not an or you've got to do it in Indonesia, but you've also got to do it in English and in Spanish. And you've got to do it all over the number one opportunity for startups to get customers by a country mile right now, Christoph is organic social media. It's not even close. Okay. So the content you're you just have to make more and with AI and with being in Indonesia and Poland, there's very good costs on labor and talent. You've got to make a bigger commitment to that because that's how you build brand and customers. Yeah, yeah. But you know, like I thought I can reach them with ads, like but basically when I'm targeting like different languages within a country, I basically also reach languages that are native to this country, like, you know, I understand. But but instead of running ads with creative that you're not sure is going to convert if you made organic creative and see if it actually index as well through the algorithm and then turn those videos into ads, you'll convert much better. The biggest issue with ads is people focus on the media when the reality is the variable of your success will not just be who you target, it will be what the message and the creative is. And now that organic social is a place where you get basically creative testing for free, you need to go all in on that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm telling you now everybody understands that social media ads are good. Now everybody stands that Google ads are good. But 20 years ago when I was yelling about Google ads or 25 years ago, people made fun of me. And 15 years ago when I said social media ads were good, people made fun of me. And now when I'm telling everybody, as a sophisticated startup like you have, you need to get serious about organic social creative, people are laughing because they don't think it's scalable. They don't think it's converting as well. They don't understand that it's building brand while testing creative that you can then use for performance. Yeah, you know, I want to start it like, you know, to creating content in English. You have to do that. Who the fuck? Yeah, go to Indonesia, rich fucking 20 year old kids. Yes, yeah. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, I just thought you know, yeah, no, I just thought it would be much easier to get customers only using no, I understand. And good news. Good news. Because because because I have a guy I have a guy from Indonesia who's creating content in Indonesia, but I'm doing like, you know, using the chat GPT, I'm you, I'm, I'm creating like, you know, all the scripts for him and record it. So with also, you know, you need more and I'm, but yeah, but I'm like a one man show, you know, I'm doing like everything that's I get it. I mean, but you want, you want to build a big business. I was a little patient said a little like you should. Yes, yes, yes. This is the thing, you know, patients like everybody, of course I get it. I'm doing it with my friends and she's less patients. That's right. By the way, whoever's the most patient wins the race. The tortoise beat the hair, brother. The tortoise, the fucking turtle beat the rabbit. Why do you think that story resonates and is such a legendary story? The fucking rabbit one, the radical rabbit rips beat the tolerant tortoise. Oh, excuse me, the verse. Thank you. The self aware hair lost the, the toddler. Oh, I like the tolerance one. Anyway, brother, that's it. Christoph happy holidays. All right. We got five minutes. Let's get one more in here.
