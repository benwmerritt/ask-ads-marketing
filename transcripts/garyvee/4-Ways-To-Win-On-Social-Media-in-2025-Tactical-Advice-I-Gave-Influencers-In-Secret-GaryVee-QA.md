Live social shopping, I could not push you more to get serious about affiliate and live selling. If there's any way you can get into that with what you do, you should. Like if you're a magician, create some deck of cards and sell that. You know, like it is a big thing that you should start learning. The other by far biggest mistake most of you are making is you're not on enough platforms. It's crazy. This whole like just locked into TikTok Instagram thing is killing people. Like Facebook's a monster. Most of you don't post there every day. It's 100% that someone who does something similar than you is gonna pop off way more than you next year. That's 100%. You can't spend a second on that. That's one. Two, challenging yourself to do different shit. The biggest thing that catches so many people here up is they're not doing different shit. They like do dance, they do libation, they do, you know, get ready with me. They get whatever you do. You get caught because at some point it becomes mundane. And so like not having this self-esteem or the confidence to try completely different shit because you're scared it's gonna underperform to what you're used to is the hidden poison for so many in here. Live social shopping. I could not push you more to get serious about affiliate and live selling. Like if there's any way you can get into that with what you do, you should. Like if you're a magician, create some fucking deck of cards and sell that shit on. You know, like it is a big thing that you should start learning because it's gonna eat up a lot of oxygen. The other by far biggest mistake most of you are making is you're not on enough platforms. It's crazy. Like you should be on seven platforms. Real talk. Like it's just this whole like just locked into TikTok, Instagram thing is killing people. Like Facebook's a monster. Most of you don't post there every day. You know what I mean? Snapchat spotlight is like free opportunity because no one's posting there and there's plenty of attention. The same attention that sits on TikTok and Instagram. Those are the big things that stand out for me for sure. But I think keeping the noise out and not letting what happens to this crew always happen, which is when you're plateauing or when you're not growing and all that stuff, it fucks you up and it just can't. Like because if it does then it's over anyway. Understanding trends like people don't follow people anymore. Like content comes to you now. So like real fucking talk. I don't know if I've really paid attention to my following account for a year now. Like I'm aware of it. I see it when I'm in my shit, but it doesn't even like really register, right? And then again, like when I walked into brand deals, like it's gonna get harder, not easier-ish. Meaning it's like this crazy thing. More brands wanna do more influencer work than ever, but there's more influencers than ever and virtual influencers are coming. And so these companies are gonna create replicas of you. Like when I say you, I just mean not like you directly. Like they're just gonna make like funny people and attractive people and black and white and Hispanic. In like years ago, I would talk to Hollywood like this and be like the influencers are coming and they'd be like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then the influencers came. Now I talk to influencers and I'm like, the virtual influencers are coming and they're really coming. And that they're gonna put money behind. Like it's a lot better for new era to create an influencer they own than rent you for a couple posts. So don't let that fuck you up because that's already, that's done. That's going to happen. You just need to be as good as you can be for you. Does that make sense? Like do not worry about competition. They're humans, each other, and definitely not the virtual ones because they're gonna keep coming and coming. And you're gonna wake up in five years and there's gonna be, there's eight billion people on earth. There'll be more than eight billion virtual influencers on social in a decade. Yeah, and what does that gonna mean? It's gonna mean that you might not get paid as much. It's called supply and demand. So you need to go hard during this era and I highly recommend you add live shopping to your repertoire. Highly. You know, some people won't translate into that genre as well. There's certain reasons why big actors or big names never do SNL. They can't do improv. They can win an Academy Award, but they can't do improv. Some of you can amass 10 million followers really making a skit, but you might not be good at selling shit. That's okay, but you need to find out if you can. Because if you can, it will be your hedge against what I'm talking to you about. Make sense? Is that only on TikTok? Like selling nine years? No, TikTok is leading. Whatnot is doing very well. That's a one-off app that's just live social shopping, but everyone's coming. Twitter's gonna roll out something next year. Meta is not gonna sit and let TikTok win this. So I don't know anything, but I promise you that Instagram and Facebook next year will be like announcing live shopping. You know, like it's like, I just can't see how, it's too important it's happening. In fact, I wonder if Facebook will buy whatnot, just like speed it up. I don't know, but I expect by this time next year, every platform's playing with it. It's that important. So I'm from live shopping. Like Marathon's for tart cosmetics. We did put so much time into live shopping like a year and a half ago. And I don't really see them doing it anymore. I don't see them doing that much anymore, but like the GMB from live shopping and my friends at the Ordinary also do live shopping so low right now. Like you could spend six hours live and make like a couple hundred dollars or something. Yeah. And is it like, if you already know how to do it, I'm running a new brand now, but it's like, our startup, if you already know how to do it, do you think it's worth it to be on the platform and dedicate time alive and you know that the money's not there yet? Or should we just like pull it off until you get it? What you just said in a different way is somebody saying like, I've tried to be an influencer and I haven't. I wanna break it down though. I did $41,000 in sales in an hour two nights ago. Right? So I think that it's just cause you guys didn't do it well. Right? Like for example, if you're doing tart cosmetics and you don't have a unique product for that live shopping, which was exclusive to that live shopping and you know, that becomes a thing. I see that you did. Then it becomes, how was it produced? Right? What was the call to actions? Who was the hosts? The hosts back like I just said, some people here might not be good at it. And comma, to your point, a year and a half ago, it was not where it is right now. Right? So like in that 18 months, there's just been so much more growth in demand. So many more people have put their credit cards in. So many more people buy now. The algorithm 18 months ago did not put as much live shopping into the For You page. Now, anybody that goes on live shopping is getting a huge boost. So there's like 13 variables I'd have to look at that show 18 months ago to understand why it happened. No, I guess, I was just interested to see what was happening. Who are seeing it? Like cause if they were saying the same, like a year ago, it's like, oh, live shopping now I wouldn't get on right now. But it wasn't like there, at least for our product and like our demo, like it wasn't there yet, which I'm assuming you're seeing now just to be possible that it is actually. Even 18 months ago, it was a game of haves and have nots. Again, I'd have to look at what y'all did. But it's the same old thing. Like if you're not, like I think everybody here should become a basketball player. Like right, it's the best business in the world. Like literally, Wemby's gonna make a billion dollars being a basketball player. But most of us aren't capable of it. And so like, I think all of you should do live shopping, but you can imagine if you're not good at it, it won't go. So there was just so many things from that, you know, but there are people making millions of dollars a month. So that's just real data. What are like best practices? Like I said earlier, people don't go on social for the sake of getting sold, right? And it's like, anytime I feel like I'm getting sort of quick to slide that out. So they have like what, how do you get people to go there? They only want to go to buy. This was a big distinction I said a long time ago that I still believe, which is people don't want to be sold when you guys are being tricky about it. Right? Like when you're trying to be clever, I think people are comfortable if you're like upfront. Like you're fucking live and you're like on QVC, you're like, yo, I'm selling shit. Like, you know what I mean? Like it's nobody's getting tricked. If they don't want, you know what I mean? So I think what we see is that when people are trying to be sneaky about it, like here's my free white paper on how to become a creator and you click it and then it's like put in your email and you get one page free, but then give us $99 to get the rest of the ebook. Then you're like, fuck you. But if that person was like, my ebook's 99 bucks to be a creator, that converts better. So I think it's just about clarity as a best practice. So off we're on Connect. Would the engagement be in, like would that be the factor of conversation? Use. Your reach will be the first lever. So how large you can help distribute the brand itself will be the most important thing. Now they're measuring above and beyond reach. How valuable are those reach? Is it just it came on someone's screen or did someone actually consume it? And that's how they're measuring it. Is the measurement how people are being paid? Like would a brand pay a creator? You'll get paid more. You mean performance? Yes. You'll be paid more. It depends. It depends. At the end of the day, any negotiation in life is completely subjective. So for example, the reason I've never done a single deal ever is the halo effect of what I'm actually doing. I can't capture. Right? If someone's like, well, this is how many followers you have, Gary, and this is how many views you have. I'm like, cool, but like my influence over the entire ecosystem is so profound that for me, I have to think of it from like a name, image and likeness standpoint. And then that becomes complete error compared to what Peter's talking about, which is pure math. And then as you all know, now more things are going into affiliate and live shopping where that's pure performance. And you have to decide that. If you're gonna be on live for an hour selling stuff and you're only getting $13 a unit for the thing you're selling, but what about all the brand halo effect that comes along with the creative? So these are just all things. But this all happens while there's also a million of you being born at every hour. And virtual influencers are coming and they're not even human beings and they're gonna eat your food too. So that's all real shit. How do you balance? So my social media is a pipeline for business as well. So how do you balance reach and exposure versus it becoming a source of lead gem? Well, the creative becomes that variable, right? So the way I think about that is most of the stuff I do, 99% of it is back to 10 years ago when I talked about jab, jab, jab, right hook. 99% of it is I just wanna create value to build brand. When I go for conversion, it never does as well as the other stuff. When I'm like, buy this book, buy this hoodie, that never gets the same reach because people don't wanna be sold to. Right? And there's creative ways to do it. And like for me, like green screening, blog posts, I write about things that like have done better because the format's better. But you can't dwell on it not performing as well in reach when you're trying to convert because by nature it won't. And we're always challenging ourselves to find creative ways to hopefully make that happen. But that's, you know, it's like, what's the purpose? If you're in brand building mode, you wanna get as much read, reach. But if you're in sales mode in a B2B environment, you may only need one person to convert to make it worth it, you know? So I just gradually dropped my school right now. I wanted to know, I created content before I started my acting journey. I wanted to know how do I share my acting journey without overexposing myself? Cause I noticed like some of the actors I truly love, a lot of them aren't on social media. And it's like a mystique type of thing. I was wondering like, how do you go about that? And also, you know, just keep that self-esteem going without. Those are two separate questions. So the first one, I walk down the street and 98% of people have no idea who the fuck I am. Many people in this room have no idea who the fuck 80% of the other people in this room are. I promise you, my guy, you will not be overexposed. This concept of overexposure is a 1980s television thing, like Madonna, Michael Jackson. Literally most of you don't know who the rest of the people in this room are, yet many people know who these people are, right? So overexposure is a farce of a day that's long ago that Hollywood wants to keep around cause they trade on it. It's straight, the boogeyman bullshit. It's Santa Claus. There is no overexposure. Literally, Sabrina Carpenter could walk into this office and 35% of this office has no idea who the fuck she is. You know, insane that is. That's the world we live in now. It's mass fragmentation. So don't worry about overexposure. It's just not real. You know, I don't know the journeys of your favorite actors. They just might have gone up the acting track the whole time. But I also know that King Batch used Vine to get on every Netflix movie I see him on. Like, there's different ways to go about it. As far as self-esteem, I just don't know why anyone values somebody else's opinion about their life. I really don't, I just do not know. The second you realize that is the second you have self-esteem. Like, I just don't know why you would care what I think about you. I don't know you. I'm being honest. I don't even care what my parents think about me because I know there's many things they don't know about me. And I'm close as shit to my parents. The only person in the world that knows you is you. No matter how close you are to your spouse, your partner, your parents, your sibling, all of you right now can think of the single person you're most close to in the world and you know how much they don't know about you actually. Right? So that's fucking self-esteem to me. That's it in a wrap. Like, self-esteem's an inside game but it really is based on outside forces. Right? You're worried about what people think about, you know, especially a kid like you if you're going up a drometer. Like, I'm sure for a while you're like, I'm gonna be a big actor. I'm gonna, right? And so you start worrying about what people think because you aren't yet. But you're trying. What are they doing? I always think about this like sports. If athletes who are on the court, when they get, like, when the Knicks have a 13-0 run, the other, the way team has a 13-0 run and we call a time out and the whole garden boos the fuck out of the Knicks. If the Knicks players were like, and like, and had to go into locker room, like, they're not worried about me booing, I'm fucking eating a popcorn watching them. Everybody who's got opinions about you is eating fucking popcorn watching you. I believe it. Awesome. I gotta go. See ya, love ya. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
