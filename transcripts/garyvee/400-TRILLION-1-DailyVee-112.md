I feel like those guys are like slothed from Goonies. They're like, they're like, they're just like, they're like chained to this like weird part. Jake, Tom, do not come out of here. Hey you guys! What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? Can't believe it's that time of year already. Not for me. I'm usually three weeks early and then seven. I'll probably say happy holidays to you of February 29th. So be prepared. Yeah, it's really, it's, you know, it's actually, I work every day, but I actually starting Saturday actually do take two weeks with my family. So I'm very excited. Have you been good? Good. Sure, makes sense. Great. Well, why don't we get going? What can I help you with? You know, I think that I'm just, I know that the odds of being a human being are 400 trillion to one. And so it's not very difficult to get up in the morning when that's top of mind. I will always know where emerging attention is and I will never ever fear being a pioneer in setting up shop. I think I'm a, at some level, I actually think I'm in the real estate business. And that's how I built Wine Library and that's how I built my brand and that's how I built VaynerMedia and that's how I sell books and that's how everything I do is going to happen. Yeah, I'm not scared to lose it because I think I can gain it. And I do think, I think this interview is a lot of fun. I think the interview in 11 years after losing it all and then bringing it all back would be really fascinating. I think I do think battle scars are attractive. I do think adversity is, you know, listen, I like to tell a good story. I think story sell. And so, you know, what's greater than the climb from little, losing it all and then climbing back up? I mean, that is the apex of a story. I never say quit your job unless it's practical, right? Meaning if you can afford to, if you are in a place where, and when I say can you afford, I don't mean how much money you make. I mean, you know, like if you're 20 and you're willing to work and live in a basement with three of your buddies and eat $2 worth of food a day, then in theory you can if you choose to say that that's what makes you happiest, right? So, I would say, look, here's what I will say. I am absolutely affected heavily by the $400 trillion to one thing. It's real to me. I think that people may, you know, I don't know to be very honest with you. I don't know in how people, if they were practical, not emotional, not delusional, if they were practical and understood the $400 trillion to one, how they can't be on the offense, how they can't debate, oh my God, I won the ultimate lottery. Why don't I, why don't I maximize my happiness while I have my time on earth? My 17 goal is to tighten everything up, to be better at everything that's going, I had a very good year and the businesses are going well, my brand is, my brand and my content is going very well, my family is going well, my health is going well. So, I really want to have a, like, 20% of the baby fat in all of those directions to become more efficient, more successful in all those things. Alright, good to see you. Wow. You guys all signed? Yeah. Awesome. Hi. What up Facebook? Good morning. It's me, Gary. I don't do a lot of Facebook video direct, actually ever. Anyway, good morning. I Heart Radio, Z100, Elvis Durand, all you New York and New Jersey peeps, especially my age, know exactly what I'm talking about. Tune in right now, I should be on pretty shortly. Not exactly sure, but what time is it right now? What, do you guys, hey good morning. Hey, I'm, what time, I'm just, I gotta tell them what time I'm going on. Oh, in five minutes. Good, okay. Eight eleven in the morning, come check me now. Yeah. How are you Gary? I'm my friend, I'm promoting like crazy. We've got all sorts of people. Fantastic. We have a bone to pick with you. You do? Oh, yeah we do. Good. I didn't know. I like bones. When we leave, tell me what bone we're picking. Okay, are we going to do a good amount of call-in? Whatever you want to do. That's what I want to do. Whatever you want to do. It's good to see you. Whatever you want to do. We don't have any. We really have no plans on this show. We just go to the show and see whatever. No wonder you've been successful for so long. There's no plan. Well, that's, you know that's real, right? You know that's my entire thesis. That's the way I used to do tests in high school. Remember Scantrons? Yeah. No plan. B-C-A, B-C-A. I've been doing that for three minutes. So the answer is Saturday. I'm actually leaving in two days to Florida. Dropping off our kids and we're going to Antigua for five days. Lizzie and I off the grid phone and save the whole night. Wait, wait, you're going to be off the grid for five days? 100%. Is that possible? It happens. Every year that week and then we come home Christmas Eve and we spend the next seven or eight days in Naples, Florida with my loss. That's awesome. Yeah, it'll be great. You have a latte. I was like, that's a new move. Gary, it's so fantastic to have you here. You had this idea. Your parents had a wine store and you took it from a successful wine store into a massive online wine monster. That's right. Because you figured out and something we could all figure out. One little idea can actually be a massive idea. If you actually do a little work and make it happen or a lot of work, make it happen. You just beat me to the punchline. What I'm scared about is everybody's driving right now. Everybody's in the office right now. Everybody's sitting at home right now and I was listening as you were prepping me to come in here and I'm like, okay, I see how Elvis is setting this up but I hope that everybody understands that the next thing I'm going to say is you have to work until your eyes are bleeding. I mean that. Look, great. You have an idea and yes, if you call in now, I can give you four to seven bullet points that you can dig into that will probably put you in a better position to succeed but I want to make this analogy. You call in and say, I want to lose weight. I will give you exactly what you have to do. Here's the problem. You have to work out every day. Here's a good thing because I always think of this show because I used to listen to it as a kid growing up in Jersey driving. I kind of really want people to pull over right now. If you get letters or calls that people got into accidents, that's on you guys. I'm waving all my liability. I want you to pull over. I want you to look at that mirror, rear view mirror, right? That's what's called thank you. I want you to look at it. You need to understand if you look at it, it's your fault. Everything in life is on you. It's not your dad's fault who was a drinker. It's not your boyfriend that cheated on you. It's not your girlfriend who's always putting you down. It is your fundamental fault. The second you make that decision, then you can go on the offense. Do you know the odds of becoming a human being are 400 trillion to one. Everybody who's listening, if you want to get real motivated, you want to become real grateful if you start realizing that you're more likely to win the mega millions seven times in your life than even having a life. All of a sudden, you don't waste three, four years pondering. Michael, you're scared of something. You need to figure that out. Go make a video right now, post it and see what happens. If the world doesn't want that electronic product, come up with something else. This thing for me. I've already made my thing. I'm going to buy the New York Jets and it'll be a movie and it's going to be great. At this point, Joe, this phone call means the world to me. You have to understand why this matters. If you actually believe what you just said, if this is not a fleeting moment of the energy of this show and you're able to maintain that feeling, you cannot imagine how much better your life is going to be. Wow. Everyone listening must apply it constantly, not only today but for the rest of your life. Stop complaining and take control of the things you actually have control of. You have more control than you think you do. It's frightening sometimes. It's true. Elvis, Joe, I have to say this. It's the internet. It gave us options and that's what eliminated the complaints. It's the options of the internet that are practical that gave us this shot. We have to milk this opportunity because we're all pioneers in the early internet. It's going to be harder 20, 40 and 60 years from now. Right now, it's practical. This is our shot. We love you, Joe. Thanks for listening. GaryVee, you're fabulous. I love you. You're the best. GaryVee. Stop complaining. Excellent. That was so awesome. You know what? She might literally, her life may be better. That's real. She's like, wait a minute. Thanks for your time. Thank you. Take care. Happy holidays. Thank you. Thank you for coming in. It's great to see you again. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Have a wonderful vacation. Have a wonderful vacation. That's a great hug. A girl that I liked and she liked me in junior high school, she sent me a message saying I actually do know that you work all the time. Oh, wait. Where's my coat? You got it. Thank you. How funny is that? Is this how it ends? So this is going to live on Alvastrand.com and we're doing like a, it's going to be a quick thing about news. Got it. Okay. Should people make news? Yes. Your answer is yes, I'm assuming. I don't know. Okay. But we're about to find out. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Should people make New Year's resolutions? People should make New Year's resolutions if they're actually watching this video on January 1st. If they're watching it on December 23rd, they should make December 23rd resolutions. Waiting miraculously to when the calendar flips to start making your life better is silly at best and pisses me off at worst. And so whenever you're watching this, because it lives on the internet and thus that means you could watch this on June 17th, 2017, make a resolution every day of your life because you only get one at bat. Hope you guys have a great holiday. Yeah. Really? Real pleasure. Thanks man. Yeah. Take care. I like the snake. I feel like those guys are like slothed from Goonies. They're like, they're like, they're just like, they're like, they're like chained to this like weird part. And Jake, Tom, do not come out of here. Hey you guys. See ya. Thank you. Yo am I going to the airport now? Like just early and just like, I'll make content there? Like might as well? Alright. Hey guys, it's me Gary. Actually perfect. These guys, this one and this one just came in here and said, you know, hey, this episode is so iconic. You should chop it up into three episodes. So this is not something I want to do. I'm blaming these two characters right here. And so we're going to do this three part episode. Did you have the audio? Am I like? Oh is that what it is? Good. Alright, we'll see what you think.
