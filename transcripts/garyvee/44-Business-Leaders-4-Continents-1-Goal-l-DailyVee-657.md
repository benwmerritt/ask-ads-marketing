Osmosis, you're watching Osmosis. This is why Osmosis scales more than any tactical corporate move. I day trade attention and build businesses. Legacy is greater than currency. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Like documented. You know, when I think about a company offsite, a retreat of leaders, I really think of them as watershed moments in the year of a company. I think of them as the biggest single opportunity to get a bunch of people aligned on a mission. I think about them as an opportunity to be vulnerable, as an opportunity to be strategic. I think of them as an opportunity to bring the family back together and really talk about the things that matter at the most macro. Everybody, everybody, everybody is caught in the day to day, the meetings, the grind, then you get caught up into the micro, the minutiae, the meetings, the scheduling, the stuff that really isn't driving the role of a business. And so for me, what's really excited about getting these together sessions is like really sitting down and getting a bunch of leaders to really think about, what are we doing here, the why, and talking about the two, to three, to four, to five, to seven real issues that we're struggling with, that as a team, we're not making happen. When I get VaynerX together, it's a real opportunity. Occasionally, I like to do them in the summer where you can just sit outside, shoot the shit, as you're watching this, as you see the Zack Nallers who runs Vayner Speakers, or Lisa Buckleys who run LA, or Sid there sitting next to J-Mo. We really talked a lot about how to use me. In my business, I'm a unique X factor, right? I'm not a figurehead. A lot of you who are watching this right now don't even realize that I'm the actual day-to-day operating CEO of the company, that if you looked at my calendar, you wouldn't even understand what's going on, because a lot of you view me as a personality, or an influencer, or a public figure, but literally I'm spending 13 hours a day running businesses. Actually, for real, we've just figured out how to create content in a different way. And so what's happening here is we're really in the trenches, and so a lot of this conversation that you're watching as people are thinking and pondering is them understanding things we talked about, which was, for example, what if you had to be out for eight weeks because of a personal matter? Are your direct reports capable of making it happen? And when I looked around and saw 40 faces collectively say, oh shit, I knew that people have not been building up their people good enough, or are not managing up, or don't have the right talent underneath them, that's organizationally important. An offsite like this got me to get a collective understanding of where do my leaders sit with their leaders. There's some head shaking going on, and so these are the things a leader has to do, and this is what I tend to do in offsites here, but not to mention the best part, the serendipity of all these people, it makes it more human for all of them. They become more human with each other, and become closer after this. And at the end of the day, just like we talk about a lot, once you're able to take strangers to acquaintances, acquaintances to friends, and then finally, friends to family, you'll achieve everything you're trying to do. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?
