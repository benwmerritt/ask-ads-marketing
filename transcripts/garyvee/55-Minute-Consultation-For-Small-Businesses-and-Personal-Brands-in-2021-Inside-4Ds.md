## Transcript
If you knew that 90% of your business was how to do pictures and videos on Facebook, you would act differently every day. This portion is like with me, so I think this is when you need to get selfish. Like you need to ask your question. ["Fire Ring"] Hiring is guessing, firing is knowing. Like you gotta go fast. That's how you get shit done, that's how you figure stuff out. This is the television. And the television is the radio. So poor he's, motherfuckers. There he is, hey Gary. Hey Joe. Hey everyone. How are you? Hi, hi Gary. Hey everybody, sorry about the confusion, I had some wrong links. I have a board meeting at one o'clock, so I'm gonna go right into it. Would love to, you know, joke you, why don't you take the lead and just pick on someone. Please say hello, where you're from, and then go right into your, actually let's do intros first because it's good context for me. So Joe, if you could just, or I would. Yeah, so let's start with Jason Williams, the birthday boy. Jason, you're up, tell Gary who you are. Hey Gary, Jason Williams from Jack Williams Tire Company. So we're a third generation family business, 91 years old. And this recently launched a new disruptive concept of mobile tire installation. So we have 36 traditional brick and mortar stores, the whole new brand that we're launching and just trying to launch a new model out there. That's awesome. I get it. I'll get right back to you, Jason. Gary, let's go down to Daniel and Michael Yuhá in Honduras. Yuhá brother, say hello. Hey, how's it going Gary? Very happy to be here. We own a family business as well, 50 years. We're a hardware store, we're into wholesale retail, franchise, and e-commerce as well, both for retail and for B2B. Awesome, real nice to meet you Michael. Nice to meet you. Toby over in Barbados, say hello to Gary. What's happening Gary? Nice to see you man. Good to see you. We got two retail stores building the third store, we got e-commerce presence also. We are selling high-end power tools and equipment to Barbados, the country Barbados. To the B2B or to the consumers of Barbados. Both B2B and B2C. Understood, thank you. Let's keep the outside of the continental US flare going and Hawaii. Hey Gary. Hi Gary. Zach and Brittany here. We're Sage Creamery, we're a small batch. I remember all the whole thing. It's good to see you guys again, I'll be ready. Yeah, thank you. Let's swing back into the United States, but let's go down to Florida. Gio and Antonio from Stream Media, say hello to Gary. You're on mute or we can't hear your audio guys. Can't hear you. How you doing? This is Gio and Antonio from Stream Media. So we're the most innovative and interactive OTT streaming platform in the world. So we work with content providers to provide our technology so they can build a next generation, Netflix, Spotify, OTT direct to consumer solutions. So obviously our business is booming. We're launching two new products direct to consumer and we'd love to hear what you think. Awesome, thank you, everybody. Ryan, we're working our way up the coast. Ryan Smith and Georgia, say hello to Gary. Hey Gary, how are you doing? I'm doing very well, how are you? I'm doing well, thank you. Thanks for allowing me to be here. I also wanted to wish you a slightly late happy birthday. Thank you. I believe that you're not even close to half time yet. So just keep doing it. Thank you. So I have a very small startup home theater design company that my wife and I are trying to build so that way I can get out of the job that I'm not very happy doing. And just thankful to be here and learning everything that I can from you guys. Thank you so much. And Lauren Martin from Franklin, Tennessee, who's got a burgeoning business in the field of therapy. Go ahead and say hi to Gary. Hi Gary, I think you like my shirt. It says practice radical empathy. Love. Nice. So I am here because I want to go from being a therapist in the chair to developing products, digital products for clients. What I want to launch next year is the idea of a solo self-guided retreat where you have videos, PDFs, guided prompts for the day so that you have the retreat experience, but on your own, COVID friendly. Awesome. And Christopher up in Milwaukee. Go ahead and say hi to Gary. Hey Gary, how you doing? Great. Really happy to be here. So I have a medical practice, podiatry, foot and ankle, a single location, scaled it down to scale it up. So sold a couple of my offices. And now I want to scale it up. I have a great location. And then I coach and consult with podiatrists. I want to be able to scale up, use digital, just really get better at doing that and then be able to coach other people to do it as well. I understand. And finally, we're going to bring it home with Esther, who's the closest to you, Gary. She's in the tri-state. Esther, say hi to Gary. Hi, Gary. How are you? Good morning. We'll give you afternoon. I'm going to waste time. I think Gary knows. I have all the contacts in you, Esther. Happy, happy, happy birthday to you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Let's go back around the horn. Jason, fire away. And team, this is where you go very narrow with your question. Obviously, the 4Ds program will give you a ton of context, but I want you to go very narrow. And what we've learned through the years is, a lot of times it helps everybody else too from a different angle. So it's exciting, but be selfish. Go narrow. Okay. So launching a new disruptive brand. So a disruptive model as well as a brand. So people were having some challenges just connecting a van coming to your house to change your tires versus for the last 90 years going to a brick and mortar. So trying to figure out how we could be more strategic in driving appointments. So there's a certain number of appointments that we need to do each day per van, as well as re... Are they your own operated and owned vans? Yes, yes. Yeah. So we have those, they're all in different... How much first party data do you have on prior customers through the years? Well, we're trying not to target our traditional customers. So we're looking for new customers in the market. I think that might be a mistake, which is why I'm asking the question. Let me freeze. I think you should 100% target new customers. To back to the question, brother, do you have the information of all your customers through the years? Yes, yes, yes. We could get it. We were changing systems recently, but we have... But you would have email at least? Yes. Address? Yes. I would... It's the number one mistake people make when they go to a new format for their service is literally what you walked into, which is like, this is not gonna be the same customers. These are people that don't wanna come. They're gonna be younger. It's the cliche mistake. You have to market in two ways in parallel. But your historical client, Rick, 58 years old, in Pittsburgh that walked into your store six years ago and has never come back, but the data sits in one of your old systems, is the first person I'm sending a direct mail piece to and an email. Okay. Lapsed users from the old model, because you're sitting on the data, you know that they would even consider what you do. The money you're gonna spend trying to get all of us, I would never do what you do. I've leased all my car. I don't even think. Like I don't think I've changed my oil in any car in my 27 years of ownership or tires or any, like no shot. You can spend a billion fucking dollars. You can tell me about the jets. You can tell me about wine. It's not happening. You're sitting on a goldmine of data of people that would consider it. And don't think that, you know, James Orsini, how old are you? 57. Beautiful. Don't assume that James, just because he's 57, doesn't value his time and wouldn't love for you to come to his fucking house instead of him going to one of your old- His book set of tires this week got ripped off, told had to run flats for that small Mercedes, my daughter drives, rip me off. So Jason, to that point, I think you, so two plan attack, for every, this is gonna matter for everybody, for screaming for Gio and Antonio, for all of you, ice cream, whoever's best at spending the least amount of money running ads and making pictures and videos to get people to consider their business, will win. That's it. That's it. Nothing else. That's all I've done for 25 years, right? That's why I like TikTok. That's why I like LinkedIn right now. That's why I like creators and PCSs and every single thing that comes out of my mouth. Now, bucketing your two groups into historical clients and new clients is where you have to go. I'll give you a couple of tidbits. You have to master Facebook creative and media, Facebook, not Facebook Inc, not Instagram. Yes, Instagram, but for your business to work, for the math to work on what your overhead is on your own bands, your company's gonna have to be great at Facebook because it's the most scaled, cheapest, and in the pocket of the age group that I think you will convert best on your product. For Zach and Courtney, it's Instagram. For you, it's Facebook. For Zach and Courtney, it's Instagram story ads that swipe up to their DTC or their store. They'll run it different in Hawaii because it's come to the store as they will with shipping. Got it? So there's nuances within it. For you, pictures and videos. Now, when you're doing a new thing, doing videos on your phone even that are a little silly and a little different, you need to teach people that it's cool for people to come to their house. So the creative, the things, there's a mill, as all of you know, there's millions of people on the internet that try to be like Gary Vee, right? There's a lot of people talking about business advice, motivation, content, social. It becomes a game of who's best. So not all, and I'm talking about in the content. So the tie, it's insane how the world works today now. The business is imperative. You have to have a good business, a good product, getting ripped off, but James just got ripped off. It's why he considered that business. Did it show up versus Google? Did he say that? Was it word of mouth from somebody? One of the reasons I want you to hit up all your current clients is for the 8% of them that take you up on this new service, they're gonna be the loudest people at dinner tables talking about your service. Hey, Jane, once we get back from COVID, hey, Jane, you know what I do this week? It's crazy. You know, Jack, like they came to my house. Got it? Yeah. I guess, so follow up. So the other part is entering new markets and we're also moving to franchising the concept as well. Right, so if you look at all the mobile fitness stuff and the other stuff that you're probably looking at for this model, junk and all that stuff, it's the same game, brother. Like you have to have a massive marketing strategy to build awareness in a marketplace. And you have to create awareness for your brand so that franchisees come in. You know, I'm sitting on the, my in 40 minutes, which is why I'm kind of shut, shoot, come through. By the way, anybody who I miss, we're gonna schedule some five and 10 minute versions of this because I'm not gonna let you down. So don't stress as the time goes on here. The other thing to think about is the recruitment. My board meeting at one o'clock is Bojangles, the chicken restaurant down in the Carolinas. I know, I'm leading up the task force to do content on LinkedIn to get franchisees. So brother, and I'm telling you this is why I'm staying on this one, because this is the answer to literally to everybody. There is nothing even close to as important as knowing how to run media on social media and how to make content that works on social media. There's nothing even close left. So, you know, you can acquire franchisees with a crazy LinkedIn strategy because you're making content about entrepreneurs that don't wanna take the full risk, get it? Right? You're gonna, you know, you're gonna have to own Facebook because you can target people 48 to 57, right? Who are car enthusiasts, who also like the Steelers. And in that video, you're talking about, remember the bus, Jerome Bates? Well, we're like the, you know, we bring the bus, like you see where I'm going? Yeah. And then that video goes well, and you're like, wait a minute, maybe we should reach out to Jerome Bates. And sure enough, Jerome Bates is a washed up athlete. Let's call it what it is and hope for $10,000 be in your videos. And now you're convert, like, this is a forever living and breathing machine. Hey, Gary. Yeah, go ahead, Joe. I was gonna say, in respect to time, we should probably move on a little bit. Please, good job, Joe. Thank you for executing on what I told you to do when I went in here. No problem. Why don't we go keeping the same order? Why don't we go down to Honduras and talk to the UR brothers, Daniel or Michael, wanna chime in and ask Gary your question. All right, thank you. Hi, Gary. So actually that bit about franchising was really helpful for us. We're involved in that space as well. Well, I don't know how many times a day you get this, but I dropped out of college because of you. It was last year. And so... Were your parents upset with me? No, actually, they were the only ones who supported me. So everyone else told me not to do it. Lucky boy. Yeah. I told them not to do it, yeah. Yeah, remind your brother and everybody else you can always go back. Yeah, I do. I do. I'm not going. I get it. So basically, since last year, we started this franchise concept. And, you know, my brother and I, we've lived in the States, I've lived in Europe. And so we've seen all of these different businesses out there, you know, the whole environment there. And when we come back here, it's like we want so many things to change. So really, we're set out on this mission to make something, make sort of this vehicle that will allow us to go into other businesses. You know, we've been focused on hardware all our lives. Our families have been. So we're trying to branch out and get into other things, you know, B2B e-commerce, platform services, consulting, retail infrastructure. So yeah, we're sort of we're interested in your experience as VaynerX, you know, this machine that you've built. And the idea of how much time do we spend operating versus managing a business? You know, I'm a programmer. So how do I like how do I balance my time in building a platform versus managing everything around it? Patience. Right. I mean, you know, it was seven years of VaynerMedia before there was an M&A activity, you know, so patience, putting in the work based on your ambition. So, you know, I don't know you two and I don't want you to burn out. But if you have this big ambition, because I operate and manage. And I'm Gary V. Right. And so so what I say that is I want to know what your 24 hours look like. I really do. Now, now if you have patience, you don't have to burn out. Right. You know, but the way you manage it is more time. Like I were, for example, every day during COVID, like I'm basically at 14 hours every minute, no lunch, no dinner in front of the computer, you know, really, you know, 8am to 9pm, like just right there, 12, 13, 14. Or every minute. That's a lot of output in one day. That's 13, 14 hours of work. You know, a lot of people who have big ambitions, when they really audit it, they did this for an hour in the middle of the day. They took care of this personal matter, like how many hours of output. And then if your ambition is big, because you're talking big, is you're both so young. And before you say anything, Daniel, you're so young. So you're both so young that it's OK to be eight hours, but you just need to know that that's going to then take 14 years. Yeah, it's net hours. I think we understand the patient, the patient's component. And, you know, there's just so much that we want to get done. And I know we have to be patient. I want to do so much too. I think you do one at a time, you know, whenever you go into your. So, for example, the first thing you do outside the thing you've always known, you need to be focused on that for many years. You know, because don't forget, my expansion wasn't something completely different. They were all in the same basic realm. The gallery media group is talking to the same customers of VaynerMedia. Sasha is just part of the Gary V ecosystem and VaynerMedia, because it's all just kind of connected. So it's not like, you know, for example, even though I successfully did Resi and I successfully did empathy wines, I wasn't able to impact those businesses the way I'm impacting this. So the second they become too different, it's almost like a whole. I did like an overlap, not like a separate. Got it? Yeah. Yeah. Keep that in mind. Yeah, I have another quick question about franchise. We launched our franchise business five days before we got into quarantine, which was back in March. And that we've been hit by a hurricane two weeks ago and hit by another one this week. So it's kind of tough, you know, getting new franchisees, you know, asking people to invest 100K, 80K into, you know, new retail stores. You have it? French disease? We have, no, we have our model store was launched in March and then we got into quarantine. So we have a bunch of leads, but people just don't feel like investing. And, you know, I think you I think you should build community right now. OK, zooms and LinkedIn things and just build relationships and don't even ask to close. Call it franchise advisory sessions. OK. And you start off with like, like, we're here to just talk about it in the macro business in the macro marketing in the macro franchise. He's got it. Build relationships. Yeah, because people, people. Yeah, people love the business that they just don't want to close right now. People are talking 20, 21. And so we just need to have patience, as you say, you know, 100 percent. On that theme, Gary, Toby has been down and he's a Brit hanging out down in Barbados. He's been there for 13 years. He's in a similar industry to the U of Brothers. But Toby, why don't you go ahead and fire up a question to Gary Vee? Yes, right. Gary, my first question will be we've been doing a unique contact every day. So we will push 365 a year unique pieces of content. Every piece of content we've done, it doesn't have a face in it. Do you think that we should be putting a face in it to scowl the business? I don't think you have to. I don't think you have to. I think you should you could consider it. I think, you know, there's two ways of faces. There's Usain Bolt or there's Gary Vee. Are you saying yourself and your team or are you saying other people that you rent equity from like a famous Barbados influencer? It could be either. But because of when it gets technical with product, it might have to be an internal face. I think you should do that because people trust humans. So I think I would do it, but I don't think you have to. OK. Does that make sense? Yeah, for sure. The only slight nervousness on it is being obviously a white Englishman in a in a different environment, which is 95 percent dark pigmentation different local mindsets. Do you and and you know, I think that's a great call out. Do you feel like the market would be over? Now, one of the things you can do is with a co-host. Maybe it's you and. OK, somebody internal or maybe it's always for people. It's like a roundtable discussion on the content. So maybe it's two internal one external former client, current client, somebody else that's in the space so you can make the format less about one person and more about several. OK, cool. That's great. Can I fire a quick a few quick questions when I'm talking about marketing? I've not heard it on a lot of content, but would you ever recommend what sort of market in a sense of revenue would spend on marketing budget? Me personally, every dollar I could afford. OK, I believe in it. I believe marketing is more important than money. Because you'll get the return or confident again, it's a. Yeah, because I don't because I don't think if you're not marketing digitally today, you're actually going to go out of business. Understood. Like over time, it's just going to corrode. Yeah, I think the stakes are higher than people realize. OK. OK. Change in the genre a little bit. How would you motivate an employee that's not motivated by money? By giving them what they're motivated by. My this is a huge mistake that business owner makes. People are motivated by different things. And if that person is motivated by a three day weekend on Fridays, you have to consider it. Now, if you're scared that that's a precedent for other people, you can just speak to them and say, let's just use people in here. Ryan comes to you and says, hey, why is Zach and Jason off on Fridays? And I'm fucking working here. And I say, Ryan, they're taking less money to be off on Friday. If you want to take a 20 percent cut on your salary, you can have Friday off. Understood. Yeah, it really works. And this was something my father couldn't understand. He thinks everyone should be motivated by money, I think, because he was. He thought everybody should work as hard as him. And I was like, they work for you. It's not their business. And he was very inflexible. He thought they should be motivated by what he wanted them to be motivated by. I have a very, very reverse model to that. Cool. Is there is there any lifestyle habits that helped you become successful? The ability not to judge myself. The mental lifestyle aspect of understanding I'm human. I'm far from perfect. I have good intent. I have to be patient. I like people. I'm in business, which means a lot of times it's not going to be good. And that mentality is the mental lifestyles what got me to where I am. Cheers. Let's move it on, Joe. Yeah, so let's keep it on mental health, actually. So Lauren Martin up in Franklin, Tennessee, she she practices in that space. So Lauren, why don't you and Joe, I need to give you a huge shout out. These little segues are very, very, very good. I'm impressed, Joe. All day yesterday, getting to know these people. Yes, but just that's one thing, but doing the improv skills of natural things that are coming out of my mouth and segueing. I am quite and I'm not kidding. I'm very impressed. Lauren, what's up? Hi. I want to pivot from therapy. So right now all of my content is branded under novel counseling because like novel, like new ways of thinking. I'm considering going to my own name since I'm the only employee. I'm just wondering if I'm wanting to do, you know, more personable content, moving more into education. I'll still have some clients. I have some really good news. Yeah, I lived this life. I went from Wine Library TV. I started Gary V. And I started changing the things that came out of my mouth while still for a little while selling plenty of wine. OK, the answer is I know it better than anybody on earth. I really mean that because I was at the top of my game. Nobody was doing influencer marketing and content in 2006, seven, eight when I was doing it. I got known as the wine guy. The I wanted to talk about business. I lost 80 percent of my views. Yeah, I didn't care. Because you're doing what you want. And I didn't lose 80 percent of my business. Got it. So you'll maintain your business. You'll start adding other components to your world. And then the world will become your oyster. Cool. Change all your user names immediately to your name. OK. And make a manifesto video immediately and saying, I'm still doing this, but I'm now in and land. This is not or everybody. This is not an or video. Hey, we're a big believer in the and world and the therapy world. It's a both and sort of life. You know what? That makes a ton of sense to me, given like all my natural nuances. So that's cool to hear. And that's what this is. It's not like you're going into now you talk about jam or business or whatever you're going to go into. You're going to talk about both. So this is an and video. Now what I'm hearing, you could tied into the macro of what you do to begin with. And there it is. And everyone's going to be like, congratulations. I'm proud of you, girl. And all that. And you'll be on your way. And some people will be like, I don't want to hear that other stuff. And I'll be fine, too. Right. Cool. Immediately, immediately. Well, you know, I'm going to do it tonight. And then my husband's going to be like, of course, you're going to stay up till midnight doing all the things. Just go to bed. So then I guess with that, you know, I'm wondering. So I had that. And then I was curious about the viability of like the self guided retreats, but I got your initial reaction on that, that that like a digital product is really viable, especially in COVID world, but also doing things on your own time. I'm wondering if it makes sense to sort of says I don't have the product done. I'm in the process of making the product. If I should go ahead and just start more like an influencer movement of creating things like, I don't know if people have considered doing solo retreats or I think people do it, but almost sort of branding it myself. And then even if people copy it, they copy it. I don't give a shit. I just come up with a good one. It's a good one. I want everybody listening. There's nothing in the world that stops people from copying. You should spend zero seconds on it. It is the greatest waste of time for entrepreneurs. Yeah. People worrying about people copying shit stops people from doing shit when it didn't matter. Well, and that's like where I've been stuck because I don't come up with the therapy models. So I don't want to be accused of stealing therapy models, but if I'm compiling all together, then that's my brain. You're the DJ. You're the DJ, but make sure the world knows you're a DJ because otherwise you're a Millie Vanilli. I used to be a radio producer. I used to be a radio DJ. So that's funny that you said that's where you are. You're a DJ and you just have to make sure that everybody knows that. And that's it. And and people value DJs. I don't need you to be the creator of it. You being the curator of it is great for me. So you should own that. Never hide from that. Awesome. Stay in the medical world and shipped over to Milwaukee. Christopher, do you want to talk about your podiatry? Podiatry practice? Absolutely. Yeah. Chris, by the way, Chris, I'm so proud of you for being strategic enough to take a step backwards for three steps forward. It is the cliche mistake of almost everybody in the kind of businesses that you have and other doctors and hair cut many around that business model. Kudos to you. It's really cool. It's very hard to do for a lot of people. Yeah. Well, part of the reason for that is we lost one of our biggest sources of new patients with it, which is doctor referrals. They're all in the corporate health care. So we're going up against big goliaths and we're just trying to figure out how to add that third best referral source into the business. So number one is patient referrals. Number two would be Google AdWords and SEO. And then number three used to be doctors. So I'm just looking for that third strategy and I know digital has to be it. That's where people are. That's where, you know, the attention is, but I don't really have a good strategy. I've done some, you know, content. I've done a lot of written content, you know, just in our field. I've done some video content, but I just feel like we're not doing enough. And I want to reach. Chris, you know, it's funny to jump in here. I'm sorry, you want to reach? One last thing is the 40 to 70 year old female is our demo. That's really who we're looking for. Brother, one, you know, what's really cool about this is, and I'm actually using Lauren as a comp, people like, I have this problem like, no, no, your problem is you haven't dealt with your childhood. Right. Or like, Gary, I did it. No, no, no, you're, I have a major problem with my sink. No, you don't, you're well outside your water sources, your problem. The reason I use those two things and I want everybody here to ask Chris, if you knew that 90% of your business was how to do pictures and videos on Facebook. You would act differently every day. What I need you to do in these five minutes. And I appreciate the way you just responded. Like, I don't, like I'm not kidding. You, you, and then whether you hire people, whether you freelance it, whether you work with an agency, you have to realize that that's exactly why you have to do it to your point. And I appreciate your humility. You didn't have the strategic rationale or the burnout or some other different point of stepping back. You were forced to, because you were live in something else driving your business. I am never scared because I never let anyone have leverage. James will tell you that. He knows the inside of my, literally everybody can leave the company and it'll be fucking disastrous for an hour or a month or a year. But I have so much leverage and understanding that I'm actually not vulnerable. You were vulnerable. Some of you else here are vulnerable. You can't rely on somebody driving your relationship with your customer. So this will now make sense, which is why I'm using this. It's not the Raz. It's to get you fired up to the next chapter. You have to win Instagram and Facebook. You, you, it's more important than your practice, your ability. Now it's more important than balancing your checkbook. It's more important than breathing fucking oxygen. You have to know what it is. And, and, and it's Jason's answer too. Jason will get destroyed in new markets. If he doesn't understand it, he will. It's just too much capital upfront to wait for it to happen. Unless he raises a galley amount of money or he bleeds all his base business dollars, if he doesn't get good at it, at least adequate, it's not going to work. If you can't create growth, you know, one of the things I've really enjoyed and working with James Orr, seeing as he comes from big holding company agency land where they are at such scale, they, they are about efficiencies. And it's been great for me to learn because I've always created such growth. But like, that's why I'm never, like when you're growing, when you know how to get more business, ironically, all the other shit works itself out. It's when you stop knowing how to get business, that you have to become a monster at efficiencies, but that's not a fun game. It's depressing. Firing people, renegotiating, like it's all defense. Fuck defense. So brother, you have to learn offense and the offense in your business is how to acquire customers. And the only way to acquire customers for all of us, including me in small business land is social media. Nobody here is buying a Super Bowl commercial. That's great. I was putting a little bit of tension into taking your advice hosting the party, doing a podcast called inspiring small business stories. I love that. The problem is you need people to listen. And if you don't have to market the podcast, you're going to be looking at yourself and saying, this is cool for my grandchildren to listen to one day because it's funny, but it's not driving your business. By the way, what you're now you're going, think about how this works. I love that. And I'm glad you picked up on that. And by the way, you should do that. It's going to work. The problem is if you don't know how to get people to fucking listen to it, it's all dead. Knowing how to do pictures, videos, cartoons, written words, and how to spend $100 a media on LinkedIn, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, is everyone's business here. Everything's secondary. I don't give a fuck how good the stereo equipment Esther's family has been making for 50 fucking years. If she doesn't know how to get people to come to the fucking store, it's game over or get or buy it on.com. All of it. I don't. Delicious ice cream is subjective. What's not subjective is that people saw Zach and Courtney shit in their feet and it's like, fuck it, I'll try it. It's the only thing that matters. It's why I'm completely been obsessed about it for a decade, not honing any other skill than trying to become the single best practitioner at the day trading of media and creative on an every second basis. And I would argue that's why I have just started my career, because I'm now in the place where I'm recognized as if and it will only compound from here because everyone's about to get educated next 10 years. That's the only thing that matters. Comma, of course, your product matters if tires suck, of course, but everyone here thing is good enough to build a big enough business to make everybody here happy for the rest of their life. They got to get this fucking part right. That's your move on a little bit. I've got Chris, the reason I went that route with you is now anything you've heard prior or anything that's coming up. I just feel like you're going to take it an 11 seriousness instead of an eight. Got it. That's what I'm trying to do here. Right. Like you got to like get down to zero and go, oh, my God, this is actually the business I'm in that I happen. Everybody here is a marketing media company that happens to do the other things they say you happen to sell ice cream tires you happen to. Great. You happen to decide to grow a weird mustache. You happen to. Gary, we've got Gio and Antonio that are getting ready to launch an innovation. So I figured innovation might be a good change of pace. Gio, go ahead. How you doing? Can you hear us? Yes, can you hear? Yeah, great. So we're launching a new product, you know, going live, doing live streaming right now to multiple destination is hard. Right. You have to be platform. You have to be a restream or a switchboard to do it. So we have developed an app where users can download it and they can go. You can add multiple social media. So what you see here is two Instagram, one Facebook, but you can do like five Facebook, you know, seven Instagram and then you do a live. And when you do live, obviously you go live on all the different social media channels and and then you can actually see comments coming in from Facebook, Instagram. We are we also so similar to Streamyard, right? Yes, but mobile, but app based. I understand. So we're the first ones in the world doing that and we're adding LinkedIn. So we just got the approval from LinkedIn. So it's pretty cool. And we also had a spokesman, an influencer, Sinbad, that was going to be the spokesman. You know, you know, you got to know. Comedian. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 45 years old. No, no, no, that's right. I thought it was going to be recently, but I don't know if you knew that he just got a stroke like last week. I'm so sorry. I know it sucks. And but he's doing he's doing better. Anyway, so we wanted to know if this was your product, right? This is your app. Well, how would you mark it? Theo, Anton, is it ready for me to try and use? It's in the chat window. If you want to take out, we're going to do a separate thing. Joe, why don't you set them up with Andy and Sid? We'll do. We'll take this offline because I will absolutely play with it. OK. And then I can give you a really, really, really, really good answer. Beautiful. Awesome. Why don't we slide over to Hawaii then and you already know Zach and Courtney, but go ahead and chime in. She and Antonio, we'll do that in the first week of December. We'll have a real meeting. Beautiful. Zach, Courtney, great to see you guys again. Hi, Gary, you too. So I mean, we're super interested in what ideas you had for us from the last call, especially around like how to provide value as a sustainable business model for us, because we're so early on. I guess a specific question for us is in terms of branding, we have so many elements going on. We have the story of Daniel, like Daniel's real life. We have the story of the sage, which is going to be like a fictional character that we want to use to inspire customers. And then we also have like Zach and Courtney as the couple, high school, sweetheart, starting a business together during coronavirus. So and then and then the product itself, right? The only organic made ice cream using local products. You mean similar to empathy, right? Where you had me and my origin story, the product itself, the story of two interns that became my partners, the story of the farmers direct to bottle. You mean like every brand in the world, multiple stories. This is one big session of and not or. OK, so I mean, we just all of it. All of it. OK. And by the way, in the same screen, this post is a beautiful picture of ice cream. The next one is the first time you guys kissed. The next one is right. The next is the sage. The next is a new flavor. The next is it. And watch and listen. I know a lot of you follow me. That whole thing I talked about PCS post creative strategist, the people that read all the stuff that that's a very big part of it. You'll see after six months of doing all of it, which one has a little more juice than others. Then you start all four at 25 percent energy each. But then four months later, it's 60, 10, five, 22. Got it. You understand? And by the way, it also ebbs and flows. I don't know if any of you've noticed this, but in the last two weeks, my Instagram has taken a different tone. I'm doing a lot more business content, less mindset, less motivation, more what I did in 2011 on the next wave, more like here's why Spotify is doing this. Palatine and beyond. Like now my views are down, but I want to for my brand and for my soul, do more business content because I'm a businessman. And I feel like I've established the mindset perspective thing the last three years. We've got that down again. Now I'm going to move away from it and I'm going to be more and you understand? So not a start at 25 percent each for those four stories and really 20 percent because leave the last 20 percent for anything. Then you're going to keep going and going and you're going to ebb and flow. And it's going to change for a year. Maybe it's all about your relationship, but then everyone's tired. They know all your fucking stories. They were they know about the note in class and the first kiss. And they know all that shit. But first of all, as you know, everybody knows my lemonade stand and all that. I still pound it, but you're going to ebb and flow it. Got it? Yeah, got it. OK, I mean, we're trying to. And by the way, real quick, just to make this more valuable for everybody. One part of your relationship may work better on YouTube. The sage might work better on TikTok. The the flavors might be better on Instagram. So there's also not only are the four strategies and different flow, but your distribution channels might have different percentages given the psychology and the demographics within that fucking platform. Yeah. So they won't be it won't be muddled if we if we are talking about. There is no muddled. That's a theory. To. Yeah. You know, and and by the way, you're going to watch. And if you see like people really react to the beautiful pictures of Instagram, high res photos of ice cream, then you're like, fucking, we'll do 80 percent that. But like people fear staying in the same topic. That makes people boring. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. I guess like what what ideas did you have for us? I mean, it sounded like you had some some cool ideas. I think sampling is the number one thing that brands don't do enough of. So anything that can create content. So I'll give you an example. If you did a thing on Instagram that if you leave a comment in the first minute, we're going to pick one person every time to send free ice cream to now it's a game. Now you see things like, but using sampling as your as your leverage. Right. Make content for us in all your states. And for the best one for each 50 states will send 50 people five car ends of ice cream. Now you got content. Yeah. You know, show us your freezer. Like just creativity. You see where I'm going? Using sampling because your product is delicious. And so giving it away is good for you. Yeah. Because once they taste it, they can come back. Yeah. Which is different than, let's say, if you're selling power tools in Barbados where they don't need it again, that's not good. Sampling is not good for Toby. Yeah. If wine sampling was legal because alcohol, you can't give away for free in New Jersey. I would constantly do it. Mm hmm. Yeah. So influencer marketing would be good for us too, then. Influencer marketing would be 100 very much. OK. So now let's go up to Esther. Esther and Ryan are the last two and they both have similar conundrums. They're both in the sound space, but in very different reasons. Esther, talk to Gary. You're on mute. Hi, Gary. So I'm like trying to can Ryan go because I have so many things that I want to ask and I'm trying to see what would be the best use. So we're trying to get right and we're trying to get Gary out of here in 10 minutes, but Ryan start us off and Esther, hope that we have enough time. We'll come back. All right, we'll do. I'll try to go as quick as possible. Gary, you used the analogy earlier about fixing the sink versus fixing the well before I could use your analogy. I'm trying to fix my well. I'm trying to get out of a career that I've been stuck in for the last 14 years. And I'm not fancy. My wife and I, we have three kids, we're lower middle class. I don't need to make a ton of money. I just need to make enough to replace the career. Patience and execution every night. Feverishness. This is, you know, you know what one of my great mistakes of my career was, Ryan? Is when I wrote crush it, I talked about happiness over everything, the opportunity to be on the internet. And then I talked about Ryan Smith and I talked about 7pm to 2 in the morning. I said, if you were all out of options, if you can't get less fancy, if you can't, if you've got no other options, you still have 7pm to 2 in the morning with the internet that our grandparents didn't have. If you were your grandfather, you're stuck. Mm hmm. The end. This unstuck us. Unfortunately for me, people manipulated what I was saying to me, saying that everybody has to work two o'clock in the morning and burn out, which sucks, because I don't want to be associated with hustle porn. But but here we are. And the answer to you is what I wrote in 2008 and the book came out in 09, which is you have to be very strategic about 7 to 2pm. You have to be patient because you still want time with the family. You got to take care of your health. You got to be right. But over a five year window, because you're a young man, if you if you execute properly in that time, you have a model to get out of this situation. Otherwise, without it, you don't and go into depression of never getting out of it. Mm hmm. Or you just live way shittier. You think you can't leave more humbly. You can. Do you own a house? We do. It's not very fancy, but yeah, you could sell it and rent a shitty place. You could. I'm not saying you should. I'm not saying it's fun to you could. But the only thing I know is taking one step back. Even more extremely than you think you could. Or what I get excited about 7pm to 2 in the morning. In a balanced way, amortized over a long period of time, so it's healthy around the thing that's going to take you to the next place. One of the things I don't know if you saw the email or not. But one of the things about why should I make is we're supposed to go to a senior bull to see was a poster that said Vanderchup Jets. And on the other side, on the other side of it, it said, we'll sell our house and move to Chattanooga to work for you. So my wife's on board like we're willing to downsize and what do you want to do? I want to design and deliver amazing entertainment experiences to people through home theater and audio and video. Like that's that's my passion. That's what I've been doing for like 23 years. When you say design, you mean being like the interior decorator strategist of what somebody should do for their home theater? Not necessarily the interior decorating part, but more the system. And the technical architecture of what if Nick Dio makes it big one day and like, I need this epic theater and you're like, what's your budget? And he says, 80 K, you're going to make the best use of that for the most epic up to date infrastructure. 100 percent. Esther, that's that leads into your world a little, huh? Yes, for sure. So that's what you want to do, right? Can I can I make a huge recommendation to you? Of course. That I'm really bullish on that I'm like praying to God works because it'll be an amazing case study and you'll be happy as fuck with me forever. I think you should share in long written posts and video potentially on LinkedIn. Make pretend scenarios. Hey, guys, it's me. Whether this is an article I'll do my version of the videos from. Hey, guys, it's Ryan Smith here again with the make pretend setup show where I take a theoretical budget and a theoretical scenario. And I customize that person's home entertainment experience. Here we go. On today's episode, make pretend lawyer Rick on the Upper East Side has $67,000 for his new Hamptons home. He's got two kids that are seven, so he wants that Disney plus shit to be on fire. Let's get into the show. All right, so I got $67,000. I got plenty of room. It's not about the couches that if you do that on LinkedIn and written or audio or video form. Once a week, it is my belief in my heart that something weird will happen. And for everybody who's not following something weird is a company is going to reach out to you and say, we want to hire you to do this. But you have to keep doing this show because we need more contemporary marketing and we think your face matters. Or both sees it or or Esther sees or somebody sees it in the business and goes the other route and makes you an influencer for their business. I want you to as a doctor writing a prescription, I want you to do what I just said once a week on LinkedIn. And after you do 10 of them, I want you to share the 10th one with me via email titled here's my 10th one CC Joe Q to make sure I don't miss it. And I will give it a little bit of awareness if I like what you've done in your first 10. We'll do it. We'll do it. Absolutely. Thank you. You're welcome. You anyway, Ryan, we're already connected on LinkedIn. So I'll make sure you're you're up on your 10 posts and Gary, it'll be coming hot in your inbox when it does. Esther, do you have your question ready? Yes, I do. OK, fine. So Benjamin wanted to say hi to you. It's great to see you again, Bill. And what did you want to tell the guy? Who do you want to be when you go off? I'm a rapper and I'm jumping on the business name. My man, you will be. And that he made this for you. He wanted to show you. You're very. Yeah, OK. So really quick. Very nice. So this is one of this is what I like lost my train of thought. And I feel like this is like the most important question that I have. I have a lot of the solutions of what I need to do. But here's my issue. You know, we have this brand, right? That is a world class brand. You tell you ask pretty much any audio file that's serious about audio. And they'll say land industries is like the Bentley of audio, whatever. Fine. We had we operated as like a mom and pop shop. Which is like the same mentality that your dad had. Yet you were able to scale it and take it to the next level. Yes, I was not able to do that within, you know, that scope of time. Whatever, just it's fine. Everything happens at its right time. So I feel like now's my time to launch. I know that all the things that I need to do really, I mean, yes, of course, I could do content myself and hire somebody, even get interns. And, you know, like that's what I was actually doing, setting up people who were like interested in high end audio for the experience to be with us. They're going to do free content for us. Amazing. But I really need an investor. Like there's just no way around it, but not just an investor. I had a fundraising career prior to this. If I needed just money, I could get money. I need somebody that's going to be super passionate and is going to be interested in my father's legacy. So the problem with that is, and I've heard this a lot lately in my, you know, VC hat on in that life. Everybody wants smart, strategic money. You know, that only really comes in a partner. Right. And we're willing to do that. I believe you. I want you to be thinking that way. I am for sure. Good. Because I feel like we have, I always said that, like, we're on a gold, we're sitting on a gold mine. Like we have brand equity that companies would be spending. I'm not exactly, probably millions of dollars to get to where we are, just with my father's like name recognition and where we're at. And under it, I want to launch and I spoke to people before I know how to do it. You know, I don't have per se the I have the head for it. I don't know the expertise in terms of running and operations, you know, manufacturing, I mean, I grew up like that. I know certain things like I would launch little lamb and all the dealers, every dealer distributor that I spoke to, they love the idea. They want to integrate an amp with two of those bulky things in one, right? Especially for people who are like, I'm not putting this whole freaking system, you know, in my two bedroom, you know, whatever, Manhattan apartment, but I want a good stereo and I'm willing to spend 50,000, 40,000. And then you have the younger guys who are, you know, like I'm sure the guys who work for you who could spend 20, 30, even 10,000, I would go as low as like $10,000 entry points and then build them up to the lamb industries brand. Right. I have it all planned out. I have a business and I haven't all written up. My issue is like, so do I approach people that I know from the fundraising world and try to find a partner that way? Do I, you know, shop it around? You know what I'm saying? Or do I put it all in God and say God's going to send me the. Well, God's undefeated, so you can do that. But if you want to know what I'm saying, of course I do. But if you want to hedge it a little bit, I think it's similar to the advice I gave Brian, which is I think you you put it out to the universe. I think sharing that you're, you know, that you're looking for a partner in crime. And here's what you're looking for. And I really, everyone, hear me out. TikTok has crazy organic reach. You've all heard this from nausea for me. LinkedIn has crazy organic reach. If you go tell the world that this is happening once a week for nine weeks in a row on LinkedIn, I can't tell you, Esther, how much I believe that it's going to lead to you finding someone. But do I really want to like put out? I hear what you think. Yes, you do. I'll tell you. I'll tell you why. Because you can disguise it. I understand what you're saying. You know, like, like, you don't go out. You know, like, I think you disguise it. Hey, is there any? Like, I think you make it look like an employee or like a partnership or like a service, but really underneath, that's what you're looking for. And you're hoping back to God's hands that that person actually is like, wait a minute. I mean, here's a good one. James Orsini will tell you the Sasha group or even Vayner consulting before at the precursor to Sasha group and Nick Dio and Joe know that an orange, know Dennis Dogg made a great employee. He was doing what Joe Q and Nick and James are doing. I came a business in one of these sessions that he really liked and he left our company to become partners with that person. So I think you can put it out there not as a desperation or as a I need a partner, but as a partnership. Right. And then you could bet it through the people that come in. Right. Right. Because like when you speak about marketing dollars, like just one idea because of COVID, we don't go to movie theaters, right? Dry foods. Like my dad, I always ask them, can I use your amps for like music festivals? Can you use your amps for these like movie theater things, which traditionally before and my dad's dealer has these crazy Japanese speakers that were used. He answered my question. We're doing this documentary and my dad called the purists. And one of our customers is the C I mentioned this to the group earlier is the CEO of Atlantic Records, who's the nicest guy, big audio file. And he has like 1.5 million LPs. He's the largest collection of LPs. So there's a lot of Craig. What? Craig Hellman. Yeah, Craig really well. A couple of things. Esther, because I know we'll be able to connect again. I have to run because I can't be late for the vote because we have a vote at one three minutes ago. I love everybody. Thank you, everyone. Great. Gary, thank you. YouTube, watch it. What's up? It's Gary Vee. First of all, thank you so much. I hope you're doing super well during these times. I also want to ask you please subscribe because my commitment and exploration of YouTube is about to explode stories, polls, more contact, more engagement, more surprise and delight. This is the time to subscribe. I hope you consider it and I hope I see you soon.
