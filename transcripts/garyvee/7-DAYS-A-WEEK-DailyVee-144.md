Another gym day with Jordan. What's up guys? That's it. Not gonna be the greatest Daily V ever. Tabin, motherfuckers, I've been telling you! Turn the back over. This fucking workout's pissing me off. You're talking about. That's when you know it's good. When it pisses you off, it's good. What's going on on this Sunday? A lot going on. Life is good. AJ just turned 30. That was good. There's Jordan. Just grinding along. They're kind of like Workout and family Sunday. Nothing too crazy. Just want to remind everybody Actions louder than words. Business. Life. Parenting. Politics. All of it. It's your actions. Everybody's getting leasy with comments. Think it's enough. You gotta do. Doing always wins. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Good! Good job. Nice job. That's 60's. Jordan and I were just talking about doing some weird push ups on this ball. But anyway, And I just kind of looked at myself and I'm like happy with the progress. And I just said 7 days a week. Day in and day out. Day in and day out. 7 days a week. And it's so interesting to me. This is the exact episode of Daily B to pass on to your fitness friends. So many of them. Get it when it comes to being in the gym. But then they think a couple of shirtless selfies on Instagram are enough to like build their business. And they're not putting in that 7 days a week. Day in and day out. I didn't realize that people thought it wasn't true. And that's the truth. And that's the truth for so many of you watching right now. You didn't think it was true. You didn't think it was true that they were 15, 16 hours a day. You thought they were hyperbolized and they were 8 or 9. You didn't realize every minute was something. You didn't realize that it's every day. Always. Forever. And not that this is for everybody. But it speaks to... It surely has eliminated the luck thing. And what I don't think people realize is this has been going on every day for the last 7 years at this pace. Every day. Day in and day out. Work. That's it. I mean there's really just nothing else. There's your talent, your strategy, and the work you put in. Those are the 3 pillars right? You've got your talent and for the 99.9% of us we can only maximize our talent. Right? Like when I talk about not having a big enough chest. Some people just naturally have that. Some people can naturally just sell. Some people can naturally just put the ball in the hoop. There's your talent. And if you put in the work you can maximize that. There's the work which is the most controllable. It's the thing that we all control. I could have not come in the gym this Sunday morning. Or I can. Like it's just the work. You could stay up another hour and work on your copy. The work you've put in Jordan on your social since you've come with me. And that's just the work. You either do it or you don't. When I busted your chops about Instagram first couple days this year. I said did you do it? You're like yeah I go no you didn't. You did one photo not three right? Right. It's either just the work. And then the strategy. If you have the wrong strategy. If you're putting in all your efforts on Google Plus right now. You're wrong. If you're putting all your efforts in the gym. And stuff that's not helping you because you don't have a trained professional. Or you didn't get good advice. You're not going to win as much. Those are the three things that I want everybody to think about. You got your natural talent. Don't be crippled by what you can't do. Worry about what you can do. You've got your work. It's the number one thing I push. Because it's the most controllable. And then you've got the strategy. And that's the part that we need to kind of expand on here in 2017. That's why I talk about day trading attention. When I was warming up Jordan's like. You think it's just good to mess attention is that what you said? Like. It's the most important just to like get attention. Yeah. I mean it is. It's like then you know how to deploy it. So those are the three pillars.
