## Transcript
Like, love, is that a good thing? Is it powerful? Does it matter? I mean, the shit that people do for love is everything, right? That's how I feel about brand. It's everything. But how to measure that? We think that there's an extreme under-investment in creative, organic, and an over-investment in media that is wasted on creative that could have been better. Money's expensive now. Yeah. Don't own the building and see how great this concept really is. Use the location, 11 minutes in the bougie place, treat it like your New York location, and innovate on the idea. Mart! Oh my gosh, that's genius. Attention is the number one asset. I know we spoke, you know, a few months ago, so I forgot to give you a quick recap just to kind of where we're at. We started that hospitality group. We moved on to... Ace and Jamie, by the way. Yeah, Ace and Jamie. Yeah, Ace and Jamie. So, we moved from New York to North Carolina in 2021. We bought three historic properties, converted them into boutique hotels, added some restaurants and an espresso bar and one. And there's a Florida location, right? We were looking... So, we started the burger concept that we were looking to franchise and start the startup. We actually step back on that now because the espresso bar has taken off so insanely. I mean, we're turning away 100 to 200 people a night on the weekend. And we found the margins were really good. So, right now from an excitement standpoint, from a profit standpoint, the cocktail, the coffee shop slash cocktail bar, it's coffee by day, cocktails by night, is we're doing about $350,000 a month. Last month we just did over $400,000. Wow. Yeah, so we're going to... About a percent margins on that. Because there's no food involved, it's all liquor. Yeah, so we're running just over 30% in that market. Well, you're probably starting to realize the maximizing of margin and liquor is an endless game, like get really good really fast if you keep doing it. Yeah, yeah. So, we were talking to the franchise company about doing the burger restaurant and realized that there's no one in the franchise space that's doing anything with the espresso, coffee shop and cocktails by night. And we've been getting a lot of emails and people asking, are you franchising? Can we buy a franchise? How do we do this in Raleigh? Have you two swallowed the concept of franchise or meaning like, do you feel like you've exuberated? Do you feel like you've fully thought through if you want to be a franchise or do you think you're being intoxicated by the short term value of it? Possibly. That's one of the questions we wanted to ask you because we also own 90% of the real estate of all the buildings and we were in the middle of buying another building and opening a pound core espresso bar location too. Number two, yeah. On the other side of town. So... Should we stay private? Should we franchise? And what do you do? Do you know anything about the industry and do you have connections? Yeah, so we wanted to pick your brain. On our minds, one side we're like, oh, speed before someone else tries to do the same thing we're doing and then on the other side. So by the way, I'm sure if you go to Google or chat, you'll see this. This is not the first time I've heard of coffee and cocktails. Yeah, I'm sure. I've had coffee and cocktails by night. There's like four places by me and that did it 10 years ago. Like, yeah, yeah. It's all execution. Yeah. Like Burger King and McDonald's and Wendy's. There's you have unlimited like that. Don't worry. Don't do it for that reason. Yeah. Okay. So I think it's both work. What I'd like you to do is spend like 100 hours of watching YouTube videos and listening to podcasts from the perspective of franchisee or is who understand like it's all fun and games until the first person and they give you money and you're all pumping and they're complaining to you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You like babysitting? No. And you're going to hate being a franchisee. That's the whole point of franchising, right? But it's like a catch 22. But fast, you know, fast money is seductive but often leads to headaches. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, that's good. Good insight on that. And then and then the on the other side of the equation, right? Because now franchising would become like a separate thing from what we're if we were did franchise from the hospitality group. So that so us growing the hospitality group and you know, thanks for connecting us to Tony and David. We spoke to them so much value, so much value. So much value. So we want to just pick your brain on, you know, maybe trying to duplicate what you're doing up north and the south, right? Essentially, yeah, I think, I think, I think you don't need to own every piece of real estate. Obviously, real estate is a great asset. But like if you feel like you got something with the coffee and cocktail, my point of view is that keep your cash. Money is expensive now. Yeah. So if you're borrowing, you're paying higher interest rates. Yeah. You know, I'm kind of a fan of, you know, open another location in a great fucking location, like a great location, pay the pay the big don't own the building and see how great this concept really is. Got it. If I was the third partner we were having our meeting and I was like the elder statesman and you know, like I was the older brother or whatever, I'd be like, let's the right way to test this is to go to the best fucking location that we can fucking afford, pay the rent, high big, but it we're paying the big because it's in the best fucking location in the state of North Carolina. Yeah. And let's see how good this concept really is. So so you would recommend like, I like that because you context. Yeah. If all of a sudden I'll give you an example why let's say we pay something like we get we do that instead of the down payment right on an asset of a building. We now are using that cash to get like a real fucking killer spot. Yeah. But what if that spot's doing a million a month? Hmm. Because you see the kind of location I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah. We could see if it's doing 300,000 a month and everyone's like, what the fuck? Very well. We have all these other competitors here. Yeah. And but now we learned. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we didn't have to put all that cash down to buy the real estate to find out that lesson for this one exact lesson. Yes. I'm going. Yeah. Yeah. Location. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. I think that's what I would do if I was the partner right now because you've got something. Let's really understand if you got something, got something. Got it. Where would you go after hearing that from me? Where would you go? We're we're looking. Well, right now we're looking for a spot. We're in Wilmington, like downtown most of the. And then there's Wrightsville Beach, which is like the more bougie side of town, landfall. Yeah. Right. So Beach, I guess, would be like if we were looking at Long Island, like the Hamptons versus Jones Beach, I guess. Is it a seasonal? Except it's more populated and less seasonal. It's not. It's not seasonal. It's just that it's great. And it's grown. So we're look we're looking for something there. And then we were then having we think two would be enough. And then we'd have to set our sights on Raleigh and Charlotte after that. Yeah. So let's talk about that area. You were thinking about buying a building there. And yeah. And Wrightsville, yeah, Wrightsville Beach. Is that the good? Is that the Hamptons one or the? That's the good part of town. It's the good part of town. Yeah. Are you able to get a better? Are you OK? What about what's the best? Are there better locations than where you is if you were to rent? There's not a lot available there. So it's kind of like you have to take what it is. The location where we would get beginnings on a main road. It's very popular where it is. So why would you be for sale? The it used to be a used to be a brewery that went out of business, multiple breweries that just didn't run a fit. And now the building is up for sale for for that. So why? That map was not good. Yeah. Good spots to rent. But here's a good spot to buy that we can afford a small entrepreneurs. Everything smells bad to me. I think I know. Yeah. Yeah. But I know something. Do you know what I mean? Kind of thing. Yeah. I don't want to talk out of something that might be remarked. I could be 100 percent wrong. Yeah. But boy, does that make no sense to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's seven minutes from the actual beach. It's 11 minutes from the biggest area that everyone in Wrightsville Beach shops and dines. But talk to me about that area. Yeah. There is that 11 minutes literally have nothing nothing. You know, it's like I mean for you to open right now. That's my concept. Yeah. Yeah. Go in that area. Skip the 11 11 minutes. Yeah. Go in there. Like directly. Of course, you could buy 11 minutes out. You can't buy in the heart of the heart because it's way more expensive and not available. Yeah. You're right. Yeah. If there was a spot there, I would get off what I want for you. Which is to see if this is a ten million dollar concept. Yeah. Yeah. Best location. So that being said, just because of the population here, we have a ton of we we just Wilmington just doubled in the past two years. So they went from 130 to 150,000 people to 300 plus. Is that because like all the Northeast people are moving? Yeah. The Northeast people moving. A lot of New Yorkers came down here. Yeah. Sure. And putting a location in Wrightsville Beach would still only put us 20 minutes away from our other location. Coffee and cocktails. That's like a century away. Yeah. They don't really that side of town doesn't really come to the side and vice versa. Yes. But this concept, because there's no food, we are the before dinner spot and we're the after dinner spot. And we're what about the breakfast spot? What's that? Are you also a breakfast spot because of coffee? Yeah. Yeah. The coffee. So the call the call obviously the majority of money, the chunk, you know, like 80 percent of the money is made at night, obviously. We only have an agriculture license. So we actually we get pastry delivered and we don't really have breakfast there. We have very limited people by coffee, right? Or not coffee croissants like some big good. But if we're doing it out like if on a good day, we'll do a thousand dollars in coffee, but we're doing five, six thousand dollars in liquor. Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. So do you think that opening a location in Rightsville Beach? Twenty minutes away versus going to a bigger city for best location like Raleigh. I like, you know, you know this, your infrastructure right now, of you being able to drive back and forth 24 seven versus two hours. Yeah. You like this is why I'm pushing you to something very specific. Yeah. You're going to be in a very competitive spot. There's plenty of other fucking places in this 11 minutes bottom shore as well. Yeah. Yeah, there is. Right. So like I assume your town, there's less good like like bar, like less than what would be in the heart of the 11 or no. Actually, there's a lot. We're kind of and that's we're in the heart of downtown. You can literally walk to everything downtown from where we are. So people will literally make a reservation and we're reservation only, Gary. So people make a reservation. Are your drinks really good? Do you nail it? They crush. They crush. Yeah, we have 20 different espresso martinis. It's a big, but we also have a signature cocktail list. So it's not just espresso. We have like 40 different drinks on there. So that's a big variety. We do flights of espresso martinis and stuff. So I just get really excited about staying very close, going to part of the competition. Yeah. Apex. I'll tell you why. If you go and crush against the most competitive best spot in your town and it's doing 700,000 a month, well, that changes how you're going to look at Raleigh. Yeah. Yeah. This data is too valuable. It's almost like if you even if you went out of like if you if we run zoom and you fuck us, Gary, we open it out of business. I didn't fuck you. We now know that you. It's true. It's true. OK, so the last the last little thing is in this concept, we run natural gas lines. And all of our tables are fire pits outside and that's part of the appeal. People sit down at a fire pit table. We make a homemade marshmallows. And our concept is really s'mores by the fire with espresso martini flights. So cool. Yeah. Yeah. And and that's that's what makes final. Crushes the after dinner, right? You become the desert spot. We come in a third spot. That's exactly what it is. The location that we found that we wanted to buy has a kitchen. It has the outdoor space that we can turn into fire pits. That's been our hardest thing is finding like a place that we can have indoor and outdoor area, put natural gas lines down and have the ideal outdoor space. Use the location 11 minutes in the bougie place as the preview to if you have to be in New York and innovate on the idea. Mark, oh my gosh. Yeah, genius. I like bring out the little thing in the middle of the table where people can do like make treat it like your New York location. It makes me like this spot more. Less capital expensive. Yeah. Yeah. Going to answer so many fucking questions if you think you're onto something. Yeah. Mm hmm. And it's so close to you that even if you guys are wrong, you'll will it to a decent outcome. I love it. And we do the tabletop fire pits inside. Well, then you just yeah, we just line up with you. Right. Right. So all right. You're right. We just have to be creative with it. That's cool. You're right. Because how would we expand it to major cities? We're going to have the same problem. How do we find the location? Yeah, we're not going to find out. Outdoor. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Use location number two to answer all the questions I would have if we are on to something. Yeah. Yeah. Don, that makes total sense. Freaking awesome. All right. Cool. I'm even more excited now. One of the things that I told you was how I was building social curator. And one of the things that you had said at the time was something along the lines of, oh, we thought about building that too. And I told you, oh, I'm so glad you didn't build it because I don't want to build. I don't want to be in the game. Gary Vaynerchuk. And then you said something that was a classic Gary juke, which was abundance, abundance. I hope you have competitors because it makes you better. And they never forgot that piece of advice. And when I look back at that experience, the one question I didn't ask was, well, why didn't you build it? But that's not my question today because shame on me for not asking that question then. But presently, when I look at what you have built, and I didn't even know the word holding company existed until 2023. And in my mind, I had this idea of something that I wanted to build. And then I'm now realizing that that is the very thing that you have built. And so knowing what you know now, would you have built the holding company? And if so, if you can go back, what would you do differently? Great question. Yes, I would definitely build it. I'm very good at being wide open and changing my mind in micros, but holding to a strategy and macro. I knew that I wanted to build the best marketing communications company in the world that was global. And that I was open to it being a series of companies or a company. And I was never going to be overly romantic about social media. Right. We started this in 09. It's 24 or 15 years in. I would have said in 15 years, if no one's doing social, then we're doing whatever that thing is. And I continue to do that. So I wasn't romantic about what services we did, how many companies were in the entity, if it was one or a hundred. And more importantly, not romantic about what we did. But I was romantic about being always current. Right. Like, as you know, what's unique about my career is from 2006 to today, there's not a lot of people who have 18 years of on the record, publicly following the flows of innovation, around attention and communication at the same level that I do. And that's really humbling and good. You know. So what would you differently, like now knowing what you know now? I would have probably hired more people with more experience from the industry earlier. I probably didn't need to. I was so romantic. See how romance is a problem. I was so romantic of staying clean with my own intuitive ideas. I demonized people from the outside that did it the old way. And it probably wasted some time on simple things that I could have done by having people around. I deaf. I mean, this is my biggest issue, period, still to this day. I would have fired faster on people I knew weren't capable. It's a real disease of mine, Jess. I'm such a bleeding heart. It's just not good for business. And it's not good for them. Like, because it leads to nepotism and resentment and it never ends up good. Anyway, I think it's a good thing. It never ends up good anyway. I fired them eventually anyway. So that's a huge mistake of mine. I wouldn't have conversations that I had with Andrea when I was asking, how did you court her to come into vener? And I think that early on, like now looking at what vener is, it is a formidable force in the industry. But at the time, so when I look at myself and I know that I want to hire people with experience, but they have optionality. And so what was like a key factor? Could you go back and say, identify the pattern of what? I think you and I have the same skill, which is like, I think you'll be able to convince people to do it. Now you just can't be fixated on one boy. But how did I do it? By being okay with all the people that didn't see it. In the same way I did it when I was a boy, every girl that I thought was cute that didn't want to be with me. In my mind, I was like, they're going to be really sad one day. And oh, are they? So I think you need to take the same approach with this business. You're going to identify someone and you want Ricky Thompson and he's going to say no. And then literally you're like, cool, next. Oh, that feels good. That's it. Who should I be talking to? Who should I be aligning to? Not in not in regards to building a holding company that looks like VaynerX. Anybody with the idea of holding companies? Because what I want to do is I'm not the best at coming up with new ideas, but I'm really good at spotting patterns and then identifying for my strengths and building from there. So when you look at people who've successfully built holding companies out inside or outside of your industry, who is who is the formidable leader? Who is somebody who's creating content? Who is the person that I can learn from in regards to? Well, just as a history lesson from a M&A standpoint and the history of the game, you should definitely talk to James Orsini. I talked to James. So he sent me up. He sent me up really well for this call. Thank you. I would say that's an interesting question. Private equity firms. Okay. Is an industry you should look at. Talent agencies, CAA, UTA, WME. Those are, I would say talent agencies and private equity conglomerates, Apollo, BlackRock. Like dig into those two worlds, private equity and talent representation. They did a lot of M&A. They did a lot of executive stuff. They did a lot of building from a small base to a big base. Those are two good industries for you to focus on. If you were building VNRX again and you had nothing, what would you be doing differently or the same that you did? You look back at yourself and you're like, damn, that was pretty incredible. Or even when I had nothing, I could have leveraged it in a different way. It's a good question. That's a hard question in that what I would say is, if it was today, it's pretty easy for me to answer. I still want to build the same thing, which is in several years, I want this to be this huge conglomerate. What I would do is I would have different services. I would be focusing on AI right now. I'd be focused on things that are of the moment that people don't have figured out that I could build on top of. So good. When we were meeting in Vive and we had lunch, you had said something that I am still trying to wrap my mind around. And I was just like, what you essentially said was, are you going to pick up what I'm putting down? And you talked about acquiring a company like Cracker Jacks or Snapple and taking it from like a $40 million company that was once like a behemoth. And then you turning into a $400 million company based on the principles of people who are actually getting what it is that you're trying to inculcate the current team with. So there's like, it felt like you were drawing a clear line in the sand of people who get it and then those who don't and the people who get it are going to go on to this next iteration. And to me, I felt like, are you building the holding company specifically for that? Or would you just not start focusing on that acquisition? And does the team know that culturally? The team knows people like James and Andrea and other senior leaders that my goal with VaynerX is to build a holding company that is the best marketing company in the world. Then anoint an active CEO and stay on as chairman and then go build a either private equity firm or a holding company of brands and build that company and then take the best players from VaynerX over to the owned and operated businesses from services to owned. And that's been very open in the organization? Yes, it's actually probably been very inspiring to the best players because they are like self selecting like I'm going to be the best and I'm going to go over to Snapple or Reebok when Gary buys it. That's one of the reasons I do believe the 1% of 1% here, you know, are probably here because of that. Wow. Damn. So then how are we, how are you identifying your 1%? I'm in the trenches every day. I'm in freaking, I live this life. That's why I'm in the trenches. Because I know that it's almost like my Navy SEALs, right? Like this is an army, but I'm going to need my Navy SEALs when I go and I'm not willing to guess. That is so, and it's crazy because when I hear that, if I was working there, I would self select and be like, it's bootcamp. I'm going to bootcamp. And so I wonder if that is part of the culture because you know how you build, you build, you attract more with honey. And so I'd like you come from this honey, but then there's also like there's this really sharp edge to what it is that you're doing in the balance of the two as a leader has been really inspiring. And so I wasn't sure how transparent you were with your team being like, oh, we're a honeycomb, but make no mistake. Honey empire, you've heard it, you know, it's built here. But within the empire, what you're saying is also as a leader is this, this honeycomb is not going to be the honeycomb that I, that is the next thing that I built. It's so empowering for me to see. And it's really invigorating because I want to be that transparent. With my team. And so I don't want to have myself a false narrative and I see you do it and it's positive and it's successful. And then you have somebody who's literally creeping on the call being like truth facts giving you an amen. That's exactly the culture. This has been so, so, so helpful. Howard, thanks. Good, good man. Thank you so much for the time, obviously, and putting together James and Andrea for Vive. It's been a pleasure to be here. I think it's, you know, like week two exceeded my expectations. Never mind, here we are like, reforce the way through it. So thank you for doing that as well. That makes me so happy. We really want a lot of confidence in it. And it's not the easiest thing to like deliver on given, you know, there's a real fee behind it. But man, we knew, we knew it, you know, I think it's a great thing to do. Yeah, so thank you for that. It's been awesome. Good. But yeah, anyways, little just quick context to catch you back up to speed. Franchise or of get up and go kayaking, we have 32 locations now, four different states. Most of them are in Florida, but Texas, Tennessee and North Carolina are the others. Really just focused on a couple of things. Free up a little bit of my mental capacity to focus on growing the business. But one of the big questions I had is about turning a commodity like kayak tours into more of a community. Like how do I, how do I turn my customers into a community? How do I turn my customers into a community? How do I turn my customers into a community? How do I turn my customers into a community? Like how do I, how do I turn my customers into super fans? What are things that you would do to make that happen? I think extending the story, meaning, you know, creating a digital, creating a digital infrastructure, whether it's on text, whether it's on a closed Facebook group, like, you know, a discord. Where can you put everyone digitally? That they can interact with you and them is like a really big deal. Yeah. Yeah, we do, we do the closed Facebook and the text group. And those have been great. I love just popping on the text group and talk to me a little bit more about that. So if you've done that, what, what's going on with that and what hasn't allowed that to feel like a community to you? Yeah, I think it's mostly because I'm the one initiating the conversation and I want them to initiate the conversation. So how do I get them more engaged from that side of things, you know, similar to the way that you text your community? Like I'll just show up randomly and say, hey, I hope you're having a good Tuesday, you know, and a lot of people reply being like, oh my God, thanks so much. And it's amazing, but like, how do I get them to initiate that, you know, as I think the next level of community? Yeah, I mean, I think, I think you and where and do you have a discord or no? No discord. No, just the Facebook group and the texting group. And what's happening with the Facebook group? Facebook group, we typically like repurpose some of our content so that it's more Facebook-ish friendly, you know, not as like, we'll repurpose a lot of our blog content in shorter form just to deliver. Hey, here's five restaurants we recommend in this area or here's some other things you can do while you're visiting this area. And it's just been a lot of us kind of giving tips and little like local knowledge things in there. But again, it's it's a lot of us being the ones that are initiating the conversation. Yeah, I mean, I think doing Q&A sessions, doing this, like Google Meetout, like get more physical, go to that text group and Facebook group and put out a Google URL hangout and be like, I'm here next Wednesday, the 14th from seven to 10 answering questions. I think that will take you to the next level. Cool. Yeah, it will work. And you pulled off of it and then you record it and then you take a snippet from it and then you post it on social and you tell people how to sign up for the text to get into this, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Thanks. Next question I've got for you. So I've heard you say a few times like reporting on brand is kind of like Santa Claus, right? Like it's it's this thing that it's hard to put a met that actually think it's more like love and God. I think it's like real. Okay. But impossible to measure measure. Yeah. Santa Claus is fake, obviously. Love is probably the one I probably want to like love. I think you and I would sit here and say, because with even with God, you can get a little fluffy, but I think love. Yeah. If you and I said, is that a good thing? Is it powerful? Does it matter? I mean, the shit that people do for love is everything, right? That's how I feel about brand. It's everything. Yeah. But how to measure that? Justin, who do you love? My wife, my mom. Start with that. Your wife. What's what point? What math are you play? It's what? Yeah. Yeah. That's brand, brother. Yeah. I can't I can't measure. You know, right now, my brand right now, I'm going to keep it humble, but not like, like, not too humble. Right now, there's a hundred conversations going on in the world about me. Where someone's saying something, 87 percent, probably positive, which is going to be good. So on the franchise or side of like selling my brand to people, you know, how do I what do I focus on your efforts? Who you like that becomes about you, like the content, like how you do it? Like, like, it just becomes like the demand. They care about their perception on how much demand you can create. Right? Yeah. The franchise or, you know, is going to make a decision based on the demand you can create. So for example, I would focus a lot on your ability to be good at 20 mile social media marketing, because if you're pushing me and you're like, Hey, let me show you a screen. I'm going to do all this shit within a 20 mile radius of Manhattan for you. I'm like, Oh, shit. Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. That's the that's it. Because you're in a thing that people are passionate about. Like people actually like a lot of people would actually love to run this business. Right? Because you're in an extreme passion point. Your issue is you've got to convince them that you can help them get customers. Yeah. Got it? Yeah. That's your business. Yeah. And I guess I can just use the the history of the business and the history of the other franchisees as as that leverage, right? And I would I would always pitch them modern examples. Okay. Like if you spent an extra 30 minutes of like doing some screenshots of back end Facebook ads, like where do you sit on that skill set? Yeah, I feel like I'm above average with everything ad related. Yeah. So I would make an above average two minute video or 10 page deck per franchise or or like groups of franchise or is like if you did an event just in Colorado and there's 21 perspectives there on zoom or in a room in that video or deck, you're showing seven miles from Boulder. This piece of content. Why are all the day trading attention shit like them? You're a marketer. Yeah. Yeah. This year we have, you know, thanks to day trading attention, we have over probably 120 million organic views already. So it's been. Has day trading attention helped? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I have a community manager also and and I forced her to read it. I was like, Gary's saying it's the, you know, it's his onboarding tool for his own employees. Like you've got to read it. And so she's read it and she does a lot of our socials and we've just been crushing it. Say that like it really helped her. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. It's great. And I enjoyed it too. I'm not much of a reader. So I listened to the audio version of it. I love all the little tangency take on there too, which is fun. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. Awesome. Cool. One other thing too. So Manny is Manny is actually helping us do a mascot and I really, yeah, we talked, we talked at 4Ds last year about, you know, how important mascots are. You brought up the Duolingo example and I kind of went down a rabbit hole of like. And how'd you get to me? I'm, I'm, I'm not a fan of the Duolingo. How'd you get to me? I'm, I'm, I'm Andrea and James hooked me up with Manny. So yeah, it was perfect. But next step is like, okay, we've got the mascot. Like how do we introduce this to our community? What are the ways that we actually leverage this mascot in a way that like, I feel like we fall on more of the high end luxury side of kayak tours. We do, you know, clear kayaking and the price point is higher than most kayak tours. If not all kayak tours in our area, like how do I introduce it in a way that's not like too childish and feels, you know, but still makes sense as a mascot. You got to try different shit. Okay. I would go to TikTok where you can get away with it. Yeah. And try a bunch of different fucking shit. Okay. Consume all the Duolingo stuff, all the Jake from State Farm stuff, Geico, just consume and then replicate and see what it does. Okay. Consume, replicate with the interpretation of your world. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And do you think that's in the in the form of like actually building like a physical mascot like Duolingo has or do you keep it digital? I think so. Okay. Or or you go very AI, you know, like, yeah, I think I mean, both could work. But I think with your product, I think just by nature, it's funny to see a big fucking like character fall off a con. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Last quick one for you. We had our call with Damon John a couple weeks ago, which was awesome. And he had brought up something that kind of stuck with me a little bit that something like it's 25 times more expensive to obtain new customers than it is to kind of like upsell current customers or just retain your current customers. Yeah. So like, how do I do a better job of this? This get people into Google. This goes back to the first part. That's your community thing. Yeah. Just give a fuck. Yeah. Text all of them and ask them what their birthday is if you don't have it. Yeah. Like it's scaling unscalable behavior. Yeah. Both. It's this. Yeah, literally. I mean, like this is beyond not ROI positive for me. Yeah. But like I want the karma. I want the good, you know. Yeah. I started talking with Dr. Natasha. Yes. And she has been like working with me in more deep way to understand how I react in the past. Right. And you know, like be less judgment with myself. Judgement with yourself. I just got done doing a podcast literally 30 minutes ago where half of the conversation I had was about people being judgmental to others, which actually then leads to them being judgmental in themselves, even at a young age. Okay. And that being judgmental in yourself. And some people are not judgmental of others, but they are on themselves. Yes. And it is, I'm so happy to hear that. I would argue that all of my happiness comes from the fact that I'm not judgmental of myself. That I give myself a lot of grace. Yes. And I think most people do not. Yeah. I don't know, Gary, when you are an entrepreneur, you are super hard on yourself, right? You're, you're accountable because there's nowhere to hide. Correct. Yeah. But for me, losing is a requirement. Okay. And most people try to avoid losing at all costs. Correct. I'm always ready to lose everything, let alone little things, a bad deal, a bad probe. Five. Yes. After I was done working with James and Andre, my brain goes to what happens if you didn't say this, I know it's going well, but what if it didn't? I already made the mental commitment that I would have to spend a lot of time making it up to you and everybody else, which was a stupid thing because my time is very valuable. Yeah. But I was willing to go there and my body and emotion had already been prepared for it not to work. Correct. Exactly. Got it. So as you can imagine, it's just the way I see the world. I'm always prepared to lose. But in that, if you are in that position, you are like on the defensive way all the time. Believe it or not, it's the reverse. I'm prepared for it, which then makes me grateful for when things are going well. It's actually the reverse. It's counterintuitive. It's not crippling. It's just preparation. And in fact, it leads to enormous gratitude. By virtue of how I've lived my life, I'm deeply grateful. Every day my parents don't die is a good day. Every day my company doesn't go out of, you know, really though, it becomes your perspective. Yeah, totally. Yeah, yeah. I agree. And this is interesting, Gary, because I don't know if I'm having the right attitude, but since we sold the company, I don't have the same... Fire. Yeah. ...or fire. Is that correct? I think so. Normally, this goes back to giving yourself grace today. Okay. You don't have the same passion and fire today. It doesn't mean forever. Of course you don't. How could you? Yeah. But I feel bad with myself, because I should be like in the front line, like moving the team that are behind me, you know, like pushing them hard. You can't judge yourself for passion. That'd be like judging yourself for not falling in love with somebody who's good on paper. Okay. You know what I mean? Yeah, I am. You can't do that. It's just not something that's controllable. Okay. You know? So I don't have to feel bad because of that. Yeah. Did you see how I reacted? It doesn't even cross my mind that you could. It's a different game. Yeah, yeah, totally. It's a different game. No. Now, being accountable and responsible and grinding through, but judging yourself for this lack of same passion, that's crazy. Okay. That's an impossible requirement. Yeah, but I wonder if I'm going to fail the same fire that I used to fail for my first company. Of course. The answer is you might not. That's okay. Not trying to is the problem. Okay. Not ever, like, not ever feeling that same way. That's just how life plays. Yes. Sometimes your first, think about all the people whose first love was who they should have married. Right? You just don't know. Yes, exactly. But when you're ready to look for the next thing, not trying to find that fire again, that's a loss if you're capable. But don't fear that you'll let, like, you can't have sellers remorse. It's over. Yeah. Right? Yeah, maybe. It's the least practical emotion of all time. Yes. The least practical emotion is looking backwards. Yes. I'm sure it's. It's just. Maybe I do, but with myself, people don't. Bad. Yeah. That's exactly right. Yeah. Instead of being grateful, there's eight billion people on earth. 700 million of them don't have access to clean water. Yeah. The way you've account, the fear life. That, but that's what you got. This is about perspective. Yeah, totally, totally. Maybe I'm focusing in some more things. 100. Of course. Yeah. That's okay. You're a human being. We all get caught up in that. But that's not what you should be thinking about. Yeah. And what do you think will be my. My perspective after we finish the program? Yeah. Oh, the the vibe. Yeah. The vibe. I think everyone's going to get different things out of it. Yeah. Like there's one sentence and like this is what's so amazing about the program. We could have one of the things we just talked about could be more valuable than everything else. Yes. Dr. Natasha James on Organset, Andre introducing. So like that's why we're so confident. Yes. There's so many pillars of value and every person's on a different journey. You know, I just spoke to Jasmine and you like I got more today like people are in different places. Yeah. My hope is that it's relationships and perspective and strategy. There's just so many places. What do you feel that you're getting the most out of it? Self-awareness? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Guess what? The single most valuable thing one can learn. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's true. Okay. Really? Okay. Okay. And relationship, you know, like I get excited about knowing that if you email me in seven years, Gary, I saw you with this person. I need them for my new company. That's what I get excited about. Okay. You know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, something that interesting that I've been thinking in the past days, like over the few years in the relationship we have with Vaynergroup, we have been growing as a company, as a person. And actually I was in a meeting this morning here in the conference room and we learned a project that I've been chasing for two months. I was like, how please give me this project. And I don't know. Every time that I put up my feet here, magic comes. You know, it's like, you have something. You have something every year in my life. I think it's good intent. I'm a little, I believe in spirituality and like the things we can't see a little bit more than most. Yeah. It's good intent. I think most things are, especially in business, are not well intended. Yeah. You know? Yeah. It's true. I leave a lot, a lot, a lot of money on the table for that something special. A lot. Yeah. Okay. It costs money to create something special. I usually sleep with that. By not trying to maximize on money. Yeah. I promise you, you saying that sentence makes me feel better than an extra couple of bucks. That's how, for me. But if somebody else wants to make more money than that star, you know. Yeah. I'm just comfortable in my self-awareness. I know what makes me tick. Okay. You're fantastic. I just want to say thank you, Gary. And I have thousands of questions for you. To be honest, I don't know how to deal with this. Like, be in front of you. Like, this is new for me, right? And I just need a good advice because I have few mentors. James is one of them. But I want to have a good advice about the trip remersion because I'm about to start my second company. I have a lot of fears inside me. Thou's about me. You know. I don't know why. You know, listen. It's DNA. It's how you were parented. Circumstances. It's okay. We all have them. And different reasons, different ways. You might know something real that you're not willing to like fully get out of the back of your head yet. So, you know what I mean? You may know that you don't, for example, even spending a few minutes with you, you know what it takes. So you might, one of your fears is that you don't have the same fire in your belly because it requires that. And I feel that I want to cry because I said this is not me. Now you're set on your idea? Yeah. Set? It's set. Yeah. Maybe it's not the right idea. And maybe you know it. Okay. Right? Yeah. You know what I mean? Yes. Trust your instincts. It's, even if it costs you, like, do you know how many times I've spent like real money and then at the last minute pull the plug? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Is it necessary as an entrepreneur to give that change to give the block like? Is it, is it a requirement to be willing to pull the plug? 100%. If you really feel like the idea is not as good as, you might not like the idea as much as you still, that's why you don't have the fire. Well, I cannot start my company right away because you know, of course. So I'm starting losing a block in order to start. Do you like the idea? I have the idea. You like it? Yeah, I like it. Do you love it? Not yet. That, that in that is everything. That's what we need to figure out. I need to go to the next one. Yeah. Write down all your questions for me, even if it's 130 of them. Perfect. And email it to me and I'll schedule some more time. Thank you so much. We have 15 minutes and I have two questions for you. The first is a personal question, one for me. And then the second one I actually source from my audience if they can ask you anything. So the second one is for the group. So my first question actually expands and I brought this because I need you to sign it. Afterwards, for right now, yes. I want to make sure I spell this right. All right. You're amazing. Thank you. Close. Okay. So my first question is about a scenario that you talked in this book and I'm going to quote you. I'm hoping that the people in this scenario are two years away from writing a book versus two months from writing a book because then that's going to give them a much better chance of achieving what they want. So two years from now, I would love to publish a children's book and you are in the middle, yes, of launching Meet Me in the Middle. So I'm really curious what you did two years ago, two, three years ago to prepare for today, for now to have a successful book launch. I am masked more skills of creating awareness and the masked more audience depth to have the ability to create conversion. Right. So a success, lots of people, like if you come up with a great story, you have the capacity of getting a publisher to be excited about writing a children's book. Having a successful children's book is a whole different game. It's called being able to sell. Publishers can't sell. This is the great misnomer that they publish industry. Literally, they do literally no selling. You would think, I mean, I thought when I wrote Crush It, they have their sales team are order takers. They don't sell to Barnes and Nobles. They just take how many books Barnes and Nobles tell them they want. So I think the key to think about is not just being able to achieve getting a book made, which is a B2B behavior, serendipity, subjective opinions, the B2C part of actually being able there. I think the question becomes whether it's podcast or newsletter or discord or social media, like how are you going to build an audience that will come first? So for the last 18 months, I've been focused on organic growth. And it's gone well. I'm really happy about that. And I want to continue to grow the community because I understand the commerciality of it, that you need a marketable platform. Do you, through all of your books, you've written so many and so many bestsellers, do you have a formula that you go back to when it comes, like you have a 24 month formula of just growth, growth, growth, growth. And then what is your game plan when you know the shelf date? When I really want to sell, I incentivize bulk behavior. When you write the book, if you say, for everybody, I'm going to create a 50 girls club. For everybody who buys 50 copies of the book to give to all their nieces and nephews and donate to schools and whatever the heck you want to do with it. For the first 50 people that buy 50 of these books on pre-order and email me the receipt to prove it, we're going to get together once a month for the next three months, all 50 of us, with me for five hours every once a month with all 50 people in a private room in a restaurant or wherever that you figure out, you could afford to do that. So that would be a four instance to talk about mom life or mom balancing business life or the context of your book. So bundling experiences that create scale sales and also the book getting out there by word of mouth from the people that actually bought it by you trading access to you. Okay, that's so interesting. And so it was a direct to consumer behavior, but you're driving bulk. Yeah, this is a good example that I have to give you. I sold 100,000 copies of Ask GaryVee in the first week. And that was so this was back in 2016. The top left corner is how many books were sold on book scan that week. I sold 100,000 copies. The second biggest book in the world that week sold 11,000 copies. And you did this with your I did it with what I just told you. There were so many different ways to buy 25 books or 50 books or 100 books and just a lot of people did it. But it's I had to sacrifice my biggest asset, which was time. Okay. That's fascinating. So but you have you have millions of when did you start doing this? Yeah, you know what's so funny? I mean, like I sold less copies of the trading attention that I did there. That was eight years ago, but much bigger now. Yeah. Did you do the bulk? Not really. That's when I knew I wrote a really good book and I'm a little too busy. You wrote a textbook. Yeah. And it was like a good one. Like I knew I was about to help a lot of people and like the word of mouth would carry it. But in that scenario, if you have 100 people that think you're the best, you're off to the races. Is there a number in your mind that you would say this this makes a commercially successful book? Is it different from children's books? It is. The answer is what are you trying to make happen? So if you're trying to be in a New York Times, New York Times with a selling list for vanity or brand leverage, then there's some number. I don't know what that is in kids books yet. If you're just trying to make it a financial instrument, well, that's actually based on your advance. Yeah. All right. All right. Thank you. I'm going to pivot to my second question because I want to make the most of our time. My second question is around personal branding. And why do you think it's important for corporate executives? It's a two-part question. Why do you think it's important for corporate executives to build their brand? And how is it a benefit to the brands that they serve? I'll go to the harder question. Number two. Yeah. People buy from people. It is. I mean, I'm not going to go to the extreme of Elon Musk and Tesla. But even, I mean, I see it every day on LinkedIn, B2B SaaS companies where the head of product makes a video and people like that they're wearing a ship. I literally know this story when I'm about to tell you to be true. A head of product made a boring video that had 70 freaking views on LinkedIn, but he was wearing a bear's t-shirt and somebody bought their SaaS product because they're a bear's fan too. Yeah. Because people buy from people. Yeah. On the first part, there's endless reasons why. Right. Corporate executive knows, one, if you have a personal brand that's called reputation, it leads to a bigger demand market. If God forbid you get fired out of nowhere, it's two, two, if you do it, really do it, it becomes what I am. We become a practitioner of marketing. The biggest issue for corporate executives is they're living in ivory towers. The reason we're so unstoppable is because I'm, I, the CEO of the company and in the craft, like literally, literally in the craft, meaning this is me literally writing the copy to a post at 11 o'clock this morning. Yeah. So what really gets great about building a personal brand in social is if you're the practitioner of it, you actually learn skills by building your personal brand that you can deploy against the logo. Yeah. I believe this and I think you're spot on. I actually think it would be a really interesting post or a reel that I've been thinking about is how creating content actually made me better in the boardroom. I promise you it's incredibly needed and your voice is needed on it. Yeah. It's a practitioner shift. It's also a minority opinion right now and I think, Of course. And I think that that's the, the challenging thing is. The good news is all the best opinions start as minorities. Yeah. There's not a single, when I wrote Crush It, that book Top of the Corner, I wrote it in 08, came out in 09. The premise of that book is basically you can make money being an influencer. Yeah. Basically. The first hundred responses to the idea was this is complete and utter bullshit. Nobody can make $100,000 a year on YouTube. What a time. What a time. So I think that the best part of that is you'll have the receipts. Yeah. For your young woman. Yeah. I have people who literally, and I screenshot them. So I have the receipts that are like, I, I love Bugaboo now because you're a mom and you talk about being a mom and running this solar company. I'm empathetic to why any board would be scared that a CEO or any CEO would be scared that a CMO becomes the face of the brand. Yeah. But then they're quick to give a celebrity money who's just a rented one. Like it's crazy. Yeah. They have it so bad. Yeah. That's a sound might get right there. Right. Right. We're not going to let, we're going to keep our CMO down because we don't want her to get too big. And then she might go to Coca-Cola. Right. But let's go give four times more money to somebody who we rent for an hour. Right. I never thought of it that way. I just like my mind is blown right now because that is that celebrity and influencer. That's. Today. That's a very winnable sentence in a board. That that's like back pocket. Yeah. I want to give it to you. Yeah. I appreciate that. Thank you. You're welcome. I have to, I want you to know that I've taken pages out of day trading attention, have brought it directly to my team and we have completely re-evolved how we approach our experiences and our events to be social first. Love. And what do you call it? The sawdust. Yes. Yes. I'm like, what is the sawdust? I only, I'm literally leaving right this second. Yeah. To do a Barnes and Noble book signing for this. I know, I'm going with. For one reason. Yeah. The content. Yeah. One. Yeah. All the other nice stuff, shake, shake hand, kiss some babies, thrilled. Definitely not to sell books. Right. Right. 50 books. Like that's a, that's like a. So you approach everything through the lens of how does this become a snackable content? When Fortune 5000. Yeah. Companies realize that organic social creative is the disproportionate most important part of the entire media mix is when they will start to grow. Every company is allocating 80% of their marketing budget to working media dollars to amplify bad content. Yes. That's another thing that we did is we took our best performing organic pieces and we started running them. As performance. Yes. For informants. Go figure. Yes. Miraculously. And then we're looking at the data and they're like the ones that we created are outperforming in terms of click and view. Seconds viewed. And I'm like, it's working. It's working. Yeah. I mean, the best part about me writing books is I write them after I proved it. Yeah. I'm not guessing. Right. Creating proof of concept. What are you working on next? Honestly, I'm a very deep in COO life. You know, I'm CEO. Yeah. I'm operationalizing us to be the best in the world at this. Yeah. That's it. I wanted to tell you one of your newest ventures that you have. Vive. Yes. I'm in this program. Yes. Has unlocked so many things for me. That's awesome. I believe in it so much. Yeah. And it's it's it's it relates to my second question, which is why personal branding why investing in this what it can do how to do it the right way. What are the tactics for the tools? And I've also gotten so much from the personal coaching aspect. Yes. I'm working with Natasha. Yeah. And she's created this tailored individual business plan for me. And thank you. Thank you for having me as part of the in our class. Yes. Of course. And thank you for your time and thank you for sharing and being so generous. Yeah. So such a pleasure. How are things? Things are good. You have a black eye. Yes. I took an elbow and basketball. Oh, good. Good. How are you happy it wasn't on your way up here to meet with me because you were so excited. You read so fast. How are things? Things are good. Got this yesterday. Thank you so much. Yeah. Looking forward to all. I'm so happy to talk to you. Let's get started. Yeah. What can what can I answer for you? What will bring you the most value? Of course, it's what I don't know that I need to know. Yep. I met you 11 years ago at a Tony Robbins conference. Yep. Went back to my room that night, got on Facebook, started running ads. That's $360 million later. And here we are. I didn't take all that advice. That's amazing. But I got in touch with the customers. Did something that was pretty rare, able to build a brand, few brands actually to national without outside capital and without selling my soul? Yep. I remember our chat over at 35 Hudson Yards. So I, you know, the whole retail media, all this stuff. What is there anything into, is there anything that you'd love to double click on? Is it the advertising? It is the business strategy? Is it staffing? Is it anything? Any? Yeah. Yeah. Business. Business. Yeah. Yeah. Business strategy. There's been obviously a lot of changes over the years, especially with social media and all of that. So we always wanted to make our product available to everyone in this country that needed it. So it was, we put it in a store next to them. They could run down and get that product. They didn't have to wait for shipping. The whole game has changed. Now that Amazon's in there, they're oftentimes getting shipping same day. We still need to get the word out. So, you know, Curious about the best way to invest to do both. We have to build the brand awareness. We also have to build that customer path to purchase. I think it's all based, I mean, I literally did an offsite last week in Los Angeles with a small team building out a deck where, let me give you this example, back to competing with bigger things. This is a little bit off the record, but I want to give you value. Gap is a multi-billion-dollar company. Gap Inc. So it's Gap. It's what's in their portfolio, Banana Republic, and one more in there. So it's a big business. And then there's a t-shirt company called Cuts. Cuts is a brand new t-shirt company in the last five years. They only do a hundred revenue. Cuts spends a year on organic social media. Yeah. On organic. Do you know cakes, which is like the sprawl, the Spanx, they have grown a hundred revenue this year from up to a hundred. They're only a couple years old because they made a full commitment to organic social media. Okay. When you do organic, the AI of the news feed, the algorithm, the feed, is so good now over the last 24 months, it shows you what's good content. And then, so you're building brand, but then you take that good content and you turn it into performance ads. Okay. We're doing that on a limited. We're running two content posts a week right now with Sasha. And I'm thinking we need to do much more and continually test and learn, test and learn, take it. My, my belief is that quote unquote Sasha, hopefully when we're at our best, we know what are we're doing. The issue is we think that there's an extreme under investment in creative, organic, and an over investment in media that is wasted on creative that could have been better. So let's break it down. How much does your business right now spend on including Sasha fees? Include, you know, how much do you spend on social media, organic, creative? No, about So that's how much do you spend on media? Oh, goodness. Much, much less than that. We're about So what's the net number? How much do you spend on media? We just did a change up. It's it's close to about Got it. So and so that's it. That's what you spent on marketing though. So, you know, three, yeah, yeah. Overall, all marketing overall is under Ever of our gross revenues. That's Do you do revenue or do you do more or less? Yeah. So we're In revenue. Understood. So where's the other Going? Oh, goodness. Geez, off the top of my mind, it's more going to our retailer. The shopper spends that they do the shopper marketing plans. They're not nearly as effective. I know. But you have social that runs through the ad targeting through the Facebook and the Stay in the store, right? Yes. Just looking at one thing. Yeah. So to me, the question The question is how do we get What the the that's spent on media is that pure performance or is that amplification of the brand content from Sasha? It's it's both. It's yeah, it's both. I want to want. Yeah, we definitely want the brand awareness. So we're doing meta, which, you know, does but the strong hook Picked up is good for us to problem solver is captivating. They're learning from that. We're not doing anything on creative. Are you doing Myself, I post about five times a week across a few different platforms. I've always enjoyed the community part of it. I'm going to get a I'm texting the team to do an audit and everything Sasha's doing just to see if there's anything that we can maximize there. I know one thing Gary. Everybody's happy if they hear about us and they want walk into a store to buy our product or they come to buy it from us or they go to Amazon, right? There's 100 million homes out there and a good 70% of them, I think could use our product if they if they learned about it. How much how many podcasts are you going on a week or a month or a year? Not enough. Maybe three a year. Three year. Yeah. I think that's probably the biggest strategic focus. I think you should be going on podcast just for the content. Yeah. Just for the content. I would go on even tiny podcasts that are in your niche to hitting, hitting the kind of right demo just so that we can post produce the content from the thing for more. I think that's the key. My number one performing wine text ad is me doing the radio show. Yeah. Well, some of our best content has been when I've made something or and it was just impromptu thing that turned out. I think more of you. So you don't have a lot more money to spend on making more, but you have your time. Which makes more. Got it? In my heart. Yeah. I mean, listen, the whole company's built on your intent. That's that to me is already secondary. That's a given. Nobody knows your intent or heart if they don't see you. Through that. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think the most practical thing on those numbers of them spending, you know, the advertising, I think the right move for you is to spend more time on podcasts and then clipping the clips from those podcasts and putting them into organic. And when they do well and organic, turning them into a performance ad. That's great. That's the that's the thing I would do if I bought the business tomorrow and we were partners. That's what I would spend my time on. Okay. What else? That is a good to know. I think that's the one because what we need is more content from you. Yeah. But you don't have the dollars to spend on it. And before I just got a lot of ideas from your book. Thank you. The section in there of all the examples of golden. I've got a list of things to do. Look, I think I think the founder story is doing better and better and better. And I think that that would really benefit from you being on a podcast once a week with the intent of getting one to three clips out. Okay. So now we've got to figure out how to get you on those podcasts. Got it. Well, yeah. Are you able to look at the podcast rankings on Spotify and and Apple and in your categories of health, wellness, all that stuff business, whatever it might be, female empowerment, entrepreneurship, all of it. I think you should make a list of, you know, all the things you could see yourself on and then we could maybe I can call in some favors and we should attack it. Great. I love it. I have one one question. Please. I'm a visionary. You're a visionary. I heard you so many years ago. You said where things were going. I met Brian Chatsky. And he told me if you do nothing but vision, focus on your vision, think of it. Talk about it. Hire around it. Align resources around it. You'll have a billion dollar business within 10 years. I didn't take his advice because I thought, well, that's an easy thing to say. What advice do you have for entrepreneurs wanting to start something? They had this big idea. They want to change the world. What would you say that they need to harness that into communicating to if you want to change the world, you need to talk. Talk to the world. I have big ambitions to change the world. I talk to the world every day. Amen. Articulating a vision in a way people can see it and taste it is much harder than most entrepreneurs realize. I think that's a brilliant statement. And then the other thing is many that can articulate it don't say it often enough in enough places at scale. Yeah. That's where you're at right now. Yes. I need you out and about. I need more content from you and I want it to be free, which is in essence, is you going on podcast. That's golden. I think so. Karen, remind me where do you live? I'm in North Carolina. That's right. That's right. Yeah. NASCAR country. Oh, I know. Well, I'm on the board of Bojangles. I'm right around the corner from Kid Rock's place. And yeah, we're just the great community here. The amazing community. I'm going to follow up with Sasha to see if there's anything tweaks there, but I need you to focus on podcasting. Email me if you need anything. Thank you.
