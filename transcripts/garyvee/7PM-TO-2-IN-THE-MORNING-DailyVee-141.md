## Transcript
I want to call this chapter the one variable that allows somebody to crush it. I'm from mom and casual. Down to that ground like gravel. Coming back around like a lasso. Macro, like a vision boy. I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Gary V. Tabba motherfuckers, I've been telling you. Counts was talking about equity. I'm trippin' like I'm giving a pedigree. And me and I'm special, my specialty. I'm puttin' the work, tellin' I'm dirtin' the earth. I'm movin' furniture to tackle. There he is. Yo, how you doin'? Life is good. I'm in SF, going to Uber's headquarters and then I'm flying to LA and taking a red-eye to Miami. Okay, good. Alright, so I'll see you tomorrow. I'll hit you up. Have a good session. Alright, bye. These early days. Early days of building anything. Oh, quick shout out to everybody who left the comment. Thank you for educating me. It's the fourth wall, DRock. It's not the third wall. Fourth wall that I'm breaking. Makes a lot more sense, actually. That's the fourth. One, two, three. I got it. I was right. You were wrong. That. You were right. You was right, right? Oh, no, diamonds stands in the future. What? Future? I got it. I'm a dummy dancer. DRock, I don't know why you're creeping up on my shit, but once in a while I do really nondescript tweets. I haven't done it in a long time. I'm going to have to go back to my 2009, 2010, 2011 stuff. They're basically once in a while little things that I put out that I want to recall seven or eight years from now. I think what I've been able to understand through the years is consumer behavior, what people respond to, what they care about. I think I'm on the verge of doing some interesting stuff and a lot of different genres. I think about it like hacking culture. I think about you know what's emerging in culture and how do you infiltrate it and bring it more value. I use the word hack as a positive. I think that a lot of the Silicon Valley hack culture has created some of the greatest products in the world, whether it's Nuba or Facebook and Airbnb, Google going back. I tweet stuff sometimes that would be fun to look back at. I think being in Silicon Valley right now put me in the mood of that hack term. I'm going to go up the first one and the third one. That one and that one. And the third one. There's only one. Look, a lot of things have changed since I wrote Crush It. Mainly the fact that when I wrote it nobody knew what the hell I was really talking about and now it's established in our society that if you are the foremost expert in Alph, the TV show, the social networks of the world have become so big that it's not just YouTube anymore that you've got all these different platforms that allow you to amass an audience and you can make a living. The amount of people that are making six figures a year on Instagram is baffling to anybody who's not looking under the hood. Influencer marketing is now a foundation to our society and that's a monetization strategy that was very difficult to comprehend for a lot of people back before. Just got some nuts. You didn't have to get out of the... I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Just got some crappy business news. Nothing bad at all. Just a good old fashioned business. But I was quiet for like 17 minutes and totally changed the vibes of our trip. I transform into airport Gary. Wait a minute. Where did the... This was the only time? Okay. This is cool? Steph, I'll tell you what's really been obvious to me since Crush It, which is that 7pm to 2 in the morning thing, it's everything. Can I tell you it's everything? We're only going to be so pretty. We're only going to be so funny. We're only going to be so charismatic. We're only going to be so talented in what we do. No question the variable of success in the last decade as I became a poster child of entrepreneurship and crushing it and hustle. The people that have outworked the other people have succeeded at a much higher variable. And I'm sure we'll hear about those stories when we profile people that crushed it. I basically want to say something like from October 7th, 2009, I don't know what date the book came out, until today I have worked so hard, so much, more than I did when I wrote Crush It. And it is... And I've been documenting it in my daily V-Vlog. The lack of patience that so many people deployed against Crush It was the reason so many people failed. If you're reading this book and you started something in 2010 because Crush It motivated you and you failed, my belief is that you didn't put in enough work or you didn't do it around your passion or you just weren't talented enough. But the one that you can control the most was your work ethic. And when I audited people through the last decade that hadn't succeeded, they weren't working as hard as it actually takes. 7pm to 2am is a real conversation.
