## Transcript
Alright vlog, this is super weird. For two reasons. One, I'm the one filming in Ducati 2. We're consuming beverages, which is very rare, but this is the biggest thing. We never have downtime. We're 15 minutes early for my VaynerSports meeting and I'm like, doesn't let me buy you a drink. He was all freaked out. My VDN has a take. He's got that vodka hit you with this system. Got a couple of bubbles, bougie style. Alright, let's keep this episode going. I'm doing press until 8pm I think. Radio row, pat mac at me, like lots of stuff. We'll go through the commercials. We're doing commercials first. We'll set you up as, you know, you kind of know a little bit about VDN and this thing, and they're really important this year. Is there anything that you'd love for me to ask? Honestly, you know your audience so well. Whatever is good for them is good for me. I'm seeing ads are going for $7 million. Is that worth it? I think it's the biggest deal in marketing. I am known in the marketing land as the social media guy, as the digital guy. As a matter of fact, I spent a lot of time telling people I think most commercials are overpriced. Here's the difference. Everybody of the 200 million people that are going to watch want to watch the commercials in the Super Bowl during real life. They don't. It's a value at 7 million. I know that sounds crazy, America. It's a value at 7 million. Having it on CBS, we are thrilled. We're thrilled. We'll be back a little bit later in the newscast. We're so good. Fabulous of course. We're so good. Where are we going? Jim Rowe. Is this the way to go? He's on a big set. That's great. That first segment was probably my best TV performance of all time because if I tell you what was going on in our years. We have mixed minus FYI. Great job with that. Thank you. What happened? Their feedback was of us delayed so I could barely hear her. Oh no. That close to her. Is this hearing on CBS Sports.com? Yes. They're doing a social. One of my own? 9.20. Oh we got plenty of time. I would love a coffee then. I'm going on a Jim Rowe show right now so I'll be back after my 10 minute hit. My brother. How you doing? Great to see you. How you doing? I'm well. This is remarkable for the sport and for all the people that are crying about it you're in control of your consumption. You got it in show mode. I did. Just did Jim Rowe. When I do sports radio I become a sports radio guy. Steelers have tons of bandwagon fans because they win all the time. Right. Steeler fans piss me off Jim. How about bandwagon fans? Do they piss you off too? Especially Steeler bandwagon fans. I want to apologize to the Steeler fans not really but I got hot. Coming to big events like this it's not parties. It's business development, networking. Why is it important to come to mega events? What are some of the things you look for from a business standpoint? Time efficiency. So I'm going to have 7 to 12 meetings here that would have taken me two different flights 10 hours to accomplish that will happen in 4 hours. So just pure meeting time efficiency. Then serendipity. There will be 4 to 7 relationships I make at this Super Bowl that where people I talk to on digital but we never connected. Random people that we get 30 minutes randomly over a glass of wine. And even parties. You know as you know, because you know me I don't love them. But I'll go with the purpose on the two things that I just mentioned. So I think it's about efficiency and serendipity. Because I want to clip that question about why to go to mega events. I like the serendipity and efficiency. I want to title it Why Go to Big Events. Or if that's not the best practice, it could be how to be efficient and create serendipity. We could play with it a little bit. Okay, where are we? They're going to take us to a room upstairs. They're still... I think. Glad we made it. So happy to be here. So happy to be with all of you. Such a pleasure. Yeah, thanks for coming on. Such a pleasure. You've been here since when? So you've been in it? Yeah. Really, every day has been like 14-hour days. There was enough people through Monday and Tuesday and you just loaded it up? Yeah. It's great. You got like six months worth of content in like a week? Yeah. Yeah. 11-13 podcasts just this week. And pumped. And we only release once a week. These are the reason to go to things like this. It seems like we're rolling, right? Yeah. Good to go. Nice. I'm so glad we did this. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Pleasure. Thank you guys. Love you guys. As far as posting content, you think it's better to not post at all or post something that's not valuable. You should post something that poses a question that might lead to an insight of what you should be posting. Here's a great post that a lot of people who are stuck should be posting. Hey, what would you like to see me post? What do you want from me? That's a great post when you're stuck. I guess going to radio row right now, doing a bunch of radio and all sorts of stuff. But anyway, Fanatics Live show. Check out my Twitter. I'm sharing all the info there. Fanatics Live doing a bunch of giveaways, doing a bunch of free stuff. It's going to be fun. Come and check us out in a couple hours. Check out my Twitter for all the information. Love you guys. You've been fucking motivation man. Thank you my dude. Just listen to you for years. That's fucking dope man. When you say those stories, people got to make it at 30. That was me. Pleasure. So what's happening first? We're going to go do a couple things. We move things around. Maximize. Gary, you're supposed to say in 2020 I'll write your book, crush it, start a podcast, I'm here because of you. Proud of you brother. You're welcome. Proud of you. We're going to go see Matthew Berry. We're changing. We're going to overtime. Crush it. We have a surprise guest. Oh shit. Ladies and gentlemen, Gary V. No way! Yes! Did you see that? No, I didn't. We ran up on stage and gave them all to everybody. Thank you. Oh, is this? I don't care. Very fucking cool boys. Thank you Gary. So cute. Good. Maggie! Hiya. Thank you for doing this. What's that? They're all wearing your hats. They're literally on the show wearing your hat. Major. So good. We're doing cooking on wrist now. I always say that I wish I was in someone's algorithm. The way like you're in my algorithm, Andy Santino and Bobby Lear in my algorithm. I see the same people. What's happening is you're showing to the platform that this is the type of content you like. One thing I tell people all the time, you don't like your algorithm? You're the algorithm. You don't like it? Mute it. A lot of people use fear and negativity to make you watch. If you feel like that's happening to you, mute it. On the flip side, do you see something you like? Like it. Tell the algorithm what you want. That's the way to do it. Taylor Swift Effect. Real quick. Great for the sport. Do you have any 12 year old girls now love football? That will be moms in 20 years. This is massive impact on the NFL. How are we doing? Good. Where you got me? Right here? Thank you so much. You helped my son and my husband's relationship get so good. I didn't. That made my day. I'm predicting that this will land on number 5. Black 2. I just want to say that I played for the Cardinal but you're a receiver. Thank you. Any time. Hit me with a DM. I'll hit you tonight. It's a real pleasure. Sorry about your jest though. We're trying to stop out there. You know how it is. We need like 30 minutes to get to Stephen A. So let's go. Is that where we're running to? Yes. That's right. But you'll get me the link to promote too? Yes. Give us a minute. We'll send it to you all. Okay. I'll get a picture. Of course. Alright everybody. It's a row. I'm not like it. You balled out like... I'm so proud of you bro. You really balled it out bro. Keep it running into homies like CJ's Proud I'm really excited for this show. Obviously Stephen A has been a sports media icon for a long time. And he's a Nick's fan and we're happy. Am I going in? Yes we are. Yes. Thank you. We're going back to the old school Dustin. Now you're really worthy of like... Are you D-Rock? This feels like that kind of day. D-Rock. Big shout out. Keep building out there. Stephen A. The media icon. I'm going to spit some serious sports knowledge because that's what I do. That's what I could be doing. All entrepreneurial stuff could have easily been sports talk radio. Obviously what you probably just watched was radio row. Tons of interviews. You know some of the distribution on those are smaller. Not that many listeners but we're getting the content. We're post producing and you never know when you're going to get a nugget. Gary Vee everyone. What's up my man? So good to see you. 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Riddle me this. Why the hell do you want to own a New York jet? Ha ha ha. What is that about? Why would a winner such as yourself associate yourself and your fandom, your love, your emotions and everything else in between with the New York Jets. The most guaranteed way that I know I'm going to get a Super Bowl is for me to do it. But here's the thing. I'm in my zone. I know I'm trying to get there. I also know there's a lot of serendipity that goes into it. I'm not in full control. The Johnson's may want to sell next year and it's over. So I need a lot of things that I don't control to happen to go my way. I'm just focused on building an empire to give me a shot. How'd you like that trade? I'm so happy. Mix? Yeah. Restaurants all the way in the end over here. All right, vlog. This is super weird. For two reasons. I'm the one filming the industry. Two, we're consuming beverages, which is very rare. But this is the biggest thing. We never have down time. We're 15 minutes early. We're in my VaynerSports meeting. And I'm like, doesn't let me buy you a drink. You don't freak out. My medium hesitating. He's got that vodka hitting me with this system. Got a couple troubles. Food style. All right, let's keep this episode going. Why didn't you drop us off at Lids? They want school around here. There's a good part. Security. It's a good food. Dustin. Let's see it. Oh, you're back again. I did Pat Back-A-Fee show. That was a lot of fun. We got them a bunch of the new V-Friends hats that I know people want. It's been a good day, but this has been the highlight. This is what I've been waiting for. So I'm allowed to give away these very expensive cards. But I want you to know, when someone wins a giveaway, they cannot enter again. I get it. But like this Randy Moss rookie card that's worth a lot of money, I could just throw that into the crowd. And somebody could get it, right? There it is. I think we're ready. One minute. Fire it up. Two Super Bowl tickets next year. Followers only. We're launching it. The biggest moment in Fnatic's life history. Good luck, everybody. The biggest moment in V-Friends history. Eyes! Are you fucking kidding me? Eyes! Shout out, eyes! Eyes! This is insane. Jack, I have to go run. The boys will finish off the show. Bye-bye. It's fun. Good show. Super Bowl tickets. You said tickets and something to us at the hotel. And spending money. No, no, I didn't say that. And a bodyguard. And a bodyguard. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Stay well. Take care of yourself. Thank you. Thank you so much. All right. We're here at the Bar School Quiz Show that I'm about to do. Dustin's filming. We're focused. I feel like I'm going to have a big moment. Just predicting a huge fucking moment. What's up, Gary? What's going on? How are you? It's great to see you. You well? Welcome. Welcome to the Hunterville. Thank you. Thanks for having us. Is it sports? No, it's everything. It's pretty intense tribute. There's probably like three to six categories history, sports, pop culture. You'll be good. If you got those, you'll be good. History, I feel solid. Anyway, thank you for having me. You're good? You well? Love this stuff? Yeah. Frank, such a pleasure, bro. Yeah, good. Let's win this shit. I can't lose the carrot top. It's gonna be a tie. I'm transitioning into a competitive carry. Give it up for Gary Vaynerchuk. Gary has fired the fuck up, by the way. Fuck up. Let's fuck up. That is correct. Let's fuck up. Let's fuck up. Frank has to win. No, hopefully. We're winning this fucking shit, Frank. That is correct. The lights went out. Can we get there? The lights went out. First up to 1. Her city showdown. The beat belt goes to Frank. The tag. Yeah, fuck up, Frank. Fuck up, Frank. Good night, everybody. Thank you, Los Vegas. Yeah! What do you know, baby? What do you know? What do you know? What do you know? Thank you, brother. That was everything I ever needed. God, I wanted that. How much is it? It's 8.35. It's a little... You look great out there. I tried. I knew some of those answers. Yeah, you did. You gotta return that. I do? I think so. Who names that? I'm trying, brother. Have the best weekend. Thank you so much. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Are these ready? That was good. Great day. Tomorrow 5.30. 5.30, I'll meet you in the lobby with the Simmel Go to Boogern Gio. Jesus. Fresh off my championship win. In the fucking quiz tournament. Defeating Josh Allen. Alright, Jeff Ames. I've been waiting for this for my whole life. Me with Josh Allen. Trippin'. I'm headed to a private dinner for a seagullman's stables. I've been seeing him all the time. Today was a day. Awesome. Love you. See you tomorrow.
