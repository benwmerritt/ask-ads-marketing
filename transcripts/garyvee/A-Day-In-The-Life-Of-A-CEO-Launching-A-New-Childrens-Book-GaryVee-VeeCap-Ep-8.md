Hi, oh my God, it's so good to see you. I cannot wait to talk to you. That is the only teacher that thought I would make anything of myself. That is a legend right there. Mrs. Kennedy is very important in my life. I'm so happy to see you. What she did for me to see me when no one could and help me get through means a lot to me. This is why I'm so passionate about parenting or kids content. You're really impacting these people. You are really forming into who you're gonna be. This book is based off of characters that you created and developed. Tell me what it's about. It really talks about two of the characters in the de-Friends world, eager eagle and patient pig. And these two characters really go through this great competition of basketball, but they over do it. Eager eagle gets a little too eager, which gets sloppy. Patient pig gets a little too patient, which becomes complacent. And it really teaches the kids about the value of balance. Ooh. So what is one thing you want modern parents to teach their children? To champion losing. If you make kids think that losing is bad, they're gonna struggle in real life because losing is a big part of real life. You have this book, Meet Me in the Middle. Why now? I think the world's lost balance. I think we can all agree. You know, we've gone to the two extremes, and I think balance in the middle matters. I think modern parenting has slightly lost its way. Hence this book. I think losing is good, not bad. I think eighth place trophies are bad, not good. Patient pig and eager eagle, two of the characters of my world. Eagerness is amazing. Tenacity going for it. But if you do too much, you're sloppy. Patience is remarkable and hard. But if you do too much, it becomes indecisive and complacent. ["Hate Oysters"] Everybody, how many people in the comments, please leave a comment, hate oysters, say me. Okay, we got a bunch of me's. Now watch this. No bullshit, everybody. If you just said me and I hate oysters, but you've never had oysters, please say you got me. Look at all these you got me's. You literally have no idea if oysters are your favorite food of all time. People say no to Snapchat spotlight, but never spent a month going hard at it like they did with TikTok or Instagram. People say no to doing stand up because they're scared. But what if they did it for a month and got good at it? Stop saying no without trying it. ["Fly Me Out To Paris"] ["Fly Me Out To Paris"] You and I have a date tonight. Tonight. Six to eight o'clock. Bartons and Nobles Union Square. Union Square. We're doing a Q&A together. Yes. ["Bottom jeans looking dumb"] We've been talking a lot and we talked a little bit about this on our show this morning about social media and children and them not having the social skills because everything is on the phone. Kids are less social in the way that we grew up, which is they may not be walking into rooms like this and having conversations. They're more comfortable in their phone. I would argue that in 1984, 70% of the people that went to a cocktail party or were in a public settings were also introverted and they just didn't have a phone to look down on, but they were very quiet in the corner where they picked one person that they found and they spoke to and they were not very social. Being introverted is not changed because of technology. Your options when you're an introvert have changed because you can go to the phone. ["Bottom jeans looking dumb"] Hi Gary. My name is Jane. Hi. The air check. Hi, Jane. We talked a lot. It's so fucking good to see you, brother. Two day air checks on this stage. Oh, there. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. How are you? This is advice. Always listen to yourself, okay? You got it? You need one to conceal, you can take away. The biggest mistake that people make in sales is they try to hang on to someone who is never going to buy in the first place. Never sell the unsellable. ["Bottom jeans looking dumb"] I think it's pretty legendary that Gary, you didn't reschedule this even though you're getting stitches right now. I think that's the definition of no excuses at this point. Thank you, brother. Sorry. I started my roofing company last year and 100% of the business was organic reach. So how can I grow our business even further on social that might be more in line with reaching other women? Women make a lot of the decisions in a home. So I think you have an actually natural competitive advantage for half the market. Roofing skews a little bit more male for home decisions than some other categories like in the home. I don't want you to over-philosophy the gender opportunity or other things of nature. I just actually want you to go harder. You should be on all seven platforms. It sounds like you've got technique down. I want more volume. Oh my God, it's so good to see you. That is a legend right there. Mrs. Kennedy is very important in my life. I'm so happy to see you. I just want everybody to know why I'm giving her so many flowers. My Spanish teacher flat out knew I was going to rule the world. She called my mom once and said, look, I'm giving him these because if he doesn't pass, he can't graduate. But I think he's going to be okay. She really means a lot to me because it was the only grown-up outside of my mom that I think really knew that I was going to the moon. And what she did for me to see me when no one could and help me get through means a lot to me. It is really good to see you. Really, thank you for being here. You're amazing. You really are. I was thinking about June, you know, correcting exams. You came in my classroom and like, I'm going to pass. I'm not going to pass. And I admire everything that you have done. You were just wonderful. And I thank you for the Facebook postings because people just say, you really know Gary. I said, yeah, I do. You really know Gary. I love you a lot. Thank you for everything you did for us. Really. Thank you.
