All right This question better be fucking badass and not some fucking bullshit pansy shit I think because if your name is young wolf and you ask like my feelings hurt then you're not fucking young wolf Young wolf asks. I'm an emerging Chicago artist in my early 30s and I recently signed with Jim Jones's vamp life records It's a big milestone and I'm grateful for the progress and what's ahead But I struggle with feeling like I'm not where I should be yet and building my fan base and finding financial stability any advice It's okay to be ambitious. It's okay to be Accountable right you're not where you are because you haven't done it you haven't done the work You might not be talented enough to do it like you you might be you might be liking certain parts of the music game But not other parts It's okay to do it's okay to have momentary Micro moments of self-doubt it is not allowed to have consistent Dwelling and consistent beating yourself up for dumb shit Wolf so what I need from you is to understand who gives a fuck like I mean at 34 years old I had Tiny bit of money and savings. I had built a huge business for my dad But I was not financially strong. I had I had very little to show for my 12 year insane Commitment and talents other than the self-fulfillment of why I even did it which was I wanted to support my dad and my mom and all those good things and and I Could have fucking cried I Could have real by the way if anyone deserved to cry at 34 Like a lot of people here are crying that they don't have the money the fame the happiness that they wanted 34 But they didn't do shit. I did shit. I built my parents life for them on some real shit and Yet I chose not to cry and started from scratch and built what this is today to remind all three of you as Are in like who have not been here for 15 years this fucking company that has 2,000 employees and does a $360 million in revenue started in a conference room smaller than that conference room because I couldn't afford to pay rent anywhere on earth to start the company and Marcus David Zang two guys you guys know and Kevin Stats who you don't know and Sam Taggart who you don't know literally didn't get paid and AJ AJ AJ I had to barter I had to barter Doing consulting and marketing for a hotel in midtown So that AJ could stay in a crappy hotel room as a place to stay This is real shit. I was 34 young wolf signed a signed artist That's incredible wolf Start being happy about what you've accomplished instead of crying about what you haven't accomplished You've accomplished something thousands of people watching this right now wish they could be a signed musician If you're not happy where your fans are at fucking get to work Reply to every DM you've ever gotten on social reply to every comment You've ever got on social go backwards now and like and reply to every content comment. You've ever gotten Start now Start now at 34 start now at 44 start now at 55 start now at 66 start now at 77 That's the fucking game you speak to tripling down on LinkedIn What is the proper etiquette when posting about your side hustle when your upper management is watching every post and move you make here are your options one? create a pseudo like you know Like isn't right Charles Dickens real name is not Charles Dickens, right? That was a student right that whole thing So you create the new version of that with AI like with AI you can change your voice and your facial features And you can be like a different person on your side hustle like new shit's happening number two You could go all in and just deal with the ramifications, right? Which is like the consequences you can go to HR and be like I'm doing this side hustle It does not affect my job Aaron you know this I would be okay with that as long as you weren't doing consulting for a competitor of our clients Most bosses are not like that I get that or you could set up the side hustle under your spouse your girlfriend your boyfriend Your sister your brother and they could be part of it more and you could kind of position as like I'm just helping my brother beat even though it's yours Those three ideas stand out to me real life, you know you can quit and go all in if you're at that place We were yesterday. I like that piece of right. We're gonna chop up that that said we're gonna have that clip for that piece of advice Of like side hustle 90 24. We're probably working on that, you know, it's so funny It won't overperform, but it's fucking advice that people need. I don't give a fuck said Handle strategy. I you know what I but oh my god. I have a huge fucking idea. I just invented right now I'm creating this handle. This is real said I need you to grab it Because I'm telling you live and somebody else is gonna grab it. So we're gonna go slow. All right I'm gonna go slow And I can do it cuz whoever grabs it here is then either gonna be a great person and give it to you said or They're gonna think they're clever and want money for it and I'm gonna say fuck you I'm just gonna use a different handle and then I'll ban them for life and never be their friend Ready at Gary V Won't perform How long could it be by the way a handle but Ready matters Yeah, you're not the best of spirit you got that immigrant spelling fucking thing going on but good news you're way better than me I can't yeah, if you spell shit wrong, I'm like great job, Sid.

We're going to do the flash sale and it is sold Out I'm running the social and e-com side of a retail store that's tied to a pretty well known personality Videos with them go crazy, but we're not seeing that energy turn into online sales yet What would you do to turn views into conversions when the attention is already there? By throwing some right hooks You know if the brand content's not leading to conversion then do some ads Have the personality make an ad and be like if I've done anything for you that has brought value Please buy my thing You know a lot of people just bought that hat Aaron as a thank you because they want to support me For all the value I've brought them, you know what I mean? Other people just want to make a quick buck on eBay and other people Want to rock the fucking hat? See quaver great call. He said he said $13 beer. Why $63 hat? You're absolutely right sir But see quaver. I say it here all the time I'm gonna say this nice and slow do not ever buy anything from me ever if money is tight Because the things I sell are the least necessities No one needs wine and no one definitely needs collectibles. I Mean That's absolutely right do not buy anything from me ever If you can't afford it or money is tight ever Look at it all your content stuff you were talking about business I sort of thought I need to find something I'm passionate about and the only thing I was passionate about at the time Was making cookies and the kids it's still a side hustle, but it's getting there. It's just it consumes me Yeah, and I've started doing content. You're so lucky and you're so brother You do know that you Aaron you do know that you've hit the holy grail to have something that consumes you like for example I'm sitting here right now doing this show for all of you But the only thing I'm actually thinking about is running to the airport and getting to Chicago because the trading card Convention is in Chicago and like V friends is consuming me Yeah, like I've got responsibilities with Vayner X I've got responsibilities with Vayner Sports the fives Helping my dad with wine text. You are very fortunate. You are right there. You are right there You are right there brother. You're on the cusp. You got it and you're so young I'm so pumped that you're on the cusp at 39. That's incredible. You know I talk about this a lot But I'm gonna say it again brother. God willing nothing out of the ordinary. You were gonna live for another 60 years I hope so and so for you to capture this passion this early and Something that incorporates your kids. Are you kidding me? What a fucking blessing Yeah, I'm living the dream. You really are just just To the next level you're gonna get to enough revenue where even though It's a lot less than the job that you're stepping out of right now to make this call on is making more But once you realize when you're putting 80 hours into the cookie thing, you'll be able to make as much You're gonna make that jump. You just have to use every minute right now to invest in content and selling My brother and I own a business for three years now I have a few employees and you know, they have problems with money with time yada yada yada And I found myself feeling bad for them a lot That comes with firing too like I thought my first employee and that was fucking brutal so brutal against question to you is How do you handle? Feeling bad for people because you can't just give them By I struggled with this my whole life next stay right there by the way Nick because your video went out Just stay right there for a second. I struggled with this my whole life Firing people has been the bane of my existence. I I hate it to this day I'm 49 years old. I've been doing it for 27 years really probably a little bit more because from 18 to 22 I was influential to who got fired. I Hate it. How do I deal with it by realizing that if I don't do it? Everybody else gets fired too in the form of us going out of business You know what I mean like that's one the other way is you realize that at some level There's a little ego in it where you think they're better off with you and you learn that if you fire someone Who you've already decided isn't good you've you've realized that you can Actually help them a lot with the firing I've seen many people find better environments for themselves than the environments of my workplaces even though my workplaces Subjectively and objectively were better work environments their fit in that place was better, right? And you know listen for example my organizations are a organizations some people Do better in a b organization were not held up to the same standard like it's just real life And so I think there's a little ego in it that we have me you have to let go of and then the other thing you realize is One thing that I've done way more of brother this may help. This is another little tip I Used to sit on a firing for fucking years. This is embarrassing years That's Jackie years and I realized I was better off firing people a little bit earlier at giving them more severance Than what was really happening Because even though I was paying the whole way They didn't know they were gonna be out of a job and then I was so Bent out of shape of like paying them for two years to do nothing or do a bad job that my appetite for a severance was like Fuck you you had a severance for two years in real life given done shit And then and then I so there's there's a lot of ways to pursue where I'm going right you may want to fire Like and by the way, let me say another thing while I'm on this rant Once you know It's always you know like it's very rare where I'm like I got a fire Ezra and then miraculously I'm like no I don't like even if I don't for like three months He'll do some dumb shit that reminded me why I needed to fire him in the first place like it is what it is You know and so honestly, bro. I feel so equipped to answer all questions. That's why I do these shows this one's interesting because It's been hard motherfucker. It's been hard out here because you're right. I have a bleeding heart. I am empathetic I am a people pleaser. I love people more than my businesses. I Just you have a sense of responsibility and by the way, let me give you a fucking one that really got me fucking going This is actually I'm glad I stayed on Nick. You're gonna like this one brother This is what really got me there Nick. I Realized that people that were remarkable and working their fucking faces off I wasn't able to give as much compensation to because the fucking leeches and the bottom feeders were eating up the dollars And I was now hurting the people that were carrying them It had nothing to do with me and that really got me going Correct because I was the reason I got fucked up is I was willing to eat the shit I was like fucking even though I'm the whole fucking team and I'm the guy I'll take less to be nice to these people when it hit me that it wasn't me It was my a players and my hardest workers that were taking money less money home because I was caring I was like wait a minute. I'm doing fucking communism and socialism Of course I made a piece of content within three months ago Show this kid my Rizzer video Team I'm braiding. I'm serious.
