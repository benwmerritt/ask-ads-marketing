It's D-Rock's birthday. Yay! Looks good for 40. Macro. I'm from mom and casual. Got a lot of ground like gravel. Coming back around like a lasso. Macro. Macro. Like a visual boy, I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Garry V. Sabahs, I've been telling you. Accounts were stolen by equity. I'm triple H, giving the pedigree. The meaning of special, my specialty. I'm putting the work till I'm dirty in the earth. I'm moving furniture to Bevin. I headed to a meeting this morning. With Steve Ross, my business partner. Owner of Dolphins. Real estate mogul. All around great dude. Excited for it. Always enjoy our time together. I'm actually trying to do a better job. He yelled at me the other day. He's like, why don't you take me up on spending time together? It's probably a good idea to spend time with people that have professionally achieved the things that you're trying to accomplish. Especially by building the biggest building. Instead of tearing other people's buildings down. So, he's a great man. And I'm excited for our meeting right now. I'll try to get a highlight with him. Alright Steve, how was the meeting? The meeting was great. Any meeting with you was good. And what about a piece of advice for the young, there's so many young entrepreneurs who aspire to be a tenth of what you've accomplished. What's your one or two words of wisdom? Believe in yourself and be passionate about what you're doing. And how are the dolphins going to do this year? No predictions. And what about Michigan in this tournament? Well, I still hope they have the heart that they showed and keep going. So, I need a prediction. You're on the record. I'm not a prediction guy. People you know, when you get to a certain point and you make predictions, you're quoted all over the place. I just hope for the best. I feel like we see the world the same. I have zero idea how this crosses over into what you've got going on already. But I strategically decided, you know what? I'm going to change my course even though I've been going down a path. I'm going to get this in front of the city. If she's interested, great. Then we'll flesh it out. If not, I'll just move on my merry way. But here's the punchline. That speaks to respect. Hi. Hi. I have a question. You have Jules' book, right? Like on the floor down here somewhere? Yep, probably. Okay, if you sign it, can I have it? If you sign it. You want me to sign Jules' book? Yeah, and I want to read it, yeah. And I want to remember that it came from you. Like, inscribe it. Seriously? Yeah. Are you up to something weird? No, no. I just love Jules and I love you. That's amazing. I see you. I see you more. Oh, I'm so excited. This is how you become a killer winner. I had a man at a wine tasting. I came up. He's pouring the Marriott. Hot Australian wine. He starts pouring. He looks up. He goes, get the fuck out of my table. He goes, you're the worst piece of shit that has ever happened to the wine business. He goes, you're selling this wine way too low in price. Before I could explain that the way Wine Library priced was we would look at the lowest prices in the country and match them. He blamed me because what would happen is if there was five little stores in Michigan or Orlando that had it at a price, we would match that. But nobody knew those stores and we were the big guy. So the other 15 big guys would have this at $39.99 and I would be $34.99 and I would get the blame for setting that price even though if you went to WineCercher.com there was a ton of people at $34.99. He shit on me. And I mean, I've never felt that way. You know, like when you get blood rushed to your head? Yeah. Three years later I get an email from him. I really love to be on Wine Library TV. It'd be really important for, I'd love the chance to be on Wine Library TV. Three people that knew about that story in my world were in my inbox. They were like, ah, I replied, sure, and had them on the show. Then those three were waiting for me to trick them, get them in the episode. And he acknowledged for this guy. No, he didn't say anything and I didn't because when you're the bigger man, you don't get to razz either. Life is long. Life is long. Hey. Gary. Kenny Cousins. Real pleasure, Kenny. One thing you should do in this company, it's a little bit slightly turned on what you just asked but the absolute truth is you should get to know every single person in this company. With every ounce of my soul, I'm telling you right now, every one of your lunches, if you've got the time and you're not on something, should be in the cafeteria and you should literally roll up and be like, yo, hey, it's everything. People, people is the game. The skills are commoditized, my man. The skills of like taking good notes, being organized, being on time, being smart. They're stunningly commoditized. It's the relationships. How'd you get here? You played lacrosse with somebody. Relationships, right? You shake somebody's hand, you become friends with them. Do you understand what VaynerMedia is going to be? VaynerMedia is going to be the company that spits out the digital ninjas of the future world. Somebody in this room right now is literally the CEO of Nike. Right now, somebody in this office is the CEO of Nike. 17 years from now, it wouldn't have been really good if you said what's up. I can't. What the fuck? Perfect after day one means nothing. I mean, I got five losses. It means something. We'll see. Stay hot. What's up, dude? Yeah, so I think continuation. So, 109. I don't know how the time went so fast today. Jesus, right? It's flying. I'm about to do a company all-hand-on meeting. It should be good. 90 minutes Q&A, town hall. Just a lot of good client meetings brewing. But really internal right now. Just super internal. I like doing this. Rant through the glass. What's up, dude? What's up, dude? You're all fashion down. Hi! Hi! Everybody's so religious about doing what they do, you just fucking make it. The answer is yes. Okay. Right? The answer is yes when you're at this point. Right. Like, what do you do? Yep. You know? Let's go! Let's do it! Let's do this. Take your salad. Let's go! Are you guys allowed to go? Yeah. Good. Good afternoon. Banner media. How are you? Yeah! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! I'm really excited about today's all hands-on. I'm really looking forward to the Q & A session. I'm super excited about where we're at. I'm completely blown away by PureWow and their culture and their company and the people behind it. I'm so excited for when they move here to Hudson Yards for you guys to get to know them on a personal level. It's just a really good relationship that's growing. I'm really excited about the acceleration of some of the work. I don't think I've been more happy about the way the company's moving over the last 45 to 60 days. I root for only the attention of the end consumer. It's unbelievable, even though I wrote an ungodly check into Snapchat years ago, how little I would care if they went out of business tomorrow. And Facebook, and anything else. Like, just wanna know where the attention is. Good day. Company-wide chat. Obviously, I have to edit that carefully and strategically. But we got a lot of points across, feeling pretty good. I love you, it's L.A. Chat under the desk, let me guys. How was that? You get real questions? I mean, yes or no? It's a, I think it was actually a pretty good start. I don't think we got like, we didn't get like the question that everybody was scared of. And then we answered, but I think we definitely like set a little bit of a foundation. Amazing client meeting, couldn't show that, right? Potential client meeting, beast. Beast might be a breakthrough account in size and impact. So, feedin' the beast. You know, tryin' to build an incredible company. Some of you saw this clip. You're an influence story, you could say. You're also a CEO, you're an entrepreneur, you're a businessman. You balance between your own personal brand and then, you know, be responsible to a company and employees and all that. I run my company. I'm the CEO of an 800 person, $130 million dollar year business and that takes up all my time. The Gary Vee thing is my side hustle. Which is what I actually do, you just watched it. It's the truth, this is the side hustle. Operating, really operating. All right, 60 second club. I can announce it right now, I'm feelin' it. I'm gonna go hard next week. Next week, I'm going to give away some shadow sessions. You know, been givin' out a lot of t-shirts, a lot of signed books, but we're going super hard. We're going super hard next week. 60 second club. Like and comment in the first minute on my Instagram. Make sure you hit up the notifications. Show them that screen right now, what to do, how to turn them on, so you get it. And I'm gonna give away three next week. Committing, Tyler, get into the calendar. Three one hour shadow sessions in New York. You just follow me. Well me and Babin or me and DRock are filming. You'll just be there flyin' the wall, learn some real shit. High five, spend five, 10 minutes together gappin' about your shit and you'll just fly in the wall and we'll find the perfect hour for you. You can come and hang a Vayner for four or five hours but you'll get one hour with me. And, yep. So better get your fucking Instagram notifications up. Boys and girls. I'm thinking a lot about what is forced serendipity or serendipity, right? When I hear that, biggest piece of advice, right? Like what should I do here? It's say hello to people, right? Your, one thing that has been good in the feedback from people four or five, six months in is when they've taken that tact, they've been so surprised how warm somebody is when they say hello that they're willing to say hello back. We just don't have enough matches in the company. I'm also spending a lot of time watching in the same way that I make decisions about social and where the world's going, I do it by watching. The majority of the reason we don't have a lot of structure in place is I have a very good read on you by letting you have a lot of room to do you. Yo, who wants a pencil fight? Who knows how to pencil fight? What, pencil fight? Yeah, five, oh, two, three, two, one. Like this. That's her pleasure. Shit. Oh, shit. But I just planned. You won, boy, beat me. Holy shit. Like that's how you win this game. You need to be the ones, like that's how at 50 and 80, the people that have been here five, six years, that's what they did. You just, a lot of hands just went up, right? I know some of the hands that went up and they haven't said hello randomly to anybody yet. Let's go. Let's go. Simone, get in here. It's my jam. Pencil fighting. No, I don't see what this is. I don't see what this is. See ya. One shot, baby. Let's go. Simone, you're out. Let's go. Who wants some? Gary. So like, you can't think about it. You gotta do it. Like, you can't have it both ways. You can't have us take care of it and then complain about the way it was taken care of. And you can't when I let you completely have the freedom to do it, not do anything about it. Then you're just fucking complaining. You guys are like the minor leagues. I need to impress this. Yeah, minor leagues, let's go, man, Ruby. But who gets to go? You go first, I don't know. I didn't do it, okay? I'm gonna learn how to do this. I don't fly. I don't. I don't. I don't. Let's go, let's go. Pencil fighting. I'm bringing it back. Get your pencils ready. We're back. We're back. Pencil fighting. We're back. Get ready. Heading to Vancouver. See ya. See ya. One in the morning. Just got to Vancouver. Headed to the hotel. Hustle's real. I'ma get it poppin', I'ma do my thing. I'ma blow the fuck up. Yeah, just know I'ma cash out. Stack hella M's in my account. Yeah, just know I'ma have my dream girl in my dream house in my dream car. I just know I'ma be a legend. Ain't no talent when, but yeah, just know I'ma hit the dealership and just ball. Usually the driver's white.
