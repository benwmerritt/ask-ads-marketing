I'm touching Edison like that's like that's the place to go That's where I grew up as a kid. Did you really was there when Indian immigration came because I was the only immigrant because I was born in Russia in 82 83 80 45 and then in Martin Luther King elementary school summer of 85 going into 86 13 new kids 11 Indian seven with the last name Patel, but none of them actually related Correct, you know, I was just like what's going on? I loved it because they were scrappers like me huge and then over the next two Three decades it became little India huge Indian community over there proper food, right? Like I hear a lot of my Indian friends who live in Manhattan That are like yo, we're going to Edison this weekend to eat proper. I mean, that's where you go. Yeah Jackson Heights also Yep, nice. I apologize my sorry Greg You know born and raised in New York City Queens and I'm a jewelry designer I live in New York from the geth. No, I'm not from the geth. I started about 15 years ago Since you were nice no, I know if your grandparents were doing it. No, I started in 2007 with some distant relatives and now I'm Was good job your boy, Arlana and I am an artist I'm responsible for throwing paint on all the exotic cars that you guys see. Yep I'm from Atlanta, Georgia living Miami now. I'm in New York You but visiting you My yeah, I live my and how when did that go down when everybody else moved in the last three four years? Yeah, two years ago. Yeah, like after COVID LA Miami is just like winning Right, everybody wants to go there the best city in America used to be when you were like wrapped up in 60 You'd go 70 80 now the youngsters. Wow. Yeah, it's true. All right Let's go back around the horn. Why don't we start with like double-clicking now that we got a general sense Everyone's listening. Let's go a little bit deeper three four minute bio like to like break it down Orange County And then like you go and work as a junior producer at the today's show or as a what I'll break it down Yeah, bottom of the totem pole actually in turn. Okay, so again, you know, I went to Berkeley I always say you're interested. Well, I mean that's nice. I love school. I really did I'm a person you want to be you boy You still don't you still don't look to me like a kid who got good grades I'm still always confused. You went to fucking Boston University. That's crazy. Like, yeah Yeah, but you can mean a lot of things true. Go ahead Yeah, I really love school. I had immigrant parents and I felt like that was very much a priority for me and for them as well But they never really pressured me to go into one direction You hear a lot of the stereotype of like Indian parents are like doctor engineer Like that's they did not do that. Which is really nice and I grew up having an interest in Television and I thought that when I grew up I wanted to be a reporter or initially I thought more in the entertainment space So I thought like I would do red carpet reporting or things like that But anyway, you know life takes you on really weird unexpected turns that even you can't really plan for so I I studied media and public policy and a little bit of acting at Berkeley and then I went off to Graduated early did a month traveling by myself. I applied to one job before I left which was the NBC page program It's a very prestigious Very that kid Kenny played it on 30 Rock that whole Exactly where the uniform you give the NBC studio tour you work SNL Jimmy Fallon Seth Meyers all of those late night shows and it's a very prestigious program And it's really it was my grad school really of TV I got to learn a lot of different things of in production not just it was very behind the camera very behind the scenes I loved it. I did that job for a year and it really immersed me in TV My favorite assignment was at the Today Show after my program was up I got a job at the Today Show as a production assistant all the while in 2015 We're rewinding back. I was still in college. I took a internship at CNN. I was in New York for the first time This is definitely more than three minutes, but I'm wrapping everything go to think I Was interning at CNN and I was just taken by the food scene here I just loved it I always had an interest in food in college my friends called me a human yelp because I really knew where everything was like With your parents dinner. I got you like date. I got you. I had a full list I loved it. I just loved being immersed in Different foods different cultures. I did half of my high school predominantly from a restaurant place Or you also knew were like the good organic food store was or the or the market or was it predominantly focused on restaurant at that point? That's such a good question because Berkeley kind of instilled like the crunchiness in me Yes, like I was very intrigued by health only at Berkeley because there was so much more of a focus on What food you were eating and like where it was coming from so I got really interested in sourcing at that point And actually looking at the labels on my food like what is in this like where are there 8,000 ingredients? Natural flavors. Yeah, I don't know if you know this natural flavors. Yeah is beaver anus beaver What you heard me my guy? So when you drink like some sort of like the shit that claims to be clean and like it looks healthy on the shelf like the New-age soda or whatever as soon as you say second ingredient after water natural flavor You're getting straight beaver anus to the fucking metal For some reason beaver anus has like some sort of like sweet like I'm that's why I wish I could answer that I don't remember I did at one point I can't remember at all, but like I'm sure the comments about to go off on this and they're clearly laughing Yeah, people are gonna Google it right now and they're about to jump back in and like talk about this like it's really the Anus glands It's the glands I like saying beaver anus for effect, but it's anus glands I think like like it's like really kind of but this is what she's referring to there's a ton of Things that are listed on your products. They look good because like only a hundred calories. Yeah, but yeah Yeah, the whole the whole The next decade people are about to eat clean in a different way. It's not gonna be about calories It's gonna be out the source of it and it's it's on you could see it already It's been on it's starting to really get going good the messaging has been all crazy for years like first it was like Oh each sugar it's gonna keep you skinny like if you look at these all these Advertisements from years or years like decades ago It's crazy to see what kind of messaging like low-fat like high sugar like that's just not how you eat It's all very much marketing and that's all life is marketing Healthy There's there I mean you just look at you just look at oils that every restaurant cooks with Canola oils and all this stuff is is fuck seed oils But also being on the run is tough, you know, you're traveling you know how that goes Yeah, and food got smart 20 years ago these companies they made every package look healthy as fuck But there's still a fucking piece of candy like mango like these Yes, that's all I eat Dry mango I'm healthy. I'm like, but in my brain. I'm like, yo, this is for roll up mother fucker It's different when you go to Europe. It's different when you go somewhere No, it is different. It's completely different different. You're different. You're okay It has much stronger food standards and they benefit from that in that arena and like America has a lot more options. So if you're educated you can navigate anyway, that's so in 15 year Fascinating by that you're doing the show and I assume either social media or the internet helped you start to build enough A personal brand that you were able to make the transition hundred percent and it was very unexpected for me So I started out at eats in 2015 just as a way for me to document the food I was cooking and eating and you did that we're on Instagram Instagram Yeah, and so when I finally started a job at the today show I was cooking in my off hours I'd wake up at 3 a.m. I'd go to work at 4 I'd come home at 2 I would cook I would try to go to the gym and like work out go to sleep at 8 do it again So I did that for years your life. That was my life and nothing that happened in the world between 8 and midnight No, and I but I loved it because I love the people You know people live in different lives yeah, and then what the account grew momentum So what happened was that at that point it was it was kind of weird to have a food blog right? It wasn't normal and like 2014 2015 to be posting pictures of your food on the internet that wasn't as common as it is today To me yeah, and yeah Instagram was made for for the photos. I feel like well, yeah landscape photos It's first intent was like take a beautiful fucking photo of the sunset. Yes, not fucking dudes like me telling you to stop But that's the funny thing of every platform Facebook was made to be a replication of connecting people on campus These founders start these things with a certain intent which was not started for it was just In TV it was live streaming on a camera and then it became gamers now You got dudes like me literally Streaming me sitting in the office. Yeah, like the consumer takes control That's true platform starts with intent, but then at scale the consumer takes control left right away Yeah, and so then it popped off so basically I was working the controller one day the producers I heard them scrolling through my Instagram account and we started talking and they said and by the way This wasn't a story where I like pitched myself to be on the show. I was you could not go lower than a PA I was running scripts. I was building the show down You built your yeah, you built your demand outside of your work and I said of expecting it from happening What's within your work correct? And I knew I knew I was I knew what my goal was right which was to be a reporter beyond camera do something But I didn't chase it so hard that I Broke that dream in my hands before I even got it right it was just in the back of my mind And it did come to me very organically so they said why aren't you on the show as a guest? I said that seems like a you-call and then I started coming on the show is a on-air guest and was able to leave and do a full Time we'll get back to more stuff I mean what about you from a comic book number one origin story? So you grew up what a punk kid No, so for our first I come from a nice boy my parents I was a punk. Yeah, I do it I was a punk I come from parents of you know my parents were immigrants that came in 1979 from Russia like me the south of Russia Yeah, I came in 78 so they instilled that December said that hustle in me You speak Russian fluently take a British peru's key. Yeah, you do. So I'm a man. Yeah, I was talking Russian I don't know if you noticed it. Yeah, I've been calling forever. Yeah, I know it's great. So That happened never really did good in school like you know my my pull pull it pull it. I like doing this You have to see it Top frame can I see excuse me guys? I need to you to contend no the one closer to your right hand top top one You can take it down. I need to yeah pull it I need to get a sense of how bad we're in school because I was one of the worst of all time I just you know what it was my attention span wasn't there my IQ may not be the highest but my EQ is incredible Yeah, I mean I'm right there with you man. If not, you know, what about the class rank look at that at the bottom Where can you help me out here cuz I'm you know, look still I still can't read This is the opposite of you Yeah, I'm probably I'm probably out of what That was not Berkeley With that so you're a bad student like that I wasn't a bad student I just I was also you were better than me I because everybody who says bad students were like C's I was D's and F's Me too straight I love being a class clown Call out some good ones there see what what are you seeing there? What about that German one education? That was an A I got a Trying to win Stanley cups floor hockey What about speech? Look at speech I think health a Senior year right health 12. Yeah.

I never cut class in all four years of high school Bro, I never cut class in four years. I got A's in Jim Jim that's incredible. What about speech as one of the most prolific public speakers I'm one of the ten most compensated prolific public speakers in the world D But that's just you know everything What is the lesson bullshit I? Mean you can do whatever you want to do and this is an indicative of your school is one system A lot of people you know do really well with it and they understand it Well, you're a good test taker not everyone's a good test taker, right? I'm I didn't even like I'm saying like you you could be a very good Anyway, I School wasn't really my thing my mom took me out of I think the I believe I was supposed to be class of 2000 My mom ended up taking me out of school. Yep got my GD started working for my cousin who owned a mortgage company at the time Okay Well your parents kind of like yo, you're not a good student, but that means you have to fucking work hard Or they didn't give do they just they just wanted me to just say out of trouble and not you know Dispatcher my mom's limousine company that she worked for yeah She's so my mom always helped me and plugged me wherever she could and one day she was like why don't you go? work in the Diamond District that have some you know relatives that you can get some cousins you had some relatives her cousins you know not my cousins but um I Started working there and Instagram started happening and Instagram honestly changed my life You agree yeah, it changed everyone's life. Of course, you know and then tiktok changed lives I'm still you tube and Twitter changed my life Like yeah, wherever the attention it the television changed people's lives before then the radio changed people's lives Wherever consumer attention is Spotify SoundCloud MTV BET Dick Clark the soul train like it's all the same game. Yeah over like the game has always been the same Where is the attention? Mm-hmm who understands how to get on to the attention forever pre-internet? There were gatekeepers there was a producer that said you're allowed to be on there was ahead of the studio There was people that decided you're good enough. You're good enough. You're good enough. You're good enough now Nobody gets to the side I just think this out is a cool table for the cool kids anymore. I understand you know, but it's gone Meaning that like everybody it's just like it's just the same language. That's right. See the same thing everyone's looking the same everyone Well plastic surgery and How do you how do you? Straight from that by not conforming yeah You know I Think I'm doing a pretty good job By wearing a pink quarter-aged jacket So so you started you were out able to outflank people because you were Marketing on I feel like I was more because I was watching what was good So the jewelry game is just it's it's it's so dirty everyone's just that they're all haters over there You know, so it's very tough to get in there and be respected and you know also takes time to it takes time Right like that's the thing that I always like right to your point There's always pushback or thing but back to something I thought that was great that you said I think the biggest thing for hungry ambitious people is patience. It's why I talk about all the time Like it just takes time people like yo, I want to be respected. I'm like, what have you done? Like I agree. You know what I mean like people want to I came in like that. I came in just like that I came in I'm like, all right. Where's my respect? I could see it I could see it in the way like right now, right and it makes sense to me It's the number one thing I wish people understood like like but you have to go through it. Yeah, you gotta go through it I don't know people like yo, I want scary be fuck you. I want your respect my motherfucker Everyday my life I got decent that's working in my liquor store like fuck you fuck you right like that's like me saying Why don't I fucking have humongous pecs and fuck? Like I've been in gym for ten years and now it's like somewhat decent when I was a fucking slob ten years ago Like it's cuz I fuck it didn't do shit. Yeah That's funny you say that I got upset at her friend because he didn't put me on I was like come on dude like I Gotta go on I'm doing jewelry. Look what I'm doing. He's like yeah, it doesn't work like that Hmm and now when you look back now now I have somebody doing that to me and it's like I'm trying I used to get upset when people that wouldn't post answer my text forget the post. Oh my you can't be that busy to not reply to a text That's wild. It's odd day. It's it's it's it's an audacious. It's wild and I get my phone. I get my phone sometimes like oh shit I get it now. It's like you have to prioritize, you know, I'm lying to you know I non busy people don't know what busy is and I was I was non busy as I was getting to be busy Mm-hmm, and I would just get in it would take it so personal Yeah, it's so upset. Yeah, so my cancer so I'm very sensitive And I would take it so personal and I'll you know catch somebody like dude you don't text you he takes out his phone He's like look at my text message. Look at look at how many text messages that that's true. I'm like, alright, whatever I don't care. No, but it's I love you right now because you're about to help a bunch of kids It's a very simple framework. It's a selfish framework, but if it was Jay Z. They would answer that's my point because he earned it Exactly That's right and and it and it's and here's my big thing I loved it by the way what we're doing right now I love the most because it's gonna help it's honest. It's very honest and it's gonna be very helpful The other thing is when when people say that here's my question. You're the one that's asking Right something was fucking rolling up on me so aggressive at the airport And I was trying to be really like I'm like and my it's tough sometimes and I'm like yo my guy Like it was real hot right at the airport. He was like you never thought I was like I Like I was just like I just want to say one thing. He's like what? I'm like, but you're the one who's asking right, but it's I'm not asking you for shit Why are you mad at me when you're the one who's asking you're asking for me to give you something? You were asking your boy to give you something was and so like how the fuck is that? All the kids that are watching right now Let me make this real simple for you if you're the one who's asking you have no permission to be upset But I felt entitled no shit But I you know I calm down right and he checked me just like that good it was Ronnie five by the way shout out to Ronnie Fine, Ronnie's the best, but I was like dude And here's why Ronnie's the best right coming up in the same year as Ronnie not knowing him until recently But always watching everything from afar Fucking took his lumps Everybody's it now right, but it takes time for it so you can't understand that when you're not even anywhere near that side That part I understand I'm not understanding I understand what I'm trying to get people to reframe and you're a great example in this and you people are looking up to you Now so this is perfect right is not understanding. I respect because naive and say we all have blind spots Coming at someone right before you understand It's just a mass of energy of insecurity well because we put our emotion into it. It's personal no shit now it's business Mm-hmm. It took me a long time from go to personal to business It's business now because you're on the other side right but but that fucking crossovers. It's it's night and day It's a safe game. It's a simple game of being it's a game of selfishness It's a game of selfish when when you wanted something right it was personal now that you're busy and you've got a little something now It's business right it's a it's a it's a very selfish framework versus a selfless framework For example, why do I think most things work for me? For example as we sit here right now even this where am I out of my career? I'm like, you know what I'm at a place where I can get the biggest guests But I don't feel like that's like like I feel like a bunch of podcasters got that Mm-hmm. I think what I can do right now is put people that are in a interesting part of their career It's not like day one and they got nothing there's nothing to talk about It's there at this nice middle range with what I believe from afar observing y'all because I observe as much as I possibly can With much more to go so it's good for them because I know how eclectic the mix of people that listen to my podcast There's people that are day one. They're gonna look up to you There's people that are CEOs of the biggest companies in the world that might want to JV with you So a right off top the second I allocate this hour I know for three people I'm doing something nice on the flip side if I do the kind of podcast I'm doing right this second I also know for the hundreds that are watching right now and the hundreds of thousands of millions that will listen over the next year on The long tail of this there's something valuable That's that's selfless framework like why the fuck would these 600 plus people right now in the middle of fucking day Give us their time. I always think that way. Hmm. I love that amazing You what's your origin story? How'd it go? Man? Yeah, so yeah, I grew up in Atlanta Grew up dirt poor my parents Southside. Oh, yeah, South Carolina My parents are immigrants as well from Nigeria came out here. We have nothing education to schools big in the Nigerian Yeah, it was but I dropped out high school. Yeah, I was a high school drop fucking drop If my mom let me if they let me by the way the school was selfish all those grades all all those grades besides Jim should be Everybody you're gonna love this especially as a good Berkeley girl I did not do one piece of homework in all four years of my high school career not one one Not one was cheated out some I went no you mean when I you mean a test. Yeah, bro. I gave so little fucks You remember scantron. Yeah Bro on some real shit. They would hand me the scantron Nobody in my high school four years finished a test faster than me I Somewhere around Midway through fresh being I'm like wait a minute They're just pushing me through because I kept hearing in my school. We're going for blue ribbon We're going for blue women somebody said the wrong thing like someone's like my mom's any administration They need all of us to graduate for them to give blue ribbon. I'm like peace That's genius anyway, so you dropped out of high school. Yeah dropped out high school Like I always knew like yo school wasn't for me You know I'm saying cuz I made music at the time I still make music, but I wanted to be a musician I'm like yo there was nothing for me in school.

I need to work on this music Or were you looking for some sort of like basic job to eat up five to ten hours a day? No, it wasn't even I didn't even look for a job or anything.

Hmm. Like you're all frustrated and hot and trying to get it and you're like fuck it Let me start posting on Instagram. Hmm. Like you did it, right? Like a lot of versions of you just keep crying about it. I'll do it now That right like still ask it a next buddy to put them on without doing the push-ups, right? This shit's fucking crazy what he just said. All right, let's go back around the horn What's up right now? You got this like right now state of the union some promo time for you Like what should people know like you got a fucking book like what were we at right now? What's hot and 24 for you? Um, well first of all, I feel like the energy is really hot in 24 I don't know. I I don't know. I've been thinking about this a lot about my mindset. I think last year I spent some of it. I've been doing this for a really long time, right? Or at least for me I feel like I've been doing it a lot and there's so much that you have to keep up with and so much you have to You know Like things are just evolving and you have to evolve with it, right? That's a real point one of the biggest things that pissed me off about Back to what you just said when I was screaming about tiktok five years ago The reason no, but most people didn't do it was one of two reasons perception and insecurity Number one was perception people thought it was teenage girls dancing on it But they hadn't learned as if we didn't just live through Instagram being photographers to being what it was or Facebook being for College kids and now being for grandmas. They couldn't see the chess move of like yeah It's 14 year old girls dancing now, but it's gonna be for everyone. So their perception number two is worse insecurity They had their 8,000 followers on Instagram. They didn't want to go to tiktok and start over it would have been the best move They've ever I know that's why I get a fucking thousand fucking emails a year from people who literally started their career in tiktok Literally because of how loud I was during that time and I get a that I get a thousand other emails from people saying literally titled in my inbox Wish I listened to you because they're not doing shit right now on Instagram because it's harder I literally I literally joined because of you tiktok literally and I mean I got I don't know. I got a bunch of followers really fast Yeah, and I post like you say You do your thing I post, you know, it's the fear right people are so afraid people They're in their head yeah, yeah, they had 11,000 putting their pecs or showing their ass or whatever Flossing on Instagram 11,000 but they didn't want to go to tiktok and start at zero because they were worried what people would think Most of those people weren't scared of the work. There's a whole group. We just talked about that are scared of the work Those people have no shot But the part that drives me crazy is the second group that put in the work somewhere This is why I jumped in because you just said it but shit evolves Mm-hmm. I built on fucking Twitter and then YouTube like I didn't want Instagram to come out I was winning right but it's okay, but I have to figure it out. I didn't want tiktok to happen. I was winning Mm-hmm. I don't want anything to come out I'm winning but shit will come out and if you don't go where it goes you're dead left behind So go ahead so that takes time sometimes mentally to acclimate and recalibrate Right like if you feel like you're on top in one space and then you feel and then I think it's what you were saying earlier Too a lot of people are now just doing what other people are doing and hopping on trends and How do you stand out and how do you make yourself different and how do you feel different? It's because of you like no one's me. That's so nobody's gonna do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it Exactly, right and I think you know honestly I sort of forgot that last year a little bit interesting and I have none three shows with NBC TV shows cooking shows oh And a really good time with that and TV is always my North Star and what I want to continue to do and do you have a Pit in your stomach that TV is evolving in a way That's not the way we all grew up and it's a different medium that it used to be it's interesting because the way I started out was sort of weird because I was bridging both traditional broadcast media and also social media Which was not really done before like that the today's show producers had never put like a social media person on air That was weird and crazy. I was 22 at the time like that was not heard of but now I think For a second yes, but at the same time like what do you do you can make I can make my own show now I don't need to rely on Yeah, not a television show is less awareness than doing social media Right, you're exactly yeah, and the amount of eyes you can get on your content smaller Yeah, you're a famous actor on Netflix even and like you're not bigger than the biggest celebrities on tiktok That's just the way it is now. Yeah, it's what we went through when radio went to television radio stars were fucking everything Yeah, they were everything and TV stars came and they were like yo That's why we know who Bob Hope and Lucille Ball are because they were that first group of TV stars And that was a whole new paradigm shift People love me like Hollywood loves to make fun of these social media people especially because I've been in it from day one They're not making fun anymore, right? They want that It's required. Yeah, so you're in a funny place where like what you started Led to what you thought you wanted and now where the attention is for what you want to talk about Actually lives where you start exactly. I'm aware and that is What I was grappling with last year because I've done these shows with with NBC and then I was sort of like okay Now what especially when you see somebody make 15 tiktoks and have more actual awareness than you yeah And I like 100% and it's funny because I think that I've had more eyes on my content that then could be Technically on a show at the given time, right? Like no, that's not a theory. That's fast. No, it's facts But it's like you have to just yeah, I guess I have two new books coming out a kid's book and my new business book Which is the follow-up to Jeff Jeff jab right hook. I'm talking to all the PR people right now my people My the Harper Collins people and they're all talking about the launch and they're like we need you to do this We need you to do that. I'm like why hmm. I'm like, I don't want to go to that studio for an hour and have sell 310 books I can go do a fucking podcast with somebody in my underpants and sell 10,000 The fuck am I going to the studio an hour before we go on air? Yeah drinking shit coffee I love your pants Good for you. All right So that's Was a was a brain fuck year because the thing you were achieving towards you kind of had a realization of like wait a minute I got a recalibrate. Yeah, and I think that takes a you know, it was a lot of Thinking to myself about Who I am what I want where I'm going and also making promises to myself and keeping them because I think you can say like oh Like you were saying I want to do this I want to do this I'm gonna do this but if I'm not actually putting in the work I'm not putting the work and I'm not getting anywhere. Yeah So this year, I mean I have a cookbook which is very exciting It took me two and a half years to make it and I love it and I'm very proud of it. When did it come out? 2021 very difficult to Do a whole book situation covid that was tough and unexpected obviously but I'm just grateful that I'm proud of the product Because that's all that matters to me I'm really focusing on making my own show this year. So that is in the works When you say own show you're gonna make something and you're gonna distribute it on social. Yeah, good for you Um, and then also I have been really interested in in-person activations. I did a couple pop-ups last year for you We sold out like two nights of like Me cooking where are actually this for all three of you. I apologize. Yeah, I'm gonna name a social media platform You're gonna tell me what's like how serious you're taking it if you're doing anything ready YouTube shorts Zero no, I've been posting on YouTube shorts Often um not that much. Tell me the truth. No, I've been been posting that much I need the actual number. I don't want your fucking bullshit. Oh, like once a week. Yeah, I'll say once a week Yeah, I don't even know about it like four to five times a week beautiful So here's why I love YouTube shorts YouTube shorts is very similar to tiktok one difference YouTube's the second biggest search engine in the world behind Google So unlike tiktok where you post something and it kind of that's is and yes tiktok has good search query But YouTube really has searched query. Okay, and so like a YouTube short that you make could pop nine months later Because the search algorithm changed and you might show up first for like blue diamond hearings Okay, you see what I mean got it so YouTube shorts very important Google should not be fucked with they are never going away For your lifetime YouTube shorts needs to be serious in your repertoire. I want it tonight. Okay beautiful. They spoke I Don't post on Facebook respect same dinosaur I had the feature where it was automatically publishing to face and I had a like Decent Facebook audience because NBC. Yeah, of course. That's you should my prime demo But not as often as I got to day trading attention what I think about every day Facebook is a beast my fastest growing audience on Facebook right now is 20 to 30 year olds Really yep, how do I get my account back? So Facebook all these games are the same game supply and demand of attention Because all the proper creators just did what you did all of them There's not as many people that are really great at producing content producing for Facebook Meanwhile, there is a fuckload of people on Facebook 40 to 90 all day 20 to 40 more than you would think maybe not hardcore New York Miami, LA but the world is much more than cities or 20 cities and A lot of 25 year olds will check it like once a week, but consume is it reals Facebook reals? It's both both of them. It's both interesting So Facebook especially with what's going on kind of like with now you saw what happened with Vision Pro Sure, you saw that this weekend this Apple thing is coming Facebook's gonna be like oh fuck they might win the VR AR thing So they're gonna up their game on their next version of their things like it's common Okay, and so Facebook and YouTube even if you post the same video as you made elsewhere I don't want you to do it the way a lot of people do it where it's like you post it exactly the same You can make the same video just change the copy based on the room you're in Because you know that you're in Facebook for you It might be like yo if you want to buy your significant other a proper gift for Valentine's Day And even proper gift is not right like a language right then you would on tiktok, right? So you know the audience that's gonna see it You can tweak it a little bit just changing the words the copy if you want to get advanced Maybe you change the opening second or two that you're addressing if you want to do some editing but Facebook and YouTube shorts are wildly underused by the good creators of the world Gotta play with that then because I used to do it where you just slide it over next the same thing snap That I stopped using it. No snap to Okay snapchat and this is one advice I have to take myself So the others I'm doing this one. I'm not doing so you get even when you know you're like it's funny But my trainer makes me do something like you're doing it. He's like no I'm like damn see it's like funny Like even when you know it you can't get to everything if you can snap and vlog your day Like really do it There is so much not only opportunity for audience growth money There's a lot of ad money and snap but not a lot of creators getting it Snap is a huge opportunity for all three of you as well to kind of do the like the true story vlog thing Like I'm talking 13 snaps a day in Gary V's office and when you're gonna go eat now and like your day I mean it would crush feel like you just became our manager thoughts. Yeah, I mean This is my look this is I mean, you know what that is that's Facebook and Tumblr stock that I bought in 2006 Migrate gift has been Knowing like I knew twitch when it was Justin dot TV, but I know when to hit things It's not just no when you ask me what's next. I don't know but the second I know I'm gonna know that's right I was first on vine moving I was like I'm always the especially the age that I was when this all happened I was always like the older dog that was first on all these stuff because I view it not for any other reason then What's the opportunity to do whatever you want whether that's to sell wine or trading cards? Actually, that's open these trading cards real quick. I'm gonna play a little game here with our friends You know, this is be friends is my Pokemon meets Sesame Street Open these packs. Hmm You know change kids perspectives like whatever you're gonna fill the pipes with but which pipes are most fertile I want you to look at these cards and tell me which card you most resonate with twitch. Let's ask a couple questions in here Threads is not dead Sotterdog it's just declined a lot of that hot week and then it's declined But there's plenty of audience there, too You got to try to actually make the content though these hats are not are gonna be very limited and a piece They're not it's gonna be very hard to get them. I apologize. I'm doing that on purpose though I want these to be properly cool and hot Right Right look at them all figure out which one most resonates to you. I got mine Figure it out. Let me put the rest in there Yeah, just keep them. I'm gonna take them with you. Just you got yours. I think so which one I chose hard-working wombat Hard-working and I have a reason for it great I've been thinking a lot about Like actually this is on the way over here. I was listening to atomic city by you to lol There's a line in there that says if your dreams don't scare you they're not big enough I love that and I just feel like the only thing that separates people from getting what they want is And who don't is the ones that stop on the way, you know Like if you stop you're not gonna get what you want But if you keep going no matter how many times you fail or you have to recalibrate or do it again You'll still get there. It's just my time there. Yeah, where is a life filled with less regret? Yeah, and it's not achieved like we may have the biggest I want to win a great I want to buy the New York jet I want to buy the New York jets the only thing I actually want to do is be proud of how hard I tried to get the New York Jets when I'm 90 right so like to the point of getting there Most people don't actually achieve their goal. There's just two groups of people One that are proud of themselves at 90 for trying and one that sits around at 80 and 90 and just dwell and regret Not going for it. Yeah, it's a simple as that. Yeah, the try is the game. Yeah, it's funny Right 2023 was kind of like a transition. Yeah, but now it yeah, you're like feeling I feel ready to go I I'm fired up. I feel like I've really always been a dude in movement, but there are apps I remember my 28th 28 to 29. I can clearly see that was a passive year for me. Yeah, I was comfortable Yeah, I was comfortable. I was just kind of you know I just worked every minute for seven years and I kind of just like I just know I know that I like softened up a little bit Yeah, and that's okay. Just one year. Yeah, that's right. What do you got? I have the headstrong honey badger. I like that character me too. You feel headstrong I feel like when it's time to get disciplined. I'm very disciplined when it's time I love that. So you're kind of like like a fighter, right? Yeah, you can fuck around in between fights But when it's eight weeks from the fucking main event pressure, you can fucking stop eating bullshit You like the pressure you'll put in the work like a prize fighter. Yes. I like that. No, I like that yours. I chose the energetic electric you oh Because your energy so fucking flavor. Yeah, like especially like when I'm in my element like cuz I do these performances called the art land experience and like And that's me like performing my art Like I'm throwing the paint on these cars and like everybody fills the energy and I like wow like and that resonates with me so much It's crazy. What what happens to you in that zone and you just talked about so and I really fuck with zone like What broke the second before I take the stage for a public speech? I'm on my phone running this business and everyone always laughing about it right dust like everyone's always like Things it's kind of funny or weird, but the second they're like that it goes into my intro like a WWE wrestler like the second I hear my theme song. Yeah, I become like a bazaar version of myself and I like black out Yeah, black out to yeah. Yeah, it's like you just go to this place and like nothing matters You just want how long does it take you to get down from the high when off post like you're done now Ah Doesn't take me that long no transition. Yeah, it's like trance out. Yeah, like just like I'm gonna give you one of my cards Too that goes with that. I don't know if it depends on what kind of high we're talking about. Yeah, sometimes when it's like it's a big deal I'm high for the whole day. Like it's just I can't even focus on anything. I can't believe what's going on What are they saying? What are they doing? It's crazy. I get it, but it's it's the action. It's it's it's a high I'm going with arbitraging admiral because what I've been talking to you all about just now is the arbitrage that I spend my life on Where's the attention? That's underpriced that most people can't see the fact that you three are really in the game the way I define the game Humans that are moving that get it are caught up in the old world Even know there's a world of attention And think about all three of those platforms that we just talked about and like to me I get excited because I can't wait for one of the three of you to email me in two seven ten weeks DM me be like How the fuck did you know? I just know and I know you already have shown me the capacity to put out good stuff So it just becomes matching that good stuff to a new audience that's being underserved arbitrage I'm gonna take this back. Yeah, take it. Can I keep these cards? Hell yeah, you can tell me what the deal is with these cars because you said I'm trying to be Pokemon over the next 30 40 years Okay, yeah, like one day you will all look back in this video and be like why the fuck did I lose those cards? No, no, I as soon as I got them. I was like, you know All right, let's do last couple seven minutes, let's do questions since I'm here for you Do you have any question anything I can answer? Well, I just feel like you have so many tabs open in your brain. Yes Um How do you where do you focus your attention like how do you I feel like I'm driving a boat I have a boat and I've all my homies on it and it's a boat in the ocean and Boyd's like, yo, there's a hole over here and I'm like coming over there But like yo this sounds like I feel like I'm a firefighter and I like it Wow, this is my state like I'm not maximizing for money if I was maximizing for money I would have done a fund. Yeah, I just made a lot of money. I'm maximizing for my art I love the art of being an entrepreneur and my art is chaotic. It is Jackson Pollock. It is our Atlanta It's all over the place. And so when I sit back and assess years, I'm like always can logically as an operator I'm like, man, I made like it's I smile at how many mistakes I make that's because I have too many balls near The problem is most people in the world are juggling a ball I'm juggling 39 Seven of those balls are gonna hit the ground and break outright That means I only have 32 balls, right? Some of those other balls are gonna get dented while I'm playing with them all so it means only have 16 clean balls That's still more than one ball Got it. Yeah, and so that's how my world works The key to my world is I'm glad we talked about this. The only reason my shit works is I don't care about my failures Same and when I say I don't care about them I Like to dissect them. I like to learn from them But the number one thing that I have that I'm blessed with and I'm so grateful for from parenting upbringing Culture luck of the draw is I genuinely don't give a shit what all of you think about my failures Was it always that way? It was always that's why you saw those grades. Yeah, I had the strength Yeah judged by parents of my friends and Mike, do you know that every one of my teachers told me I was gonna be a garbage man Yeah That was the big thing in the 80s. They're like you're gonna be a garbage man, and I'm like I make more money than you do right now Because I was making $500 a weekend selling baseball cards in the malls in New Jersey now I couldn't work every weekend, but I had a good enough math skills to say 500 times 52 Teachers were getting paid nothing in Jersey back. Like I was like how I was like I understand you see the world from a grade standpoint I don't and so yeah, my self-esteem The way my mother raised me is so masterful. It's why I'm writing this kids book meet me in the middle my mom hit the middle She like and your parents hit a version of this like having parents that didn't push you to the right Yeah, well my mom did really well was your self-worth isn't your grades But she also didn't make me entitled anything that I did that was wrong She would smack my fucking face and punish me the biggest issue for kids right now is there's no consequences for interactions And now kids don't even get grounded so kids are just moving as if like this while right it's changed And so I got very fortunate. So yes, it's always been like that because a great parenting and the luck of the DNA draw And then I refined it. I've been on it early adopting is like a theme for your whole Everything though completely based on lack of fear. I'm not scared to lose. Yeah, I'm not scared to waste my time You know why most of my friends don't find the shit I find most people in this world don't find is when a new thing comes out Be real spent fucking 20 hours on it. Yeah, most people like they heard it But I spent the 20 I put in fucking hard work and then I had the skill and the pattern recognition be like no this is not gonna pop That's what I'm great at. I'm great at really putting in the work when new shit happens and Keeping tabs on Everybody moved on from Facebook. I'm looking at it every day is today. You understand. Yeah, I'm gonna find out what my password is today I love it What do you got? We got like two three minutes, but you either one of you got something man I got a new restaurant happening.
