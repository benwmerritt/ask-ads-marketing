Yeah, I mean look, I think it depends on how you look at it. I mean, do I think new things happen? Not that often. I think everybody's being fucked with because the attention is being staggered in so many different directions and shifts very quickly. If you were all of our parents, our moms and dads, if they were marketers a generation ago, they had it easy. We had a consistent platform of marketing for a very long time. The internet, that's the thing being delivered in the phone, by the way. That thing screwed it up. It's tough now. Sorry. Like, do you think I'm happy that Twitter's losing its attention? I have 1.2 million followers on it. I was at the top of the heap. I was winning. I'm super pissed. I'm sad. I'm not happy about it. But I'm not crying about it.

It's like one more time, two humans in the world decide what 30 second video is gonna drive their business and deliver it in a platform where every one of us are running away from consuming it at all costs. Like how is that smart? Right.
