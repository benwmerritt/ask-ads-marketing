I do my website, I edit my videos, I create my videos, I film myself, I do all my social media stuff, and I'm just wondering, am I hurting myself by trying to do too much? Potentially. Now the thing by doing it that allows you is you'll know how to judge it because you did it. Most people hurt themselves by outsourcing too soon. You know why I was unstoppable at running a liquor store? Cause I did everything. At 14 I did the ice and I stopped the shelves and I closed the store. Like I knew how to do everything. So you've been a practitioner of everything, which is huge, which is going to allow you to be able to build. And when I say build, it means when you hire someone to do things, which you will if you keep growing. You'll be able to know if they're good and you need to promote them, or if they're bad and you need to fire them because you've done it. Attention is the number one asset. My question is I am a full-time martial arts instructor and combat sport coach. I coach kickboxing, MMA, and I'm a full-time YouTuber as well. I've got 500,000 subscribers on YouTube at hard to hurt. And my gym has been open for seven years. I've been doing it full-time in brick and mortar for nine and I am closing in two months. Is that hurting your feelings? Yeah. Yeah. If you can't tell, I'm getting a little emotional. I'm thinking about it. It just became because the business model, the way that real estate and gyms, like it just got too tough. So I don't have any business. You've talked earlier about, are you a true entrepreneur, or do you have entrepreneurial tendencies? I'm not a true entrepreneur. You have a passion for the skill you're selling. Yeah. So Michael, good news. I got it, brother. And thank you for giving me that dapps of like, you got it. Like, good news. You are a prime example, a prime example of someone who should have a partner. Yeah. That's tough in my space. People that do fitness and martial arts are all flaky. And they're artists. So they're, you know. I'm talking about a business partner. I'm talking about somebody right now who's dream in life is to operate a restaurant, be the manager of operating a restaurant and operating a restaurant. And then an MA gym is the same exact business. I'm not, I love VaynerSports is in UFC. Do you know that? Yeah. Chris Wideman. Yeah. I mean, Wideman, Corey, Sam, the Hagan, like, we're in it. Like, I love MMA, but I'm a businessman. Right. Like, there's, do you understand if you made a video to your 500,000 YouTube people, where are you located, brother? Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Even better. Brother, do you understand, because I'll tell you why I said even better. The amount of retirees that realized that they're like 61 and they're bored and they used to run an $800 million corporate company. I'm gonna see this video and be like, fuck it, I'm gonna go team up with him. You don't even understand how good you have this. You literally gonna make a video and say, and again, I know it's shutting down and I know that you have to like for a year, like decompress, but like if you decide to open another one in 2026, you're gonna make a video that says, I've done it before, I know what I've learned. It's like watching the film to a fight in UFC or MMA and kickboxing and you're like, oh fuck, I dropped my left hand and you get better at not dropping your left fucking hand. That's very apt and it's funny you mentioned a restaurant. I actually have a buddy, he owns a couple of restaurants and he's like, hey, why don't I just do all the parts you don't wanna do? But so I think you're 100% right. The only issue why we didn't go that route yet and I'd never even thought, hey, why not just give it some time? And this might answer my question. I did it because my kids are 14, 11 and six and I cannot own and run that program and not be in there six days a week. Like I just can't do that and I'm missing everything. So I wanna pull back from the brick and mortar and focus more on the YouTube channel, which I honestly probably would make more money if I did that. But I still love teaching. It sounds like the gym was losing money. It was eating up all the energy and time and all that kind of thing. Yeah, the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. I made a okay living, it was a fine job and I was very passionate and I enjoyed it. It's so many hours and I was missing so much in my children's life. Brother, picking family over money and business is never a bad decision. Ever, ever, ever. Only is it a bad decision when you're not doing something you loved and now you're between two things you love. But that's a great decision by you. I'm proud of you. Keep going. So my, on the day trading and attention, I wanna focus on the courses, like online courses and martial arts courses. Am I too late to the game with that? No, literally today somebody's gonna make their first TikTok and beyond their way being one of the most successful TikTokers. Literally today somebody's gonna start a YouTube channel. Bro, I started my YouTube channel in 2006. When did you start yours? About five years ago. You mean 2019? Yeah. You were 13 years after me. Was it too late? No, you're fucking rocking. Yeah. It's, there's never a bad time to start a good business. It's never too late. If you're 18 years old and you still have energy, like why wouldn't you start a business? Like the concept of like just waiting to die is a bad idea. No, you're not too late. I've got a few courses and they do okay. I guess it's just, you know. Well, that's because you've been wasting so much fucking time on the store. Now you're gonna find all these fucking hours and you're gonna allocate it to your kids and these courses are gonna fucking be thrilled. Yes, sir. You're right. Yes, sir. I have a side hustle of selling firewood. And then I turned my side hustle of that into a side hustle of content creation, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok. And so over the past few years, I've just been growing steadily. This Friday night will be my 230th consecutive live stream that I host weekly. I'm impressed. Recently, I don't know if you're familiar with like tabletop fire pits. Yes. So recently I just launched Mini Firewood. So like I sell Mini Firewood online. That's fucking. I went through the USDA certification program to be able to ship it across state lines. And so, and this isn't complaining at all, but like I do my website, I do my, I edit my videos, I create my videos, I film myself, I do all my social media stuff. And I'm just wondering like, is there a point where I should, you know, look at outsourcing something like to a team? Like, am I hurting myself by trying to do too much? Potentially. Now the thing by doing it that allows you is, you'll know how to judge it because you did it. Most people hurt themselves by outsourcing too soon. So that's number one. So good news. I love that you're doing it because you know how to do everything. You know why I was unstoppable at running a liquor store? Cause I did everything. Right. I did the ice and I stopped the shelves and I closed the store. Like I knew how to do everything. Like, do you know why VaynerMedia is a really interesting company? Cause I'm the only CEO in advertising at this kind of scale. That actually does the work that the company does. All the people we compete with are ivory tower, holding company accountants and bankers. They're not practitioners. So you've been a practitioner of everything, which is huge, which is going to allow you to be able to build, which is huge. And when I say build, it means when you hire someone to do things, which you will if you keep growing, you'll be able to know if they're good and you need to promote them or if they're bad and you need to fire them because you've done it. The amount of people that outsource social media to people and have no idea if it's going well or not, is more than most. Can you afford to hire someone? Well, I mean, that's the other downside of it. You know, if like that, I'm aware it would require, you know, giving up some revenue that I am making in social media. That's called investing. Into the business. Yes. And that's how I look at it. A cliche mistake that most people make. And I could tell you're not fully there. You're on the right side of this, but Dan, do you know how many fucking people businesses never grow because they need the money that's coming from the business for their lifestyle and they don't put the money back in the business? Yeah, I can imagine quite a few. Right. And then something happens and they didn't have any money in the business and they're completely out of business. Yeah. All because they needed a new BMW. Right. Yeah. So, you know, I think the other thing for you to think about brother is, it sounds like you can afford something and I think you should do it just to taste it because the answer is nobody knows. Right. Yeah. Right now I'm like trying to work on and like packaging design, you know, for my shipping boxes and trying to, you know. Well, let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question. Cause I don't, I didn't view it as complaining. Are you enjoying all of it or what parts? Yes. Are you meeting any of it? No. I keep doing it longer. I just feel like I might be hurting myself because I am doing so much. No, no, you're saying I might be leaving some money on the table. Possibly, yes. If you said that you love something and I saw this way you said it, I believe you. How can you hurting yourself if you're loving everything you're doing? You're talking financially. Yeah. And just maybe potentially like missing out on opportunities, you know, and not, not I guess achieving something as soon as I maybe could. So. Well, that's a lack of patience potentially. Possibly, yes. I think you're just got to decide. There's two different answers here. There's the continuation of joy, which I would highly recommend. And then there's what's the best way to optimize. And then to your point, and where I'm going to go with this is you could probably achieve all of it because it just seems like you're super fucking obsessed with firewood and anything you do is going to be fucking awesome. Potentially, yes. Yes. So when I hear the amount of times you've used potentially, I would say that I have a really good insight for you. Every time that you have a burning feeling of something potentially might be better that way, you should do it. And then if it's not better, unwind it and go back to the way you did it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I just, I mean, it's, it's just like, you know, right now I just think about things that I, I kind of have on the back burner that I want to bring forward, but then I get into something else. And then I, you know, it's just a constant. That's called being creative and being an entrepreneur. Yeah. By the way, it's me too. And I have 2,000 employees just at VaynerX. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, I've got plenty of quote unquote support around me, but like you're thinking about things because you're creative and you got a lot of things going on because you're running your business. Right. And just real quick on your, you know, the insecurity thing. Yes, sir. Like the one thing that that's what I'm not afraid to admit I have small wood. Ha! Good way to set this out. Love you, Dan. Good stuff. And also on my Friday night live streams, like anytime somebody gives a super chat, I have a little gimmick hooked up where like drops a coin in the cup and we all take a drink, we raise our cups. And, you know, we can raise wine glasses if you're ever interested. Send it over brother. I would love to, I want to know everything about your mini wood. Yes. All right. Well, thank you very much. I think I first, I first heard of you back in 2020 during COVID. You know, I was working at a bank, you know, I was, I wasn't having like a terrible time, but I was also like kind of wondering, what more can I do? Right. And then you came across my feet and you started talking about, you know, finding your passions, you know, chasing your passions, doing, doing what you love. And that really resonated with me. So after that, I started, you know, a little private soccer training business, you know, one-on-one private soccer training. And I was enjoying it, but it became draining. Right. So I was, okay, this is a, this is a, it's fun, but it's taking too much of my time. I'm not enjoying my time with my wife, with my family. It's just, it's too much. So then I transitioned into video editing, making highlight videos for soccer players. And the same thing, you know, a little too time consuming. So yeah, it started, you know, kind of just, just posting for fun, right? Posting for fun on all social platforms. Man, I take everything that you say to heart. And yeah, so a couple of weeks ago, you know, I got, we reached a thousand subscribers on YouTube, got approved for the YouTube partner program. And we were excited about it. Okay, yeah, let's, let's, let's, let's start monetizing this a bit, right? A few content and then, and after that, it took off 1000 the following day and extra 1000 subscribers the following day and so on. And so, and that's how it's been for the past couple of weeks now, and, and we're up to almost, I think we just hit 14K this morning. And I saw the, you know, I saw the generated revenue that's been coming in from that. I'm like, wow, like this is, I see why people, you know, turn this into a full time gig. I kind of had forgotten what my question, it was about merch. No, it was about merch. No, and I kind of answered, you kind of answered partially as I've had you on the background where I've been working, but it was like, okay, I have this, I have this spike. So spike 17 is my nickname. I had a spiky hair in high school. 17 was my jersey number. So I was 17 and I was okay. So spike 17 training was in my business. And I now I have the YouTube channel called spike 17 TV. And, and I've had this merch, right? I've had it for over a year. I haven't really like pushed hard on it to sell. And I think what I've been focusing on is, is building the brand, right? Like gaining the followers, you know, kind of telling the story, having people, you know, get emotionally connected to Oscar and to, into the YouTube page. Makes sense. What I was asking was like, how, like, should I, should I keep waiting, should I keep waiting, right? To, to, to. You could do both brother. You could jab and right hook. You're allowed to throw out the merch push once at a blue moon. Like you could do that shit. And you're more than allowed to do that. And I would highly recommend you putting it out there. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of what I figured. Yeah. And that's kind of the same thing that, that we're doing with, with you. So, you know, I've gone really big into content creating, just, just making content for fun, right? And I got recently, I got reached out by a USL two franchise, Utah United shout out to Utah United Academy. Shout out to Mark Davis. Mark Davis is a huge fan of you, by the way. He's a, he's a, he's the head coach, kind of co-owner or founder of Utah United. And, and we just kind of talk about you all the time. And, and it's funny now that he's, he's watching this too. But, yeah. So, so I don't know. I guess the question would be like what with Utah United, we're on, we're kind of on a mission to, to kind of stand out amongst all the other, I don't think, don't think in the terms of standing out, think in the terms of providing value. Providing value, yeah. You know what I mean? Back to you, listening a little, like we talked to Joey Bats, the Vegas arrivals there, like the way we spoke to that lady in the UK. Like too many people are like, oh, we're going to stand out from all the other, you know, soccer teams or, you know, like it's, it's not about that. The way you accomplish the stand out, the way you accomplish the happiness, it's all the same shit, which is how do you, how do you bring value to people? Right? The, this book was originally called Jab, Jab, Jab, Left Hook. Right. Which was a follow up from a book that I wrote 10 years ago, which is what I was just telling you to do, which is give value, give value, give value. And then you could ask if, if the Utah club puts out great videos, you know, learning videos of how to start your soccer journey, highlight videos that people think are rad and are escapism. And then you ask for people to tune into the game on the SPN plus or to buy tickets. You're going to convert better because you brought value. Yeah. There's a lot of people, Eric, that are going to buy this, this fundal book today because it's a thank you consciously or subconsciously for the value I've provided for 15 years. Right. And because they're going to get value, right? Right. No, that's exactly how I feel. That's exactly how I feel. That's why I bought the book. I was, I asked it for a Christmas present back in, yeah, last Christmas and figured out that it was really going to be released right now. So yeah, I mean, I'm just, I'm just grateful to be on here, Gary. And I mean, I kind of, like I said, I take everything to heart from what you say when it comes to, you know, pursuing what you love, not chasing the cloud, not chasing the money, you know, chasing happiness, true joy. Oh, it's always happiness. Like, look, money and clout, slang for reputation potentially at its best form. Those are good things. Having good reputation, having money, they're not bad things. It's just not easy to sustain them if you're not in a good place. Right. Why do so many millionaires burn out and go into addiction or lose their money? It wasn't sustainable because they weren't in a good place with themselves. I'll try to give you a very short backstory, but I'm building a business with my dad. We are, we've grown up loving mini bikes. We've ridden them all our lives. He literally buys and flips them and fixes them and really cool. And over the last decade, I've worked as a professional filmmaker making marketing content. So I learned working with business and entrepreneurs, business owners and entrepreneurs, like what it takes to build a business. And so I finally took the leap to build one with my dad. And so for the last eight, nine months, we've been promoting before we've launched our product and we're about to do our VIP presale for the first 25 bikes that we'll be doing. And I'm confident that we're going to sell out because I think with the amount of hype that we've been building. But my question for you is once we get an influx of this capital, what would be the best way to invest it back into the company? Is it better to hire people because right now it's just my dad and I? Would it be into equipment that can help make our jobs easier? Would it be into more marketing? Also for background, I literally, I left my job. Let me answer that question. Yes. All three. So the question becomes the cadence and I think the cadence of which ones of the three are completely predicated on which ones you want to do or which ones you least want to do. And I would focus on what you want to least do. Yes. Okay. So accounting. I definitely don't want to do accounting. But then I would hire somebody that knows how to do that. Yeah, that makes sense. You can do somebody who's part time and partial because you're still a small company. So I like to go with either extreme offense marketing or plugging holes that is a vulnerability because we don't want to do it. Gotcha. Now, what if it's something I enjoy doing? I'm good at like video production, but it also is the most time consuming element, which takes me away from the visionary role, which is what I'm kind of in the company. Because the visionary role is not something you actually do. It's something you think. I'm in a visionary role in the company too. Yeah, that makes sense. I do my visioning when I'm fucking in the shower or taking a poop or on a plane or when I'm walking across the street or while I'm talking to you right now, I'm visioning some of the stuff I want to do with virtual influencers for VaynerX because the brain has the capacity to be thinking about multiple things at once. The vision, the thing you're talking about, the visionary thing is don't let that turn into some sort of bougie entitlement. Oh, no. Yeah. That's like, what do you get to fucking do? What are you going to sit in a room and look at yourself? Yeah, no, no, not at all. I just I... Probably while you're editing, if you're like a lot of other good video editors, the video editing a lot of time is your therapy and your time to think as well. So vision while you fucking edit. That's true. Totally. I understand that 100%. It's something I actually do a lot of my thinking in the shower. That's where I do my best thinking. And I don't know if you'll appreciate this, but we literally, my fiance and I moved back in with my parents to start this business. Of course, you brought that up knowing I was going to appreciate it. It's like a best with everyone. I hate when people live at home so that their parents pay for their whole life and they're just sitting on the couch and fucking talking shit and doing nothing. I love when people have the strategy to have the humility to move back in with their parents, to save dollars, to reset to a springboard and extract more family time with their parents. Two very different versions of living at home. One is you're still a fucking child. The second is you're a humble operator looking to reset and strategize. Two very different fucking people. That's exactly the, I had this realization last two summers ago. I'm like, we only have X amount of time and I don't spend enough time with my dad. And here's something we both care about and I have, I believe the skill set to build it. It's the, the greatest thing that ever happened to me was that time with my dad running that mind library, like the great blessing of my life. Yeah. That's, that's, I feel that every day I feel fortunate. I feel like we're living a dream. I was very fortunate in the fact that the only reason I was able to do it, we had a condo. I had to move to the States for a little bit for work. And so I sold that condo and I had a bunch of money sitting in a bank account. I'm like, what am I doing? I could use this money to build something of my own, or I can keep just doing what I'm doing and miss out on that opportunity. And so we took the leap and here we are 16 months later. We haven't sold the product yet, but it took time to build for you. Look, my business is a twill, the world in other, it's a brand, but I, everything has started because I've been 25 years in the leather industry. Over 25 years. So, and I realized that the materials, when they are, the leather, when it's properly processed is one of the most sustainable materials. So that's why, even if I went in the, in the supply chain, I moved completely to the, to, we're directly to the consumers, just because I wanted to create a brand where, where the materials were, where I could educate and bring some products to the people in, that are where sustainable. What are my challenges, the creating this education and bringing, bringing this awareness because there was a big gap, the, the leather industries at the front, front of the industries because of the nature of the business. So, somebody on Twitch said they need a hundred leather wallets. Should they DM you on your app? Yes. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Yes. So, thank you so much. So, there is my, my Instagram. So, my question is that when I also, I've, I've learned that the, the many companies are doing, of course, the greenwashing is just saying that they're doing something that is not, but there are many companies are also doing the green hushing. So, where the green hushing is where the, the, the industries or the companies are doing some of the, of the sustainable efforts, but they are not communicating it. Why? Because they're afraid of not reaching the goal or whatever. So, what would you recommend to approach and not, I mean, of course, social media and I'm trying to educate and I'm trying to, to create every beacon. I really thankful for the opportunity at beacon because I have had the opportunity to even to talk to Mike, Mike Rubin or leaders like that say, Hey, what are you doing for us consumers? You know what I mean? Because we want to learn. So, what do you recommend or help me to how can I address these and creating marketing, I mean, creating content so I can get people because a lot of people think, oh, sustainable, and sustainable is so expensive. But if we all start like you're saying, eating healthy, oh, when you start eating clean, I mean, you help the soil and there's so much behind it. So, a couple of things. I think, you know, with anything, with anything that people think about in these genres, there's the ideological part, there's the financial part. There's the one thing that I always think that for good businesses struggle with is when they start bleeding into shaming people versus educating. Yes. Oh, yes. It's a humongous issue for nonprofits and for cause businesses. There is a really incredible insight about people. They are visceral to being shamed. People would rather be punched in the face than shamed. Shaming is an incredibly ineffective tool. So, I think that the first thing that I would say is one, the answer to your question is content. You know that. You know what my answer is for me. But I think how you do your content is important. I think you have to be very thoughtful of being overly empathetic and just keep pounding that empathetic framework with information and patience and lack of emotion. Like this is something you're passionate about. I will never achieve me fulfilling my goal of making all 8 billion people like each other. Okay. It's not going to happen. It doesn't mean I'm not going to try. Okay. Yes. It's just execution, right? Like what is V-Friends? V-Friends is my opportunity to scale my message using characters that I know can get to people that I can't. Yes. Yes. What V-Friend? And Jessica said, why the fuck not? Jessica, the reason I don't think I'll be able to achieve getting 8 billion people to all like each other is it's just not the reality of the human race in 50 years based on where we are right now. Maybe we can get there in 5,000 years, but like we're just too far away from that right now. We've been taught too much to dislike. We lack compassion. We lack sympathy. We're too selfish to be able to be there. Modern parenting is not showing me that they're going to achieve that. So why not? Because fear is a very effective formula. Well, in fact, that was a big mistake done by, I mean, the leather industry did not approach all the sustainable efforts being done. And that's what I'm trying to communicate also to businesses, because if you start doing anything in sustainability, don't make the mistake that the leather industry did. Yeah, but I also think the bigger issue is that businesses go out of business if they run out of money. And so, you know, like the question starts to get very heady on this issue. For example, like what like when I hear this issue, I'm like, yes, sustainability process for a lot of businesses doesn't require more money, but for many it does. And it requires, you know, this short term money, but then long term it will work out. Money has never been more expensive than it is right now. Interest rates are all time highs for a lot of people, like or at least in times. Most of the business I know are barely holding on to say like businesses are big businesses are stressed to fuck out even people are asking them to like business environments are more competitive than ever. AI is looming and changing the whole world. Governments regulations are getting harder. People are asking them to do shit and they're barely getting by. And some aren't some are flush and crushing and and I think when you look like and then there's also consumer demand, right? Until the consumers demand it, businesses aren't going to give a shit about anything. This is what is very interesting because there was a survey done by IKEA where it says that three out of four are really looking for the sustainable surveys are full of shit. Eva, okay. Like the reason like the way people buy shit is the way it actually works out. But look, I think it will head that way because people will learn. But like it's a challenge, you know, like again, I think we've touched on a lot of important things. I would say for you, focus on not shaming. Yes, that's that's what I've been doing. Yes, this is information and then you can feel when you're 99 when you're laying there, you can feel like you gave it your all. And that's all that I'm trying to do. That's all you we're just human beings. We're doing this weekend and to answer you directly, put out the information. All right. Well, thank you so much. I got a question for you. All right. I started a newsletter. It's called a Sunday sauce. We do one every week. Don't start getting don't be like what you got to do 90 a week. Like don't start doing it. Let me just get the question because I know you better say it. No, we rep sauce, Gardner at VaynerSports and I was going to help you. Now that you said don't say it. I'm not doing it. I spoke too much. No, but my seriously, the idea behind it is to get some real data from like the actual audience that we're cultivating and obviously provide value to what it is we're writing about. My question to you is what's a good way and a cheap way to help boost the amount of people that see it and sign up? Is it just volume of like here's what we're doing? I think look, you're very comedically strong. I would do like a very smart video that is like a normal Nikki Cass kind of video. Yeah. Yeah. But the hook and the laugh is signing up for the newsletter. Yeah. All right. You see, he liked it. Huh? See, I didn't get here with my fucking. I like it. No, I like it. I'm really proud of you, bro. I see big things for you. Stay focused. And I see that in you. I see your capacity to be like me, which is just living your fucking cocoon and don't give a fuck. Yeah. You know, hearing you say that gives me chills because I think, and I'm not just saying this, like that it just I believe you and I believe that and I know that for me too. And I like you say that it's very cool. And bro, you just got to remember right now, like you're in a good zone. There's going to be times where it's going to be even though it's natural to you hard for you to stay in that cocoon. Yeah. You know, like you're going to get a Netflix special and then it gets canceled at the last minute. And you're like, what the fuck? You know, there's going to be adversity. Right. Well, I love adversity. I know you do. That's why I believe in you. I love adversity. Yeah. I appreciate you saying that. Do you know how much like I love adversity? You know what's so funny, dude? I fuck and like it's like when I say that people like make fun of me like around me and they'll be like, like, what are you players? Yeah. Like, like, what is it like I get excitement and so probably a little fucked up if you think about it, like, I get it. Bro, it's very fun. Bro, I literally want to go bankrupt so I can start again. And like when like this whole thing people talking about tick tock going away and all this stuff, I'm like, good, fucking let it go away. I like fucking and then we figure it out. You know what I mean? Like then what's the next move? Yeah, there it is. You know, much attention is going to be up for grabs. Exactly. Exactly. Right. And from up, it's a slippery slope with democracy. I think there's bigger issues than people realize. Like it starts with like, they're bad. And then it's like, you're bad. Like it gets a little weird, weird, weird. But I'm empathetic. It's above my pay grade. I don't know exactly what the fuck is going on. Right. On the flip side, if it goes to if it goes away, everyone's going to be scrambling. And I love when it's scrambled. Yeah. Yeah. Let me ask you this. I feel like, like I said, there's the there's the comedic side to me. Like standups not in the cart. Like I I genuinely I played sports, my like business. Yeah, I get it. And I'm struggling. I said a Netflix special, not a standup. No, no, I know. No, I know. I'm the but when I'm asking you, Gary is transitioning because on the street, although it's all love, but on the street, it's like, Oh, do the skits are so funny to skit. And that's great. That's the only thing people want to bro, my original fucking business videos. Talk to me. Talk to me. I'm talking to you right now. My I did wine content only for five years. I started making business videos. The comments are literally staying your fucking lane wine. Okay, good. Good. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Now look at you Gary signing box. So I'm glad. Well, templates. But you know, like, but yeah, and they're going to tell you like, yo, why are you talking this business shit? You should have stayed doing the videos. This is boring. You were funny before. Yeah, you need to be like, I don't give a fuck. Right. Well, I never do that. You're right. You're right. Like, why do the V friends thing? I like the other stuff. I'm like, I don't care. Because in 19 years, you'll be like, now I know why this motherfucker did the V when you're wearing V friends pajamas one day, you're gonna understand exactly why the fuck. So you know what's so funny to I don't know how much time yet, but I'm just going to rip it. The I was in Disney two and a half weeks ago. And at the end of the fucking night, they do the fireworks, right? I was in family vacation, do the fireworks and they do this whole thing. And I'm thinking to myself like this guy like Walt Disney, someone I look up to this guy created these characters. And like, I think every adult should watch Disney movies and educate themselves on what it means to be like a very empathetic good human being because the lessons that are taught in those movies are so powerful. And like, like, it's so genius how you take the the guy's imagination, you make it into a reality. And then you make these movies about it, you make the amusement parks and people are learning how to be a good human being through these creative outlets. And I'm like, that motherfucker Gary Vee's doing the same shit. Yeah, I'm like, it's awesome. Like it really is. Nicky, what do you think of Hewlett Long Island? Never been I'm not from Long Island. I'm in I'm in the I'm from Rockland. He was a bunch of pusses and like make fun. Yeah. Now, honestly, I you know, I don't want to I got all the love in New York. I don't want to talk bad. Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this. You you when you go to the bagel shop in New York, are you are you like what I'm so curious I never seen you eat my life. I seen the blueberry video. But like, what are you challenge down you getting like the program protein production? No, I yeah, I like protein, like I've gotten very educated on like getting my protein carb ratio into a decent place. I'm bro, I love food. I just don't eat from weight. I don't eat until seven to eight o'clock at night. Predominantly, I don't eat during the day. What? Yeah, bro. Well, you're not getting you're not getting enough cows. What the fuck you mean? So you're telling me you're just dialed on no food, just black coffee every every day until eight p.m. Well, I like a little cream in my coffee. But like, I'm like chilling. Yeah, like this is like, I don't know. Everybody's been here since 10 a.m. Like I'm not moving like I've been sitting here the whole fucking moment like I'm not you're not hungry at all. At all. Are you getting in the gym? Are you doing some resistance training? What's that? I'm like, I thought you were watching daily these bro, I'm fucking like, yeah, don't you watch daily V? I don't think I got I saw you stretch. I saw you I saw you do fucking yoga and maybe a little bit of curls and whatnot. But I I I get protein. I just pound it in the evening. You know what I mean? You get good for you. All right. So then you wake up in the morning, right? alarm goes off. Yep. Is like, what's the routine to the office? I got my phone, go poop, make sure nothing was on fire in Singapore. I like all the shit that I have to and then I shower I go I go to the gym to 83% of the time hour. Where's shower office, 830 or nine until literally fucking seven, then seven to 10 business meetings. Love it. It's a lot of a lot of how I roll around on buying and selling service contracts between like B2B. Okay. Negotiation from the purchasing side and the seller side because I have an entrepreneurial boyfriend who does selling and then I purchase on my side for my full time job. No way. Yeah. Awesome. Okay. So any like, especially when you're dealing with like competitive likeness between businesses that you're vetting or how transparent do should we be from the buyer side and then from the seller side, if they're getting, you know, driven to lower pricing, lower pricing, lower pricing because the big dog in town is, is trying to stay in big dog. Hold on guys, stay in the game and they're about to lose that service to like a third party or something like what, what are some strategies around that? Well, the biggest strategy. How far do you go, I guess, to keep a customer? The place you have to go is transparency to the customer. Sure. Like that, like whatever's in the best interest of the customer will always be the future leverage of your life. Sure. So that's number one. Yeah. Right. So if you're telling a customer like do this because it's in your best interest, not theirs, you're dead. Yeah. Yeah. And that's how I think like he's always approached it has always been from the perspective of, you know, trying to be the best and then also like delivering at a really, really good value. The problem is, is there like who he competes with is like an OEM. And so, but they're like third partying out their service. And so I think it's, I mean, I mean, you know, if the service is subjective that to the consumer, if they don't value it, you know, these, you know, it's always price and service. And like, it's always like in the marketing world, they're like, Gary, these are good priced CPM, but I'm like, they're cheap because they suck banner ads on websites should be cheap. It's bullshit inventory. Right. Right. Like at Wine Library, if I call my dad right now and say, how's our service? He'd be like, it's the best in the state, but that's because he's grading his own homework. Right. Right. You know, so like some things are debatable, some aren't. Service provided is subjective. Yeah. Absolutely. Price is not. Right. Right. What you need to do is make sure the service so much better that the far majority of people believe that service is better. Otherwise, you'll be an докумent. Yep. That would produce
