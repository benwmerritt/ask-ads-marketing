The thing that you're dreaming of doing, being a singer, being a content creator, whatever it is, if you never jump, you've always lost. If you jump, you might lose, but you've always known you did it. That's a big difference, because if you don't jump, it's a guaranteed loss. If you do jump, 5% of you might pull it off. But for the 95% that don't, at least you don't have to live your life with that pit in your stomach that you never went. I did trade attention and build businesses. The legacy is greater than currency. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Life documented. What is going on at Sunday at the National at the V-Pres with? You know how Sunday is. It's chill. I'm kind of walking around buying. I'm watching kids literally play the TCG right now. It really started to establish this IP. We're building slowly, but we put a flag on the ground of building the V-Pres brand. And I'm proud of that. People are discovering the characters, and we've got a long road to building out this IP, but I'm a minute for that. I like the grind, I like the building, and we'll be doing that. I'm having a very good time. Days and days of life here at the National Car Convention. Remember this, strangers become acquaintances. Appointances become friends, and friends become family. And I really believe in that journey. Like, we don't pick our parents. We don't pick our siblings. But all of us, we pick our friends. And they always start off as strangers. And so, be more open. Don't be scared. Love yourself. Give yourself some freedom. Don't beat yourself up. Love yourself. Because if you love yourself, you'll have room to love others. And that's what we're saying. My name's Stephanie, and I go mama breaks. I was a middle school teacher, and now I'm making a million in revenue by first year. And the first book I ever read that got me started crushing it. Everybody's watching. Do what she did. She had the courage to jump. Even if the thing that you're dreaming of doing, being a singer, being a content creator, being a breaker, whatever it is. If you never jump, you've always lost. If you jump, you might lose. But you've always known you did it. That's a big difference. Because if you don't jump, it's a guaranteed loss. If you do jump, 5% of you might pull it off. But for the 95% that don't, at least you don't have to live your life with that pit in your stomach that you never went. Thank you. You're welcome. Man, I'm sad we're leaving. This is how a DJ I am. I literally just said, man, I hate that we're leaving because I'm looking at supplies for trading cards, and it made me feel sad and nostalgic. We're perfect timing. We're at mascot. We just did a podcast, and he's eating. This is like out of all the seconds of the entire show to walk and keep eating. All of the over listening in the podcast, I told you he's handsome. No bullshit. What was the big stand out? The amount of kids here, the amount of activity. I drop by your booth, hundreds, hundreds of people every single time I drop by. Now the important question. What is the best potato chip flavor? Salt and vinegar. Bro, I'm so, oh yes, I wanted one. I thought you ate them all. I needed one. That's the first time I've eaten anything besides all Italian ice. Italian Italian ice. I've been on this entire show. Brother, we'll see you in Cleveland. Talk soon. Let's keep this going and rolling. The supplies, I'm telling you, is the backbone of the fucking industry. You don't have your shit right, you're dead. Supplies are underrated. Brandon knows how much I nerd out on supplies. What's been your most awesome pick up this week? I got a Ronaldo, BGS, 8.5, Mega Crafts rookie, which I'm excited about. I'm buying some of the vintage, non-sport stuff because I'm building an intellectual property. Some of the Disney, some of the He-Man, some of the cool pop culture stuff. It's got my attention, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So I'm enjoying it. What's up? What's up, chum? Okay, we're wrapping up here. Cars packed back to New York. Just had the best time. Time with my friends, time with my co-workers who are my family, and really expanded the brand. You know, this is fun. There's not a lot of video on the early VaynerMedia stuff. There's no video on the early Wine Library stuff, but there's gonna be a lot of video on the early V-Friends stuff. I'm excited. I'm excited you're on this journey, Dust. It was fun. And I really hope that you all can find something you like building as much as I'm enjoying building V-Friends. It's a great joy. It's a grind, it's hard. I don't know how Dust and the team are gonna edit this, but there was a lot of energy put out every day, second by second by second. And it's well worth it, because it's gonna be fun for everyone. See ya.
