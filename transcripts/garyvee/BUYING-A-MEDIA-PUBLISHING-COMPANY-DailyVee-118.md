PLEASE PLEASE! Let's go home, let's go home, baby, you jerk. When it hurts, you stop. You don't like that jerk. You don't like that jerk. Ha ha ha, he's at some point right now. Just need to get on the record that this is Russ. This is a week long Russ for some two week long, right? That's why everything you're getting on tape right now, it's trash. It's absolute trash. Now, Miss Buckets, we missed our foul shots. Well, except for the time that I got Gary on the No Look Pass, he went that way. That was pretty good. That was pretty good. Just for the record. Just for the record. Ha ha ha. Good morning. How you feeling? Back. We're fucking back, D-Rock. Okay, it's great to see everybody. How was your New York? Great. More good stuff? Good. Really good. I really did rest. You're absolutely right, Collin. I took a look at my first four months, the calendar, like the third day in, and I was like, okay, I'm going to rest because I don't know when it's going to happen again. Antigua was great. I slept. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it was Inquila. It was Inquila. I didn't go to Antigua. I went to Inquila. I went to Inquila. It was great. It was originally the viceroy, but then it was bought by the Four Seasons. It was great, except that we got there super late the first day and the second day. I was only awake for four hours. Like, completely, yeah. Like slept in, woke up 10 o'clock, had a massage at like 10.30, had lunch, drank like three-fourths of a bottle of wine, and went to sleep at 4.30. And didn't wake up until 9 a.m. the next day. He's the best. Two-sevenths. The dose fire up there? What? The case doesn't? Should just be connected here for? Oh, West Red Hills? You know about West? West Red Hills. West Red Hills. West Red Hills. West Red Hills. West Red Hills. West Red Hills. West Red Hills. West Red Hills. West Red Hills. What now about West? Alright. So, this is it. This is the new shit? Hey, guys! How are ya? What's your name tag? Horror? That's a really fucking funny thing. That's such a good clip. There you go. Yep. I'm so tired. I'm so spent for basketball. My legs are dead. Yeah. I'm back. How's it going? Really well, my friend. Such a pleasure. Is this like a surreal feeling? Yeah. Got his combine invite yesterday. Yeah. What do you want to work on? Have you given that thought? In terms of what? For the combine. Have you thought about that? I was thinking I want to work a lot more like just skill development on the field kind of stuff. Just lineman type stuff. Just a kind of... Technique. His positional coach is John Stenchkohm. What about the interviews? The interviews are big. To me, I think that's where you're going to explode. And now it's working with Chip and John. Thank you so much for the opportunity, man. I'm really excited. Thank you. Such a pleasure. Thank you so much. But anyway, please let me know. John. Yep. I see it. John. You're wired. I'm wired. It's a real pleasure. Thank you so much. They need... Yeah, I think we do, but I need to wrap my head around it first. Cool. Take it. Yeah, exactly. What do they need? The details of their deal. Hey guys, how are you? Really well, man. How are you? Happy New Year. Happy New Year. So, okay, so we're starting the New Year off with some news, I see. Yes, some little news? So, yeah, so I saw the details against October a little earlier, but yeah, I guess maybe the best place to start would be just by understanding exactly what the structure is. So this is sort of separate to VaynerMedia. It'll be kind of like a, you know, sort of like the publisher side of sort of a new holding company. Is that kind of right, Gary? That's right, Steve. Where it's not owned by Vayner. It's a sister company to it that is going to be called the Gallery. Inning, as a matter of fact, if you even think about how I named the company from the beginning, VaynerMedia, it was always the ambition from day one to try to be involved if we were able to execute over the next two, three decades in all facets as I thought what the internet was going to do. And I think the reason that the most macro level for why it's happening, Steve, is I think the internet itself creates an infrastructure that allows people to be involved in a lot of things at once. And so to me, five or six years ago, this became very obvious to me. And so we just needed to get big enough. And I bought small little media sites along the way, fooled around with it. We finally got to a place where we could afford and make a proper play for the, you know, I think for me, I'm a big fan of the jockey along with the horse. And so, you know, over the half decade, seven years, getting to know Ryan and, you know, on and off the field using a sports term. And so I'm really, to be very honest, it's a very important day in the history of my career because I think it's a foray at a major level into the media side. And that's why we formed the Gallery because I think the ambition is obviously pure as a real thing and we have real work to do and we have aspirations for it to be as big as possible and as impactful as possible. But it is structured and at the highest level, the goal is to be as successful as possible in producing the stories that grab people's attention at the highest levels for every demo forever at the, just like, I want to buy the New York Jets, Steve. Good new year? Good new year. All right. Lovely. Cool. I'm gonna prove it. Damn it. Hey, everybody, this is Gary Vaynerchuk and this is episode 236 of the Ask Gary Vee Show. My question is, when you are setting up a startup, this is a pricing question. Would you go strictly trying to compete? Would you, how do you get that, you know, startup number if you're offering services or a product? Just go trying to be cheaper with a competition. If you have a better product, how, what's your thought on that? Yes. Do you understand? Yeah. If you were building a business that you want to build and you want to support your life and family and have all the riches that entrepreneurship requires, well then you need to spend 18 hours a day. Is it a good idea to have a better product? Yes. Is it a good idea to have a service at a lower price than your competitors to give the person that is actually financially conscious the ability to go with you? Yes. Is it better for you to cold call 97 people versus 6? Yes. Is it better for you to produce great content that reaches people through virality that is better than your competition so they know about your service? Yes. Is it better to hit up your grandfather because he's friends with this guy who's got a business in the space that you're trying to reach? Yes. Is it better to put your phone number on Instagram live to get on the Ask Gary Vee Show to get an answer? Yes. Yeah. That's awesome. How's everything going here? Everything's been going well. How do you like the culture? I like it a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Everything's like this. Good man. How's it going? Hey. Good to see you man. I see too. What's going on? Not much. How was your holiday? It was good. It was a lot of things actually. I didn't do much. I had a very, I didn't sit by a fireplace but theoretically I did. I didn't do shit. I really did. I just got a focus or an online or a lap. How you doing? I'm doing well. Good man. What's been going on? So how long have you been here now? I started June 6. So a lot of different things have happened in your guys' department since you've been here. Let's start this way. How do you feel today? I feel good. I like the company a lot. How you doing? Good. How's work? Great. Good. Tell me. People are working with the best. Very, very happy with. Who I ended up with? Yeah, you ended up with an A team. That's the truth. How you work with this? Unbelievable. Yeah. What was it? Wait a minute. Your spirit animal wasn't... Listen. Originally not an Al. I was in it to live by love's Hebrews and I'm obsessed with Alist. Have you ever heard of Wuzzles? Wuzzles? Wuzzles. So this is something I like to reference once in a while. That's why D-Rock's laughing. It was a 1980s cartoon for like three seasons and it was the combination of two animals. You know what's funny about that? In interviews I ask, if you're the... It's the last question. It's kind of like the, you know, just how funny are you? If you could go buy any two animals, what would it be? And if you're a designer, make them draw. That's cool. Can we collaborate? So it would be a zebra owl if I could. Yeah, but you gotta come up with a better name. Albra. Albra. Albra. Albra. I'll draw for you. Jessica Albra. But it's so interesting to see how far the company's gone on the execution level. And how many people can just collaborate when you have that scale size. And I just found that so intriguing that we've been able to maintain that ability because it's super hard. Honestly, not... It's hard to keep up with everyone. Yeah. Before like this. I'm glad we did that because we're in our weekly meeting and Kenny and I were like, oh, it's cool Vayner coming back. And like, you know, these are the things that bring people closer. 100%. I walked down the hallway and it's barely like, I'll be like, hey, if I do them, right? Yeah. If not, it's harder to just give them a high five, right? Because Joe went marching on it back in the day. 100%. And it was like, you got kicked out. Yeah. So that's been interesting to see. So actually, you know what? I'm going to send a company wide email right now. You see your tag. I'm going to use it as a props. When is it prop? Cool. Cool. Yeah. But it's been crazy man. Being back. I'm so happy you're back. Hit me up anytime if you need anything. Awesome man. Take care. Thanks. In the same reverse, no BS. We have plenty of our shortcomings and everybody's got strengths and weaknesses. I just know every organization stems from the top. Like, we actually want to do it for the right reasons. I've never had, I've never made a decision. I run this company that is predicated on our personal financial situation. That's why I know. Unheard of. It only happens. It's not because I'm Mother Teresa. It only happens because I'm so capable of growing top line revenue. So it hides all the mistakes because I myself can get us so much new business. It just enables us to actually try to figure it out in a time when it's being figured out like everything's changing. Yeah. And that's cool. You know, one thing that people like, you know, so when I started talking about this whole world 10 years ago, so many creatives poo pooed it because they think it's small. They still think it's small. This is now 10 years later. But I remembered thinking, wow, they're so blind. They, you know, these creatives don't realize that 96% of creatives don't become Steven Spielberg or anything close to it. And then their stuff is never seen. Like, how can you be creative? I believe that as a, like, as a far more creative person than people realize, I believe in it so much that I'm documenting it daily and putting it out the next day. Like how would you want to work on televisions? Like when I met Jason, the reason I knew he was my guy is the passion oozing out of his eyes is like I can't work on another TV show like the last four in a row that don't see the day of life. Like how can you work for 40 years as a creative telling stories and it never be seen? Exactly. It's insane. More people saw that Budweiser video on Facebook than like 94% of the content on television. I feel like there's definitely a place for me to grow and do what I want to do. It's really great to be here and to have this time with you. Not what I was expecting the day back in the office, but I'm happy to see your face and have this one at one time and just to grow with the company. It's great to see you. You too. Have a great day. You too. Talk to you soon. You too, my friend. I'll take care. Awesome. Over here. We did this. It's so cool. Looking good. There we go. Awesome. Thank you. Guys, just so you know, like Mainer Sports is going to literally be a major play. The two kids that we just signed, this kid Toth that's in there, he's going to be a second round center. He's going to be the all pro center. Just money in the bank. He stays healthy. He's the best center in draft. Very involved in the first seven to 10 pitches, 15 even, show you some of the moves that I think are going to work in that world. I need to hear it so I can reverse engineer it. I'm going to be very entrepreneurial. Here comes, and he's like, wait a minute, we have 700 employees. If you count, well, no, no, we count one for ancient. Like obviously we're not going to like, the answer is the thing to do here, correct. The goal here is, you know, to really think about how to position this, because if we position it properly, I can get loud. And if I get loud, we'll have unlimited deal flow. We can just close people left and right. All good stuff, man. How are you? Really good. Super checked out and just spent mainly time on just hacking Instagram and just relaxing. So it was good. There's two things I'd like to accomplish in this meeting. One is to talk about the content around you. Are we going to do a daily V or we can do an ask Gary Vee and how much of the, you're the franchise man like you had with, you obviously, Lindsay and I have been talking, like, do we do both? What do we do? How does that work out in a $1000 kind of fee thing? And then number two, John's been working with KT, right? You know, this conversation of classic, you know, like everybody has to deal with this, which I just need clarity from you of like your point of view versus your CFO's point of view of like, what should we deal with? And by the way, I want you to know, Eric, nothing scares me. I just want to get to the clarity of it so we can tell you what we can deliver for what, right? Are you interested in being followed around from a day to day standpoint or two, three times a week daily V? Do you want to redo what you were going to do anyway? We're like, maybe it's a once a week show where we actually go and find franchisees and do something like that. Do podcasts, like where do you want the, what pillar of creative are you thinking? Let's get this all wrapped up and we'll talk soon. Alright, talk to you. Thanks for the... I mean, so... There's so many... That's small business, by the way. There's a lot more of those. It all comes back to the way I built Wine Library. When I get into wine business, everybody sold Opus 1 for 110 bucks but it cost 63. So I just sold it for $69.99. Market share capture. Also allows us to like do some, you know, we have clients that want to give us media dollars but can't. You know, like it's a way to play with dollars. Yeah, but being very disruptive. Yes. Did you see my, you felt my strength today. I messed up. You probably ran into me. You ran into me. You guys are late to the end. Yeah, you know what's funny? Honestly, this is, and I think you maybe felt it too. This is not a joke. I mean, I'm being a little bit... I actually actually have quantified the strength that Jordan gave me based on our interactions. Because... Because like... Two years ago, we'd throw you around and now that's not... There was one weird play when we ran into each other and I didn't see you and I was thinking to myself, my God, 24 months ago, I would have been dead. Well, the problem is now is that I'm more afraid when you're behind me. Right? Because... I would feel okay to back up in you before. Yes. And now it's quite the opposite. Yeah. I'm a man. That's why I threw you around. See how far he flew? The extra tab that's podcast. Where? The website? In. For which we'll have like the different links to the different audio experiences we have, like Stitcher and IOT radio iTunes because when you link up the iTunes, it only goes to the A. In. In. In about a week. That was when we got Zach. We get it. That's good offensive work. I like your hair too. That's a good move. Thanks. Got some work done today. Lots of ups and downs. Got to figure out how to show more downs this year. I'm such a positive person in general. And usually downs involve... You know, it's funny. I wish that the downs didn't involve other people. So I'm really sorry, Bayonet Ornation, that I can't show you what a stunning percentage of my day is actually downs because I'm protecting other people. That's what's happening. Like, you know, we're not going to show you the entire Tyler freak out about the scheduling this week. You know, like, it's not going to happen. I appreciate it. But you know what I mean? Can't protect all, but there's plenty of, plenty of downs. What she smells you like. I know. Hey guys. Hi. I'm good. How are you? Good. Good to see you. Same to you. Was it good? Yes. Enjoyed it? Not for Miami yesterday. Yeah. Yeah. I was in Naples on the other side and like the weather was... I do. My in-laws live there. What's up brother? It's your spirit animal. Me? Go. I'm going to see the color purple. It's the night of the last night? It's going to be emotional. I feel very emotional about this. Have a good night. Good night guys. Have a great night. Good night. Take care. Bye. All right. Good night. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. I'm fine. I'll go another 12 hours. But yeah, there's a little bit of a recon... You know, when you let your body down. Yep.
