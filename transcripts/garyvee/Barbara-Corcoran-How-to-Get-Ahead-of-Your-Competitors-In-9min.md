A lot of people watching right now are like, the social's not working for me and I'm like, the creative is the variable. You got your perspective. I just wanna be happy, don't you wanna be happy? All right, first up, we're kicking off the show with Shark Barbara Corcoran. Her credits include straight Ds in high school and college. She had 20 jobs by the time she turned 23 and then she borrowed $1,000, quit her job as a waitress and started a tiny real estate company in New York City that is now a $5 billion real estate business. Welcome, Barbara. Hey, my pleasure to be here. I love Gary, I'll do anything for him. Barbara, it's great to see you. It's always great to see you. Happy holidays and pending new year. We don't have a lot of time, so I'm gonna get right into it because I know a lot of people were excited that you were gonna be on the show. Thanks for kicking us off. In your opinion, which consumer behavior shift will be key to driving growth in 2021? Am I allowed to pick more than one? Cause I think there's probably four or five out there. Okay, one of the customers in charge. I think if we didn't understand that before we certainly understand it now, the behavior that we collaborate with the customers over with they're in charge, end of story. So I think the key here as an entrepreneur is you have to stay very close to your customer and listen hard and see what they need. And I think the first thing they need is they want safety and that ain't gonna go away either. And when I say safety, I think you have to put safety first. Customers demand it and you don't have to worry about how to pay for it because you can't afford to worry about how to pay for it. You just have to do it. I think social media is the fastest and cheapest way to communicate what the safety measures your particular business has done. And I think the social distancing protocols that we've all recently encountered are here to stay as well. Things like the dots on the floor. I don't expect them to go away next year at this time. Mounted thermometers at restaurant doors, discretionary masks for travel. I think it's all, we're gonna just see a softer version of the same old and ain't gonna go away. But safety is what people care about now and they will continue. How long do you, let me jump in on that one. You know, okay. So we see a softening, let's say a year from today. Do you think, do you see a time where we go back to 2019 levels or do you think this is now stuck in our culture for quite a long time? It's part of our culture. It's not gonna go away. Would you travel in an airplane whether you're traveling business class or coach and not wear a mask? I wouldn't, never again. I mean, I kind of wanted to do that when people were coughing next to me but I thought it was socially rude. Nope, I'm going on the airplane with the mask forever more. I don't want to catch what's going around. You know, nothing's gonna go away. Totally we'll have a residual that will become part of our culture. Definitely. Understood, keep going. Okay, online shopping is king. I mean, I almost feel embarrassed to say that everybody knows that, okay? But I think part and parcel of that is you need to go to where the customer is. I have one business name, Cousins of Maine Lobster, a large franchise of lobster trucks. Yes, I like those guys. Yeah, those guys, I think you interviewed, yeah, smart entrepreneur. The moment COVID hit, that guy had pivot, I hate the word pivot but I'll have to use it because I don't know what's the substitute. Oh, he turned his business around. There's a new substitute I can use. With contactless pickup, communicating where his trucks are gonna be and he moved his trucks out of the normal places that were crowded and he utilized every single large shopping mall parking lot, gave people numbers, they waited in line, picked up, they went home with their dinner out and his increase in sales went through the roof within a month and a half. Pretty sharp, but he understood he needed to go to where the customer was comfortable being. I also have a business that's my most successful business named Comfy and what it is is a wearable sweatshirt and what they did is they had $150 million in sales in big box stores that were sent back to the one COVID hit because the big box stores they were merchandising to had closed, what were they gonna do? They increased their sales online, turned up a website that they hadn't taken seriously as before and they turned $150 million in sales into $250 million in sales. They went to where the customer wanted to be. That's exactly what they did. And then also, again, obvious, so I hesitate to say it, social media is the name of the game. I mean, I don't invest in a single business in this season on Shark Tank unless I felt that the entrepreneur was almost a borderline genius on social media because I know we're gonna have to rely on the social media platforms forevermore because we have spoiled our customers with us and they want it. In social media, I think key traits or key entrepreneurs or pardon me, key employees that all of us need as entrepreneurs are now the producers, the storytellers, the videographers, it's really become the new norm. They used to be extra people. It was nice, a luxury feature if you want, but with social media being the name of the game, it's not the case anymore. Barbara, real quick on that, I'm starting to interrupt. When you were building your real estate empire, so much of it to do with branding, was direct mail a very strong pillar for you in the prime of your growth? Yes, it was, but everyone used direct mail, but the way I was able to become extremely successful with it is I use postcards because I watched people at home, including myself, and I didn't open junk mail, or I was forced to read, that's what we used, yes. So you paid higher to be your individual postcard versus maybe in a value pack, and you feel like even though you were paying more to get into a mailbox, you were getting seen more often, and that gave you a leg up. It gave me a leg up, but honestly, I never considered value packs because I'm too selfish. I want my own stage wherever I am, and I got it on a postcard. What was more effective than the postcard campaigns I constantly ran was buying billboards, 10 cents on the dollar. A lot of people... Remnant inventory, right? Remnant inventory. I did the same thing for Wine Library. I went to New York and that put my brand frontline and center billboards worth king, and then also what a lot of people didn't know then that I took full advantage of is I bought Remnant Space in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and saved for retailers, but when I checked into their rules, retail was not the rule. It was just shop right and everybody was using it, and I started putting full page advertising for all my properties that look at a billion when I really had 10 cents on the dollar as well. It's funny. I really think your career in knowing it, being a East Coast guy, a lot of people think about me with social media, but I got my chops in direct mail print, outdoor, radio, because I was advertising as like a kid for my dad's store, and I think the reason social was so natural to me was all the things I learned between distribution, you just basically talked about underpriced attention. You would buy more strategically around places that people would look. You took advantage of the remnant cost, or I did the same exact stuff on print and outdoor, and direct, you couldn't really do it the same way on direct mail, but the other thing I learned during that era, because I was doing so much of it, was the creative was the variable. Even though I was buying the full page New York Times ad in the dining section at a really good price, because I knew when to buy it and how, my ad mattered to how many people I would get, and I think that that is a big, a lot of people watching right now are like, but social's not working for me, and I'm like, the creative is the variable. And the creative also must have the key ingredient, and I'm sure you'd agree with me. It has to be authentic. People see through the bullshit anymore. You know, if your story's not authentic, if you don't connect with them on some basis, I've even gotten rid of makeup in most of my postings. I find that people respond better to me looking ugly than old all up. Authentic is key, and I don't think that's gonna change either, of course. I agree with you. You got one parting shot, we got a minute. I know these are going quick. Okay, so one more thing. Please. You need to be an entrepreneur that thrives on change. I mean, if you don't welcome change and look for it, seek it out like a missile, like, what's next? What's next? Like a kid with a curiosity box, right? You're not gonna be ready for the changes out there. I mean, change for me, and I don't think I'm imagining it's happening probably twice the rate it would four years ago, and if you're not aware that today is the single best opportunity you're ever gonna see again for the next 10 years of taking over your competitor's marketplace, his beat, because you can outperform, out-create, out-do whatever you have to do to get rid of that guy. This is the time to do it. The best time to move ahead is always in the worst times. Any smart entrepreneur will tell you they moved ahead in the worst times because the big guys are asleep at the wheel, they were talking. They get tight. They get tight. Most people go on defense. It's exactly the time you got. Yeah. Yeah. Farmer, it's great to see you. Okay, my pleasure. Thank you so much for this 10 minutes, really. Thank you very much. YouTube Watcher, what's up?
