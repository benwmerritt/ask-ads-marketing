Is it a good idea to spend $700,000 to make a 30 second video that nobody on earth gives a f*** about? There's a respectful way for you to say that in the room and I believe you speaking up to truth has a funny way to play out well for your career. Somebody's always watching. It's a late October 2024. Just making a quick little video. Business slash marketing opportunities in 2025. Number one, live social shopping. Tick Tock Shop, whatnot. Meta's gonna have an answer. X looks like it's gonna have an answer. Like it's a big deal. Poshmark, Walmart Live, Amazon, eBay Live, Fanatics Live. Like it's really here. And so please, please, please understand affiliate which is happening more in Tick Tock than anywhere else and live shopping which is happening in a lot of places. Get good at it. The QVCification of social media is gonna be the buzzword of 2025. Number two, AI influencers. You will see more people that are getting famous on social that are not real people. It's AI and you're gonna see companies and entrepreneurs own those people and monetize selling stuff. It's gonna be wild. And so this one I know is gonna get a lot of people like, ah, but AI influencers is gonna be a big part and what AI influencers are going to do to influencers is what influencers did to famous people. It's gonna take a lot of market share from brand and business opportunities over the next decade. The beginnings are now here. Number three, creative creating the reach in social and changing the entire paradigm of marketing. Organic social posts will become the most important thing in a person's marketing world. Not the last thing it does as matching luggage and complimenting to the campaign or the thing they're doing. Using the AI algorithms, the news feeds, the algorithms, the 4U pages to do creative testing, to do consumer insights while it's doing marketing and then saving you a fortune on media when you're spending good media on good creative will become the modern framework. Social media, organic posts, excellence, the best in the game are gonna separate themselves even more and it's gonna be a major deal. And so three hot topics on my mind. Leave a comment on what's on your mind. Nice, nice, nice. You have like a really jam packed bag. Yeah. Podcasts, interviews. Yeah, little bit of a throwback 2017 Gary V-Day. Yeah, I was thinking how most people will prep, take notes, do you, you don't like... I think I'm prepping at all times. What I think more people should consider doing is talking about things they know. I'm a practitioner who then talks about what he's doing. I prepped yesterday, I prepped the day before, I prepped the week before. I think too many people speak about things they used to do on categories that are still moving. Like going and giving a speech right now about marketing when I retired from day to day marketing in 2007 is challenging, I would need to prep. But I stay in my lane, that requires no prep by the way people think about it because you're actually prepping at all times. There was not a speck of meat left on my chicken wings. And nobody has ever done hot ones and cleaned the bone more. And I dominated. What I think is the most important thing is that you're not going to be able to do anything. You're not going to be able to do anything. You're not going to be able to do anything. Someone comes to you, they're coming to learn how to be authentic. How do you have that conversation? What do you stage? It's kind of similar to companies having to make political statements. Brands can't be authentic. Brands are not a human. What brands can do is be more consumer centric. It's less that we talk about authenticity, though that's lovely. I think what we talk about is like, do you understand that no human being would like this video? The amount of marketing that is made that literally nobody on earth would ever make if they were trying to get people to give a shit about it. But because it's the industry we make or when we run media, and you know those impressions are not getting achieved. Like this industry is obsessed properly with reach, it's imperative, but we're actually obsessed with potential reach, not actualized reach. Because this industry has done a remarkable job of deciding that common sense has no place in our industry. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Really good, really good, really good. Thank you. Overall, I would say die on your own sword. My biggest sadness, because I've really come to love this industry and many of the people in it, my biggest sadness is that I know a lot of you don't say in boardrooms and in meetings exactly what you actually believe because you know it doesn't get measured. It's not in the reports. And I will tell you that what's been devastating for me now that I'm 15 years in is watching people that really knew but bit their tongue and then they get blamed when shit doesn't work and they lose anyway. And I think that I do think that there's a lot of change coming. I do think that the pressures of the reality of how the industry is changing will put pressure. And I think it would just be like, there's a respect, I'm lucky, I have no board, I'm not public. When I fuck up and do something stupid and we lose a client, I just look at myself in the mirror and make fun of myself and move on. So I lack the fear that many have when they know if they make a mistake they may lose their job, I get that. I'm not confused by that. But I promise you there is a respectful way for you to say, are we gonna continue to buy these programmatic banner ads on dot coms that nobody goes to? This is not good, even though it might look good on the report. Or is it a good idea to spend $700,000 to make a 30 second video that nobody on earth gives a fuck about? You know, there's a respectful way for you to say that in the room. And I believe if you're a CMO or VP or in a company on a brand at an agency that you speaking up to truth has a funny way to play out well for your career. Somebody's always watching. And being right historically matters. Thank you, Harry. Go, Jess. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Amazing guys. It was nice seeing you. Bye bye. Thank you. I left the corporate world for 20 years to follow my dream as a photographer. Got to take your picture tonight, bro. My brother, I'm proud of you. Really proud of you, man. You know, I'm so glad you brought that fear thing up because that was holding me back. 100% Yeah. The thing with the fear thing is you could always go back. Everybody who's watching this right now that is scared to jump, you jump. You're like, oh shit, I suck or I lost money or it's worse. You go get a job back. The jobs are there. The jobs are there. I love your sweater, by the way. I saw it in the, yeah, happy to. Everyone's gonna say no, but virtual influencers are gonna do influencers. What influencers did to famous people? People laughed when I said that people on Vine Twitter and Facebook and social media would be more famous than TV people. But the biggest social media influencers are dramatically more famous than a lot of actors on shows right now. Like dramatically, they're not even the same realm. Like the average TikToker that's five million followers is more famous than a B actor on Law and Order, fucking SVU, you know what I mean? I'm not scared of social at all in the way that people talk about it because I think parenting is collectively using social as an excuse to not parent. Like TikTok, like, I mean, a lot of you know this. I've been yelling about TikTok since the get, since it was fucking musically in America, right? Plenty of people, especially when all the baloney started happening, would roll up at me at like an airport or a restaurant or something like that. Like, you know, I like you, but this fucking TikTok thing, like it's a real fucking problem. And I'm just, I swear to God, I would look at them and be like, then take it off your kid's phone. I'm not your fucking kid's parent. If you think, like, I don't know, I'm 49. My parents thought like alcohol was a problem, which meant they didn't want me fucking drinking when I was 14, so they scared the fuck out of me. Like parenting has become unbelievably ludicrous. You don't like shit? Be a fucking parent. Hey Gary, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your time, thank you for your energy. Thank you so much. Thank you. I wish people had better relationships with their parents. I wish people gave their parents more grace. I said something at Vekon once that said, it was called, said the line was, I just want you to all know, if you're upset with your parents, like fuck your grandparents. And the point was, there's so many people that are mad at their mom, they know their grandma. They know what their grandma did to their mom. But they like their grandma, because their grandma didn't do that to them. But they're mad at their mom. But the grandma created the mom. Like I don't think we do not leave enough grace for our parents' mistakes. Thank you, Gary. Thank you so much. Good luck, my friend. Thank you, my friend. If your whole life is prepping, do you need to prep?
