Do you know that I went to the Lion King on a date because I was in high school and cried when the dad died? Which pretty much does. When Mufasa dies, I am a senior in high school on a date with a girl like that. I like start crying seriously. The company behind Coco Mellon announced a new partnership with entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk agreeing to produce content based on his V Friends universe and a lot more is the man himself Gary Vaynerchuk along with Kendall media co-CEO Kevin mayor of course Gary. What is this partnership? Why does it make sense for your business? You know my mission is to make people fall in love with the V Friends characters If I don't get the world to fall in love with rare robot or patient panda Then the mission isn't accomplished and the collect abilities of the original NFTs and other things we do becomes mute And so teaming up with Kevin and team like moonbug. Obviously. I don't have to tell any parent That's watching this how much consumption and love for Coco Mellon and other things they do and just like morning cartoons in the 70s on Saturdays or after school in the 80s or Nickelodeon later If you don't win in the medium where cartoons are being consumed you lose and YouTube kids is the most important platform for me And I'm teaming up with the best Gary Vaynerchuk. Kevin mayor. Thanks so much cartoon time Thanks everybody so excited about this really just genuinely excited about building this over the next rest of my life Got a lot of work ahead of me to get people to uh really fall in love with these characters Obviously got the kids book coming soon.

I'm just wanting to be guys In gals the heads up Okay, am I uh unmuted you guys can hear me We can hear you. Yep. All right awesome squad ccc says this is the worst idea ever I disagree And we're here for questions. Please put in In the chat question colon and your question How do you have the capacity and time to give love to everyone on bad days? How do you work through it when you're not feeling it? Well on bad days when you're not feeling something you don't do it. It's not like 365 days a year I'm at my most alpha. There is no such thing as consistent every day all the time Some days are rainy and I have bad news and I don't have the ability to Explode and give everyone positive energy what I don't do that. I think most people do is on my bad days I'm not deploying my negativity onto others. I think people when they have bad days or not in a good place Deploy their negativity on others. That's what people do in comments like social media and in real life I saw some guy having a kid in a carriage Which is the kid I get it at the airport But an elderly not an elder like a 60 year old 65 year old woman. So not elderly but like, you know, not a Not a young woman Uh, we're just kind of walking by him and he's like excuse you and I'm just like so much anger And I get that he's frustrated at the airport and the little kid in the carriage. I get it But like that just unhappiness being deployed at people for no reason and so it's less that I Give love every day. I try But on my bad days I keep my fucking mouth shut for my negativity and that's what the world is not doing a good job of right now When they're unhappy, they're just trying to make everybody else. I'm fucking happy right youtube How am I gonna tell you to get to the point where you was like I don't give a fuck about what nobody thinks because I thought like I am there. I think it was I think it was like fifth grade For real when it's not in you for a long time It's hard because then you're relapsing when they talk to a friend or they read somebody else or listen to a good And they get hot right it's like working out like right now my scale this morning was probably one of the worst numbers I've had in like two years and I put on a little muscle so I understand how that all works But me and mike were talking and I'm like man, it's fucking hard Which is why I'm empathetic to everybody when I give my two spills. I don't think about it as even advice I'm just talking my talk and hoping it might help someone But I know it's hard because I know you know eating properly and doing the right thing in the gym comes hard to me It doesn't come hard to everybody for some people. What's their favorite thing for me getting my mind right is my favorite thing I've been practicing not giving a fuck. I went through high school where everybody feels heavy peer pressure And I was laughing at people and when I say laughing at people I was a laughing meaning I was good with me like when people try to drop some peer pressure or making fun of me. I was like I can't feel you You're not winning You're confused you picked the wrong dude to do that too because you're just wasting energy because I feel bad for you You know for me, it's been a long time. Which is probably why I was able to like navigate my career the way I do When you're this talented you're always one post one video one song one lyric away And I've seen it happen countless times No, you've seen a different version than you you've seen people get a moment for a couple of months or a year Off of one little thing. I saw trinity that james had the biggest song in the world and he's amazing by the way Yeah, but he's transformed himself into a 360 personality But like let me take you back that song was the biggest song in the world But it doesn't mean he's selling out stadiums right now Now because he's so talented and he's a businessman and his personality has been able to do so many amazing things One of my favorite people. This is not saying that tj doesn't have all-time world-class talent. It's saying that you do What is something that you would say that happened in pop culture that was instrumental in your life for me what What literally came up was actually pretty funny because and I'm still a huge fan of the movie The lion king i'm forcing the the disney moving the lion king on my kids because I still like it and I really watched it so many times when I was a kid This is amazing like my my mom by the way Do you know that I went to the lion king on a date because I was in high school and cried when the dad died? No, pretty much pretty much I mean and I cried too. They did like take me out. Yeah, so I was too upset when mufasa dies I'm a senior in high school on a date with a girl like that. I like start crying Seriously, yeah game over today. It would have completely locked it in back in the 90s in jersey But I never wavered I didn't try to hold back the tears either. No, I was like fuck it No, no like I lost but like she really lost Yeah But like thinking about that. Yeah, I don't know but that movie has so much so much In it truth. Yeah truth perseverance Overcoming finding out who you really are In life. Yeah, I think it's such an interesting interesting journey I believe that most people listening to what I'm about to say do not believe me at all And you're literally on zoom with one of the only humans outside of my family like outside of what I tell you Brandon knows that if in Four Saturdays him and I went garage sailing and I found a thing for a dollar That is 39 dollars on ebay that in my chemicals in my cloth in my fucking soul Who I am but that's more exciting to me than if I got a text from the head of new business of vayner media saying We just landed a 20 million dollar account for vayner media and when I say it's not even close parker It's not even close brand. It's so it it's so true, but it's so ridiculous But you understand Gary, right? Like how well I live it. I know what's like of course. I understand. It's my life But like it's it's true. It's true. The reason you're interesting is you're I of course know Because it's how I live my life every day You are like one of the few people on earth that actually know that's true. That's correct There's not a normal human on earth that just heard that That's like that makes sense. That is the stupidest shit of all time to every person Gary, how do you find garage sales? What's the you know, like you just drive on google The key is to google townwide sale in your state. So townwide sale Illinois townwide garage sale new jersey to really be efficient You want to find a town that's doing a full garage sale now? We're fortunate jerseys one of those states a lot of states don't do that It's not as common, but that's it. What do you work on today? Gary? What's like? I'm working on in three minutes I have a call with this starbucks CEO. No way. That's right. It's how my life goes sitting with parker for You know an hour drinking wine and telling war stories or bread and then quick harsh transition to three minutes as CEO starbucks You
