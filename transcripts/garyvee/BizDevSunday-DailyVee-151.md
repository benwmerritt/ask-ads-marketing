It's a big idea, George. His Dev Sundays. Here we go. Sob, I've been telling you... I'm trippin' like I'm giving a pedigree, and me and my specialty, I'm puttin' the work, tell him dirtin' the earth, I'm movin' furniture to heaven. It's almost 8 o'clock at night. It's been a weird, weird day. Got to work out, Jordan. Just passed the laundry room, heard people yelling. Guy yelled the score. I can't believe the Falcons are winning 21-0. I tried not to know anything about the game or watch anything about it. So my prediction is Pats win. Anyway, woke up this morning on one hour's sleep. Slept a whole flight, landed, hung out a little bit, had to take a nap, just dead. I just woke up. What a weird day. Just a weird, weird day. But look forward to work out and came up with a little fun idea for Sundays. So I'll record that in a minute. It's called Biz Dev Sundays. It's a big idea, George. So I'm gonna do Biz Dev Sundays. What I'm gonna do on Sundays is list things for you, the community, of things that I'm up to that might be business opportunities for me and you. Now, the thing that scares me about this and why I don't normally do this is like tons of emails, like hundreds, that have nothing to do with it, right? People are trying to really stretch. Move in a little, Jordan, I wanna make sure you hear us. Like really stretching if they actually can do this or whatever I'm asking for is really a fit. But hopefully it works out. So actually, you know what? Let's do Biz Dev Sunday at VaynerMedia.com. Team create that email this way. It won't be horrible. And this way a bunch of the team can jump into the email with me and phone it. So ready? First, the first Biz Dev Sunday item. Oh crap, I forgot my phone. Oh, I got it. Small brands do stuff with my athletes. Oh, right. So Vayner Sports, as you guys know, one of the things I'm trying to do is change that sport a little bit and do endorsement deals that have never been done before. Obviously the Nike's and Under Armors and Thetis and Reebok deals and the Panini Sports Cards, those are all standard deals that we'll work with. And a lot of that has to do with wherever the kid is coming out of school. Like those are slotted in and you negotiate them. But I want to do unique things. Up-and-coming brands, right? Like Nose Stripes or Headbands or Beans or Socks or Granola Bars or Trail Mix or you know, Pomegranate Juice or Coconut Water before they were big. This is a real opportunity for my athletes that are going to have big social media profiles, become new star rookies in their cities and big college stars. You know, like Jaylen Reeves, Maven and John Toth from Kentucky and Tennessee. Now you're thinking about like if you're a regional play in the middle of America and you want to hit that fan base of them being college stars and now they go to the pros. So these are the things that I'm looking for. So if you are a startup brand, a t-shirt brand and you're willing to pay a small amount of dollars to my players to be one of the faces of your brand and put it on their social or we create content and you put it on your social. Or if you want to give a piece of the equity of the company for those guys, kind of that vitamin water deal that David Wright got and 50 Cent got. Bizdeb, small brands with my up-and-coming athletes and some of the athletes that we're building around VaynerSports is today's Sunday 1st Bizdeb number one. Music Alright, number two on the Bizdeb Sunday list. By the way, this thing, the hell is that? It's called a Vowslide. Okay, whatever. Number two, stickers and posters. If you're a company that, and by the way, we'll put like stickers and posters, Bizdeb for brands. So put whatever we put down here in the title when you send it to the email so that we don't have any confusion and whoever's jumping in and handling it can go through it quicker. Stickers and posters. Obviously the things that create t-shirts and all the quotes and the stuff on Instagram, all that stuff. So many people asking for stickers and posters. I'm looking for a company or two, a startup that wants a Bizdeb with me. What I'm looking for is starting a free, that's the best deal for the exposure and all the different people all the way up to like whatever I think the best deal is. So where we Bizdeb, what's the value prop, what's the exchange. I know people get so sad about free. If I had a sticker poster company where I printed, I would ping somebody that had a big audience and be willing to do it. I did it a ton with Gourmet Library. I gave away free cheese forever. I did it with my baseball cards. When I was 15, I gave away free cards to the biggest dealers and thing because it made relationships and I built on that. That's a different story for a different day. What's the best deal? Who's got a sticker company? Big shout out to Sticker Mule. I've done a bunch of stuff with you in the past. But really this is Bizdeb Sunday. This is for me and my community to do business together if we think we can match. And so sticker and poster companies that are willing to print on demand and ship to the people on the other side of this camera. Because one of the biggest things I want to do with the 60 Second Club, which I'm rebirthing, 5 minute club, 60 Second Club back on Instagram, put on your notifications. I want to give away a bunch of the posters and stickers of that quote in real time. And I think that would be a lot of fun. So stickers and posters. Number three is I just mentioned the 60 Second Club is back. I'm focused on it. I'm putting people on my team on it. One of the reasons I faded out and created a 5 minute club was because I was worried that I couldn't get into all the comments. Thought it would give me a little more time. Big thing is I just want to deliver on this. You know, I'm a big fan of surprise and delights, right? Like the thing I did the other day with Chipotle. I love this stuff. I call it the Taylor Swift thing. I just like, I like doing nice things that are fun for the community. Like if Macho Man did this back in the day and he had an Instagram account, I would put my notifications on. And what he would post if I click it, if that gave me a FaceTime with him or like a signed shirt or it would have been cool. So anyway, nonetheless, 60 Second Club, if you don't know what it is, when I post something on Instagram, if you like and comment within the first minute, you become eligible for me or somebody on my team now because I just needed to add that to make sure I deliver. To jump in, pick one, two, three random people each time to win. We leave in the comments. You DM the information my team. We ship out stuff. Just a little fun little thing for the community and a great way to make sure you're keeping up with those two to three posts I'm doing every day on Instagram. 60 Second Club back focused. Be a part of it. Alright, starting to get rocked. I'm getting rocked at my workout here. I'm here with you Jordan. You're like all happy. I want to start a Beanie Company. I've decided. A brand new Beanie Company, not like the Gary V signature or not in Gary V shop. I mean just like a Beanie Company. So I'm looking for somebody who is really great at sourcing high quality materials for production. And so I'm looking for somebody to give a little piece of equity to come and be on my team on this to be my partner, a creative director to design the concept. Got a good idea of what I want to do. But make it better for that person to make it better. And somebody on the sourcing. I'll take care of the design and marketing website all that. Distribution I think I can figure out pretty quickly. But somebody that actually produced the first 10,000. I'm going to start a Beanie Company because I wear them all the time. And I miss retail. I want to sell something. So and something that's not like also your fucking face. Cool. Who wants to be part of the Beanie Company. Hit me up. Now, you're a deliriat. Perfect. Not I've got hustle and I need to be a part of this. You have experience in producing, you know, product that's been sold at retail direct to consumer in the fashion space. And you have a creative director background around it as well. Like experience only. Young hustlers. We've got many millions of other things to do with you. But this one that's what I need. So don't waste your time. And finally, sorry. I'm not getting up. And finally, clip it. Clip one. Clip one minute. Clip it. Whatever you want to call it. We'll come up with the hashtag here. Just clip it. In the YouTube sections, comments. Your favorite one minute clip from every DailyVee. That we can then use for an Instagram, Facebook and Twitter video. So a new group of people who follow DailyVee. Who when they watch the episode, say hashtag clip it. Two minutes and 13 seconds to three minutes and 13 seconds. We're going to use the community to decide which clips we should be making in our one minute Instagram, Facebook and Twitter videos. Who's part of the clip it community. Let me know in the comments. How long? 47. I think it's like 50. 1260s? I think it's 60s per minute. 12. Farmers carries? Yeah. Yeah. I still got strong there though. Stronger. Stronger. One is greater than zero. Worst workout ever. See you tomorrow. Bye.
