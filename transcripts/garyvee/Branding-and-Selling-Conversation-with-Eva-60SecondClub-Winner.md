So, big following on Facebook, we have another million uniques to our actual website or our blog a month. Nothing I didn't spend. And we want strategically to do something, especially I think with Instagram, now moving a little bit away from the branding and giving, I think, well. It's funny, because I was just about to blurt out, this is your opportunity to do more branding. There's a big difference between the way HubSpot marketed their product and a lot of other people. And the reason it was successful is they did both. How did they do both? They spent money on things that weren't directly correlated to fucking driving people into a conversion funnel and selling them. Yeah, okay. So they invested in both equally, is what you said? I don't know. I would tell you that if you can afford to, you would only invest in branding. You would only invest in branding. If you can afford to. Got it? Yeah. Because what branding does is the following. Here's what branding is. Branding is getting married. Okay. Got it? Yeah. And selling is hooking up. Okay. Okay. Like, look. That's the best of the day right now. Pretty much. Like, why did I buy these? Not because they crooked me. Right. I'm fascinated by that. It's why I'm winning. Right. I'm branding while everybody else is selling. So how would you go about? Even the only little things I sell? Like the only two things like, and shirts, right? Like it's branding. It's branding. I don't give a fuck about the money. That's it. Got it? That's where people are confused. I like when people are like, Gary, you say everything is free. I'm like, sorry for the $13 book every three years. You know, like, I'm like, I'm not, I don't need you to buy it. Like, I don't stop my sentences and then put up a paywall. I give complete thoughts. You don't need to buy anything. Got it? Even, so to my point, if people are smart enough to understand what I'm actually doing, I'm doing branding. Where I make my economics, it's still just reinforcing branding. Speaking is branding. It's awareness. Right. Like if I, like if I, like, I'm just laughing because do you know how easy it is for me to build a business that's like, hey, everybody pay me a thousand dollars. That's what I'll give you. Like convert, I mean, it would kill. Like horse, no. It would kill. I would make $50 million a year. 50. But when you're trying to be a billion dollar player, you don't care. You know, you think you've got more. And so I think, I think people brand and sell predicated against their talent. Or at least their belief of their talent. The quickest way I know somebody doesn't think they're big time is by their short term behavior. Now, money is important to make. I'm blessed that I don't need to monetize my audience in what I actually do for a living. And I actually think what you're doing is smart. Like you need to build content and those things for your business. What I don't, what I think you need guys need to tweak is you can't be 100% in DR sales. You need to start with 20% of all your stuff is just for the branding of it all. Like why don't you have a dinner with your 12 best customers and then film the conversation and then put that out. I was literally gonna do that in New York. I was like, wait, this guy. But yeah. There you go. You've got it. You're being very intuitive. Like based on a couple of things that are going on here, you need to get to the market. I mean, how many people in the company? 60. Is it small? How long you been there? I've been there a year and a half, maybe two months or so? Do you have the year of the CEO or the marketing head? That would make sense to me. It sounds like they're smart people. If you've got their attention, you've got my attention. You need to push. Be like, hey, I don't wanna step outside my bounds of what I do, but I believe in this. And Gary V said it was cool. You know, like you've gotta figure it out because you're right. You're up, your body language is going to the right place. Your water is getting to the right place. If you, do you think, this is just a side tip. Yeah. Do you think if you didn't get successful, you got with Angel Investing, would you have done things differently? No, because it's how I built Wine Library. So you would, you think- I had nothing. But timing wise, do you think you'd be able to do a lot of the giving back that you're doing now at this scale? Yeah, it's the thing that I did. It's how I built Wine Library. I'm just patient. Like what's everybody in a rush for? Like I promise you, if I asked everybody, hey, do you wanna make $10 million in three years? Or do you wanna make $50 million in 11? Some people would take the 10 and three. That's fine. But I don't know. I like the 15, 11. It's just better. I think people get confused and unfortunately, they didn't document this at the time. So here's something interesting. I was about to say, I think people get confused because I wasn't documenting my life and thoughts when I was actually being patient in my 20s. And now they see it. What I don't think people realize is I'm nothing compared to what I'm gonna be. So when I'm gonna be the guy, like the, not nice, cold status amongst the smart homies, then this is gonna be interesting. This is gonna be real interesting when, when I sell a company for $1.7 billion. This is gonna be really interesting when I buy a brand and flip it. This is gonna be really interesting when I make my, I know that I have another Facebook and Uber in me. Like when I make that, but I'm gonna put $5 million into it at a $10 million valuation, own half of it. And then, this is gonna be interesting in 25 years. When people are gonna ask me the same question, like would you be giving back? And I'm like, yeah. Go watch DailyVee 158. You know what I mean? Yeah. Got it? Yeah, yeah I got it. My version of that was, I was a 22 year old kid and I worked every minute. That was my giving back. I couldn't fly people from, I couldn't give them my time. I couldn't do these, I couldn't give away tons of slick. But what I gave was my time. When you don't have money, you give your time. That was my patience. That was my giving back. That was me being in the store, helping a manager get better, 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on a Saturday and training him on how I wanna do it instead of going home at six and going to the city and having a date. Got it? Mm-hmm. Work 10 minutes away. Thanks. Oh, I meant when we get there to the airport. One of the things I thought, since I've been in the tech world for all my career, but I have a lot of friends that always ask whether or not I would start my own thing, including my former CEO. Like, do you have any desire to do your own thing someday? Yeah, you have such a confidence kind of vibe, which makes sense. But it's funny because my answer was always, no. Like, I think I'm a very, and until you said it in your content, I think it really stuck with me. Like, I'm a very good number two. Yeah, I get it, man. I think that's- I love being like that. So I'm gonna say something that pisses me off that D-Rock is catching this, because I've sat it here and there, but I don't think I'm gonna be escaping this one. I secretly wish I was a number two. Why is that? It's the best job. You get a lot of the economics, a lot. You get a lot, a lot, a lot of the perks, and a lot less of the shit. Because you're still number two. When you're number one, you're a professional janitor. When you're number one, you're in the shittiest spot ever. You've got, it devastates me that my hard wiring forced me into the narrative. I'm obsessed with number two. It's the gig. It's the gig. It's just great. You still can impact. You can do so much. And there's just still something about not being the last line of defense. You still get to look at somebody else and go, what do you do? Yeah. And for me, the way I am, theoretically I wish I was a number two, but for me, it's so funny, even though I just made that huge rant, I could never look at somebody and say, what are we gonna do? It's funny, but it's a good gig. It's a good gig. And I think even more interestingly, I think number three and four and five, I mean, if you can be impactful, there's people in my company that are number 57, but have a lot of influence. And that's a really great gig. Everything is relative, but it's awesome. That's right. Yes, that's right. That's right. Like the 52 at Facebook. Like growing landings. Oh my God. More money. From a financial standpoint, number 52 at Facebook is gonna make more than 99.9% of number one. For sure. That's why I always remind people that interact with me. This is where I think DRock is very smart. Been watching his whole narrative, like you gotta be smart when you catch a tiger by the tail. You really do. She was saying his burger thing. She was just told, you know, say no to a seat on the rocket ship. Yeah, right, right, right. When it's a pan-decorated center. You just take whichever seat's given to you. And I love the meritocracy of it all. Like the people that jump off my ship, I'm such a son of a bitch when it comes to the competitive nature of business. Like I love them and I feel sad. And I want nothing but great. And I genuinely, genuinely, genuinely wish they go on and do bigger than if they stayed with me. I really do. However, I'm excited to knowing that that's probably not gonna be the case. And I can't wait to see that. That's why I love business. Because you can be a good guy and you can be an assassin at the same time. And if you know how to balance it, you can really pull it off. And I love that. I love business like that. I love that we can pontificate back here. I'm a number two. I'm a number one. I'm gonna be all time. Guess what? That's what I actually think what I do is pretty interesting. I'm always curious about, am I completely insane? Or is it meant to be? Do you know it's insane that I've painted such an aggressive narrative that I've opened my mouth in such a big way? That I can achieve unbelievable greatness and still be looked upon as a failure by the masses? You said thanks for teaching. Yeah. Yeah. Like the high percentage of people that believe in me will be massively disappointed if I'm not able to achieve $4 billion worth of net worth and be able to find it. You're telling me? Like I could literally be the first eight hunts. I could be the first person ever to make a billion and be a loser. Yeah. Everyone you're gonna hit that number. But you know what's funny? You know what's funny? You know what's funny? I actually, as I sit here, realize how much the journey is the only thing for me. Like it's crazy to me. So it would be insane to do that. And it's crazy when you look at the math of what I'm doing. And it makes me realize how little it actually means to me. Like just the legacy means more to me. I really mean it. Like I've really gotten into a great place with this. Like I love it. I love the impact I'm having on people. When did you realize, I'm sure you've said this at some point that you wanted to buy the Jets? Very early on. Somewhere around fourth grade? Really? Yeah. Right around the time I realized I couldn't play for them. I was like wait, these other kids are faster and bigger. I better just buy them. You know? What strategy? Yeah, it was a competitive move. Like okay, your bow. Oh okay, you're better at it. What about when you play for me? What about when I'm signing your check, dick? That's what happened. That's not the way I was at a young age. Yeah. That, yeah, you know, I'll be honest. I'm real curious to see if one of my kids has it. Because it is, in hindsight, it was, I mean people aren't blessed with it ever, let alone having it. I mean, so I punted school. It took me a long time to understand that about myself, but that's why I gave up on school. Just knew it wasn't gonna matter. And when you really genuinely don't think it's gonna matter and you're in the fifth grade, sixth grade, you know, then you're able to like kind of enjoy it because I hated it. But at least I didn't have to do anything. Yeah. Like I didn't believe in anything that was going on. But at least I didn't waste any, I mean, I think in ninth grade, freshman year of high school, which is a pretty essential academic year, I don't think I opened a book. I think I took books home. I think I put the brown paper bags and covered them up, you know, protect the cover. I think I drew on them. I think I put them in my book bag and I actually believe that I never opened it. Mint condition. You should sell it. It's probably worth some money. It's a big trade. I think you put this on eBay. It's very cool. Why did you ever do college if you knew? My parents wanted me to and I didn't, it wasn't a fight that, it was a fight I tried to have. But my mom wasn't, I wasn't beating my mom. My mom was undefeated. You know, it's the true answer. I would have loved to have not. Actually, that's not true. I'm so pumped I did. It made me grow up. I went to a really hardcore college, got very cultured, met a lot of stuff, grew up. I became a grown up, you know? You don't think you would have done so in the same way I did? No, I think I would have been different. I think a lot of my swag comes from the urbanization of my four years of college, which I think is, bodes well for me. I think people can taste it. And so I think that worked out. You never think these things. Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, I mean, the first day I walked into college, the internet didn't exist to me. So like, let alone thinking 20, you know what I mean? This is what I try to tell youngsters like you, the Iraq, like, you're so young. Like, do you understand? Like, there's so much more to go. Yeah, I feel like whenever people ask what your five year plan is, I'm like, if I feel like I can predict my five year plan, I think I'm probably not going fast enough. If I'm actually where I am in five years, I mean, I couldn't even imagine, you know, as much as I predict, like, you don't have any clue what the world's going to look like in five years. Yeah, just change the way too fast. Way too fast. Like, way too fast.
