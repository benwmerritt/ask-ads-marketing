Dan just said he's giving 500 bucks to the next person asking a question. Awesome, I could grasp. Dan, I'm waiting for that. How are you doing? What's your name? Craig Cost is like a con didn't ask. How are you? Hey Craig, how are you? Quick question. So what you just mentioned, it's really interesting, right? It's the idea that somebody can see the kind of the direct results that my content has, you know, green mountain coffee, they can see how many cups. So for a larger purchase item, right, where think about autos for instance, right, it's like average, like you use 8 to 10 different sources to actually buy your product and you're only making that product purchase once every couple years. For a higher ticket item, how do you use an attribution model, right, to kind of go back to are you actually getting lead gen, are you actually moving vehicles? So this is like the most interesting question for me in the whole space, especially around social and the content within it. The answer is you use the same model used for everything else, right? It's an impression somewhere along the decision making path, right? And so a lot of people come to me and they're like, well, what's the ROI of the social media content we're producing? And then I'm always asking them, cool, like awesome. And this was a real question for me asking them because I was just getting into the industry. I'm like, well, how do you do it for outdoor media? How do you do it for your print? How are you doing it for your commercials? And the answers were straight garbage bullshit, right? I started like calling my, you know, nerd fucking friends at MIT and they're like, this is shit math. I'm like, right? And so like, you know, so the funny thing is is I can try to figure out when they ask me that question why they don't have an answer for any of the traditional shit other than fucking Nielsen's told them, you know, it's, you know, it hurts, right? You know, like, like the math that I have a national, I have a big television client and they're spending so much money on outdoor media, right? And I'm like, cool. I'm like, by the way, as you're debating my scope over here for this fucking nothing money that you put in one fucking billboard in Kansas, can you explain to me what the ROI of that billboard is? And nobody's ever got an answer. There's models. There's things that our industry has accepted, you know, your company in the print business, we've expected accepted three times circulation. When I finally learned a couple months ago what that meant was, oh, Jane might leave her fucking vogue in a bus and I might come up, pick it up and go to page 147 and see the fucking Jaguar ad, right? I was like, shit, that's fucked up, right? Right. Eight, respect, good brand, right? So, you know, I mean, I think that a lot of things have been accepted in this world and it's funny, you know, now that I'm not in my wine shop, which is over there in New Jersey, every time I come once every two, three months, everything's broken. When I was in it, it all seemed right. I'd been in it my whole life. You know, I was so successful, but it's like shit with a new eye. It's like so many things are flawed, the things I've learned from other areas. I feel like I walk around in this world and I'm like, wow, how like, wow, right? You know, you come with fresh eyes. I think that there's a lot of shit that is being accepted that is not true. I mean, you know, some dudes stood at the top of that building, clicked how many cars drove by, multiplied it and came up with a price for the billboard that's on, you know, the second, I mean, it's ridiculous, you know? As I told that client and I like to say in keynotes and some of you have seen this, you know, when you, you know, we're in New York, so, you know, a lot of you might be from the West Coast. When you're home, when you drive the next time, watch how many people out of the five people you drive past are on their cell phone while they're driving, at least three of the five, at least. So I always tell my clients, I'm like, people aren't looking at billboards. They're not even looking at the fucking road anymore. And so I think it's every person in this room's job to care about one thing. Where are the eyes and ears of the end consumer? And the eyes and ears are shifting that last panel, they're clearly in mobile. But very honestly, I've been like obsessed with mobile for the last three years. It's all I think about. Most of the things I invest in. I'm trying to figure out how to story tell in it. But now, very honestly, after playing around with Google Glasses, I'm like, fuck. I'm like, all right, now this, right? And so like, what's going to happen when somebody goes into a supermarket and my client's product has some bad news on it, and when they look at it, it's physically going to be there and giving them information about the recall or why it's not healthy. I mean, you know, we're not going to need McDonald's to put the calories on the sign. We're going to get it if we want it based on the apps we put on our Google Glasses. And that's 36 months away. It's going to be here in a heartbeat. So at the end of the day, we can talk about tactics in here all we want, and we should be executing because it matters. But I think there's a philosophy shift that needs to happen overall, which is we have to start from the consumer, not from us. I think there's way too much us talk and us think what we want, what's good for us. This will be good for us if this happens. If you reverse engineer what they want, you have a far better chance of the conversion that we're all looking for.
