Hey everybody, it's Gary Vaynerchuk. Super excited to talk about my new book, Day Trading, Attention, How to Actually Build Brands Sales in the new social media world. Really, this is a follow up to Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. Get over here. In a lot of ways, if you read this, this is kind of the 301 and 10 years later update. How do you do content? But this one's even greater. I really want content there, whereas this one goes into media, it goes into influencer, it goes into a lot of other things. Really the advancements of the biggest conversation, which is if you are not a day trader of attention, AKA, where do people pay attention? Predominantly screens like this and screens like this. And do you actually know how to tell stories in it? AKA, do you understand how to make content for it? Contextually, the difference within a carousel and a reel. Do you understand the first three seconds of the video matter? The thumbnail, what time to post? All that nerd stuff, the science behind the art of making videos, pictures, and audio recordings across the 10 to 15 platforms that matter most in the world, whether you're the CEO of a Fortune 50 company, or you're a creator, whether you own three pizza shops, or you're a B2B executive in sales and SaaS, the LinkedIn, the YouTube, the Facebook, the Twitter, the Instagram, the X, the Twitter, all of it. All in one book, I'm pretty proud of this. Raghav, big shout out to you. Worked with me very closely on 12 and a half. And now working on this, really the marketing book for 2024 that everybody on earth is gonna get value out of it. That is what we went into it with. And I've gotta say, and I've done this a long time now, pretty excited about this one. I think this one's gonna have a huge impact. And I hope you check it out.
