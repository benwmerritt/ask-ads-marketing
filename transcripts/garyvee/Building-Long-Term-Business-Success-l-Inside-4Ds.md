You need to figure out what your comfort zone is on communicating. There's only three. There's audio, video and record. And this is going to be the answer for so many of us in here. The question is which format works for you. And then what you need to do is realize the following. Everything is about perspective shift, a slight perspective shift. You have to give away all your best advice on social media at scale. I'm in Singapore for the last 10 years. My heart and my head is all about health care. And how can we make health care and vitality really cool so that we can move people to do something about their health before they fall sick? So that's what I'm about. And that's what I would love to ask more of you. And what is... Do you have a business within that realm? No. I used to run a biotech company for four years, build and sold. And then because I'm not a doctor, a lot of people were coming to me saying, Kaz, can you explain whatever my doctor is saying in a simplistic way? And that kind of became a theme. So a few months back I decided to be a little bit more open about it and talk a little bit more about social media. So I own social media, a lot of health and what's important. But currently the social media component, one is very new. There's no business behind it per se. I'm not promoting any of the stuff that I used to work on. Understood. OK. Next. Go to Laura, Laura in Kansas City. So how to Gary? Hi, Gary. Great to see you again. Laura Schmidt, chief positive person with notes to self socks. Positive phrases like I am kind on the toes and the bottom of the socks made in the USA. I'm very so excited to be back looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Great to see you again. Awesome. Ned Spector say hi. Hey, Gary. Appreciate being here from Minnesota. Moved to LA, worked at CAA for a handful of years, left to go help manage the Jonas Brothers. Demi Lovato got into Brandon Merchandise and most recently into doing content for a company. So looking forward to getting some strategy to bring those together. So I'm a big fan. Good to see you, brother. Good to see you. Chris and Ethan up in southern New Hampshire. Say hi. Hey, Gary. Gary, great to see you. Really excited to have an opportunity to talk to you. My name is Chris. I own ResCon Basement Solutions. We're a specialty home improvement contractor specializing in based on water proofing and foundation repair, been in business for 27 years, really focused on growing the organization, push through some top line revenue goals over the past few years and now really looking to kind of bring it to the next level. Awesome. Ethan's my DRock. Yeah, I'm our content slash digital marketing manager in-house. Amazing. You couldn't you couldn't have found a different angle. You had to stick the Brady jersey right down my mouth. I mean, like we do have a solution for that, which I'll take care of right now. So we're going to do this made up especially for you. Just to hang right up here. Thank you. Take care of it. So we'll put that right here for you. I think much, much better advice. So we had a plan in place to deal with that. I don't know if the guys over in and southern Massachusetts have a better plan, but what's going on over in southern Massachusetts, Nick and Austin. Hey, the good news is we don't really care about football too much. So we'll root for the jets. That's fine. So I'm Nick. This is my business partner, Austin. We do residential landscaping maintenance. So mowing lawn care, leaf cleanups, things like that. We've been in business eight years and we're in southeastern Mass. Love it, brother. Pleasure. Good to see you guys. You too. David Rappa. David. Still with us. Hey, Gary. Last time I saw you was at Brunch Bears. Not so long ago. I remember. So I have an investment management firm. I remember the capital management. It's been all word of mouth marketing. I have a handful of family offices and individual clients. I serve them to the best of my ability. We've been at it for I've been at it for 20 years, but in this instance, in this company for seven. And I've never really thought of marketing on social media or social media in general, above and beyond investing in the companies, which we have and we listen to what you say and where to look. But in the pandemic, you mentioned LinkedIn as a platform. I think I remember a couple of years ago as an underutilized platform. And because I wasn't seeing my clients in a big part of, you know, the business is seeing people and going to lunches and dinners. I decided to start to post a little bit on LinkedIn to just, you know, get in front of people. And I did get some good response from my existing client base that, oh, it's nice to hear you're like, you know, thinking about this, talking about this. So I thought that was an interesting lead in for me to kind of press more and see if there's more for me to do in social media. Love it. Makes tons of sense. All right. And we get Jennifer also. Last but not least, Jennifer, say hi. Hey, Gary, super nice to meet you. My name is Jennifer Cannon. I'm in Parkland, Florida. I have a skincare company called MD Topicals and my fiance is a huge fan of yours. So he got me hooked in NFTs. He's got a bunch of those. I have a humble pie. I wish I had more. And I wanted to really thank you because I follow all your advice religiously and you changed my life with chat GPT because as a startup, there is no budget to hire employees. And I'm like so much more productive because I'm a horrible writer. So chat GPT is like my employee and he puts out all my content with me. And I'm just really excited to get to be here today. I love that. I love that. It's a real pleasure, Jennifer. All right, let's let's restack the deck and go back to CAS over in Singapore. CAS, let's you got about seven minutes. Let's get into it. OK, thank you. You cast before you get into it, you know, for everyone here. Like this is the time to go very specific. Like what's cool about this format we've learned along the way is like people garner value out of other people's thing. But this is like one on one time. Like wherever you want to thank you so much. Perfect. So my first question is I'm super new at this. Social media terrifies me after listening to Jeff. I'm like, oh, my God, I had so much to learn. But with that, my question is with my main thing, how can we make longevity and health care cool? How can I craft my voice and my brand to really support that in a long run? I think that there's there's a couple of things with your situation. I think there's two variables. There's one which is universal to everybody here back to what David I think has a good understanding about intuitively. And I'm excited to get to his part as well. But this is for everyone, Nick, Chris, everybody. You always like there is no thing on earth, not religion, not the biggest bands or pop stars that Ned was working with, not selling wine. Nothing to be accomplished unless someone knows about it. Not super complicated. You know, so I bet my my prime years on building the biggest infrastructure in the world to understand at every moment. From a media standpoint, from a creative standpoint, from what's happening in popular culture standpoint, where is the underpriced and where is the overpriced attention? Right. So first cast like in crafting your message. There's there's the need to understand that. And that's going to be universal for everyone here. The second need is what do you want to happen? Right. So for example, if David was like, I'm looking to sell my practice in the next three years, all of a sudden the content he's putting out on LinkedIn is very, very different and very targeted, then it would be if he's looking to acquire. So for all of you, what I'm going to be trying to figure out is where are you? What would you like to happen? Right. So I think you're in such an early stage where you're willing to use your your your starting the journey of building a personal brand. But, you know, the question becomes, what is that personal brand trying to accomplish? Right. So you've already had a business to exit it. You may want to, you know, this is very common. People want to run the same blueprint again, slightly different with all the new nuances. Other times people want to go completely away from the last exit and do something completely different. The thing that's most important in your situation is I don't need you to know yet. You may not need to know where to put this energy of longevity. Like you can imagine, you know, for example, back to Lara, like bringing kindness to the world can be in the format of a personal brand like me or it could be in the form of socks that say positive things like you can put all of our energies. When I get to Ned, when, you know, when I get to, you know, Nick and crew, like the energy can be put into anything. Right. So I think for you, the questions are a couple of things. Do you have what you want the next business to be figured out? Product service, event business. And so I'm going to go right to there. Do you yet or do you have some running hypotheses? Because it's going to impact the advice. But the good news is I don't need you to have that figured out because the advice and the work you have to do, even without that being answered is quite substantial. We'll get into that in a second. But that's the first question. So the answer is not free. What is kind of a slowly started happening is that because of my background and also my pre-health, pre biotech world was all finance and investment. I was invited to multiple companies just to speak to their sweet people, basically how to feel better on a daily basis, because I don't matter. I don't think doctor and I simplify things. So that kind of became almost like like I didn't think that would be a thing, but suddenly from one company to another to another, but it's not a business line by any means at the state. And I have no idea. You wanted to. I think it's interesting. For example, I, for example, I could have, instead of building what I'm building easily on a bad day, built an eight figure income per year, doing that. Right. Like, you know, building a one woman show that works with the C-suite that over a period of time has seven employees and does ten million dollars in revenue on 70 percent margin, 60 percent margin is very realistic, especially in the category that you're playing, because every future C-suite executive is the only going to care more about mental and physical health. It is just the cat is so out of the bag. Right. It's like that is a runaway train. It's all going to be around the gray and the EQ and the not black and white. Do you want that? Do you think or do you want to build something with more scale that's less on your back? Um, good question. The initial feeling I was having when I was giving those talks is I can really see people just something moving. And it's not even because I'm not even I'm not exactly giving them something they don't know about, maybe a few tweaks here and there, because everything else literally can Google. It's all about why should you even care and why vitality matters and how much this is literally a rocket fuel to anything else you're doing in life. So it was that psychology bit that was fun. I probably wouldn't do it on a daily basis and building something to me. It's also, um, honestly, you know, being born where I was born, health sucks. And it's still that. So I just want to almost like I feel. Let me jump in given Joe just came out of 60 second morning. The number one thing you need to do, regardless of where we go with what we just talked about is you need to figure out what your. Comfort zone is on communicating, whether that's the written word, which it is clearly not for me or Jennifer, right? Like the written writing wasn't our output. And is it audio? There's only three. There's audio, video and word. And this is going to be the answer for so many of us in here. The question is which format works for you? And then what you need to do is realize the following. The number one just this is going to work with you because you're doing it for others. Everything is about perspective shift, a slight perspective shift. The number one perspective shift that you have to make sure you understand. And it might not be a shift that might come natural to you, but it is the punchline for what you're about to embark on. You have to give away all your best advice on social media at scale. Right. So the biggest things are, A, how do you want to make content? Video, written word, audio, B, the team here. I put out tons of free content will help after this, like figuring out which platforms. Right. Is it YouTube Shorts? Is it LinkedIn? Is it Snapchat? Is it Twitter? And then you have to make sure that the content that comes out of your mouth is your best content. And you're basically saying the same 23 things for four things, four thousand times with different contexts. It becomes like, Hey, are you the CEO of a 50,000 person Fortune 500 company? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The next video is literally like, Hey, are you the leader of a small business with nine employees? You know what I mean? So it's about distribution, contextual format. But the biggest thing is the strategy of your words has to be all your best advice. Too many people like that, that your profile hold back some of it because they think that's the thing that people pay for. The people don't pay for that. The people pay for the when you get in there, you're really getting detailed to their reality, you can still stay top level, but go into very heavy detail on your advice. Got it? That is awesome. That's fantastic. Thank you so much, Gary. All right, we're going to Laura next. You're a mute, Laura. OK, thank you. My question for you, Gary, is I've been in business 12 years. You know, you and I talked years ago when I was just a few years into it. I remember you telling me at that point, spend absolutely as much as you can afford on Facebook and Instagram ads and influencers. And I wish I had spent more at the time. I did. I took your advice, but I wish I would have 10 times that. I there's no there's no war. And by the way, it's important for everyone here. There's no worse feeling than not squeezing an orange as hard as you can when you have unlimited oranges coming from the tree. Because in this game, you wake up one morning and there's no oranges on the tree. To Laura's point, it's really important for cast and everybody like this is day trading attention. What I do for a living is day trade attention. You know, knowing what Ned was doing for a living and knowing the places he was doing is like he's been I don't know how much or how little, but like he's been aware of my trajectory over the long period of time at this point. And so there's a reason that I'm consistently there because it's it's the obsession of understanding this point. And just so everybody hears this because it's going to be the theme for next hour. What Laura went through when she did this before and probably why she's back is it was right. And then it changes and it's not as good of a deal anymore. And you're like, damn it. And then what's really and by the way, Laura, you think you're upset? It upsets me because I'm like the godfather of this game. And I don't squeeze it all the way. Every time I promise myself the next time I see it, I'm going to go and I do. And it's still never I still never go hard enough because the value is so high. So I just wanted to call that out for everybody because I'm pumped that you felt that and the reason she said that is because if she went to go do those same behaviors now, it doesn't work the same. No, no. And and my just overall, you know, notes to self.com has been the channel that I focus the most on. I also sell to Hallmark stores, hospital, gift shops, boutiques. Recently, airports are a big expansion area for us. And there's a lot of potential there and we're getting good traction there. Twelve years into it, like you like just what you said, Gary, that like more people need to know about my brand, like everybody that knows about it loves it. You know, best socks she'll ever wear made in the USA. People write me and give me stories about how they're changing their lives. And what are we trying to figure out? Because I don't want to run on time and I want to give you as much as possible. Go ahead. Yeah, I guess my question is like, if you or me, what would you do next? Like part of me feels like I didn't I didn't start the company to sell it, but I'm not going to live to be 200. So I, you know, there's got to be some kind of strategy. And I think I'm at the point where like I I think I could help the world more if I could grow faster. And so that's kind of what I'm thinking. What's the top line revenue? A couple million. And where's most of the business coming from? About half and half. You mean store and dot com. And on the dot com part, where is most of the you have a sense of where most of the sales are coming from? Facebook ads and Instagram, mostly Facebook. And I pay a lot. I know you do. Where do you pay? And are you doing them? I am. And that that's part of my thought process this year. I mean, I'm kind I'm doing it all. Tick tock has to become incredibly important to you. Like all that time and energy that you're putting in your business, like, you know, you need to send out like 25 packages of socks like a week. And know that like only one of the or two of the 25 tick tockers are actually going to do anything about it. But that one tick tocker one time can actually change the outcome of your business. It's actually what influencer marketing looks like. But nobody wants to. It's all the same game. Everyone wants to look good, but nobody wants to go to the gym. You know, like, like, you know, it's just that's what it is with business. Nobody wants to have the patience to do the right marketing tactics for you. It's sampling to influencers with a very low ratio of good things happening because it's disheartening, right? I tell you, you have to send out 25 different packages, takes you two hours to find these people a week on tick tock, then you got to message them all. Most don't reply with an address or they have you find the address in their profile. Then you then you send it. Most people don't post and becomes like disheartening pretty quick. Yet four months in the one right person thinks it's the cutest thing ever, makes a video, two million views. And like now you do more revenue in 48 hours on those organic views than you do on your entire Facebook spend on the year. That's 20, 23. OK, I just signed up for that. L.T.K. like to know it influencers. Yeah, I don't I'm not educated enough to tell you I want you to do your own work on it because I think what will happen is if you do research in the trenches, you'll find the moms, you'll find you'll find your people, right? You'll find your people. Plus what I like about you and anybody who has a consumer business spending an hour or two in Tiktok is you'll know what's happening in culture and it will change your creative and it will give you a pulse. You'll most you might also pick up on a line, you know, a slang term or a sentence that you put on a sock because you're in the trenches that is the viral one that you make. Like it's just good work. An hour day searching on Tiktok and getting good at that over the course of a year is just good research work. Thank you. You got it. Let's shift over to Ned. Ned, it's your turn. You're up. So, Gary, over the last 10 years have built the promotional products business doing brand and merchandise for companies. The business has built, but I'll just be completely, completely honest with you. I don't I don't love it and it like drains my energy and it's become and it's a really hard thing for me because I'm so grateful for it. I have two young kids. It pays the bills, but the 10 percent of my time over the last handful of years that I'm pitching to companies to say, hey, you're not producing enough video content. Let me come in, be your social media reporter, interview staff, interview customers, product reviews, doing that content. It's consistently working, but I have no time during the day to do that and build that because there's so much business coming in on the promotional product side. And I'm too afraid to make the higher of a higher I know I have to make. And I've been talking to James for the last year or two and he's like, well, take out a business line of credit. That's like my blood money and there's $20,000 left. The business has never been hotter on both sides, but I've never been more overwhelmed working day and night. I really want to let go of the logistics of all of these orders that are coming in and really focus on the content. Again, I know it's an end game and I have to stop looking at these as separate businesses potentially. But what I really want to ask is how do I do I structure a deal with somebody? I pay part time and maybe give a percent of sales. I'm not sure what's that like. This is like such a James and Gary love this problem because we just like you do understand that there's an unlimited amount of 24 year old us's in the world. I don't think I do. I'm like so I know it goes back to that. That's why this is so fucking fun for me, similar to what Cass was saying about like what's fun for her, the high of like you're saying shit. People know, but it's amazing how the words matter. The semantics matter. The moment matters. The context matters like, brother, the amount ready for this. Now, this takes work, but it's the work that gets you to a finish line. Otherwise, you're in a fucking hamster wheel. The amount of 24 year olds that have pure talent and work ethic, but didn't get lucky enough to be born into the right family or the right area of the country or the right, you know, like I always say that if I was a good student, I would own the Jets, Nixon. I always talk about this to myself. I don't say publicly if I knew what an SPV was, I would have SPV Facebook four years before IPL and I would have made it. I was an edge of my roommates at Brown and Yale and like all the things I've learned about how the world works. My life would have been a different path. Now, I don't I'm so happy where I'm at. I can't even imagine to worry about those things where I'm going with that analogy is there's a 23 year old kid right now that was born on the wrong side. I'm going to be a little bit more aware of the tracks that will work for free for 10% of equity of this company. For free, man, forget about minimum wage. Now, you're probably going to have to do minimum wage. You probably have to do maybe a little bit more. But like I would spend 100% of my time to find the person to give 10% of the company to that had almost no cost associated with them upfront. I would spend it over a year. Like I would literally there's a lot of people. There's people born on the right side of the tracks that would take that deal because they just want to be an owner and they just like the business and better to be owning 10% of your business than being a logistics or project manager at a company. You need to spend all your time dating for your junior partner. You know, James thoughts on that. Yeah, when I was speaking with him earlier and he was worried about being cash strapped and everything we talked about, look, just get yourself some breathing room. Right. The time to get a credit line is when you don't need a credit line. And he deployed the money and used it well for a year and a half. You've been leaning more into your passion project. And I think it's more than 10% of where you are right now. But, you know, it could have even been a client on the other end. I mean, look, you don't want to sold us this. So, you know, you have a lot of a lot of clients that you that you may have somebody who's taken the orders with. And back to being cash strapped, like, I mean, you could literally again, I'll say it again, there is doing that work. There are a lot of 24, 23, 22, 25 year old talented people on earth that you're offering them a better opportunity at a close to minimum wage. Minimum wage to 10% ownership is bananas for a lot of people. Especially like first generation, you're in Cali, right? Now, Michigan outside of Detroit. Right. Like even even better, you have like fucking unlimited kids graduating. You got hundreds of thousands of 22 years coming out of the system in a 40 mile radius, 100 mile radius of you. You know, me University of Michigan or Michigan State Kids would literally do this, would literally take especially in this environment where everyone wants to be an entrepreneur and yeah, they would have normally taken the $150,000 job in New York 20 years ago when you and I were going up the game. But like today, they'll literally take 20 bucks an hour to prove it for a year to own 10% to do this very mundane achievable work, which is why it's driving you crazy. Got it. I appreciate it. Real quick, if I have one more minute. Look like I have humongous coconut that I'm about to drink. Real quick. So on my content, what you said a while ago about like you call it like almost like being like the digital like become the mayor is like, I'm so passionate about small businesses here in Michigan that when I go get a haircut, I go eat a piece. I'm like, I would do that content for free. And that's my version of a podcast for them. And some of them now are turning into clients. Should I just quadruple down on that kind of content? I don't need anything from my audience. Like I'm not trying to get anything when I post on social. It's just like sparking joy and man on the street. And I mean, that. Yes, the answer is yes, because the coolest part similar to me not wanting anything from my audience, it leads to B2B behavior, right? You're going to wake up one day if you 8X that behavior and you're going to get an email from Visa saying we're our big initiative is on small businesses. You know, we've been scouring Detroit where Michigan is a is a top five market trust where we need it. We think you're the face of this. Can we JV together and you're getting a $250,000 a year ambassador to the Visa Small Business Program? I mean, it's it's a humongous space. OK, I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For real. Let's see. We're moving over to Chris and Ethan up in New Hampshire. Hey, guys. Hey, how are we doing? Gary, the first thing before I ask the question, I just want to say thank you for everything you've done. Long time follower of your content, really instrumental in some of the changes I've made in my life over the years. Joe and I were talking, you know, I've been sober for five and a half years. It's made a huge difference in my life. There was a lot of things that I was going through beforehand. But anyways, a lot of your content was responsible for that. So I got to thank you. Very excited for the Flyfish Club to open VF one holder in at both the E-Cons. Thank you. But anyways, I'm going to let Ethan ask the first question because this is really a lot of this is for him. So I'm going to let him ask the first question just before I do have a question. OK, so I'm 22. I went to school for a little bit, went to college a little bit, didn't know what I wanted to do. I left. I have been working for him. I started working in the field doing the construction for about a year and a half, two years, and now I jumped into this marketing role in house. I have a certificate through UBM and just the basics of fundamentals of digital marketing and my main focus right now is on the creative aspect of what we're doing. We're going to be working with the Sasha group as well. And my main question was as a 20 year old entering this digital marketing creative content space, what skills do you think are going to be the most needed within the next five, 10, 15, 20 years that I should focus on learning? There's a couple of places you can look at. One is this acronym of PAC platforms and culture will never go away. What are the platforms that people pay attention to? Today, there's social networks. There's streaming TV services. Obviously, we saw the Apple announcement, Facebook's working on it like VR is going to happen in your lifetime. So that platform people pay attention to. And then there's culture, right? Who's ice spice? You know, who's going to be the number one pick in the NBA draft? Who's, you know, all the stuff that's happening in popular culture. So you can make your commitment to that. So you're great at understanding how the algorithms work. What are all the different creative ways you can make content? You might know this like if you go look at my Instagram, you could see I have all sorts of different ways I do content, right? Video, carousel, picture. We're doing all sorts of things. So being great at that game or you could become a prop engineer. So AI is going to completely eat up marketing during your time and something that you should Google is prompt engineering. Like what you ask AI is going to be the punch line. Right. So like being good at asking chat, GPT, mid journey, these things, questions is definitely a skill set that I would focus on. OK. Do you think AI is going to take over the creative aspect of things or more so paid SEO and those kind of things? I don't think it's going to take over either the way you're asking it when everyone's like, oh, my God, all the jobs are going to be high. Like going to become a compliment, it will change shit, but there's no absolutes. There's people that still have AOL. Do you know millions of people use AOL dial up? Like the world takes a long time to adjust to everything. So like it's it's going to make a change in every area. OK, so cool. So now. You know, Jen and I don't have to hire a writer to write our stuff. You know, chat, GPT can do it first. Like it's also like we're still going to have to either us ourselves or hire someone that's good at asking chat, GPT, the questions. You're still going to have to conceptualize if you're going to use mid journey. So you may not hire someone to do Adobe Photoshop, but you still have to be great at coming up with the idea to input. So prompt engineering. OK, thank you. OK, so my quick question, I'll try and be quick about it. So 27 years in, Gary, been running Rescon Basement Solutions as the brand. But have also been in love with YB Wet as a quick, easy to remember kind of tag. From a branding perspective, what would you do if if you were coming on board, have these two names? Which what would you do? Well, I think Nike and Just Do It are both things that that company focuses on. OK, so just kind of blend the two together. I don't think it's that you blend this. You know what that this is what you'll like this. This is when people go into academia versus real life. We're pondering the challenge here when there is no challenge. Like you don't need to blend them together. Like you have a slogan that is memorable and you have a brand and a company name that also should be built. Right? OK, so it's just a game of the and right. Like when you say blended together, I have no problem if the two of you put the slogan in every piece of content and I have no problem if you put the slogan in half of the pieces of content. This is where I where I get into like philosophy versus real life. OK, back to back to him quitting college and like feeling like when he said, you know, I know his psyche because I was his psyche when he's like, well, I got a certificate from me. Like I'm like, I don't give a shit what certificate you have from digital media. That certificate sucks shit. I promise you that whatever they taught you in that class was dog shit. Yes, I agree. I paid for it. So I get it. Yeah, I think in my mindset over the past year, after being out, by the way, I mean, but now that I'm out less and less, I'm like, I I'm OK with it as another dude that struggled with school. I understand the journey of going from like thinking it's a vulnerability or it's an issue to realizing it means nothing. And this is kind of I'm bringing that back up because same here. There's no right way to manage a brand and a slogan properly. There's just doing it. Right. OK. Unintended, right? Right. Like, so that's it. You don't have to you don't have there is no right way. Just use them both, play with them both sometimes together, sometimes separate and just keep going on feel. OK, Joe, do I have time for one more quick question? So scaling question. We're at 30 people. I've tapped out the core people that have been with me for 10, 15, 20 years. I've gotten the growth that I can out of them. Now I've got to really hire some people and bring them on. How did you jump that shark to bringing on people and getting to that, you know, 50, 100 person level and keep them trained and maintaining that culture? By having one on one conversations with the 30, you know what to do. Your problem is the 30. OK, so spending more time with the 30, spending more time with the 30 and understanding you have 30 different things going on there. Yeah, no, I know. So it's just spending more time with them. Because you know, four of them are going to be upset about like new people coming in and, you know, three of them are going to suppress the new people and try to fuck them up because they don't want to take their spots. And, you know, five of them are going to be sad when the new people come in and become their bosses, but you know that they're not good enough and four of them should be fired, but they're your family and you don't want to fire them. And that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that. So you have to have one on one conversations and you need to tell them the following. From one by one, the general theme is I'm taking this to the next step because that's my responsibility, right? In that I see things are going to change. Somebody in these next 20 is going to get hired and may become your boss. And you're going to think that's crazy because you've been here for 17 years. And they've been here for three. I'm speaking to you because I actually am OK with hiring no people, but everyone here now has families like same thing happened to my dad's business. You can't work weekends. Like I need young blood because you you're going home at five o'clock and you're not about used to I could have you work full time on Saturday. Now I can't even text you on Saturday without you giving me attitude. Right. Right. Exactly. Yep. The 30 conversations to tell them what's happening. And 10 of them are going to say, actually, fuck that shit, I'm ready to step up and it may help you hire five less people. And 20 other people won't get won't have a leg to stand on when they're upset with you because you have the conversation. Right. OK. I can do that. OK. All right. Let's go. Thank you. Nick and Austin. How's it going, Gary? Brother. It just says real quick, you're you're a beast and you've influenced us both in our our the culture of our company. So we appreciate that. It means a lot to me at a pivotal point when we were 18. That's when we were looking at your content and we could have gone. Steve Jobs or Gary V and we went Gary V. So I said that on the back of somebody yesterday that works for our company. And it was my first one on one with her. And she broke down and cried because she grew up in tech and flat out used the Steve Jobs and me analogy of a turning point in what she sees. And for you to them bring it up completely. When I tell you the last time somebody used the Steve Jobs and me analogy was like five years ago and for not to be on back to back days, I love that kind of cosmic shit because I because I really believe in it. And I'm pumped for you guys because here's the the aha that nobody understands. You guys are going to make more money and people are going to be happier. It's like a fucking win win. Hell, yeah. But yeah, in terms of a question, so a little context. So we've been using we're at about a little over two million sales. We've been using Facebook ads. We're like the only people in our area that do it. And you know, we're remotely well. We've seen the 10, 15 percent more leads year over year over year. And then this year all of a sudden, boom, we get half as many leads coming in. So we went from increasing 15 percent to getting to pretty much half. The same in graces. We've been improving operations and things like that. And we've had much higher close rates. Our service is better. So our techs good, our operations good. You know, we're getting some tactics from your team. It's been awesome. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. I was saying we're getting tactics from your team in terms of like best utilization practices of the platforms, which is huge. And I feel like we're going to get some more of that after this too. So I guess for my question goes with this is, you know, as much as you can put yourself in the shoes of a marketing person who's trying to sell people on cutting grass and keeping weeds out of their lawn. And I think I know where you're going to go with it. But what is what does Gary V do when he steps in and walks? And I got it. Yeah. How big is the general area that you're marketing in? So it's about 11 towns. We have about 50 to 60,000 homes. We think roughly just based off analysis. So like I said, we're at like two. We think we could be about three times the size we are now in the same area. We also have the infrastructure to support being about 50 percent bigger right now as a result of previous, you know, mistakes in terms of getting off, bringing on too much infrastructure. So we have a lot of room to go. We just we can't catch up to ourselves fast enough. So that's that's that's where we're at. Yeah, I think what's super interesting about the Facebook thing is I think you're hitting saturation point. It's not that the problem. It's that your area you've just hit saturation of how many people are paying attention and the other saturation is the creative. Right. So the creative is the variable. How many different pieces of creative are you guys running? So right now for for in terms of ad, we would we would put up like maybe three or four ads, run them against each other. And every year we make new ones. You know, we've done things off your advice. Like we put town names with like the high school colors on there. That's improved it. Like we've done all that tactical stuff. But you're only running three to four ads, right? Right. Per town. We have 11 ads that's in each one has three to four different ads all paying against the per town contextual to the town. On just Facebook tactics, I want you guys to do three to four new ads that are completely different video and imagery per town, per week. OK, so you're talking like ads ran on the platform, like throwing a new piece of creative ad content, running it as like a conversion ad every week. You love it. You'll love this, brother. The only variable is the creative. You're in a set target. Right. So one thing that was mentioned previously was kind of like top of funnel. So we've done we've done a good amount of organic like value posts. Like look out for this weed or here's how you do a professional mulch edge or things like that. How many I love that? How much? So my question is, is that could should I need to answer that? What's that? Answered me how much organic posting you're doing. Probably like 10 percent of what we do is probably organic posting. I probably post like once every two weeks, maybe. Most of the focus is on paid ads. We don't I think we don't we haven't done enough in the organic space because we haven't had a way right up right right up right off the top. If you go to Facebook, real ads, not just Facebook feed. Sure. And you go to three to four variable completely different. Now I'm not talking fucking font and colors. I'm talking about like flat out commercial like completely different shit. Got it. Three to four times three or four posts a week changing. You've got your last weeks. So basically think about it. The world used to do one post for the whole year on Facebook. This was real talk when you guys were fucking in diapers. They were running one post for the whole year against all 11 towns. And what you think about you doing it, you're doing four posts a year times 11 towns, that's monumental. You've got 44 different ads versus one, right? I want you to do four ads. I want you to do 44 different ads a week the whole year. And I want you to post four times organically a day. If you're asking, should we put money behind like so if we run like if we put the when you say ads, should some of these ads not be geared towards conversion? Like should should some of them just be putting ourselves out there in terms of the first answer is volume. The first answer is volume. The second answer is do organic at scale. And if something goes viral, turn it into an ad. OK. And the organic stuff purely just organic, like you just talking like throwing up a reel on Facebook or Instagram or a post just like a photo or a video of Nick walking a property just like straight up, no paid, no nothing on the organic stuff. YouTube shorts and TikTok in addition to Instagram, in addition to Facebook, Facebook Reels is a monster go ham. And you guys are at one percent on your creative variable testing one percent. I want you to literally 52 X what you're doing by changing the app. Now, when you find something that works, you now you're running five ads because you kept one from the prior week that you love and you've added four new ones. Your entire game is based on more creative, more creative ways to story tell, more creative ways organically, more creative ways to run ads. OK, so you'd even advise still on like TikTok and stuff like that, even though it's just posting to the world, not contextual or 10 towns still be posting on TikTok regularly or just when you do something that's super or like like makes sense, then you're going to take it. So the algorithm is going to show you what people give a fuck about. So if you're like 15 seconds on how you can fix your lawn and then you go and people like, this is fucking insane. Well, now you just use the algorithm to give you affirmation on creative that will work and then you run it as a fucking Facebook ad that is with supported copy and is being done as a performance ad in Facebook. And it's the best ad you've ever run because you figured it out in organic TikTok because it has the best interest algorithm. OK, so it's like a testing thing, like not necessarily we're not looking for for clients because obviously we can't target them into our. I love this. It's an it's an insights thing that also built top of the funnel awareness for you. Right. OK. And that's right. I have you guys have an awareness issue because you're you're penetrating. By the way, all your ads that you're running right now on Facebook in the same style of just four different ads that you've been doing for a while. Nobody's seen that anymore. I'll tell you why, because all the people that you could get you got. Right. Yeah. Of course, that's what's happening. Yeah. You've hit a saturation point. Now, just by changing your creative on Facebook, you can get a whole new world. OK, but you start adding TikTok, you start adding, you know, YouTube sports is amazing because people search and you might have a how to like so. That's that's the 20 of that content. It's just a matter of like. Yeah, one of the questions if I have a sec. So one thing I noticed you do a lot of is like you'll spend time and you'll like you post about it. So like you change, you know, one word in a phrase or something like that, like there's really nitty gritty tests that you're doing on organic posts for someone at our size with our workload. It's like, would you still suggest we try to get that granted even with the ads? Like say we have, you know, we start posting that often. Obviously, we're a B testing. I'd love to know what you're doing with your 12 hours a day. I mean, that's that's a fair answer. Fucking kid trying to build a big ass business. You should be working. You have the capacity to work 12 to 15 hours a day. And I'd love to know you're busy. You know, I'd show me your calendar. With that said, love it though. Thank you, Gary. David Rapp, we're not going to ask to see your calendar, but we are going to talk to Gary. I know how it feels, Gary. I didn't quit Palantir in an SPV in the early 2000s. It hurts. You live and you learn, right? Right. I've got a lot of those. I know, I know, I know. I've seen. So we have a good little business. We're at 400 million a.m. So it's a small asset manager. It's all individuals. They're all like my family. I do anything legal for them. I have everybody from Mark Lazarie and Ken Langone who let me say their names. So I'm not talking at a turn to a dentist. I treat them all equally and they're they're literally like my family. So the quit, you know, why wouldn't I want to grow it? I want to have more impact. I want to do more. And so, you know, the bottleneck is it's a very unique business, right? Because it's trust, it's really big trust, right? So it takes years to build trust. Why would you give and why would you give me money to manage when you can go to Morgan Stanley or Fidelity or whoever? So it's really a long, long, long sale cycle. If it's even sales, it's mainly someone saying you can trust Dave. He's good. They've done really good for me. And, you know, people people, you know, give a give a support fully to manage. So the question is, does digital play a role at all? How would you know your growth hacker? How would you how would you how would you get four hundred to a billion under management by realizing that digital is how trust is built? It's how think about what's happened in American politics. It's all been done by digital, right? Like people's entire perception is based on communication. The more if I'm you, I'm doing unlimited video content on LinkedIn and YouTube Shorts because YouTube is a search engine. YouTube Shorts is a monster for this. But I think the way you do it is create a format of a show and you interview people. OK, contemporary finance, contemporary. I love the I love contemporary modern of the moment. The way you get people to pay attention in your world, in my opinion, is giving them the sense of shit's changing. And that's where the arbitrage is. And that's what this show focuses on. And I see you as interview, you know, people like that are in my network. What are you? Right. That's right. And by the way, once you have this is why I love this. Once you have a podcast, I've watched Ray Dallio, Arthur Blank. I've watched some of the most iconic businessmen and women do the most random shows because the person cold emailing them said the word podcast. Hmm. I'd love to have you on my podcast to talk about your journey. You'd be shocked. Many people will say yes to that. It goes back to what I talked to, you know, Nick and the boys just now on. It's are you going to spend one hour on it a week asking people to be on the show? Or are you going to ask try to do four hours? The way you do that is by having a 45 minute video weekly show where you interview someone and you chop up. You know how I do my content. I don't I'm one of the most prolific content producers in the world and I don't sit down and make content. I do my life and then we post produce. Your life in this scenario would be spending an hour to getting guests because it takes time and then spending an hour making the show and then spending another hour to cutting up the clips or if somebody do it, you know, depending on what you want to allocate to, but that's the five to six hours a week that is required for you to do this well. OK. But it is podcast, YouTube, LinkedIn, fucking at scale, like I just said, to the last voice, like the only difference between me is that calendar you just saw and the output. OK, thanks. Not a brother. All right. And last but not least, Jennifer, you're up. Hi, Gary. So a very short condensed version of my history. My former, my late ex-husband and I were the biggest on QVC and we kind of just set the trend for skincare on shopping networks. We ended up getting divorced. He kept the business. I kept the kids. I left as the largest shareholder and I used all that funding to raise my kids because he wasn't much help. Later on, I was doing small things on the side, consulting, working with small businesses and I was working with a doctor. He wanted to start a skincare line and I suggested, hey, I can do this for you because that's my background, my field. So I'm kind of tapped out like credit wise. I've got all my funds in this. My partner ended up exiting. He got personal problems financially and he gave me a hundred percent of the business. We had launched on Shop HQ because that was my background. We were doing great, but they had like payment issues. So I got nervous about their stability and had to leave. So now I have 60,000 in inventory and because I really can't do anything funding wise, I've been chasing after these big influencers. I got like really close to the point where she even liked one of my comments about trying my product. She has my product. I've been in talks with her team. How do I keep her attention? Because if I can get a short hit like that with, you know, an influencer, that could help me self fund more to make it back to QVC, which is where I intend to go, but I need to do a 25 person clinical study before I can get there. So that's why another reason why I was on the small shopping network. So I've got my plan. I'm going overseas. I've got somebody there who wants to place an order, but I really do need to get that quick boost. So do you have any suggestions on without mentioning it? You know, because she's not answering my emails. How can I keep her attention and keep her interested? I think first of all, there's a lot of high risk with that. The thought of her or anybody else posting and that guaranteeing the sales of those units is not there. Right. But just to review, just where they say they like your product. When they say they like your product, what do you mean? One more time, I want to make sure I understand. So a lot of these big influencers, what they do is they just take your product. They try it and they're like, Oh, wow. You know, I had a great experience. I got results and boom, they went to the next one. That's really all I need is just to kind of get known out there. I'm going to say it again, Mike. I'm very aware of influencer marketing. I'm talking about. I'm not sure that would work. Oh, OK. I do this for a living at scale. Like take a Vanderpump right now, which is top of mind for everyone. Then posting saying I like this does not guarantee the product sell. It's happening all the time that where that's not happening. My biggest concern is that you see that as the lightning bolt to give you the quick pump to get you out of this situation to your next thing. And you may end up going for that, betting the whole farm on that and it not working. Yeah, that makes sense. I'll say this very well, like just back to everything's friendy here. Putting up your product and saying I love this coconut. You should buy it. May not sell the best you think. Right. That's true. What about? Go ahead. Go ahead. Like Mary Ruth organics, for example, you did something with them to do creative funding. Do you think I'm a candidate to do something like that? And how do you even approach something like that? Why? Why wouldn't you just start making content with yourself just like what you were doing on QDC, but just doing it on all the social media platforms yourself? I was going and now I'm going to start, but I couldn't until I hit a thousand followers, so and that was hard to get to. Why? Why couldn't you do that until you? Why couldn't you make content about your product until you have a thousand followers? It wouldn't let me go live, but I've been making videos and I see. Yeah. Well, right. To me, the point is like for me, I think it's more about sending samples to emerging influencers. OK, not paying at all. Right. You send a sample of your product to somebody who has 30,000 followers, but is doing really good work on TikTok. Right now, they're one post away from doing more than what you thought you would do. Right. OK, so stick with the smaller micro 100 percent. You look because you were affected by your career being built in those big moments. I'm very aware what QDC shopping network has been historically. Like like what's happening now is like you don't want to bet a business model on the on the lightning bolt model. You want to build it on the brick by brick, brick by brick, back to like health and wellness. I don't want you looking for like apple cider vinegar or like the fucking shot that wants you to put in the work on eating and going to the gym. That in our world, in what you do is making four to five pieces of social media content a day. OK, which is what I've been doing. OK, great. And then what about the Mary Ruth model? How did you do that? Like, is am I a candidate to do something like that? Or Mary Ruth reached out. Yes, you're a candidate. If you put out good content for a decade, then people like Mary Ruth and everybody else in the world will reach out to you. Thank you. You're welcome. All right, team. Thank you.
