## Transcript
The biggest thing that's tough when you're young is reconciling two things. Reconciling why you see it so clearly and not just saying we're young and two, understanding what happens over time. Me and Gary Vee up in the office. How you doing bro? It's good to see you man. I feel like we've talked and I haven't seen you in so long. Dude the line's in the hair man. I need to really add that to my game. Oh you like? I love it. I did it in sixth grade. It's hot right now. I feel good about it. People either love it or hate it. They think I'm like. It faded out a little bit right? You did it a couple weeks ago? Yeah I did. I do it like national TV with it. Oh you did what? Yeah. I'm not allowed to do anything for the show. Like change my look so this is the most I can do to feel like I have control of myself. Are you off filming? You're not filming right now? No we're on hiatus right now. Got it. It's awesome man. It's it's it's it. You got it. I know him. Hey man how are you? Yeah I remember. He showed me you. So he watched you. Thanks brother. Three years ago, four years ago. It's awesome. It's awesome. So what's cooking? How's things? Good I've been here for like a week now. It's crazy. What are you doing? I'm doing press for the show and the new company that I made. The stuff you guys are working on. And the show airs when? January 19th. This is season what? Four. And they're coming out with an animated show now too. Are you the voice of? Yeah. That's good. That's awesome. That scales. Yeah no they're trying to and they're talking about merchandise and stuff. So it's it's clicked. That's yeah it's clicked. It's become a franchise. Yeah it's become a stage a little bit. That's cool. Which is like hard with the way the TV is. Like we're like one of the only shows who has that. So what can I you know obviously what I really want to do is really help you guys obviously we've had some interactions and things of that nature and obviously you know we're in control of all the cameras here so we don't use anything sensitive. So like I want to treat this like a real meeting. Like what can I help you with? Let's start with that. Just kind of advice. Yeah. We're just starting out and we're young and weird. We're trying but we don't know. What do you want to happen? We want this to be a we want the company to be the like kind of CAA go to brand mark like as far as like the way that people think of it the way that we kind of produce we want like to have all the top kind of influencers be going to us because of our quality and because of the way that we as a production company. It's a production company. I was 14 years back when I was finally AJ. I kind of try to create or with Jays like a comparison the sense of like a celebrity back company that's you know has a good face to it but I want it to be a little bit more formal where it's like we're not all feeding off each other. It's kind of each client is managed by the same person but it's not they're not dependent on each other. They take your one client separately and to hear the next to kind of like a management style type of company. I understand but the output isn't management. The output is production content. Yeah. And technically management too. I mean, so you do additional managers and that's where you're acting stuff. I mean, there's a lot of management type of an agent type of so so management. Yeah. I mean, my vision probably eventually is to become a formal manager. The way we pitch it isn't like we're management. I pitch it like like we connect brands with millions of people using influencers and we do it the right way which is not shoving it in their face. It's integrating it right. Like these are building a client service business. Yeah. But the thing also. Good. The thing is like a lot of the people a lot of the clients already are revert by multiple other people. So it's hard for us to just come in and be like, yo, let us like full service manage you. So it's definitely. Well, we can't grab a quick full service manager. But I mean, it's definitely more the branded content angle. Another big difference is that we're going more after traditional celebrities as opposed to YouTube. More like YouTubers slash traditional. So your dream scenario would have been the people behind Will Smith starting a daily blog. Yeah. Exactly. Or finding like the Madison beer when she's younger and then growing her into what she is now with the Lexus Randall. You know what I mean? Do you know who those people are? Of course. Yeah. So it's like. I know more about this world than anybody in the game. Period. And the story. I've been there from 2006 to this moment. Isn't it crazy how it's spanned out? Yeah, of course. Have you been watching what he's doing on social media? Of course. I don't know who his team is, but they're. Juju naturally is good at it. We've met with Juju from the VaynerSports.com. A lot of it's like a natural instinct, right? Yeah. Well, that's kind of what I'm gonna. It's like there's a lot of people and you're not one of them, but there's a lot of people who are like in board meetings trying to like theorize about like what the kids. I'm like, we're in it. We're there. I agree. So it's very, very, very similar to what we're doing with VaynerTalent other than you guys are willing to do more things than just produce the content. Right. Right? Yeah. Do you guys know what we're doing with VaynerTalent? I don't know. So we have, we have Lindsay. Oh, Lindsay who is just here runs a division inside of here called VaynerTalent. So like Ray Dalio or Michael Ovidz who started CAA. Yeah, I'm friends with our liar who was a lot of people. Right, right. Those are the two engines behind CAA. Like there's people paying us right now $20,000 a month, $30,000 a month to build out Sergio Baca from the NBA. Like we're wrapping up. We do a lot of executives. Like so we do, we do, we do like, like I'm living in kind of like those two places. Right. Like you'll be more like the way you pitched it. You want him to have more of a life that looks more like me. I've got, he's more of an actual celebrity came up, but I've gone down. I think he's an unprecedented territory where I'm trying to put, he's doing a whole bunch of campaigns, doing like a bunch of videos about anti-bullying with a bunch of different celebrities. Like Kevin O'Leary is doing it with him and after he's scared to move to trying to go like a mini series on that. And he's also doing today's show about making Kelly kind of surrounding the dyslexia angle. I'm really trying to build Jayce out of that. It's more of a real person. I don't know if it's being. Of course. Right now I think the big thing that I've been seeing is people that don't know Jayce, you know Henry. Well of course. And I want people to know Jayce. And I think that's where we can start a term between executive and term it a little business. You know, a formal businessman. Like it's kind of contradictory that he wears band-aids and reptiles on TV and then he's wearing a suit and tie going on CNBC talking business. I'm trying to kind of create that. I understand. But the business that you're trying to build underneath, I understand. So, or at least I'm picking up the pieces. Are you trying to go that traditional agency route? I'm trying to react to the reality of my situation and invest in the things that make sense. What you guys are doing or investing in something that makes sense, you know where the world's gonna, the world's flipped. And you guys know it to your point because you're in it. I have the big advantage because I wasn't in it but I knew it and all my money was made in investing in it, building around it. That's what I've done. That's why when people ask me, they're like, where would you come with this idea? I'm like, it was just kind of there. I didn't come up with it. I just literally saw it. I'll do that. I think the game that is important, I think the biggest thing that you'll have to think about, especially based on you bringing up Ronald and your background. And the biggest thing I would tell all three of you is what they had that none of us will have is the human has much more leverage than they did in the past. Over the next decade. Like they didn't even reply. Yes, Jace has more leverage every day. And all these people, Madison and Ren, because even they always did, but they only had three places to go and they only had eight places to be put on. What your vulnerability is, but unlimited competition and unlimited and less ways to differentiate, every kid is growing up getting it. So. That's what Jace is saying. It's not proprietary, but I feel like it genuinely still is. Oh, by the way, by the way, just by like, just by energy, I'm like, oh yeah, they'll build a 10, 20, 40 million dollar business. Thanks man. Which is great. But what you need to realize is every day that it goes by, you lose leverage, not gain. And so as long as you're strategizing towards that. Right. It's just more about becoming the CAA in five years. You know what's funny, when you bring up Madison or Ren, what's really super interesting, it's actually very interesting. The moment we had in our meeting is the most important part of the meeting. You asking me, do you know who they are? And me knowing who they were the day they started is the danger of your business. But I ask, you're the only person above 20 who I've asked who I know. I get it, I get it. But that's exactly right. But we're gonna grow with it, ideally. You can't outpace, you're not gonna outpace it. Which is okay. Well hopefully we get the electricity. But you can adjust. Correct. You can adjust to the leverage, right? So. For my experience in the MBA, what I learned was, my partner was 27, considered the older, the more critical presence. And what I found was the players relate a lot better, I'm sure AJ is saying this too, to people they can relate to. But it's not an age thing, right? But it's not an age thing, right? So if AJ walked in right now and we would say AJ, of the 15 people, nine people that VaynerSports has, who are they relating to? Relating to the most? He'd say, you Gary. Why? Because it's an understanding. They're relating to or emulating, trying to like. Relating. Relating, because I know more about Lil Xan than they do. I'm not saying to hip up guys. I'm just gonna take the little down on a plan. I'm just gonna say coach. But like, here's the punchline, right? Like, and this is an important reason I'm bringing this up. And this is not to be like, I'm cool. It's ill help you. It's never gonna be about anything other than knowing. It's like knowing, like I know no jumper, this podcast matters. Whether I'm 15 or 42, what you need to do is just always know more. Yeah, but you're an anomaly. No question. Why do you think I think you can build a $40 million thing? If I was the norm, you wouldn't build shit. Yeah. Well, that's what I'm saying. In the NBA world, you see all these agents. I'm sure some of you in the NFL, like I know them, they're 55, 65. But I think they're weird. The players don't like them. The question is, can they negotiate a good contract? The answer is yes. But if you come in and you also. You know what's even, but you know this, the coach shading the contract. My eight year old daughter can do it. You and me also, one of the only people who's going 100% in on the social. Like these people, they have agents, but this agents actually take it second. No, I totally get it. It's like, oh, you do social media. We'll do some social media stuff. But let's focus on this audition. Let's focus on this meeting. Of course, because the economics are there for you. Right, it's already established. It's funny how people don't, it seems very simple. But guess what? Like when we bought cryptocurrency in 2013, nobody got it. Like when I bought Twitter and Tumblr, go Jake, read it for me. Hey, I wanted to say thanks for being our first ever Uber rider in New York. Period. Like when you're in stuff early and you see the world for what it actually is, you see it for what it actually is. The bottom line is, of course, dude. The biggest thing that's tough when you're young is reconciling two things. Reconciling why you see it so clearly and not just saying we're young. And two, understanding what happens over time. What gets commoditized? Your knowledge gets commoditized. More people will know. People are starting to understand. Like when Gary Vee on the back of Not Entrepreneur Magazine or the Planet of the App, but on the back of Instagram, and thank you, Instagram and YouTube. You know, yeah, like that stuff. Like that stuff is everything. It's trading culture. The thing that you guys have to decide as a partnership is what you, this is the best advice. The two of you need to start getting unbelievably real with each other about how you care about the next 12 days, 12 weeks, 12 months and 12 years, because that's the only thing that matters. One thing that you have is a pre-open, I think pre-open. I believe you, but both of you are holding certain things back as you should, it's human nature. Not me, maybe. But no, no, you know what subconscious bias is? Yeah. That's what we all do. I'm kind of nuts though. Respect, but no humans, me too. But guess what? But there's still other stuff. And it's about anticipation. What happens if you fall in love with a crazy person? What happens if your mother gets sick? Like I'm talking everything. Not like how good you want to feel transparently. Like I want to screw him. Most people don't want to screw people. It's a- I don't mean really, really delve into the mix and cranny. Of course. So like to me, I think it's super important for you to think about that, because here's why. The business you're starting now is not going to be the business you're going to be in in three years, and definitely not six, and definitely not 10. And the question will become, are you excited about you, you have the, you've gravitated towards loving that game, which I also love. I can deal with people's bullshit for the rest of my life. It's innate to me, and that's what doing human stuff with. What do you mean by other people's bullshit? Well if you get into anything that looks like CIA or William Morris, or the stuff you've been doing, or the NBA or VaynerSports, you're in the people business. Cool, it sounds great right now, but when you're, even if you get to the greatest holy grail tomorrow, being the exclusive social media content provider and manager of Beyonce, you're in the Beyonce's personality business. Yeah, so I always said I'm in the sales business. Of course you are. Yeah, more than that. Of course, but the product is a human. Of course. The older agents don't realize that. They think they're in this like super special, and I'm just like, you're a sales guy. You're selling a team, and you have to think about it. Now look, it takes a certain temperament and talent to sell a human. The real business for you guys is these real celebrities are about to eat so much humility, and if you can be the people that tame them from going from a pedestal down to the trenches to build back up to a pedestal, it's an incredibly big opportunity. See what I mean? You guys are right. You're right. You're right. Look, you know this. It's proprietary in your handling of people. Why do you think that celebrities are, because for me, I was always, I'm on TV, I'm always terrified of TV going away. You know what I mean? Why are they not more afraid? Why are they not thinking? They're not afraid, because they are afraid, but they have too much ego. The only thing a real celebrity, not you, a real A. Not a B or C. Not you. Not you. I'm talking a real A. Like the biggest celebrities in the world who are fucking this up, right, is that they don't have the humility to start at zero. Come back down here. That's right. When you are a big time celebrity for the last 10 years, and you have to start on Instagram tomorrow, because you have to. But Will Smith does have the humility, which is why he's gonna fucking dominate. He's still hungry. But a million people, I'm sure we can name right now, the reason they're not doing it, is they don't like having 5,000 followers that first day. Because then it makes them look like they're nothing. They can't take that. Of course they need it. Because go read the transition of radio to television. Of course they need it. I know, but some of them are just like, whatever happens happens. Oh listen. Brother, brother, brother. That's a whole different story. Like if you don't give a fuck, nothing matters. Like you know what I mean? That's fine. Brother, that's fine. 100%. But you know what kicks in? Tasting irrelevance. You know the scariest place right now is to be a solid B. Because a solid B is awesome, but it's about to get really not awesome. It's all the same game brother. The same people you were talking to that I'm talking to, all see the world the same way. So here's the difference between where I'm at and where you're at. And I think it'll be a good thing for you to debate on the differences and decide what that means to you as you think about the next 50 years. I have decided to eat shit and build these non-exciting EBITDA businesses like we're talking right now for one reason. Because I'm gonna buy Pony or Cracker Jacks or Captain Crunch, take the energy, buy something for 288 million, and sell it for one point step. I'm gonna do champion. What happened to champion over the last three years is what I'm gonna do one day with something. Do you know what you're saying? You wanna take a pre-existing brand. Correct. Do you know what I'm doing right now is I'm, my brand is as big as it ever has been, and maybe ever will be. So right now I know I wanna do entrepreneurship. I know I wanna do bigger things. So right now I'm saying look, I'm doing this. I would argue it's the smallest that would ever be. Long term. If you're bought into where it is right now. The way you're talking. So here's what's funny. Listen, listen, listen. A macro, listen. A combination of he doesn't know where he wants. No, no, no, no, listen, listen, listen. It's macro, macro, it's the smallest. I'm saying I could die for five years, establish myself, say I've already done this company, grind, grind, grind for 10 more years, and then get to another thing. I just need to use this juice that I've got to just throw. Do you know what I'm saying? Of course I understand, two things. That's right, but it will get exponentially bigger if you do this thing. The fact that you're- No, I'm not saying I'm not doing this thing. I'm just saying. Everything that you guys are talking about is exactly, it's gonna just get bigger. Like it's great- What's gonna get just get bigger? Your juice. The bigger you get on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and podcasting is gonna make you as big as Nickelodeon is, they'll just play off of each other. It's the reason I'm willing to do TV if it's right. Apple won for me before it started. Because it was behind a paywall and all this other stuff. It didn't matter, it just positioned me differently in a world that I know is dying, Hollywood, but it mattered for me in the short term. Because you're always just balancing out your game. All right, so was it about putting yourself peer to peer? Of course. I won on the day of the announcement. It just subconsciously put me on a different place to the masses, right? That's why I'm- What do you think about the whole celebrity entrepreneurship that is kinda happening right now? Like you, I'm not gonna put you in the same realm, but Elon Musk, and there's this kind of- Yeah, it cycles. It cycles, it cycles. It's almost like these people who are creating things are now the noose almost. Yes, no, no, no. So that was because of what they, not just because of what they've done. Brother, brother, do you know how not famous athletes were in the 30s and 40s? There was a couple, but not collectively. The NBA finals in 1983 was on tape delay. They didn't show it live. But what's interesting is now, but now it's not a money game anymore. Now it's a what can you do game. Like Elon Musk, it's like- Well, no, no, no, no. Elon Musk or some billionaire who doesn't- Han, Han, Jake, is it a money game for you? Yes. Everything's a money game. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's a big, big, big- Listen, it all depends on the person. Jake could have answered no, by the way. Let me give you my story. This is just true. I'm just saying who's gonna go out and have to do the two billionaire or- I get it. I mean, the super billionaire or the Elon Musk who spent all his money on Tesla. Do you know what I'm saying? Legacy is always different than what, nobody who ended up with the most money is remembered. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, but that's because everything's being documented. Right. That's the difference now. Did you change up your strategy on that, by the way? What do you mean? The whole document was creating. Meaning? That was what you were pitching for a while, right? That's my biggest belief. But you haven't switched up on that all. Because haven't you been trying to do more narrative stuff? Like what? I don't know, I just heard you mentioning you were trying to do more creative, narrative-based stuff. Like I just wanna make sure I understand. Maybe I just wanna understand the question. Okay, so for a while you were pitching like, I'm not creating, I'm documenting. Which is what I'm doing right now. Yes. But do you consider the podcast content documentation? No, I consider that creative. But no, I think that's creative. And by the way, the first thing I ever did was creative. Why not be TV was a me documenting. I did a wine show for 30 minutes, right? Were you able to do that? 2006. Online? I have an interest so I reached out to me, friend of mine, anyone wants to do a podcast with James on entrepreneurship. Okay. What do you think he's kinda iffy on? And I wanna get your take. Oh, you should definitely do a podcast. But I can do a podcast without a video. Yes. You should just. Is it worth it? Yes. I look at audio as just so important that you have to be on it. I think for us it's a comment. I wish you'd keep hearing the audio as the next thing and I don't understand it. Because it's passive consumption. It's the same reason over and over. Like when they're going to sleep or when they're waking up in the morning driving. When they're driving, they're not fucking wondering if Henry's changing. I wasn't sure what was, yeah. I listen to venture girls' podcast every morning and then I listen to them. But how much value do you have to pass? Let me give you some, amazingly. But if you're not paying attention. No, no, you're half paying attention to everything. Like it's all the same. Let me give you a great piece of advice. The written word, audio and video are gonna be here long after we're gone. Have been here long before. All of the platforms always matter. They just go up and down in their importance based on technology. The radio was a hell of a lot more important than video. For a moment there and then this and that. And so they bounce up and down. The car radio was super important. Having a morning talk show in the car was a monster. Howard Stern was a monster. So you've got to, it goes up and down. Do you feel like within the past year podcasts have just become super saturated? Everything gets saturated. Do you think influencers have become super saturated? But it's supply and demand. The supply is not equal to demand yet. And guess what else happens next? Talent rises to the top. Do you know how many social media guru and businessmen there are? There's a difference between me and them because I'm more talented than them. That goes for acting too. Of course it does. It goes for everything in life. The end. There's nothing else to really say. Dude, when I tell you, you'll love this. As soon as you're done texting I'll tell you something you're gonna love. Of course. Can I tell you what that's called? Somebody bought Peach from property at Malibu when it first came out. Some man and woman walked over like, fuck it, we'll take a chance. Now it's still great. It's just way more expensive. I was on YouTube in 2006. That was what I gained from Twitter. I was one of the first people with a million followers. That was the foundation. Twitter's kind of resurgence because of politics. I feel like it was dying there for a second and now it's kind of- It all depends on what you use it for. But now it's like a main source for information about the world. Yeah, I mean it always was. It just- It wasn't as blank. It's on your mind right now because of the politics stuff. Let me tell you this though. Fake humility sucks. It's like, your fake is hell. It just comes across like your bigger shit. But the thing is you suck it up and you do it. I do it when I know that I'm wearing my your jersey and I don't do it when I'm wearing his jersey. I play both which is weird. So what you have here? What jersey did you have first? Personal brand Gary versus- Well I was never, nobody knew who the fuck I was until I was 34 years old so I was a businessman my whole life so it wasn't like super hard. That was my first jersey. That's what's worked for me. So I put on a different jersey at a different time. Like you have- Look, look, look. You don't roll up on Fat Joe and be like, of course you knew who I am. But when you're in a meeting and you're playing the exact- But look, by the way, by the way, this is the wrong answer. Just keep doing what you're doing, keep doing what you're doing. And that's it. And both of, by the way, you guys, you just had an exchange that has always been my biggest issue. You both put, you just have to both default starting now because you're both alpha winners and wanna win into we both, we put- We- We do the we. No, no, no, no, I've already, I'm watching you guys. Listen to me. This is what I talked about 12 days, 12 months, 12, I want you guys to win. I don't give a fuck. You guys do the we at certain times and you do the I'll replay the videotape of the breakfast club statement two seconds ago. He just said, that's the reason I can get into the business. And you said, I got you into the business. Brother, because it's true. It's true. His brand, they're both true. And the biggest issue I have with my other alpha partners is we both think it was us. I think everything that's, I think everything that VaynerSports is gonna do is me, but it's also AJ. Like it's- Do you know what I mean? So like, so it's just, so you guys will lose if you don't fight every day for we and understand that truth. And, and, and, and, it's B plus A minus. Right. Gotcha. I'm literally living the life a couple months ahead of you, couple years ahead of you that you're living. That's all. That's what being older is good about, you know? Like now you're fucking set. Now you're set. He's not- So old? Yeah. You know, by, compared to you guys, I feel young as fuck, but you guys are young as shit. You know, so listen, I'm here for you guys because I've threw up through these things a ton. How do you scale something, somebody who doesn't wanna be not authentic and not like, there's a very specific reason that I'm winning this thing and I know I'm gonna win it the most out of anybody. It's because I've been doing it for a much longer time than most and number two, I care about both. Thank you man, I really appreciate it. Seriously. It's really good to see you, bro. Thank you. Oh, let me take a picture. Oh, actually, you got my, wait a minute. You got my, wait a minute. This is the advantage you have. My daughter watches this shit. I gotta get something good. One, two, three. Awesome. Can you email me that? It's good to see you, brother. Thanks guys. Good to see you. Appreciate it. Good to see you. Good to see you.
