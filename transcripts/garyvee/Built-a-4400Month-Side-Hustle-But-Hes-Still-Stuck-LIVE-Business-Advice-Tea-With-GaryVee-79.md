## Transcript
I turned $20 into 4,400 revenue monthly, flipping items on eBay for almost two years. My theory is if I quit and risk it, double down, I can at minimum double my revenue to live on. That's right. But I'm stuck because my debt is high and I pay for my house. Anybody that can make that kind of money, part-time while having a job, when they quit their job and go all in, he's gonna triple his revenue. All of you are scared because you overvalue people's opinions. All of you are judging everybody but yourself. You're not fucking accountable. You point fingers, not thumbs, and you don't realize how lucky you are. Thank you, I'm never doing this show again. No, but I missed the show. I missed the show. I missed the show. I mean, Jesus. Oh God, he needs to jump. He will win. I've seen this movie a hundred times, Aaron. Can I just say something to everybody? Friends, friends, jobs will always be there for you. Jobs exist for the people that can't take the risks or don't have the talent, or, which is amazing. Like, jobs are amazing. I don't look down on jobs. And by the way, real talk, and all the entrepreneurs in here, including the successful ones like me, are about to say yes. You know what I mean? Times a year, I wish I was the employee. The amount of stress at the top is really gangster. And if you don't realize it, let me tell you how. Every parent in here, remember when you had that child, how shit changed? That fear you have every day, that stress you have every day to make that person live and be happy. So anyway, I just think that there's such an opportunity for more happiness. This guy, if he quits, is likely could quadruple his revenue, not double. The debt's the debt, whether he has the job or not, have the job. If he quadruples his revenue, it sounds like he's gonna be able to pay off the debt quicker. And what he doesn't realize is that 27, if he fails at 29, he'll go get the same kind of job paying the same amount of money. There's almost no risk in quitting a job because there's always another job. Next question, Erin. Okay, the next question is from Ava. What advice would you give someone that struggles to do the mindless daily tasks that you need to do to be successful because the lack of immediate gratification is like eating glass? I do not understand the lack of resilience in society. Life is about eating glass. What's her name? Ava. Ava, why are you the chosen one that should have life so easy? Ava, why are you the chosen one that should have life so easy and so great? We all have to eat glass. There's not a single person that you know, everyone, that isn't eating glass. Oh, I know what you all do. You look at Courtney Kardashian and have decided she doesn't eat glass. You look at Novak Djokovic. You look at Cindy Sweeney and you decide they don't, you look at Mr. Beast. You don't think those motherfuckers eat glass? Those motherfuckers eat a lot of glass. You know what it's like to live in the public eye and have judgment at scale daily? Do you know what it's like to have almost every human being you interact with wants something from you and not interested in giving you anything? Who doesn't eat fucking glass? Who the fuck doesn't eat glass? Claudio Mazato says, shut the fuck up, bro. Hey, Claudio, you're allowed to leave, bro. I'm not trying too hard. You don't know me, bro. How about that, Claudio? Trying too hard, I'm living life, my guy. What the fuck are you doing, Claudio? I'm trying to help out here. What the fuck are you doing, Claudio? People are funny out here. I can't wait to meet Claudio and give him a hug in real life. You know, I like Claudio. Genuinely, genuinely, like I don't mind. I know what he's doing, rage baiting. I get it, I love it. It's fun and like, that's why I love it. Like it's all good, but fuck man, every single human being on earth eats glass. Who the fuck doesn't eat glass? Bug bite says eating ass. Yes, some people eat ass too. Like that's real life. That's Victoria, you like that one? Victoria's usually locked in. Yes, it happens. I mean, we're all grown ups here. Yes, that happens too. All right, let's keep it going. Literally two days ago, my girlfriend broke up with me because she claims I'm financially irresponsible. In my eyes, I'm investing in a career that I want. I work a steady job as a freelance videographer and make anywhere from 2K to 5K a month depending on the clients and workload. My success is definitely coming in a lot slower than I'd like or better yet, she would like, but I'm determined and I communicated that I don't plan to stop. Also for more context, this is my second time dumping money on a passion project this year. We're not even talking about last year, LOL. Yeah, I mean, look, the answer is both of you can be right. In this scenario, like, there doesn't have to be someone who's wrong or right. Like, she's allowed to make a subjective opinion if she thinks your strategies on how you handle your money don't work for her, for the kind of financial partner she's looking for in her life. She's allowed, you know, and long-term, she may regret this decision or it might be the best decision that ever happened. You're also allowed to not conform and get a regular job or do something. You are not in a place where you have to make a certain amount of money or do a certain thing to appease a partner either. There are unbelievable amounts of women in the world that will love you for what you do, for how you do it financial. What is financial success? It's different to everyone. Is $100,000 a year enough to make, you know, for many women and men? It is, for many women and men, it's not. I don't judge what people are looking for. They're gonna have to live with that. If a woman is only looking to marry a man who makes a million dollars a year and she breaks up with a couple of guys along the way that treated her better at 62, she may regret that. Maybe she doesn't. She's allowed. Same for men, same for men that matter. I mean, do you know what I mean? We always love to say women are gold diggers. You know what I mean? Men are gold diggers? There's a lot of men who are trying to marry rich girls or girls that have rich dads or like, there's a lot of shit going on in the world. The answer to this question is, all of it works neither are necessarily right or wrong on surface level. Both could be wrong in real life. I just don't have all that context, but it will all play itself out. But I would say, but what I would say is, don't cry. Like don't cry when someone leaves you. That's where I'm at. That's the shit I'm about. Do not cry when someone leaves you. Be self-reflective. Think about if there's something you want to do different and be better. Be accountable. Like, be accountable. But don't cry. There's, I don't know if you guys know, there's eight billion people on earth. There's literally eight billion people on earth. If you are broken up with, there is a high percentage chance that the next partner you're gonna have is better for you. If you are fired, there is a good chance that your next job is going to be more fun and pay you more. Stop being scared of adversity. Being ghosted, being dumped, being fired are often the best thing that ever happened to you. Everyone has just decided universally that it's the worst. The end. You like that one, Mike? That one hit you a little bit. I know you. That one hit for you? You're happy, right? That was good, right? I actually felt that on you right now. Good, good shit. And Mike's huge garage sale coming up this Saturday, or he is fired, we all know that. Oh man, I'm in a really good mood. I love doing this show. I'm gonna do this show a lot. A few moments ago. Thank you, I'm never doing this show again. Brandon O'Neill, my girl cheated on me. Good, Brandon. That's good. I'm being serious. I know everyone, like a bunch of youngsters work here. I'm looking at all of you. Who cares? My point of view on that is you got lucky that you got to the truth. Now you get to make a decision. How about this? I wouldn't even judge you if you've decided to forgive her. Everyone's allowed to do everything. Everything's allowed. Who the fuck are you living by? What's the, do you know how many people right now have lived happily and successfully and prosperly and happy for the last 50 years after one of the spouses decided to forgive the other spouse for an infidelity? That's profound. Who the fuck makes the rules? Good for Brandon that she cheated on him. It's given him clarity of an option. By the way, some of you need to get cheated on to fucking kick you into fucking deer. A lot of motherfuckers on this show this morning need to get cheated on. To wake them the fuck up. Because they're taking their fucking partner for granted. Because they fucking got lazy. They need to wake the fuck up. But this show puts me in a very different mood. Right? This show puts me in a very different mood than my normal self. All right, let's go to the next question. We have a question from Michael. How do you go into a new position with little influence within your organization and communicate with a little grace and dignity that they are doing it wrong? If I'm communicating with grace and dignity. He's got it. By not being scared of the ramifications. What he's really asking is, I'm a little bit scared to do that because they might fire me. Or they might think I'm a complainer. Or they might think I'm a problem. And he's not wrong. But here's my thing. Do you know why VaynerMedia became the largest independent global agency in the world? It's because that's the only thing I do. You know why? We don't get clients all the time because of it. We, for a lot of you on Team Gary here or V-Friends, you don't know this. We do not get clients a lot because I tell them directly the truth and they don't like the truth. But here's the punchline. We get a lot of clients because of that. And so if Mike does this and gets fired, he wouldn't have won there anyway. So you, and I love him because he asked with, you know, the problem with a lot of people is they come in and they're like 23 and they think they fucking know everything. And they're like, you don't do social right. And they like, you know, and they do it audacious. They do it classless. They do it with like entitlement. But notice how great that question was. You know? So I think he's on it. And I could not encourage people more to respectfully and humbly communicate observations because that will give you an indication of where you work. Right? You know, Aaron, you already know this. Actually, Aaron, you really know this. We don't really know each other like that yet. We're about to get to know each other because of where I'm going with my personal brand come in the fall. But you've come in and you've pushed back. And I would argue, I'm just guessing here now and I'm not trying to put you on a spot, but I've been almost like too open to the feedback. Which gave you an indication of who you worked for. Right? So for you, it worked. But if I was like, shut the fuck up. Who the fuck do you think you are? Do you understand? I'm Gary. I got 55 million dollars. How many of you fucking got? If I did that shit, you'd be like, I need to get the fuck out of here. Okay, this question is from David. I'm 32 single, a CPA MBA. And I feel like I've wasted the last decade. 32 or 42? 32. Oh, here we go. I've wasted the last decade addicted to weed and just surviving. I'm finally ready to change and build something meaningful. I've said it before, but I have no choice. What's your number one advice to someone trying to reinvent their life from scratch for real this time? By realizing that 32 is 22. I'm pumped for this guy. What's his name? David, I'm so proud of you, bro. Here's what I would say. Like when you're 90, you'll be like, yo, 22 to 32 was fucking epic. I smoked weed every second. Like you're gonna be fine. Like yes, you haven't, you know, like you over, you know, you misplayed certain parts of your life. I'm sure there's certain parts of your life that you've done well with. And good news, you're 32, you're a fucking kid. Like, you know, you're a child. And by the way, when I was answering that question about 32, somebody in the chat on whatnot said, what about 47? Same thing. Here's my thing. If you're 47, 57, 67, and you're like, what about me? I've blown my whole life. Here's my point. There's never a bad time to start doing good shit. Like if you're 67 and you're like, well, it's too late. I fucked up everything. And you're destined to live to 92. You're telling me you're like, you know that you can make the next 25 years a hell of a lot better and enjoy it. Do you know how many teams are losing in the fourth quarter? Do you guys know sports? Do you know how many teams are down 28, seven going into the fourth quarter and win? We're all at sport. We're all a team. Life is sports and you as a human are a team. And there are many fucking teams. Do you know what those pieces of shit in Indiana Pacers did? The Knicks were fucking winning by 12 with one second left and lost. I'm literally going to Oklahoma City tonight to sit courtside to boo the Pacers. You'll all see me tonight if you watch the game. I will be courtside tonight booing the Pacers. Those motherfuckers were dead and pulled it down in the last second. You could be 90 and a piece of shit and a fucking loser your whole life and pull it out in the last three years and reconcile all your relationships, have some fun and shit. What is this? What about 47? What is this? What about 32? And your motherfuckers under 30? You, I'm going to kill all of you. What are you worried about? Nothing is bad. You've got unlimited time to make everything awesome. What are you crying about? And you know what you're all crying about? But I'm a 29 year old girl and my friend Heather is already married and just had her first. What the fuck does Heather's life have to do with you? Next question. Okay, this question came through your text. It's from Samantha who's 25 years old. She says, I'm an actor and my life is not going in the direction I want it to. The reason for me reaching out is to ask if you offer life coaching sessions. Listening to your videos has been giving me so much inspiration and motivation and sometimes I even feel like you're speaking directly to me. I started disconnecting from friends I grew up with lately because I no longer feel connected to them. I've realized I want to hang around people with big ideas and who see me and my ideas as a possibility. I don't know, I thought I'd reach out and see if I could get even like five minutes with you. I guess I feel like I am directionless. It has been feeling like no one gets me and my dreams, not even my family. Samantha, I'm so pumped. I'm so proud of you. You said as a 25 year old, as a 25 year old, you have realized one of the great lessons of the human life. I'm about to change thousands of people's lives in this moment and millions over the next three decades that watch this clip. If you are unhappy, you must do the following. You must audit and limit and replace the people and the content you are consuming. Who you spend time with and what you listen to is the fundamental reality of your emotions. My friends, if you are unhappy, you must break up, quit, or if you love your mom but she's a negative Nelly and you guys talk twice a day, you need to move to twice a week. You must cut out or limit. I'm not saying you gotta like never talk to your dad again, but if your dad, every time you call him is like, dad, how are you doing? Oh, my back, my boss. I think I have cancer. Like, how's your idiot boyfriend? If that's the combo, you need to get the fuck out of there. You need to go surface level. You need to start thinking about therapy. You need to start consuming positive content. My friends, you were only unhappy because of who you spend time with. Let me give you an example. When my homies tell me they're unhappy with their job, yo, bro, like this is real life. When a friend of mine is like, yo, I fucking hate my job, I go positive. I'm not that friend, like all of you are the same kind of friends. Most of you are not me. Most of you are enablers. Your buddy's like, yo, I hate my job. They're like, yeah, that boss a dick. No, no, no, I go to like, let's take a step back. What can you do about it? And then I remind them, you got a beautiful fucking daughter who's an Olympian. You've got a fucking like great wife. You're going on vacation for two weeks next week. You love your softball thing. I just go positive. And then I go accountable. I'm like, you can quit. But we're just in this culture of fucking enabling. Everybody here, I have actually what I'm feeling right now is something I don't say often. I'm asking if everybody's ready to be a better friend, please put in the chat, better friend. If you're ready to stop enabling your dwelling unhappy loser friends, and are willing to do what I'm doing on this show for you every morning to your friends. I get through your homies, but you can't just be like, yeah, you're right. When your girl's like, oh, Rick's such a dick. He like went bowling too late last night. You need to be like, Karen, shut the fuck up. Rick's a good dude. Rick's better looking than you. Rick's providing. Let the fucker bowl. Not like, yeah, Rick's a dick. Do you understand? Enough enabling. Enough enabling. Next question. Question from Jason. How do you deal with a franchiser who micromanages their brand? I'm the consultant and all creativity and innovation gets blocked by a controlling founder. By not being a consultant. I love when consultants complain. You're an opinionator, not the executor. You want to control shit, own your own shit. And guess what you do? You own your consulting business, which means in this scenario, he can fire the client. They're allowed. Leave. Oh, but you want to keep taking the money. Well, if you're taking the money and somebody else has the control, you have to deal with their shit. There's an old Russian saying that my dad used to love to say, whoever pays for the music gets to pick the song. You don't want mommy and daddy to tell you how to live your life? Because you're 24, stop taking their money. You don't want to have mommy and daddy have power on you and tell you who you should date, how you should live, where you should work. Because you're 25, I've got a big secret for you. Stop taking their money and you got all the control back. Ronald said, damn, harsh. Actually, not really. Actually, profound. What's harsh is all the kids right now that are 26 that hate that their parents are in their business and don't realize by not taking the money, their parents are totally out of their business. Erin. I have a question from Roxy. Do you have moments when you lose motivation and feel depressed? What keeps you going? I would not say I have moments of depression because I would say that I have too much of a perspective. I have many moments of micro lack of motivation because I go so hard and I'm a human being and there's just gonna be moments. I'll tell you one thing that's fucking with me, let me be a little transparent and vulnerable. I'm a little, I love making fun of all my friends that move to Florida because I'm like, you're a loser. Because they think they're like A players. I'm like, you're not an A player once you move from New York to LA or fucking Miami because you're like in yoga in the middle of day and you're like fucking, like you're just not. You can't be an A player in Miami. Let's just call it a fucking. I'm talking like A gangster fucking, you're a gangster. Which, and by the way, most people should be B minus players. Like I, but I will say this, I'm a little bit scared about this. As I get older, I definitely am realizing like a rainy day is not for me. I fucking hate rain. By the way, the suicide data around Seattle and London, like I understand it, I don't like rain. I fucking love snow, like love. That must be that like Soviet Russian, like it's probably in me, right? I fucking hate rain. I honestly fuck rain. No, I'm telling you like gloomy rain is like, like the only times I kind of feel unmotivated or there's a direct correlation to the rain. I'm telling you there is. I can't fuck with rain. Fucking hate rain. You know, and then like people are like, look, other tons of people in the comments are like I love rain. That's awesome. That's what I love about life. Like, you know what? I used to not like cilantro because I had that palate that like is like soap. And I always had this ideology that I wanted to like every food. And I forced myself over time by eating it often. Fuego 23, congrats on the pack. I have systematically, I have systematically gotten myself to be decent with cilantro. I just decided that I'm gonna systematically over the next four years, get myself to like rain. Right here. Yep, the side in the spot. That's it. All right, let's move on. All right, question from Sean. Gary, I'm 21 years old, hate going to school, pumped doing my side hustle being a video editor. What advice would you give for me as a third year college student trying to balance school and work? Quit school, quit. Do companies even look at college anymore? Do you know that I'm looking at all of you and you couldn't, I, if you told me, Victoria's the most important person in my professional life, if you asked me, what school did Victoria, Emily, Anna, Hannah, if you gate said to me, I will give you $1 billion in cash right now to tell me what colleges they went into. They went to, I'd have no clue. I barely know that Ross went to LSU when he wears LSU stuff every fucking day. I have no clue if, ready for this one? I don't have a clue if LSU's a good or bad school. I don't know what LSU's good for. I know that Shaq went to LSU. I know that Joe Burl went to LSU. I know that a tiger is a mascot. I know it's in New Orleans. If you told me what is LSU good at, like what's it known for? Accounting, nursing, technology? I don't fucking care. That's not real life. Quit school, especially if that dude's taking on debt. If you are taking on debt in college, mommy and daddy aren't paying for it. The state is not paying for it and you hate it and you don't need it for your profession. You need to be a lawyer, you need to be a doctor, yes. Your mommy and daddy are paying for it or you got a full ride because you're good at fencing. Yes. You're fine with it and it's kind of like a vacation and you're like doing keg stands and hooking up, definitely. But if you fucking hate it and you're collecting debt, quit now, yesterday, period. All right, a question from Jacob, 31 years old. Your video about building fast versus building slow really resonated with me and gave me the push to pursue my passion. I was laid off from my fire alarm job two weeks ago and decided to go all in on sports and collectible cards. I post daily on X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok using hashtag peak pull daily, but sales have been slow lately and rents coming up. I do better at card shows, but they only happen monthly. I'm all in and working hard every day, would love any advice from you. Sell them one, not 24 hours a day. Next. All right, we have a question from a former NFL player. Derek Fine says, as a former three year NFL player with ample sales and connector experience at age 41, how do I work for VaynerSports? I've made the mistakes that will allow me to help the athletes, which returns revenue to the agency. I want my shot because I can be great. So AJ Vaynerchuk, my brother, is the active CEO, co-CEO of VaynerSports. He makes that level of decision. However, I love a good cosine. I love a good, give someone an opportunity. Derek, email me at gary at VaynerSports.com and I will put you in touch with AJ. Next. Okay, Shiva asks, how do you market a product or app that you haven't built yet, but you wanna first validate the desirability and viability? By building it. You're not gonna be able to get the answer she's looking for. Learn what AI engineering is. You can build MVPs now with AI, even normal people. Go to chat, CBT and say, I'm a normal person. Gary Vee told me to build an app. This is the app, how do I build that? It will literally walk you through it. Next question. Okay, from Tootsie Jr. Looking to find my next gig post 67 years old. Love. In 18 months, my corporate risk management job will be over. Not sure where to start. Not about the money, more about what do I wanna do? You know what's so funny? Like this question's interesting to me. Like the answer is what are your hobbies? Like do you love golf? Do you love cooking? Do you like watching what not? Do you like, like everybody does know the answer to this and everybody's scared of the answer because they don't think it's a job. You know, like, again, like do you like garage selling? Because like it is a job. You can make like 200,000 a year buying a garage sales and flipping on one night in eBay. Like do you like poker? Like you could make content about poker. Like everyone does know. If he said he's not, he did well, right? He did well enough that it doesn't have to be about the money. Like it could be anything. You like the horse track? Like go to the horse track every day and make content about horse betting and that can lead to sponsorships that can pay for your betting. You like ice cream? Go work at an ice cream shop. Make $19 an hour working at a fucking ice cream shop on Palm Springs and serve the kids. Like I don't know, like everyone actually knows the answer to these questions. Everybody fears leaning into their happiness. There's this almost inherent subconscious misunderstanding that you can't like do it. Like you can't, this is why I'm how I am. Like I just fully do what I want. It comes with eating glass every minute of my life but it's what I want to do. This goes back to like nothing's perfect, nothing's easy. Even doing your dream job or your dream thing has its ramifications. There is no perfection, there's just life. Next question, Aaron, fire away. Okay, this is from a comment on one of your YouTube videos. Does passion really build billion dollar brands or do you need to be a little obsessed like V Friends to pull it off? What's your take, heart or hustle? Both. Passion is often the reason people go out of business because they just think I'm passionate about this golf business, it'll do great and it fails. Passion is fuel but your business is the car and you have to know how to drive it. Ooh, shit. Yeah, whoa. Clip that, whoa. Yeah, that was it, that was it, that was it y'all. I got that one. Passion is the fuel, right? The business is the car, you have to be a great driver. So passion is just one of the elements. But I do believe that passion allows you to get crazy. Like I think a lot of people build very nice businesses because they just want the money. Oh, I know I can sound, I'm good at math, I can start an accounting firm, I'm not passionate about it, but I'm gonna build a $10 million business and I'm gonna make 800,000 a year and I'm gonna have this good life and that's fine. But I think that blows, for me, for me, I think it's wonderful for others. But not having passion, not waking up and being pumped, that's what leads to unhappiness. I'd rather make, in fact, I do make so much less money than I could, because I choose happiness and I do that, and people are gonna be like, well, you can now, that's what, my number one passion and happiness from 22 to 30 was building a company for my parents. You guys know how I feel about my parents. It makes more sense to you the more you get to know me. Like I love my parents different. I got lucky and I think everybody else who has remarkable parents loves them like that too. But we were also immigrants and we went through it together, you know what I mean? I was born in the old country and all those dynamics. So that was my passion. That was financially horrible for me. I started this company at 34 in another company's conference room because I had no money. I was 34, I had no money. Let's say it again, I was 34, I had no money. Because I was living, my passion was happy, a shit doing it. And then I wasn't. Then I wanted to build some more monetary gain for me and I changed my mind and I started my own company instead of building my dad's for him. So, you know, to answer, no, passion is not the only thing. Like I'm passionate about being a professional athlete. I, Gary, am passionate to be the quarterback of the New York Jets. I am more passionate to be the quarterback of the New York Jets and win a Super Bowl than I am in anything I do in my life. I cannot pull that off. I do not have the talent or capability to do that. Nor did I ever have that talent or capability. I have the talent, capability to potentially buy them one day. That I believe. Okay, we have a question from Sally. Can you make content for teens? I actually got a great job just by doing everything you said. I want my son to listen to you, but we don't allow cursing. What do you have for teens? I think this would make a huge impact in my son's life. I'll just wait for your son to get old enough. I mean, you could beep out my content. Good news, in two seconds there's gonna be AI where you could, let me give you the real answer of 2026. I'm not gonna be a fan of that. I'm gonna be a fan of the real answer of 2026. Upload my videos to Gemini, to, you know, to Runway, to all these apps that are coming, chat GBT and be like, here's Gary's video. Can you give me a version where you beep out all his curse words? That's it? Question from Melissa. Melissa. Found my dream job at 61, but always wanted to retire at 65. Any thoughts? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, I have huge thoughts. It's called, you're allowed to be adaptable and change your mind based on the circumstances of the reality of your life versus the subjective ideology you created for yourself at some point in your younger life. I stay disciplined there. I didn't go crazy. That's the actual answer to the question. You arbitrarily in your 20s or teens or 30s decided that you were gonna retire at 65. You're now 61 and you found something that makes you happier. You're now allowed to go to 73. You're also allowed to do it for next four years. And in four years, by the way, shit changes. It might not be as fun as it is or dream as it is now. And then you can achieve your life goal of retiring then. Oh, by the way, when you decided 65 was retirement, probably 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, people didn't live to 100 the way they do now. You might want to rethink 65. Do you know what I'm think I'm gonna be doing at 65? The same shit I'm doing right this second. Do you know how funny it's gonna be when I'm like 78 and clearly 78 years old and still like going to garage sales and still like pounding and still doing tea with Gary? You're like, the same shit. I'm gonna be such, I'm a ridiculous 49-year-old. Imagine how ridiculous this is at 78. It's gonna be the same shit. I'm in the dirt. I'm a worm from the dirt. Next question. Question from Sunny. I own a fitness business and I'm closing my brick and mortar to go fully online. How do I stand out in a sea of online fitness businesses and influencers who charge nearly nothing for their content? By understanding that the market is the market is the market. Like supply and demand, like shit changes. By giving better content and by having people care more about them. Everybody who's got a personal brand wants to speak, I get paid more. People feel more connected to me. Give back more. Give back more. Look what I'm doing with Tea with Gary Vee right now. Have something to offer, which is yourself. People will pay for things that are free out there if they like the person more, but that's the game. Next question, Erin. Question from Deanna. How do you reinvent yourself at an older age? For instance, if you have always done sales, how do you pivot to marketing or something you know you would be better at? Nobody gave a shit that you did sales. You're allowed to do marketing. People are in their feelings too much. It doesn't matter if they did sales. Now you do marketing by start making content and just changing your LinkedIn profile. You're like, I do marketing now. Nobody cares about these things. That's old thinking. You just need one person to say yes. Do you know that's what life's all about, everyone? Everyone's like, oh, I can't get a girlfriend. You sure can. Ask out every girl you see in the world. One will say yes. Erin, you like that one? It's true. Gary, nobody will take me serious because all my LinkedIn is sales and I want to do marketing. Email 4,000 people on LinkedIn and say you do marketing and you learn these things from sales and one person will say yes. I'm trying out here, folks. I'm trying. Like life is so simple and yet everyone decided to make it so complicated. I would say humans great skill is complicating simplicity. Life's simple. You just made it hard. Next. Next. When you have no one watching, what should I be talking about? Any ideas? First, make content. So you build up a couple hundred followers. Text Andy Craniac all the way to Zach Nadler in your phone and everybody in between. Ask them to watch your content. Build an audience of seven. When I started Wine Library TV, I had 30 watchers. Then 41 and 57. Like, you know, like just make content. Make content. Put in the words, put in the actions to the words I'm saying. Sneak one more in. Okay, a quick one. Any tips for speaking on camera for someone who's never done it before? To do it.
