## Transcript
There is a little concern for me of what happens when this no longer becomes the remote control of our society. If you told me that 16 years from now we live in a predominant VR world, I would be like, maybe. Like I can see that possibility. You could see that it's pushing in a direction. I don't think it's going to end up being these Apple Pro, Google Glass, Snap, the Facebook thing, Quest. My intuition is that it's going to have to be much more lightweight, but I never underestimate the human being. I'm positive somebody's going to make the contact lenses that work like this. And then we're off to the races because now back to the way I think about day trading attention. This no longer houses the attention. Attention is the number one asset. Gary, what's going on, man? How are you? I think Sean, I've known you for a while. I've watched your videos forever. Sean saw something recently that you had posted that I thought everyone knew about you. Sean, what was that thing, the report card? Most podcasts start with an intro. We start with little ball busting. So I have your Gary's high school report card, which you tweeted out to be fair. So I'm not putting it out there. You didn't already do. But I thought this is kind of amazing. So you tweeted out a picture of your high school report card. I'm just going to read off a few of your achievements. Gary got a C in ceramics, a D in English, and F in German. P.E., you got an A. That's the only A you have on this report card, I think. Algebra D. This one's kind of amazing. Speech, which like you are known for speech. You got a D. Driver's Ed, D. Gary, you were, what a turnaround. What a turnaround. What's your reaction when you see this? That a lot of data in the world is dirty. It's fake data. And I think school grades are just not a tremendous indicator of what's going to happen. The speech one is crazy. The report card I tweeted out was the recap of all four years of high school. So little fun facts to build on top of what you just said. I got an F in all four marking periods of German one freshman year. I retook it sophomore year. I got a D in the first marking period and then proceeded to get all Fs. Failed language, my freshman and sophomore year. And the state of New Jersey in 1994. If you did not pass two years of language, you could not graduate high school. So I walked into junior year high school and took Spanish one with all these ninth graders as a junior. And I had the pressure on and luckily I got Mrs. Senora Kennedy saw something in me and forced me through the system. Otherwise it was over for me. But yeah, I mean the speech one really stands out to your point, Sean, right? Like to think that I got a D in speech, which was give a speech in class, right? Which I did well. It's just that I, you know, I told my mom, my mom and I talked about this this weekend. I literally did not open a book in four years of high school and did zero homework. Like, you know, they would have, everyone who's listening went through school. I think like they would assign a book report and like it's not that I did it poorly. It's that I didn't do it. Just like didn't ever, I literally in four years of high school did zero homework, zero. Like I something happened where I just knew that, you know, at that point high school, I was already working my dad's liquor store and selling a lot of baseball cards at shows and just kind of, and look, this is pre-internet. The world was different. I grew up in an immigrant family. We lived in like, we just moved to like rural New Jersey. When I tell you we lived in our own little four or five person cocoon, my family, we really did. It was very, very, very in hindsight, deeply immigrant. You know what I mean? Like we didn't have like American, like my parents didn't have American parent friends. Like my mom wasn't friends with any of my high school friends, parents. Like my mom asked me about what I'm doing for college February of my senior year. I was like, mom, it's over. I'm not going to college. She lost her mind and forced me to like go and I got like a postcard in the mail from Mount Ida College filled it out. And that's literally how I went to college. Like, so, you know, I think if I was growing up today, my intuition is that it would have been okay for me not to go to college and it would have just all been handled differently. And honestly, I think my teachers would have said to me like, I have a bright future instead of saying what they did back then, which was you're a loser. You're going to be a garbage man. That was the big thing, John Sam, in the nineties, your teachers would tell you you're going to be a garbage man, which I think is really crazy because actually it's a very good living with a high pay, you know, as a high pay scale. Our friend just started a garbage business and is doing like 300 grand a year of it. Jokes on you, Ms. Kennedy. Yeah. Even if you don't do like, even if you don't build a business and you work for the the city, it's like a well paying job in comparison to alternatives. Nonetheless, yes, by the way, the thing that would have been more effective is to say you're going to end up a high school teacher. Unfortunately, that would be a bro brutal burn for themselves. It's really, it's really wild. Like that was I was my mom did such a good job and like I was very respectful, even though the teachers weren't reciprocating. But I used to think like that. I used to be like, huh, I'm make I'm selling $2,000 in sports cards a weekend, right? I'm making a thousand in profit. I'm like, if I only did this, right, I'm making $52,000 a year. And I also knew that I was in school fucking all day every day. You know what I mean? And I was just like, man, like I make more money in theory than my teachers. There's something there's a disconnect, but I didn't think of it like arrogant, right? I wasn't like razzling or a dick. I was just not confused. I was intrigued. I was just like, had this incredible calmness starting in fifth grade that like all of this is not real. And like, let me just get through it. And then my real life will start. And like to this day, I really do think the first day I worked at shoppers discount liquors, then wine library, like when I came home from college that like May 19th, you know, 1998, that drive and I came home and stayed with my parents for a couple months before I got an apartment closer to the store. I would argue that that day that Monday, you know, May 18th, 1998 is still outside the birth of my children. Like top five days of my life, because there was like this. I actually remember it vividly. I was my parents lived 45 minutes from the liquor store, you know, drive on route 78 in New Jersey. And I just vividly remember coming from like the back, you know, woods of where my parents lived onto the highway. This was it. Z 100 was on like the morning zoo. Like I got a coffee at the like, you know, the gas station. And I just like literally, literally exhaled like 12 years of anxiety. And I was just like, literally like worded to myself like now my life begins. And I was hyped and it's, you know, you guys see it publicly now. I'm passionately excited. I'm very fortunate. I live a life where I like what I do. And, you know, a lot of people don't have that luxury. And I make a lot of content and talk a lot about it because it was it was really one of the best days of my life. Well, I want to ask you a little bit about that in a bit, but there's one thing I wanted to start with, which is you're very intentional. And so when I was prepping for this, I wrote down my intent. I was like, you know, before I write any of the notes, or the background, or the questions I want to ask, is what's the intent? What are we here to do? And I wrote down the following. So I just want to read this out loud to you because I feel like sharing my intent, I feel like you will get it, and it will help. I said, what I want this episode to feel like, I said, I want this to feel like people get to feel like what it's like to hang out with Gary Vee, not interview Gary Vee. I like that. Trading stories, dinner and drinks, vibe, conversation, not interview, the audience leaves feeling like they just chopped it up with Gary Vee. Not here's what I don't want to do. Interview him, ask him the same old questions about the same old topics, which will trigger him to just go into autopilot because nobody can help it if we do that. That's our fault. And the audience will feel like he's talking at them. So I wanted to say that out loud, mostly as a reminder to myself because it's my job to make that happen. But also because you're big on intention and being very intentional. And I wanted to actually reference one more thing about high school, which is I sent this to a buddy who had interviewed you on a different podcast. I said, any tips? Anything you would say that would help me out here? Because this is a big deal. Gary Vee is coming on the show. And I said, give me some advice. And he just said, he read what I wrote. And he goes, Brendan Warnacky. I didn't know who that was. He goes, I heard him say once that growing up, he didn't have anyone to talk about business with. He goes, your show is that for like half a million entrepreneurs. It's the person who you could just chop it up about business. They nerd out about business in the same way that you do. For him, that was Brendan Warnacky. I never heard this guy's name before. I guess his is your friend growing up. Ready for this? Ready for this? Go for it. You're going to love this. One minute. I'm going to show it to you visually. One minute. Let me show you the exact this is a WhatsApp at 12, which is when I came on. This is me replying to Brandon Warnacky, who right now is in Germany buying wine from my family's wine store. And I literally talked to him 13 seconds before I literally one second before I turned on the link to be on with you two. And so great, great call by your buddy. I met Brandon the first day of high school. We had homeroom together. I sold him some Hensley Bam Bam Moulin's rookie cards within the first week of meeting him, which feels very, very appropriate. And he was the kid that I did baseball card shows with. And somewhere around senior year of high school, I'm like, man, I really want Brandon to work with me because I knew I was going to build this big company for my dad's liquor store. He got a job with MCI World, whatever it was called at the time, the telecom company. And I was devastated. And then the business got smiled down on me. They went out of business, like actually out of business, like that and Ron fraud sock. And he hit me like six months into me starting. And he came over and I speak to Brandon, maybe more than anyone in my life. He's truly family to me in a way that like I feel about my brother and sister, AJ and Liz. And so he's a, I've got a lot of great stories with him. And we, you know, as any best friends, we recall them all the time. And some of them are just, we did a big How long, how long you've been working with them then since like your 18 or 20 or whenever, whatever high school ended? Yeah, 20. Well, it was a college when I wanted. So we've been working together since we were 22 some 48. So 26 years. And, you know, it's a, you know, what's cool about friendship is it's different than family, right? You choose it. And, you know, I get very emotional. It's funny. I really know how I feel about Brandon because the only time I get choked up is usually when I like the most often time where I like get emotional is if I'm like being honored at like a charity event. As you guys know, I put out a lot of stuff. One of the things that actually is very quiet in my life is my nonprofit work. I got very affected when I was coming up the game that I saw a lot of people that weren't great people using charity as like a makeup to like, like, like a reputation laundering. It's a really good way. I love that term. Sam, I've never heard that. That's exactly right, brother. And so I got very weird. I think I got so affected by that. I'm actually chat. I'm saying this out loud to challenge myself to be a little louder of what I do on pencils of promise or, or, you know, charity water or all these different things I'm doing because I do think it is I do recognize that inspires people to like consider more charitable work. But I for a long time was quiet about it. Anyway, not to sidetrack. When I would get an award or be honored at these dinners, I would be or in the wine business when I was getting awards. It's only on that stage when I'm thanking my family that I kind of get emotional only in that setting, not once in a while in a podcast, especially if I talk about my mom or dad. But Brandon gets me too. Like, I it's it's come up now a couple times in the last couple years. And so I love him deeply. He's the salt of the earth. He he's just a good dude. And it's been my best friend for a long time. And we've done a lot of baseball card shows together and a lot of selling wine together. It's been a lot of fun. Well, one of the things that me and Sam, that's kind of how me and Sam got together is basically he's my Brenda Warnke. He's the guy I can chop it up with about business and just nerd out about it. One of the things we do is always just what are you excited about? Like, what products are you seeing? What people are you seeing? What cool stories are you seeing that are kind of that you're genuinely excited about? And even though that didn't sound like a podcast, that's what this podcast became. It started off traditional interview show. And we did like, you know, 20 episodes like that kind of playing the part. And then all of a sudden one at one day, I just grabbed Sam on a Friday and we just started shooting the shit about like, dude, have you seen this? Or, hey, I've started using this thing. It's awesome. Or I think this is going to be big. And that became that's when the podcast actually took off. That's what I wanted to do. The same thing with you. Because you're you're always seeing, yeah, it's honestly, bro. That's the podcast I should be doing. Right? Like, I'm so third co host. Have you guys seen break the web? What's that? No, what's that? I like this thing. So I'm just going to go into it with you guys and jam as we're jumping. This app's got my attention. Trending topics on Twitter was so big for me back in the day when it was desktop only. I would look at it constantly. I felt like I was really on top of shit. And so this, you know, break the web is an app. I'm dude, they got a great tagline. So it's break the web.co, the internet's official scoreboard. Yeah, if you look at it again, like it's just what's trending right now. And it seems like the underlining tech is pretty damn strong. Like, like, you know how everybody loves to throw around AI or this and that. And you're like, if you're smart, you're like, there's just a collection of APIs or anything like this one's a little bit better. And like, I don't know, I've put on my home screen, which is not something I've done in a long time. Why? Dude, also the design of that was pretty sick. I like how they did that. Why did I put on my home screen, Sam? No, like why? Why do I like it? Well, yeah, I mean, it's like, I'm looking at it now. You just showed it to me. It was all the new stuff. I don't really pay attention to like yours. I saw the word Gaza, Trump, and like five of the words where they're important, but like, I don't I'm not going to like, yeah, I'm the same. It's ironic. First of all, great observation, brother. For me as well, like, honestly, something that's on my mind is everyone needs to consume less news because all it does is push fear and negativity. And like, it's just so scary, like how fucked up that is. So it's funny. Same, brother. I don't really click into that stuff. So right now it's brand new. And when I met with the founders, I only met with them for like 10 or 15 minutes. I asked them real quick, I'm like, can we get this categorized out? And they're like, yeah, that's on the roadmap. Like I just want I need pop culture and consumer trends. So like to me, I'm like, when I look at Madonna fan, I'm like, what is that? You know, Madonna mistakenly scolded a fan again, right now what they're what what's interesting though is it's a great indication of where we are in society. Like back to when Twitter trending topics in 2008, seven, excuse me, seven and seven, eight, nine, it was less political. And and it was really valuable. Like the reason I like it or the potential of it. And obviously, we're in an election season. So now this will get eaten up to your point, Sam, on this stuff. But it is an indication of the pulse. Like I'm always looking for what's the indication of the pulse of what people give a fuck about. Dude, so these guys, so it looks like it only has 90 reviews. Oddly, both of these guys used to work at a bakery. The CEO worked at Peeps Coffee. The other guy used to work at Specialties Cafe in Bakery. So they're both lovers of baked goods. And then they decided to launch it. It's three years old, though, but it's not popular yet. What so what are your predictions? I think it was something else three years ago. But my prediction is not even that it. So it's funny. There's no prediction back to shooting the shit to your point, Sean. I'm not overly like, Oh, break the web is going to be the best. The concept of date. So I have a new book coming out soon this year, right? I finally feel like I've synthesized what I actually do. Like if I do, what's it called day trading attention? Yeah, you know, like, like to me, Twitter long form video, I have a meeting today on it. Again, back to like Sean, great job of setting this up. Like I'm in full. Like let me give this audience everything I got at the second month. So long form Twitter, I think literally have a meeting today where I'm going to post as you know, Dustin, like we're going to post my 100 most successful YouTube videos on Twitter here over the course of the next couple of months. Try to stagger it a little bit because just very clear that Twitter is going to push it. Right. And so like when I think back to this, I don't know if that's going to work. I agree. They're pushing it, but I just don't find myself using it. Yeah, that's a great call. Sam. Like what I know is that I'm I never have an interest in guessing if something's going to work. I have an interest in executing on anything that might work and then dealing with the ramifications of the upside. Why guess when you can test for cheaper than it is almost cost to guess, right? Like it's not expensive to take your best of YouTube videos and have somebody repost. That's a easy way to learn. Because you know, you talk about day trading attention, right? All trading is mispriced assets. That's right. So where can you buy something that's worth more than? And I would argue that attention is the most mispriced asset right now that most impacts everyone. Right. The universal. Make that argument. Right. What's that Sean? That's to make that argument. So why is that? There is nobody that will ever listen to this that doesn't need attention as a currency to achieve what's in their stomach, whether they want to raise money for their PTA, be president of the United States, get more listeners to their podcast, sell their sneakers. They're the only asset class that I think is universal is attention. Even a parent trying to home parent to children need their kids to listen to them to be able to get the message across. The currency of listening is or consuming is profound. And we're living through the mass fragmentation of that. Right. If you think about let's use parenting was a lot easier to get your kids to listen when in 1954, 80% of families sat down and had dinner together for like an hour and a half and you did it. Right. And like so those parents were able to message in a very interesting way. Whereas now they still can and we have technology could set a tax or a Sam and Sean clip to your kids to get them to think of something. But there's also so much supply. Right. With the demand side being the same. There's only so many hours in the day. Now the human brain, I think has capacity to keep a lot more information than we think. Nonetheless, for me, more narrowly as someone who loves business and loves, you know, to think about it, you know, it doesn't matter what you're selling. And it doesn't even matter what you're saying until you first get their attention. And then everything is about what you're saying. What's interesting to me is I think of it in the acronym I use internally at Vayner X VaynerMedia is a pack platforms and culture. Right. And so break the web plays in culture. Right. Like there's two different currencies that I think about constantly or two different frameworks. One is platforms. What is what are the top 25 platforms that have people's attention doing? What do they care about from snap to Pinterest to LinkedIn to YouTube, even within themselves YouTube shorts differently than YouTube is collective of like 15, 20 places right that really have quote unquote the attention. What are they up to? How did their algorithms work? What are their features doing? And I think about them on a day to day basis. Right. And then and then I think about culture. Like what is the slang? What is what is the things of interest, the people of interest? Right. And then it becomes a framework of like what's overpriced and underpriced execution. So for example, I think Super Bowl is the most underpriced media in the world. It's very hard to get 130 million people to watch 30 seconds of a video and actually want to and pay attention to it. Right. So that's seven, eight million dollar vague. I think is great. The problem is the creative is the variable of success. Right. So the media might be a great deal, but if your 30 second video is forgettable or stinks, or you overpaid for making it, right? Verizon paid Beyonce to be in that commercial. If they paid her $500,000, I think they stole her. If they paid 40 million, I think they overpaid for her. I don't know what the number is. My guess is it's somewhere in between. But that is basically how my brain works and how I think about communication and marketing and brand building and perception changing and just the whole world. It's how I think about the world. Have you guys seen, let me tell you, let me ask you if you guys have seen this in terms of cool shit. So, uh, perplexity is awesome. Um, but they have this new thing with, I didn't see them talk about it a lot. It's called perplexity AI slash podcasts. They've come out with a daily podcast that's five to 10 minutes long. That's written by perplexity and it has beautiful background music and they've got this British guy. Have you ever seen those like planet earth videos where it's like, now we see the mother cheetah go out and throw. Yeah. They've got this voice that sounds exactly like him reading like the script and it sounds awesome. The voice is powered by this thing called 11 labs. Dude, I went to 11 lab, Sean. I uploaded a ton of our voice and I was like, fuck it. Let's just see if I can make a podcast. It's way, but it's like, it's the best thing I've ever heard. Have you guys seen that come out with this podcast and see the voices? If you ever want to see Sam speak Hindi 11 labs made a clip. They just translated the podcast auto auto dubbed it using the Hindi. Yeah. And it's phenomenal. By the way, it's something we've been working on for about a year. Like I'm, I think next year is the full year where like every single thing I do, every video, every language, like we're there. I haven't seen Sam. I haven't seen the podcast, but I just took note. Like I can't wait to listen to it. Like, look, that it's so good. And they've not made a big, this has not been like a big hoopla. They haven't done, I randomly came across it. I was listening to it. I'm like, I'm going to listen to this every day. This is great. It's David at Burrow telling me about like the news. It sounds awesome. Which language, which language you going to do? Should we do Hindi? Is that the one? I'm doing everything. Like, yeah, if you're going to do one, you might as well do all. Yeah. Just like, I just think that I also think like everyone's going to go after the big one. Like, for example, I get excited about Portuguese. I'm like, fuck it. Everyone's going to go to Mandarin and Hindi and like the big number, you know, I'm like, I'm just going to own Portugal and Brazil. Like, you know, but, but that's tongue in cheek. I think the reality is over the next three years, all of it's going to go down and cost so much that it won't even like the us in seven years are going to laugh that we ever had it just in one language. They won't even understand. They're like, dude, have you ever seen that talk that this guy Alex Schultz gave about Facebook's growth? He was the he was the top Facebook growth guy like earlier on when they created the growth team is him to math and the guy I think Javier who now runs it. And he's like, he put a chart up and it was a it was a YC, YC talk and he puts a chart up on the screen and he goes every like, there's a bunch of dots. He's like, you know, all these dots are feature releases and you can see one dot where everything starts growing right after that. He goes, anyone want to take with take a guess what that that dot is. People in the audience like photos, photo tagging. It's when you release mobile with you know, what is it? We don't know. And he's like, language translation, local language translation. He goes the biggest growth driver in Facebook's growth bar none was when we when we localized the service, which he's like was not easy. They actually I don't know if you know this Facebook had to do like a Wikipedia thing, because there was you know, there's 186 countries that they had to deal with. And so they were like, we need users to basically re translate the site for their local region. And they incentivized people to do that. And that's how they mass translated overnight. No other social network did this. And it took off. So that was the first time I heard about this. The second was when we did our basketball camp with Mr. Beast, which Gary, I invited you to, you got to come next time. Mr. Beast basically we host a basketball camp at his house and he did this presentation. He's like, he's like, here's one thing I'm doing that nobody else is really doing, which is every video I do, I now created channels and cheese everywhere else. And he's like, not only do I translate it, I hire like a voice actor who's famous in the country like like the Spider-Man of Brazil. He told me, Jimmy told me that whole thing several years ago. Like it's exactly right. But by the way, tell me about this basketball camp because I'm playing basketball tomorrow at 6am. Like this is how much I love it. I'm 48. Like I really should and I'm and I'm five foot eight. You'll fit right in. There's plenty of wheelchairs and I'm ready. I'm 90s Nick's fans. So no easy layups. Is that is that politically correct in this basketball camp? Yeah, you can hack your hardaway. It's all good. We, actually, I wonder if you do anything like this. So we do this thing where it's called Camp MFM was my first million MFM. So we were like, we like the idea of getting together like, you know, when you go to a conference, you end up having a good time. If you go speak somewhere, you end up having a good time. But there's kind of this dread in my stomach of like, fuck, you had another conference. Like I just don't want to do the boring. I just, I guess have a resistance of doing the same thing everyone else is doing in general. And so we were like, how do we get the benefits of going and networking without ever calling it networking or a conference or anything else? And so we created basically an adult summer camp. It was like, what if for a weekend, we just rented a house and in this case, we actually just stay at Mr. Beast's house now because he ended up wanting to come. And so we go to his house and then we bring in a trainer from the NBA. He treats us like we're, you know, washed up NBA players basically puts us through their program. And we just play ball all day. And there's no business talk during the day because it's all just like, how many competitive out of shape guys, 20 guys, that's it. So when is it small groups? We do it once a year. So what just happened, but it was big, we just like the founder of Airbnb, Mr. Beast, all these guys, Brian, Joe, Joe, the best Joe. I have an email from Joe that says, Gary, we're fans. We want you to look at our company. And it was Joe at air bed and breakfast.com. And I never saw it, you know, or maybe I did and just like, but I look at that email. I haven't known a separate laptop and I look at it once in a while just to like, I love it. I like, this is actually a fun segue back to chopping it up. If it was just us three and everyone's this where we're going. Yeah. Where do you guys sit on losing? So we just talked about basketball. So I just think about me going to this basketball thing. And like my favorite thing in basketball in pickup is to lose the first game. It is my favorite. And I talked about this on Steve Bartlett's podcast, like a billion fucking emails about this. There's something that just like the blood in my head, like everything transforms in my chemicals. And then everything in life, like everything stops. And the only thing that matters to me in the world is that we have to win game to. That's so funny. He said that when we did the camp, the same thing happened. The very first game I'm trying to be the host of the event. So I'm like, okay, yeah, yeah, you guys play. I'll sit out first. No problem. We get in. I'm like, I'm passing the ball. I'm like, oh, that's Joe Geb, let me not let him drive. I'm not going to try to hurt the founder of Airbnb or Mr. Beast. Oh, that was cool, man. You know, I see someone taking a video. I'm like, that's cool. That's going to be a cool clip that's going to go viral. Then I'm like, wait, fuck that. I'm in the clip. He's scoring on me. And I was like, he's no longer Mr. Beast. That's Jimmy. That's Joe. And now we're competing to win. And then the whole event got a lot more fun when it equalized. Correct. Everybody. All the job titles dropped. And it's basically who's here to win, who's here to play. And that's when it got real. It's why I love entrepreneurship where I was where I'm going with this is that email like excites me. You know, like, I'm like, yeah, eat it, Gary. Like, dude, that one would have been a bigger one for you than Uber, too. No, it wouldn't. Maybe, but no, because I was the they both probably believe it or not, this is how much startups were back then, they both would have been priced between four and eight million. That's crazy. Right? No, bro, I got into tumblers B round B series B, not Angel, not seed, not series A. I got into tumblers series B. This is actually it right here. This is my Twitter tumbler Facebook stock. I got into tumblers series B at a $14 million valuation. That's like 2006, seven, eight. It's just like years. By the way, back to that miss, miss priced assets again, right? Sean, Sam, this is actually a good insight. That was literally 2007 or eight, right? We're only talking 16 years ago. So like you guys are young dudes. So think 16 years ahead. How old will you be in 16 years, Sean? I didn't want to know 52, 50. I don't know. Right. Honestly, no bullshit. I don't know if you guys hang out with like 60, 70, 80 year old business people. Like I do a lot of that because it's the best. I mean, to me, the two extremes are the best, right? Hang out with the 17 year olds that are like shitting, listening right now, shitting on all of us, saying these fuckers are going to wait till they see what I'm going to do. And then 73 year olds who are like, just like the amount of 60, 60 forget, right? I think it's like literally children 70 and 80 70 and 80 to me. Just it's stunning to me how many 73, 75, 77 year old businessmen and women I know that go at it because they love it. It's still what they do. And it gets me excited because at 48 it's like, man, I'm still like, I'm in half time, right? Like I'm in like, it makes me, you know, I get excited about that. I wanted to ask you about that. So I think you and I kind of have similar backgrounds where it was like raised around like, like kind of a rough crowd every once in a while and still kind of have a little bit of that where like, I enjoy like doing like hoodrat shit every once in a while. And, but like, I've been, I've had some success and I'm hanging out also with like, you know, guys like, like, Sam's nickname on the pod is hose water because he's just no water fountains, baby. Just drink it straight out the hose. So he's Sam. I love to man, hose water was the best. The best dude. I drank out of the hose literally from 1982 to 1989. Dude, I peed in the backyard more than a pee in the toilet. They used to call me look my no hands like every day. So listen, I had a question. So you, so look, we're all three probably a little bit similar where it's like, we kind of like did a bunch of crappy stuff. And now, Gary, you're older and a little in further along in your career in terms of success than we are, but we've both done some interesting or we've all done interesting things where we're able to hang out with some of these guys who are like legitimate billionaires. I'm sure you're, I don't know if you are or not, but you're in that, you're in that ballpark. And I see with Michael Rubin and whatever, you know, you hang out with some of the, the shot callers of the world. What's been the, what do you think is the difference between the store owner who's doing like, you know, a retail guy doing half a million or a million dollars a year, the $10 million year business, the $100 million net worth person and the billion dollar net worth person. Do they all like, is it, is it, do they all have similar ish mindsets, just maybe luck or industry, they picked a right, a different industry, or they're just significantly more determined. They're significantly higher risk taking. Have you noticed any trends between the gap of six successful people because a million dollar net worth for a six year old who started a store, that's dope. Two things. Yeah, two things. It's, it's 1234. I still don't know why 1111 has everyone's attention and 1234 doesn't the one, two, three, four is just so cool. Anyway, should we make a wish real quick? I don't think we should start a trend and try to make 1234 matter for entrepreneurs. That's a really fun question, Sam. My brain, as you were asking it, goes in me, focused on one, two, three, four. Well, yeah, I just have to look over and see it. I always thought about 1234. I've always thought it was interesting that it has no pop culture relevance. I believe the first thing that goes through my mind on this question is risk tolerance and fear. Right? So I think it's fair. I just had an idea. 1234. I got to get it. I want, I got to use it. 1234 should be where you shoot your shot. I love that. When you see 1234, that's when you got to send that text. I think that's, bro, you got to send the email right there. That's, that's the idea for 1234. We can make this a thing. Can you get somebody to register like 1234.org? I feel like, you know, I don't want these hustler kids. Like the 13 year old me would listen to this and immediately register 1234. Dude, they always do that. Dot com. I think it's fear. I think, I think about my dad a lot. My dad, I think it's how people view their ability to go backwards. So I think that there's something very scary about my chemicals. And Sam, I've always felt this in you as well. It's funny that you brought it up. I don't know if you, I don't know you well enough to know this and I'm not even sure you're going to believe me when I say it, but I do think you have a good shot of understanding what I'm about to say. My favorite Rocky is Rocky six when he goes back to Philly with nothing. Sean, there's something so weird in me and it's almost like, am I sandbagging myself? Like I'd be, I'm going to be very vulnerable here. Like I don't view it as like I'm cool. I actually view it as I'm potentially flawed. Right. Like there's something in me that romanticizes being okay with it all falling down. I'm back in like Queens in a, you know, $400 a month apartment. The entire internet is like, see, he was fucking overrated. I told, you know, all the people that loved me, all the friends they have that don't love me are like, see your fucking guy was a loser. He fucked it up. He sucks. I don't know why I like that, but I believe Sam to answer your question. It's something to do with that chemical. I believe the people that I think you brought up some good stuff. I think a lot about if my dad had a supermarket instead of a liquor store, I would have taken that to way bigger heights because liquor was, you couldn't ship it. And you know, like there's a lot component. Yeah. There's a ton of serendipity. Like honestly, I think a lot about if my dad didn't want me to work in his store, I would have went to because I fell in love with a tech. I might have went to California and who the fuck knows what I've created in 95, 6, 7, 8, like could have had one of those Mark Cuban moments. I think about that or, you know, like, I think when you can sell, when you can, for all the, everyone who's listening, and if you have kids like this, if you can sell, you're in the game, right? Like if you can sell, you're, you'll never be like zero, right? And so what do you got here? Is one, two, three, four.com available? No, dude. One, two, three, four is owned by like a telecom. Yeah, that's what I figured. That's impossible. I like the one, like the one 37. Yeah, do that. Are you kidding me? Dude, I love that. I'm so pumped about this, bro. The funny thing, by the way, Ben, my guy, he texted us a screenshot of GoDaddy. It's 1234.org 15,000. He just said pull the trigger question mark. No, no, no, no. We're actually, this is a good one. I never think you should overpay for names because I think names are made. McDonald's. Dude, I agree. I agree. Right, Sam? Like, but you know who disagrees? Fucking Darmesh. Darmesh. I know. I know. Dude, I've been with him multiple times. So Darmesh founded HubSpot, which bought my company and I've gotten close to them. He's like, he's like, dude, I bought chat.com or chat.com today. I'm like, why? He goes because it was available. I was like, what are you going to do with it? He's like, I'm not sure. I'm going to figure something out, but I paid eight figures for it. Yeah, look, he's smart. He knows like that. You know, look, as long as.com, I mean, to me, the scary thing for, let me take a step back, not go too fast. He's smart enough to know he could probably flip that because it's a very, very, very big deal. On the flip side, there is a little concern for me of what happens when this no longer becomes the remote control of our society. Right? Like I'm very fascinated by 20 years from now. Talk about 16 years ago on Tumblr, 16 years from now. If you told me that 16 years from now, we live in a predominant VR world, I would be like, maybe like I can see that possibility. Right? You could see that it's pushing in a direction. I don't think it's going to end up being these Apple pro Google, Google Glass, Snap, the Facebook thing, Quest. My intuition is that it's going to have to be much more lightweight, but I never underestimate the human being. I'm positive somebody's going to make the contact lenses that work like this. And then we're off to the races because now back to the way I think about day trading attention. This no longer houses the attention. Now it's housed here. Whoever controls that paradigm wins big. And then all of a sudden this dot com even matter in that. Is that how the UI UX works? Because dot com didn't matter at all in 1990. Dude, that's how I feel about SEO businesses right now. Well, that's exactly what happens. If it's chat, GPT and Google should give you the answer. The intermediate never did search. When I started the company 14 years ago, everyone's like, what the fuck? Why don't you do search? And I was like, first of all, I thought if I built a very big company, I'd be able to M&A search if I wanted to add it. Right? It was already established. I grew up on search the decade, the 15 years before. And so here's a good one for the kids. If you're building towards the future, if you're capable, remember that you can always buy the current. And that's how I thought about search. I was going to master social in O's nine. And I felt like social is going to eat up search anyway. And I think it's starting to happen now. Like searches in a weird spot, like Google's in a weird spot. Like in the great spot in some ways. But yeah, I think search is definitely a different world. Like if you're business, I actually spoke to somebody Thursday who is really getting hurt because he was one-dimensional on search. And I, you know, that's such a fear of mine that if you sell your stuff via email, via your podcast, via social media content, via search, you must develop into a Swiss army knife. Because if you're just a fork, if you're just one-dimensional, you're going to get caught. Hey, Gary, let me ask you about that. You were saying a second ago, you're like, I'm not afraid to go back. Yes. Do you? So like the way that I run my personal finances is I've got like my safety net. So I've got this like account that has enough money that I'm good forever. Same. And so that's in Vanguard and bonds. And so like, I've never touched that. And then anything above that amount, I'll bet it. Same. And I'll like start new shit. Same. And so you're talking about like, you don't mind going back, but it sounds like that's not exactly how you run your finances. So do you have like a safety net and then anything above that you're like, yes, bet it, bet it, bet it. Or do you just use profits from Vayner to make these bets? How do you, how does that work? Yes. I have, I'm going to be, I'm comfortably transparent. My, I'm very fortunate. So my zero is a million dollars, but that's it. That's it. Same. Wait, so you only keep a million in your like liquid portfolio. That's your safety net. No, no, no, I have other things like I have money in all sorts of places, but I have this one place that has one million dollars and literally everything else is in play. Wow. Now, Sean, I want to paint a very clear picture here because I don't want to create hyperbole. I haven't bet everything on everything, but if I ever feel the way I felt about Facebook in 2007, when I put, I had $236,000 in savings, I put 200,000 into Facebook, right? If that ever happens again, like I'm willing to bet very large because that feeling, similar to the feeling I felt about the internet when I saw it in 95, similar to the feeling that I felt about Friendster MySpace, that little like, oh, the internet's changing. I look for those moments and, you know, again, I'm willing to go big, but to your point, Sam, like it's not like I'll go to zero, zero, you know, a million dollars is a lot, a lot of money. And especially if you're capable, if you're capable, like, I don't know, like I feel very confident. And a reputation. Yeah, correct. I also think about face off, like where you change, like I have like these very like deep Sean, it goes back to like wanting to win a basketball game. Like I think it's more, I think the worst thing for my love of entrepreneurship that's happened is what Sam just said. I no longer can do it without anyone knowing. It's a whole different game. It was so fun when people didn't know. What you're saying reminds me of, well, two things. I think it's super interesting that your answer to what's the difference you've seen in the mindset in psychology was who's willing to go backwards. And almost what you said was you almost kind of crave. There's like a romantic idea about going back, which I like a lot. I resonate with that a lot. It's almost like there's TV shows I wish I could go watch again for the first time in the same way. Like there's no greater feeling than going from not making it to making it. Once you've made it and you try to make more, it doesn't have the same thrill, adventure, satisfaction, self respect. You have to almost go into different games. Like I worry about that. Like I don't let me phrase I don't worry about it, but I sense that there's a day where I actually I talk a lot about never retiring and dying at my desk. And then there's an equal part of me that realizes that I'm very wired in a way where I just might make wake up at 79 and be like, you know what, like I'm done. I'm just going to focus on my grandchild's like, like I just, I don't know. I have like, I think we're all very like, I think we underestimate how long life is. You know, I think we underestimate our capacity to make hard decisions to different directions that we can't see along the way. Then there's back to luck. And you know, I mean, look, we live through a lot of prosperity. Everyone, the three of us have gotten very fortunate of where we live during what era, right? Like there's a lot going on in the world. Like, you know, there was people in the roaring twenties talking shit like this over dinner. And then, you know, a very challenging 30 years punched them in the face, right? All seemed so great in 1927. America was on its way. It's going to be awesome. And then, you know, massive world war and atomic bomb and Korea and Vietnam and social unrest. And so, you know, all these things are like fun to think about. It's like fun to like romanticize about the future. But I will say this, I'm actually going to ask you guys this. What do you think your personal relationship is with gratitude versus taking for granted? I changed on that. Once I actually sold my company and was financially free and then like two weeks after the sale of the company, the CEO got into a life threatening accident. And I was like, oh, that could have ruined my deal. And like, everything like this all could have been ruined. And then I like hit like some threshold. I'm like, dude, I did not work any harder than anyone else who else like who have done some of things but failed. This is 100 luck. And I'm so grateful that I like it just has worked in my way in many ways. I feel like I am the luckiest guy around. And it just seems like I'm so gracious for the luck that I have. That's kind of it's changed to more sort. I've just been gifted this and I'm so lucky and I'm thankful. Good for you, Sam. Sean, what were you out with it? I have a different. So to me, I'm like, all right, I think people make a mistake. They're grateful in the macro. So if you say to somebody, you're like, what are you grateful for? Almost everybody. My family, my health. And to me, this is the I'm not saying they're wrong. Obviously, those are great things. But it's sort of like when a company says our values are integrity and excellence. It's true but not useful. It basically has me leaves no register. And so I try my focus is how do you be grateful in the micro? Meaning, can I be if if I'm in an elevator, can I find something in that moment? Can I get a rep a practice rep of gratitude in that? Because that actually shifts me when I can take a breath, be grateful for the fresh air, I can look at something my kid is doing and how silly they are and just in that moment, find something. And if I could do that, you know, 10, 15 times a day, that is, you know, I think that's how I'm like, yeah, I think that's how micro and macro and micro work together. I really do think of it as being alive. Like just thank you for that. I'm not that I didn't die last night. Right? Like, and I to your point, I think when your macro is that, I think you're actually I think I love what you said, you're just talking about applying. Yeah, that's how I apply it. Exactly. That's my that's my relationship with that. That's right. But like, if you're getting to that place, that's how I live. I'm like, like, literally, like, it's like a nice sunny day in New York today. And I'm just like, yeah, like, that's awesome. Right. You know, like, like just choosing positivity, like, I think people have been so sucked into, like, focusing on what they don't have or what's not going well. I mean, Naval has an amazing definition of happiness. By the way, I don't have even heard this. He goes, happiness is what you feel when you don't feel like anything's missing in your life. Yeah. Right. People think happiness is something you got to achieve, something you got to go create, something you got to get. It's like, you know, you think you didn't accumulate things to have happiness. And he's like, actually, it's just when you're not focused on what's missing. Well, that's right. I think I think simplicity is just so fucking. Fuck, man, it's so right. Like, you don't your your your life is not simplistic. I mean, I don't I don't know what your personal life is like. I don't know if you have multiple homes and what you own, but your professional life is not simplistic. You've got no 10,000 my my my professional life is not simplistic. But but but it is for me meaning like I like playing like this goes back to the relationship with losing. It's not simplistic, but it is. Let me explain what I mean by that. Let me think of a good example. Something not working out for me in business, whether it's in the micro of like day to day Vayner X land, or if it's in the micro like an investment or something I put a lot of time and effort into that didn't materialize. I view that like losing the first game of a pickup game. Sam, when I I'll tell you why it's simplistic, I I'm not attached to my professional success or who I am. I'm like in a very weird place with my winning and losing and my Gary V of it all. Like I I care so much, but it's a game. My professional life is a game. Like I like it. I don't I don't I don't want to be unhappy. Like I fight for happiness too much. And I think it is in the simplicity. You're right. The day to day is chaotic. There's meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting right. But I like it. This is why I'm bringing up the pickup game. I like it. I like juggling 17 balls. And I'm not upset about the 13 that fell on the ground and broke. And more importantly, I'm not worried about the people who are watching me juggle boo when the ball breaks. That I think is massive. Yeah, but when Theo Vaughan makes fun of you, it's pretty hilarious. Yeah, but like to me, that was so good. Did you see that video? Yes, I did. But that's so great. Like that is like the ultimate like because I love Theo. Like like to me back to like where we came from, Sam. I'm like, my God, like I've gotten to a place where someone is epic as Theo Vaughan or any other. The comedians. Tim Dillet. Like I love these guys. You know, like Jerry V. I think like I'm always fascinated when people struggle with a comedian razzing. Like I think it's like you've that's like such flattery. Yeah, that was awesome. It was awesome. I saw that I was like, oh, the guy look up to he's he's crossed over to mainstream. It's awesome. I'm Sean. What were we going to say? Well, what I asked two questions. One, you showed those stock certificates on the wall. Speaking of winning. I saw, okay, you invest in Twitter and 09 Slack pre IPO. I think the liquid death guy used to work with you or you really VaynerMedia the day before he started liquid death Facebook pre IPO. I'm curious. What was what investment was the best investment for you? What paid off in terms of you've made a bunch of bets right? Facebook? I haven't sold one share yet. Oh, shit. That's insane. But that goes back. That goes back insanely good. Yeah, that goes back to jockey over horse. I tell all my friends. Like who get into investing? I'm like, man, like what have you learned? I'm like, what I've learned is when I only invested in the person when I'm when I've hit this new state where like, I'm really trying to be obsessed with the person and the idea. And if either one isn't like an A plus, then I'm like, eh, right? You said and or or and right. But if I and the horse, that's right. But if I or it fully person that idea, what years you do that? Did you do that deal Facebook? Like 2007? Oh my god. So I mean, I don't even know what that you'd be up 400 times. I don't know. I mean, a lot a lot. 100 X at least. I want to get your rapid, rapid take because I know you've one of the things we do on this pod is we kind of we love anecdotes and also little little insights on people that we think are wired in an interesting way. Maybe not even the way we want to be wired. Right? Like, yeah, we think Elon's really interesting. We don't think he's perfect. We think this bunch of things he does that are crazy. We think this bunch of things he does that are epic. There's no there's no perfect. Right? Yeah. Fair enough. So I'm curious, you've bumped into or have studied or have an opinion on any of these people. So I want to go rapid fire. See, if you have something, give us give us like either an opinion or story. Yeah. So is this from outside observation or if I met them inside observation? Either one or if you have nothing, you could say pass. I don't have anything on them. All right. So first one I want to do is Zuck. You've talked about Facebook and the Jackie. Give me Zuck. Dude, I think he's uncomfortably underrated. Like, he's the only person that I met back in 07. Like in this era now, I think it's getting more obvious, but he understood attention. He literally tried to buy Twitter. He bought Instagram. He bought WhatsApp. He tried to buy Snap. He just understood attention was the only asset. And and he's so nice. He's a nice kid. Like, like he's just a very simple, nice kid. I'm happy with the way things are going for him a little bit right now. Like people can see how doofy he is. Like you see him like in the corner of the UFC thing. You're like, this is just a nerdy kid who's like, you know what I mean? Like, and he doesn't give a fuck. Now, people will think it's because he's got a trillion, but like it's just he's just like a dentist's son from cadet. Like he's just a fucking nerd with no bad intent. Who fucking spent his childhood coding, which put him in a position, right? He put in the hours. I'm a fan. And I think he's a I think he's a very good operator. And the reason I've never sold a shared Facebook is I've been committed for a long time in this in my own mind, which was I'll never sell until he's gone. Logan Paul. I think Logan is really interesting. So he's so do you know that Logan Paul was starting to emerge very little on Vine when VaynerMedia for Virgin Mobile did a campaign called Finding the Next Vine Star. You guys kind of discovered him, right? Yeah, when he was I think he had like 15 or 18,000 followers. It was crazy. And by the way, full disclosure, Jerome Jar, who was one of the 10 most followed people on Vine, who was my partner, Jerome and I launched the first influencer agency called Grape Story back in 13. He was the one who said, you know, he he let me pick from three people. I think all three of them got big. But I think Logan is, you know, he grew up in the limelight, right? You think about like what happened in Japan or all this stuff. Like it's tough. These kids are you think about child stars when we grew up, we all knew that like child stars would be fucked up, right? And now I think like everyone's going through that the limelight is hard. So I think Logan is well intended. I think he he's very entrepreneurial, like very entrepreneurial. And I you know, I I've always thought of him as like a marquee bark or a fresh prince or the rock, meaning I always watched him from afar. And as I got to know him a little bit, I was like, okay, this kid is Logan Paul today. Just like marquee Mark was marquee Mark before he was Mark Wahlberg. Just like the fresh Prince of Bel Air, you know, what Will Smith was before he was Will Smith. I've always thought that Logan would cross over. And he has obviously with WWE in a lot of ways. And I think that will continue. Like if you told me Logan is like an action star. And it's like at the like the way John Cena was at the Academy Awards last night, like is Logan doing that in 15 years? And like that makes sense to me. That's how he's wired. Sam, he's only 28. Logan. He's only 28 years old. The dude basically like 14 or whatever, like one he won in the social media game. Now he and then think about the pivots, right? But both him and Jake, but the thing about the pivots, now he's got impulsive. So he's got the podcast where he's super chill. It's the opposite of crazy vine prankster guy. He pivoted to like, he's the guy asking questions. He's inquisitive. He's curious. He's got like, you know, the popular podcast goes WWE becomes a champion in WWE creates Prime, which is going to make him a billionaire by the time he's 28, 29 years old now, because Prime is probably going to be worth tens of billions. If you know, they did, I think 2 billion in sales last year. I mean, this world like Prime is definitely like a two depending on the time they decide to trade it. It's two, three, four, five, six, seven billion. That high. I talked to Mr. Beast and he was like 20 billion is where Prime is going. Like there's, there is basically just the, just the straight up trajectory of it. That would be very, very, I mean, that's like, look, I never underestimate Jimmy's foresight because he's great. I've known him a long time, but just being in M&A at CPG levels, my intuition is that they won't be patient enough to get to that big of a number. Right? Like, like it's just... Well, the beauty is they're not operating. The other guys are... I know. No, they got a pretty killer operator. Yeah, they're pretty young too, though. Yeah. And more importantly, like I said, shit changes. Like everything's ha ha ha until it's actually in front of you. It's all kicks and giggles. And we're going to 20 until you fly to Atlanta and Coca-Cola actually offers you 5.9 and you've got to sit there as KSI and Logan and those guys and say, okay, if we say yes, because you know what they're going to say, you guys are like this. So you're going to really understand what I'm about to say. You know what they're going to say? They're going to say, huh, huh. We could do this right now. And then in 24 months, start anything in a shampoo or a deodorant and sell it to Duff. Like, so I think it's, um, it'll be interesting to see how long they hold their breath. And don't forget one bad year. You guys know this, how businesses work. One bad year takes a lot of leverage off the table in a negotiation. And so, you know, they'll be thoughtful about that because no matter what you are, once you saturate distribution, and don't forget they're selling on something that's more like supreme, they're selling on cool. Cool. Right. Kids are buying it literally to drink it for the status symbol, like a fashion brand. And that can only last so long. Ze Kaviricis were only cool for so long. That's the point. That's the point. The mean you're not. I'm not. Ze Kaviricis reference was for all the Jersey boys that grew up in the late 80s, early 90s. People will be like, they were the hottest jeans pants. If you didn't wear your Ze Kaviricis, you were nothing. I didn't have them, by the way. I was in my great life, but they were fucking it. Compared prime to Jinko jeans. Uh, what are you going to say, Sean? Well, I asked you a bunch of names that are, you know, basically names that people know. I'm curious. Who do you think is dope? Who are you learning from? And who are you kind of admire? Who do you admire? Who do you learn from? Who are you inspired by? Because, okay, a lot of people are inspired by Gary Vee. That's a great question. I'm a little weird on this one, but I'm glad I brought up break the web. I'm like inspired by the collective more than an individual. The field. Yeah, I love the field, brother. I just like I spend almost all of my time on the collective. So I don't even have the allocation of time. I also am very inspired by the following person. Show me the person that's currently living through massive adversity. Like somebody's list. I'll tell you somebody who's 10 times more inspiring to me than I think I am or deserve to be to others. Show me the kid that's listening right now, whose father passed away from a stroke. He's 16. He's got three younger siblings. And his mom has to now work two jobs. And he's holding it down for the fam, right? He's literally a sophomore in high school. And he's basically the father figure now for three siblings. He had to quit the fucking football team because he's also like, like I am the son of two parents who lost a parent before they were 15. And and back to gratitude. I think I got really fucked up by being scared that my parents were going to die, my whole childhood. But it kind of converted into this gratitude framework that's insane. It makes me unstoppable, you know? And so yeah, for me, it's less Bezos or Elon or, you know, you know, Oprah or anything. It's it's much more like someone none of us know that is really in it. Like that bodega that bodega owner energy. That that stuff I grew up with and I fuck with it. But that person I think has it lucky back to earlier our simplicity like owning your own little business, living within your means, like, like that's fucking kind of chill. It could be really epic. It doesn't put you on like this podcast, but it's like a great life in a lot of ways. And I see it a lot. I lived it. What building my dad's business from 22 to 34. I not that person, the one that's like, back to your point, Sam, the the spin of the wheel really created real adversity. I'll say it again, they're a sophomore in high school. They're they're good at school. They're they're they really love football. Like things are going well, sudden passing of their father. Now they've got to be the father for their three siblings. Their their mom is taking on an extra job like true adversity, like true end or do and Sean to finish off that sentence. Who admire? I admire and not a peep of complaining. There's a very small group of kids that get that and they just convert into leader instead of woe is me or rebelling. I admire that level of tenacity and grit and accountability and fucking like, fuck it, like this is I got this. This is it's on me. I got to put this shit on my shoulders. I'm going to do this for my three siblings. Like I admire the fuck out of that kid. I had I wrote down a quote when I was doing the research for this that I think is is exactly what you're talking about. You go forget rags to riches. Some people are just rags to rags just so that their kids have a shot at rags to riches and I respect the shit out of that. I love that quote. That was amazing. Thank you for finding that I really meant I'm really affected by that. Like Sam really hit it on the head. Like, I hate the word luck because I think that people weaponize it against people that have worked really hard. But I but I believe in serendipity and luck quite a bit because it's just the way like I was born in the Soviet Union. Like I got lucky to get out of there when I did. If I didn't, I would have come to this country in 1991 when it fell. I would have been 1617. I'd sound like Ivan Drago on these podcasts. I like it would have been all different. And you know, I just I I just really do admire people who I really do think entitlement and lack of accountability has become a disease in first world countries in 2024. And I just really admire people who play the other way.
