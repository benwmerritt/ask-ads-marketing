## Transcript
How do you approach a challenge? I like challenges. One of the reasons I love being a Jets fan is that they lose a lot. And I'm much more into the journey. I look at challenges as the narratives of my career. Whether this is egotistical or a nice thing, I'm not quite sure, but I do think of things in the body of my work. The book will be very boring if everything's easy. You need the arc. When I see challenges, I don't think that you get to have the luxuries that come along with being a leader or CEO or founder. If I want this, if I want the attention, if I want the fruits of the things that come along with it, I have to be respectful that the challenges come along with it. When they come to me, I really kind of... I'll paint you a picture. I genuinely love the scene in the movie, the cliche scene where the person gets punched in the mouth, turns, blood comes out, spits out his tooth, and then looks back at the other person like, now what? That's how I think about challenges. I weirdly want... I almost... Can I get weird with you for a sec? I even think sometimes I fabricate challenges because I enjoy that more than the easy sailing. And so, mom, I think any true purebred entrepreneur has the stomach for challenges. And so for me, it's just part of the equation. Thank you for watching.
