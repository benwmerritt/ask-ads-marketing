So listen, I'm really excited to connect. I'm excited, but this is one of my singular biggest investments of my career. I've heard prior to this call that you have some level of context for me, which is good because then I think we'll be talking kind of on the same language. I genuinely believe in this space remarkably. When I started looking under the hood of what they were building and what their ambition was, it is 100,000% clear to me by spending time with all the executives that I do, CMOs, CEOs, that the value of, if they could deliver on this message, they've got the product potential, right? And they've got the thesis, and there's a real lack of competition if they can actually deliver on this mission in a world where I really know that there's nobody ahead of them, and I know that relationships with are absolutely going to make it acquisition in this space. It's just a big play. As a quarterback, I'm coming out, you haven't done the quarterback shit yet. You just haven't done it. No, I haven't. All right, I'm just giving you to take my career and take it to the next level. Because my seven-year-old daughter can go on Google and tell you which camp, which trainer, which right thing you need to do on a football level, and because it's in your fucking heart and your arm and your brain and all the other stuff, I have to execute for you, and there's been plenty of guys who, plenty of guys who were supposed to go on the first round, I follow football hard. I know they're just practice squad, so this is my life. I just know the stories. I know the stories. I think the reason a quarterback comes with us, look, does the number one or number two pick and the NFL draft next year, some of the guys that are projected, are they going to come with us? As egotistical as I feel right now, I'm not naive, and I recognize that some of the biggest agencies in the world are going to have the tactics. They've probably got them locked up already. So I'm a big boy. I think that, to be very frank, and you haven't been in a meeting with me like this yet, Quince, I don't want to sell them on me. I really don't. I'm empathetic. You've been, you know, you've been courted since you were 13, right? Your parents have been hoping you'll never get hurt and everything's going to be okay, and now you're finally here. You made it through, and what are you going to take this crazy high risk on a startup? But I took risks on startups. I bet my hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars that's all I had in my bank on Facebook, it worked. And so the same reason that I was able to make tens of millions of dollars on that, I think that every kid that signs with us is going to disproportionately get our attention, our execution, and then what's going to end up happening is a lot of these kids aren't going to be the ones that sign with us because they're not smart enough to. And you know what, they actually may be smart enough to. Their handlers aren't, their uncle, you know, their dad, their mom. So I'm not even worried about getting a top five quarterback in this, this draft, it's not happening, it's not really happening overall, maybe one guy. Next year's draft, I don't expect to happen, but in the, what is that, 17, 18, in 2019 draft, we will have the number one pick overall if it's a quarterback and we'll have them. Because by then, it will be clear as day that VaynerSports has fundamentally changed the game in a way because we're going to have 38 guys who are going to be like, okay, this is a different shit. And I've got, I'm friends with NFL stars who are pinging me. I just, I'm staying away from everything because I don't know the rules, you got to wait till the block out, you know, I'm like, I'm like, you know, so I'm just staying passive. I'm staying in the weeds a little bit like a Cobra. I know nobody's paying, I don't think any of the big boys are paying attention to me. Well, I'm hoping they're not, I'm trying to stay a little more, this interview might fuck me up a little bit, but I'm planning on jumping out of the fucking grass and doing my thing. And so, you know, it's a foregone conclusion. I'm excited about it, but these kids are making their entire life's decision. And then you learn bullshit like, wait a minute, so you're telling me that if you're actually in the bull series and you're going out and you haven't really talked to any agents behind the scenes or a little bit or kind of sorta, what, you've got four weeks to make the biggest decision in your life of who you're going into business with before the, like, shotgun weddings, like, there's a lot of broken shit and I plan on changing it. Proud of you, man, really am. So what are you guys up to now? Chilling? You gotta go to the road? No, I gotta go to this holiday party and then the road. Alright, ready? You know where we're going? No, I'm glad you made the schlep. That's the grind, I love it. You know, I trust your opinion that he's actually could be a player, but, but, I know for fact he might go seventh round. Yeah, he knows, definitely. He might not get drafted. Could happen, it depends what he has to, like, but that's why we're like, okay, if we're gonna do this, we're doing it. Uh, my name is Glenn Irie. I'm Lee Shan. Jordan. Horton. I'm Desiree. I'm Lizzie. Jesse Hutchison here, counter-director at the Chattanooga office. I'm Jankove. I'm Molly. Kate. Man of the Road tab. Chris Logsson, I am the creative director, down here at the VaynerMedia Chattanooga office. A lot of you know me, or know a lot about me, and some of you may know, actually, not a lot of you know this, that I basically married my wife somewhere within the first four minutes of our first date, and called her after our date as she was going upstairs to our apartment, and started with the opening line of can you believe this is it? So, I also, some of you know this, Mickey, I think you were in the room. I walked into a meeting that I think we were like, orging some department, and told AJ, oh yeah, I bought, I kinda accu-hired an entire agency. We now have an LA office. I also, basically where I'm going with this, and I'll cut it short, is I've made a lot of big decisions in my life very, very, very quickly, and I did that with this town. My favorite part of 2016 was just being down in Chattanooga, building, you know, this team up, and just the camaraderie that's down here. Winning a new business is always fun, especially when it's a small, small office. If I had to think about my top memory of 2016, I'd say it's kind of a collection of watching our team members grow, kick-ass at work, and really kind of roll through it together. And if I had to think of anything that I'm really excited for in 2017, it's crushing it again, growing this team, getting some more business, and even doing it bigger and better. As I sat there and watched this scene tonight was, this was another one of my very, very, very good, intuitive, quick decisions to watch what this unit has become, to watch how this unit has absorbed what I thought was a really fun Vayner birthday thing that we all hung out with. The only time I've been to a sporting event where I did not watch one second of the event, and the newcomers that have joined the team along the way since then, I'm very, very proud of what's going on here, and all of you also know that I do not micromanage. I put people in charge. I watch you. I watch you guys grow. There's so many people here that are pieces of this. It's not just a Mickey story. It's a collective story, and I'm very, very proud of all of you, and I'm very, very, very thankful to... I wish all of you in your life, and you feel it a little bit when you become parents, and you feel it when you become managers, and you feel it when you've mentored somebody. But, you know, when you start getting to some level of scale of having people follow your vision, and you create an infrastructure and a company of this size, it's... my biggest fear was always the thing that I always told you I was never scared of, because I'm really not, but it's a fake fear, but I actually wouldn't call it a fear. It's the thing that is always on my mind, which is at scale, how far away do we get from the soul and the heart that AJ and I set out to do with this company? There is nothing closer to the heart of what this organization is than this office right here, and I thank you very much for that. I think next year is going to be a remarkable year. You'll hear this tomorrow for me, but I have a very, very distinct vision of what needs to be a stunning portion of the amount of work we do here, and I think it's going to excite all of you, and I think it will be some great work here, and Mickey and I have been working very hard on setting that up mentally, and with some of the pieces and decisions moving forward, I think it's going to be extremely bright for this amazing office, and I'm very, very honored to be part of the Chattanooga community and what's happening in this amazing state, and I'm just very, very happy tonight, and so thank you. I have a 6 a.m. work out in New York City, so I'll be leaving shortly, but I hope you guys have a wonderful holiday, take advantage of it, rest, I appreciate the hustle. My big thing is that I work out. I'm going to listen from the end to the beginning. Vlog one day, just vlogging your Uber driving in. I say you need to change, oh, you tell me it's a phase. Why don't we listen like we used to? I'm traveling as if like, you know, when the meeting, love you. Take care of yourself, thank you. We're not in control of creativity for us. Obviously, they can do their measurement, but it's on their terms, their measurement, so I told her my skin in the game was not running it profitably, deploying my team, us, like a lot, you know, my content team, because I'm going to micromanage it, so our skin in the game is that. And open to anything they come up with that I would approve. Got it. Let's go. Long day, headed back to New York City from Chattanooga, and 6 a.m. workout, landed Jersey at midnight, 12.30. It's a grinder. D-rock, you're so fancy. You're always fine private, D-rock. Booz is shit. Booz, Booz rock. I'm trying to get cozy as shit. That was a hill? Somebody tweeted a Gary Vee and a Daily Vee and shill. That was laughing. I couldn't care less about the distance. I couldn't care less about the distance. I couldn't care.
