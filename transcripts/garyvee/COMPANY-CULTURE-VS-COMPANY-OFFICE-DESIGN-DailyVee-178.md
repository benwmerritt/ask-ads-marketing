I'm from mom and casual Got a lot of guys like gravel Coming back around like a lasso Macro, like a vision boy I see with clarity I hustle like my name is Gary Vee Job of motherfuckers, I've been telling you I'm trippin' like I'm giving a pedigree That meanin' I'm special, my specialty I'm puttin' in the work till I'm dirtin' the earth I'm movin' furniture to tackle Hey guys, so this is our new feature for Mondays as we continue to hack Last week we tried to do You know, the weekend review This week what we're doing And by the way, this is just because I'm trying to really think about the work-life balance thing Obviously, BizDev Sunday is a lot of fun to be on Sunday So I will film that in my work out on Saturday But Sundays I'm not gonna probably film But instead what D-Rock and I and Team Babin are gonna do Is we're gonna focus on Putting a full clip from the week That we didn't show in its entirety Where I set it up as well here And so this week's clip was an interview I did Which was actually about work spaces Right? Like, like, foosball tables and like Snacks, show the snacks D-Rock Snacks and that all that stuff All the cool stuff Facebook and Google does Like, what are these couches and chairs And all these things mean to the production of a company I had a pretty interesting take on it Here it is I think they feel at home because I feel like I'm a parent And I think all my actions I mean, the room they live in And the psychology I deploy And the listening and the talking You know, I think people only feel at home When the parents make it feel at home I think it's a job of every CEO Yes, businesses can start actually giving a fuck About people instead of how much money they make Because a funny thing happens when you give a fuck about people You end up making more money I mean, I don't think it's unfortunate Those companies should then make what is appropriate And all the people that work there Most places in the world have some level of freedom They're more than welcome to start their own company Or work somewhere else This whole narrative of these businesses or shit Yes, do I want businesses to care about people more? Yes, it feels nice and it feels right And it's a legacy I want to leave And I think it'll actually make them more money But the employees aren't being shit This is not slavery Right? Like, be a... I mean, everybody has to be accountable This isn't just the man is fucked up Or the business is fucked up The employees fucked up if they're in a shit situation Instead of going home at five o'clock and drinking beer And complaining, go on fucking job listings Interviews, networks, find a different fucking job You know, to be very frank You know, the foosball tables and the... I think we have a hockey thing because I like that The good cafeteria, the free granola I just think that's horseshit Those are tactics that bullshit companies do To try to make people... The people are inspired and feeling good Because they feel safe And they feel like they can grow They feel like safe and they feel like they can grow That's the shit that matters Not fucking free Cheerios on fucking Tuesday Or like inspiration I like putting up signs and I do that shit But I don't think people have vain or are happy and killing it Because I have a picture of me saying your funeral matters That's up there because I like that You know, not because that's there as a tactic It's all religion They have to feel safe and they have to feel like they can grow You know, and that's it And like, everything out... You're not going to trick people by having 24 hour massages In a fucking room You know what I mean? Band-aids Everybody's got band-aids Nobody gives a fuck about your hard-word floor Or in a soda fountain machine They're nice But I'm... And we have them But I'm not the one who's ever making that happen That's other people in my company that decide those things I have no interest in band-aids Shit works because I give a fuck I mean, look bro, I'm going to give you the shittiest interview ever I can feel Right? Because it's going to be the same stuff Like, good, good, good Because every other interviewer is going to give you bullshit answers Here's the real answer Speak to people Talk to them Care about them Your first ten employees are the foundation of your company They're the steel beams and the concrete At the bottom of your building that nobody will ever see They need to be into you and you need to be into them I mean like, and the only way you get to that is speak the truth Communication, the truth Communication, the truth, communication I think the whole... Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's okay The ultimate, for me, the holy grail of design and office space and things of that nature Is that it is not a tactic to cover up the issues of the company Got it? I don't want it to be a pretty dress You know, like, and you're at a shape underneath Right? Like, it needs to speak to the truth You know, which is, you know, if it's fancy, great You like fancy things, good I mean, I'm not against anything Everybody has to do them But it can't be a front You can't be charming at the bar and a shithead boyfriend You know what I mean? Good, I'm glad it does Awesome, man, good luck My pleasure, take care I've got surprises for you
