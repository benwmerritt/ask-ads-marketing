Thank you Sure I'm gonna try man Real pleasure. Thank you. Thank you Hi, how are you? Thank you. Thank you That's because that kind of sequence hasn't happened yet Just landed in Denver going to two client meetings and then an internal meeting with video production and creative So that should be productive. Also just put out a pretty good post about the podcast A lot of feedback for people that aren't able to keep up with videos as a new job or new kid or things of that nature So Make sure you get on the podcast train every format not just iTunes SoundCloud and Spotify iHeartRadio Overcast Stitcher We're doing it all So you can listen if you can't watch Like yes Maybe I was the lighter fluid on that on a lot of these guys who were already Putting in real business work I mean there's a lot of people picked up crush it and it's gonna take the reason I always talk about patience is I don't know If you were born entrepreneur or have been doing it for a long time if you're coming from I've been a 17 year lawyer, but I love candle making and I'm gonna become the candle guy, right? Like like you're gonna be starting from a zero place from entrepreneurship It may take two and a half three years You clip this audio part from you recording right now and send it to my team because I want because I want to use it in The pre-roll of the video for so they could hear when this got figured out Cool so yeah, so so on that point I'm gonna tell you something that's really scary to me I'm not so sold that the the only thing I am doing is actually giving people permission I think through my own confidence and my complete utter Lack of being worried about what other people think when I'm in my zone in the business world, right? That my confidence and bravado is creating a shield for a lot of people to take the leap and all of us It's literally literally I feel like I'm a swim coach and I'm just pushing people into a pool they start swimming and they're like oh wait a minute I can fucking swim. Yeah, I think I think the lesson there is like hey if some of you are actually doing well on the side if you've got a great t-shirt business and It was about the business and you like t-shirts, but now you're 34 and Actually, you're like, you know what I really like gardening like why not like it's crush it on crush it, right? Like okay, it's not being it's not being a lawyer and then starting a t-shirt business on the side It's now you actually did that, but you just realized wait a minute eight years later Actually like gardening why can't you start the gardening business on the side while you're doing t-shirt business and eventually becomes the gardening business? Good stuff good stuff I'm gonna show her and what I can tell you is If I ran their company next year, they would do 11 million in revenue from one We're and they're gonna do three and that's something we have to think about Go to a lunch meeting with a client little Lulu's BBQ Living the dream sliding down driveways making business happen I How realistic is this like is this really real I can people really do this It's fucking it's fucking very real like it's like the ambition of the majority It's the ambition of probably 20% of the youth of America To basically live the crush at life that's a that's a Astonishing situation. It's just become very real because of the emergence of podcasts you to the Explosion of YouTube and the explosion of Instagram the three current platforms are like those three current platforms and Facebook too But like those I guess it's a tipping point. I think we're in it now You're just so pumped with the visuals you're getting I And And you were out in New York like a couple months ago and you so we got together while we were talking We started talking about this idea. I like how you showing it in the email like it's like just helps out I agree just helps out right. Yeah, these guys are good. No shit But you know what I mean that just it just helps out that the feeds yeah We reverse engineered that a little bit yes There clearly was at some point somebody who was the most famous first person to do it But that just really was pure virality of like skit face. It's Facebook It's way more replicable than people think and the problem is everybody tries to make it like let's eat the peanut butter Like they what people don't realize is when you have to replicate something that's replicable You have to walk away from it Like in the way that we all thought teen spirit You can't do that because everything looks like the ice bucket challenge which means it's not good You have to take the you have to take the seed of what makes a nice bucket challenge But you can't make it like you can't make it like a challenge You have to make it like let's all hold hands across America right now go like and it just starts like it's got to have the Thematics of it but not look like it. Yeah, see you there. Yeah Yeah Awesome. Bye. Bye guys Just here in Boulder make it should happen business development to client meetings productive Trout you're joining us for this meeting Let's do it We just had a very senior meeting with the head of our video production and our creative Jason and Steve and I just love those leadership meetings were we're trying to do what's right for the logo Everybody you know, it's kind of like I'm the head coach and they're an offensive and defensive coordinator So of course they care about the football team But they can't help but caring about their squad their fighters They're part of it and I have a lot of empathy for that in my leadership team I never ask them to do what I'm supposed to do I'm supposed to take care of and care about and think about the whole team they are supposed to take and think about their teams but When I bring them to the table like I did we need to think about the entire logo So it's very productive, but we got a lot done I think what's key for leaders out there when they are having these meetings is what are you doing before that meeting? What I tend to do as a leader as somebody who's been able to build some big businesses I'm having a lot of small little meetings and some exchanges with these leaders and moving them down the field before we get there So we don't spend two hours being very far apart. We get here and then it's really just about that part, right? Just just take over I don't want to have any white space. I just got to hear one thing give one sec I just want to say thank you seriously. No questions. Just want to say thank you. Thank you My fans say we're yeah, just thank you. What's your name? Kenny? I wish my phone died because it's so cold I wish I had a picture but come here. No, no, I got you Yeah, just thank you so much What's your what's your email or email? Yep, amazing. Thank you so much. You got it The key is if you're gonna have big meetings Restructure strategies trying to get people aligned you can't allow Those people to start off here and then try to make that whole meeting get you all the way here You'll never get there. So what I try to do is for days and weeks and sometimes months Years I'm working on this and then to close the gap. So it's very happy with the meeting. It was very productive Unfortunately, don't get to share much with you because it affects hundreds and hundreds of people in my organization, but It is the one hidden thing from DailyBee even though I'm showing it more than anybody Allowing you guys to be flying the wall these meetings you guys see Things just can't show you everything but but I'll figure it out eventually People but maybe eventually we'll just release all the content, you know, in ten years. Yeah, that's Anyway, I appreciate you guys being part of this journey. It's a grind. It's a slog. It's an everyday thing. I Just think that eventually people understand it It's one thing for you guys to have this figured out an episode 160 170 Another thing for this thing to be figured out an episode 11,000 You
