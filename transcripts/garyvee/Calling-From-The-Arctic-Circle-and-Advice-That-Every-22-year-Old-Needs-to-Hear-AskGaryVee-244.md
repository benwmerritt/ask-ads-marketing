## Transcript
On this episode, we go live on YouTube. It crashes, we go on Instagram, and we have an epic ending. ["Ask Gary Vee Show"] Before we get into this episode, we should take advantage. Yeah, do that too. Maybe a little bit there. We should take advantage of everybody being here. How do we gamify subscriptions for YouTube with all these peeps? The bell. The bell? What bell? They see a bell? There's a level up. You've subscribed with me to hit the bell notification. The notification. Yeah. So if they're watching right now, there's a bell that they fucking see? Show it to me. Guys, hit the fucking bell. Levy on bell. Not the Levy on bell. I hit the fucking stealers. All right. Start putting your phone numbers in here. Hey, everybody. Hannah, great to see you. Great to see you, Zebrent. Anish, Tyler. See how there's this bell here? All right, yeah. So they're watching it. Hit the bell. I want to turn on. Turn on the bell. So are they? Show me how you're watching this live right now. Live. Right. So you're watching? Oh, good. Guys, there's a bell. The lower right corner. Oh, look. They're seeing me this way. But if I go this way, will it switch? Here we go. Nope. So this is how it's showing live, like with all that black? What the fuck's up with that? It's just how it rolls, huh? Like I can't go like. What if you go? Yeah, if I go like that, it doesn't. It just does this shit. See? See? Yeah, it's kind of like. We're going to figure out this YouTube live thing. Great to see you. Thank you for everybody who's hitting the likes up here. Please do. But more importantly, there's a bell down there. Everybody, all of you. Please hit the fucking bell. All right, keep putting up. Mattie, Mattie Ann's, Lath. Gonzalo, you putting down the bell? Tom. Dylan, you hitting the bell? TM, hitting the bell? Andrew Matheson, good to see you. Sergeant. Sergeant Jeremy Reese. USA, baby, USA. All right, let's do it. Their phone numbers are rolling. I don't know how you're going to stop them. They're rolling fast. I'm going to switch the script and get into this show. There you go, Sean. You can flip it around. You're good. All right, episode what? 244? 244? Ready? Yep. Cool. Hey, everybody, this is Gary Vaynerchuk. And this is episode 244 of the Ask GaryVee Show. And we are live on YouTube, flipping a script a little bit, excited about that, and ready to roll. We're going to go to the Colin show, which is always a lot of fun, especially when I hold in and get excited about that. We should put on the lights. Let's see here. Yep, hope everybody's super well. Great weekend. I'm heading out to the West Coast before this monster storm. We've got a blizzard coming, boys and girls. And it looks like Andy K is on his game. Big upgrade from Chris A with his calling. Listen, Chris was struggling with Colin. Oh, I spoke too soon. And all right, I'll talk a little bit while you get your shit together. First of all, I just want to thank everybody for all of the love I've been getting across all of social YouTube. Hit the bell. Hit the bell. Instagram, all this stuff. Trying to put out a lot of content. DailyVee's been rolling. Tyler doing a really good job. Where's DRock? Is he working today? Why? Traveling? Sleeping in Chicago? What? All right, let's get into the show. Hello? Hello, this is Gary Vaynerchuk and you're on the Ask Gary Vee show. Get the fuck out of here. Uh-huh, what's your name? Because I'm presuming it's not Nicole. No, no, no. It's Nick Rizzo. Nick, how are you? Good, man. How you doing? Great, man. What's your question? Ah, shit. So I guess I was... So Nick, real quick, since everybody does this, we'll use this opportunity. Like, what? Everybody's just putting their phone number and they just never think it's going to actually get called, right? Well, so Nicole is my wife's little sister and I got her on to watching you and watching all of your stuff. And I guess she just put my number and she just texted me saying, hey, I just put your number. Oh, so this is even better. I'll send her the redemption for you. Holy shit. Well, good, man. Well, thanks for being on the show. Great job by her. Do you have a business question or any kind of question? So I am starting to build my own business. I've had one. I'm transferred over to a brand name and something I'm more passionate about. It's going easier for me to kind of truly make content I really care about and make the business I make care about. I guess one question I would have is... Real quick, I'm going to stop you there before you go to your question as you gather your thoughts for everybody who's watching. My man here drilled it because he said it would be easier for me if I was passionate about it. And I think the big key on Crush It, you should show that, is the reason I talked about cashing it on your passion is when you love it. Like if I had to talk about the Jets 24 hours a day, piece of cake. I love attention and marketing. Piece of cake. Business. If Tyler, right over here, had to talk about the Penn State Lions, he could do it all day, right? He's struggling with his transition to a Jets fandom. He did a terrible job transitioning into fantasy baseball fandom. So it was harder for him even though he wanted to and as all those boys were doing it, it wasn't his passion. It is a lot easier to create, document, hustle, DM, biz dev, win when it's a subject matter that you're interested in. If you're getting into real estate but you're not interested in real estate or flipping homes but that's where you heard the money was or if you're starting a social media agency but you're doing it because that's where you think the money is and it's not something you love, you're going to lose because you're not going to put in enough hours to win because you don't love it, right? Preach brothers, I've been trying to build something I got into for like six months and just was going nowhere. When you sit down to do work every day and it's like a bore and you don't want to get into it. Did you get into it? Did you get into it because you thought that's where the money was? It was a supplement company that I started doing the research and development for products for back when I was in college and then I kind of became the owner and the guy handed it down to me. Got it. And it just wasn't moving forward the way I wanted to. So now I'm changing over things. Good. What's the question? I guess specifically, what is for value wise, do you feel a lot of value in utilizing Facebook community groups to kind of offer free courses and then with that, the target specific niches, do you think a Facebook group would be a beneficial way to host that or? Yeah, I'm actually a fair, good job by you because I haven't talked a lot about Facebook groups in a long time and I'm actually a pretty big fan of it. I think building community on Facebook is very smart. Closed groups can be very attractive. Yeah, I'm a big fan of groups. I think it builds community. I think if you're going to build a group row, you just got to make a commitment to be in the group. It's like 2003 forums, right? If you're going to build a forum on the internet in 2002, it was a good idea. It was a good idea in 2006. Problem is you got to be in it. You got to be in there, right? Moot built, you know, exactly. Just like 4chan all the way back did well because Moot was in it. You got to be in it. Jetsonsider did well because Brian was in it. Like if you're going to host, if you're going to build a community, don't think somebody else is going to run it for you or like it's going to take care of itself. You've got to manage it. You've got to live in it and provide value. Yeah, I'm just trying to use that as a place where I can build a community for people to feel safe and to feel a part of, to kind of grow together as a group itself too. I think it's a good place, man. Thanks for the call. Thank you very much. Take care. Bye-bye. Pretty good. Yeah, you know, I think communities really matter. I think there's a lot of ways to do them. I think group me's and WhatsApps and closed Facebook groups, email newsletters, internet forums. Yeah, I mean, I think wall gardens, closed environments for a group to build together is a really rad thing to do. What's up? AJ, it's Gary Vaynerchuk from the Ask Gary Vee Show. Oh my God. I knew you were going to call. I don't know why I just knew it. You knew it, Ten I mean. He said Arctic Circle. I mean, you knew it, man. I love it, man. Well, listen, you should play the Lotto, Ten I mean. Dude, we've got to be quick. I'm literally in the Arctic Circle. I only get service outside. It's negative 42. So Jesus. Let's do this before you die. Hey, man, my question is, my family, they don't operate like I do. They don't work as hard as I do. I want to help them. But my friends think that they're drowning me, you know what I mean? So I don't know if I feel like... I see you're carrying your family's weight on your shoulders, the family business. Yeah. Yeah. This is tough, bro. Because listen, I've been a driving force in two family businesses where you just got to, honestly, this is a very personal answer. Everybody's got to make their own decision. It depends on what you value and what feels good. And that will go up and down. It feels good for me, what I brought to the partnerships to my brother and dad. And at times it didn't feel good. I mean, it's hard when you're hustling harder. But you can't also, I can't expect AJ to do exactly what I'm doing because I'm being selfish. I'm doing it for myself. And so I think you need to be, you know, it's easy for everybody from the outside saying, yo, bro, stop carrying your sister and your uncle and everybody's getting money off your back. If it makes you feel good and you're OK with $0.15 or $0.50 a dollar, well, then that's your life. So I would say this. If you've got a problem with it and your friends are saying that because they're supporting what you're saying after four beers, that's one thing. But if they're just observing from the outside and they're starting to change your mind, I wouldn't let outside sources tell you what to do with inside a family dynamic. OK. I mean, I've been struggling for years. So this is great. I do appreciate it. I appreciate it. Is there anything I can help build on this? Because I think family business is a place where I have a lot of expertise and a lot of experience. And I pay attention to it is, can I build on this before you freeze to death? You know what? You've talked about this kind of a lot, not necessarily like this specific case. But this really solves a lot of questions for me. So I'll just keep watching your content. I'm sure you'll talk about it again later. Good man. If I can ever help you again, let me know. Hey, man, I appreciate it. Thanks for calling, dude. You got it. Bye-bye. Let's level that up for everybody while Andy gets the next number. Listen, you have to be very careful and very smart if you're getting feedback from your inner circle of people that love you friends about things based on you talking and them reacting and supporting you versus them observing from the outside and imposing their own family dynamics onto you. It's super important you take a step back and realize what's happening. What's the chicken and egg here? Is this people responding to me? Or is this me getting advice from people that just don't know how exactly I feel or every little part about it inside my world? Sean, you're playing with it. What's going on? Are you answering people? Are we OK? No, I'm trying to get the video back. What happened? You got a call. And when I declined it, it came back just as a flex. That sucks. Let's see. Let's, why did a reconnect? I think we're good. Hey, man, it's Gary Vaynerchuk. And you're on the Ask Gary Vee show. That is freaking awesome. What's going on, guys? Life is really good, my man. What's your name? Hey, my name is Audric. Audric Maguera. I'm not sure if it's recording, but Audry? I want to make sure I heard that. What's that? Audric. Audric Maguera. Audric. Real pleasure, man. How are you? I'm doing excellent, man. Hey, Gary, definitely you've been an inspiration to me. And a couple things that you have told in some of your things about not actually creating stuff, but actually documenting has been a turning point in what I've been doing. Makes me happy. So I started a Facebook ad agency to try to help people with their Facebook ads. But my true passion has been in motivational speaking. So I started documenting videos on my Instagram. And in the short time, I've been able to reach people with my words. And the reason I find my passion is in the fact that I want to be able to reach people that I didn't have in my life as I was growing up through my obstacles, correct? I get it. So my question to you is, how do I expand so that I can actually reach more people, so that I can actually be more impactful other than documenting my life and actually speaking from the heart? Because right now, I'm growing organically on my Instagram. How long? How long have you been doing it? So I actually started about two weeks ago. And I know that it's going to take some time to grow more. Dude. But just wanted to know what other tips I can do to be able to reach that point where I'm reaching more people. Put out put out content where people are paying attention. Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, blogs, podcasts, and put out content. And dude, when I tell you that when I start something, I don't even begin to think about how many more people I can reach than I've been reaching for the first. And maybe I start caring at year three. Maybe the first time I even think about it is three years into a decision. You just told me that you found your passion, that you're a motivational speaker, and you're antsy. And say whatever you want, but you are. You're antsy two weeks in to get bigger. That's going to be a disaster formula, my man. You need to put your head down and don't think. You have to understand how many followers you got on Instagram. I've grown up to 302 in the two weeks. I love it. You need to be in a place where if in nine months from now you're at 413, you're feeling just as good. You're feeling just as good. You know why? Oh, definitely. You know why though I'm telling you that? Why is that? Because by the way, I have a funny feeling, my man, that if you were at 413 followers nine months from today, you would not be happy. You went from 0 to 320 in two weeks. Why the fuck would you only gain 100 followers in eight months and two weeks, right? The reason that you should be thrilled if you're at 419 in nine months is you just told me you found your passion. Yeah. And that's the biggest thing that I, because I know that it's going to take time. And that's one thing that, you know, I'm 35 years old and freaking- You're a kid. Yeah, exactly. I'm still young like you. You're a real young man. You got your whole life ahead of you. And that's the biggest thing. I want to make sure that one, you know, watching your content has definitely humbled me a lot to wanting to be the rich guy. I don't want to be the rich guy. I want to be the guy that people reach out to me and tell me, hey, because of you, I see things differently. I'm more positive, you know, and that's really what my ultimate goal is going to be. My man, if you believe that, and I actually weirdly believe you, then I'm going to tell you the number one thing that you have to figure out. Patience and humility. Okay. Do not wrap yourself esteem up into the number of followers you got. Got you. You got 310 people on earth that fucking give a fuck about what you have to say and you can change every one of those lives. You leave a bigger impact on this earth than 99% of people. So it is deep. So be happy. You got 310 instead of worrying about getting 3,000. Okay. Like, thank you for calling me, man. You got him, man. Good luck to you. All right. Thank you. Cool. Take care. We're on Instagram live now because YouTube crashed. YouTube crashed, okay. I was trying to figure it out. Yeah, YouTube crashed. Let's get one or two more calls before I get my next meeting. Guys, you know, everybody wants to grow. Everybody wants to continue to succeed. I get it. But boy, do I wish I could, like, look at my world. Like, I was on Instagram for fucking five years. And was that like 40,000 followers? Like, it's not about the following count. Like, your time will come if you're good enough. If you're a good enough motivational speaker, a good enough executive, good enough designer, good enough entrepreneur, your time will come. Everybody's in a rush. Okay. Right? Everybody's in a rush to grow up. I wish I was 12 and throwing a bell. Hello? Hey, Taylor. It's Gary Vee on the Ask Gary Vee show. No way! Yes, way! Okay. Where are you from? We. I'm from Buffalo, New York. Are you a Bill's fan? Ah, unfortunately, yes. Alright, I know you said I'm a Porsche. Well, not very good. Well, listen, neither are the Jets. Don't worry. So, what's going on? Nothing much. I basically would die into asking a question. Currently, graduated college last May. And I'm trying to build my own business brand, hustle, all that kind of stuff. And my question for you is, and I'm probably sure that a lot of people ask this or one or two same things. It's okay. How do you get over the stump of you're graduating and you feel all this pressure because you're trying to build something but you're still so young but you want to do this fast and grow it big? And I'm just in a rut and I can't get out of it. But I have a hustle and a drive that I know I'll be able to build something. But I'm just in this space that's not allowing me to. So, let me help you. The space you're in is probably the macro-micro issue. So, it's macro-patience, micro-speed, right? So, what do I mean by that? You need to be patient as fuck, Taylor. You're 22, 23 years old. Like, what do you think's going to happen overnight? Yeah, I know. So, you need to be fast, 7 a.m. to 2 in the morning every day. But in the big picture, you need to realize nothing good is going to happen for the next six years. Okay. And do you think that I should just try every good idea that I think I have and just go for it all out? Or do you think I should stick with one thing at a time? I think the fact that you even asked that question that you should taste flirting with a lot of different things because you'll be crippled by the what if if you don't. Even though that's not the perfect formula to build the biggest short-term wealth because you should go triple down on one thing instead of being half pregnant on nine. Okay. Taylor, let me tell you something. Like, let me ask you the pressure. Who are you, like are you trying to prove to yourself, to your siblings, to your parents, to the world? Like, who are you trying to prove that you're successful to or that this was the right call or you're gonna make it? Like, that's what you have to figure out. Hmm, that's a good question. Like, what are you impatient for? Like, what's the problem? You wanna buy a fucking Rolex? Like, what's the rush? I feel like I've known that I'm meant to do something big. Me too. And I grew up in an entrepreneurial household. Me too. And so it's in my blood, it's in my bones. Good. And I feel like I watched all these other millennials hitting these huge, I guess, milestones in their life. What milestones? And then I'm just right here. Let's break it down. What year old are you? I'm 22, about to be 23. Okay, what milestone, please give me a millennial and the milestone they achieved that makes you feel like you're just sitting in fucking Buffalo. Well, I'm sitting in Buffalo, which is one thing I'm not happy about. But- That's right, cause it's holding the Buffalo Bill's piece of shit, team. But what, what, but, but, but, but, but, but, before you go there, forget about sitting in Buffalo. Who's the millennial and what's the milestone that's making you feel like you're sitting there? Go, the truth, go. Well, honestly, there's people on social media which definitely is not always true. But I watched, oh god, I guess the only thing on the spot I can think of is a Cartiagin or a Jenner, which is lame, but. Can we talk about this, please? Yeah, I feel like, sure. Like, you're telling me that Kylie Jenner's fucking trillion followers on Instagram makes you feel like you're just sitting there? No, I feel like the fact that she's already got a business started that's super successful. Did you fact, did you fact, did you? That comes with her fame. Did you factor in the fact that her sisters and mom architected something for 10 years while she was a teenager that she was able to walk directly into that gave her a springboard and that she had the financial capabilities of deploying ungodly amounts of, you know, plastic surgery and the, and all the other variable things that she's been able to do to create that culture and that financial benefit? Yeah. Did you factor in that her mom is a ninja architect of business and created that framework? Yeah, and I feel like not many people give them the credit for that. I totally think that they took this empire. I agree, but what the fuck does that have to do with you? It has nothing to do with me, I know. No shit, remember how I, I don't know if you saw this where I said stop looking at your friend's shit or whatever the fuck I put on Instagram? Yeah. I don't know if you saw it or not, but it doesn't matter. What the, like you looking at the Kardashians is the most ludicrous horseshit I've ever heard in my life. Well, that's just the first thing that can pop into my head. Great, give me another, listen, we're here, we're here. Give me another one. There's a guy in London, I can't think of his name at the top of my head. I'm gonna stop you right now. Okay. Let me give you some, I was gonna say fatherly, I guess my father was Ford, I know. I'll give you some massively older brother, uncle advice, you ready? Okay, yes. Every second you spend thinking about what somebody else has is taking away from time that you could create something for yourself. Yeah. You're losing, you're losing cause you're laying in your bed looking at somebody's fucking glamorous, photoshopped picture of them doing something cool and you're envious and you're jealous and you're impatient and it's crippling your upside. Yeah, cause that's where I wanna be and I know I'm not there yet. You haven't done shit. I know. So go do shit that actually gets you there so that you earn it instead of like you dwelling that you're not there and hoping something's gonna happen. I don't know what's going through your mind. Yeah, well I guess I'm hustling on the side but I don't think I'm doing enough, I guess. You definitely aren't doing enough if you have enough time to fucking consume the content of a Kardashian and some boy in London. That's true. Listen to me, Taylor, listen. You've gotta deploy patience and you've gotta love the process. I'm addicted to the process of the battle scars, the setbacks, the lack of, you know, Taylor, I gave up my entire 20s, all of them. Imagine not doing anything fun or going anywhere for the next eight years including Saturday and Sunday. That's what I did from 22 to 30. Every day I spent 15 hours a day in a liquor store, thought about a liquor store, built a liquor store, sold wine, spent every day. This last weekend, don't lie to me, Taylor, what did you do this last weekend? What did you do for Saturday and Sunday? Tell me the truth, don't bullshit me. Yeah, no bullshit. I'm helping my mom right now on digital media and branding for her company. Love you. And so I had a marketing meeting with one of the people doing that. Love you. And then I also... How much time did you have for yourself on Saturday and Sunday that was not working every minute? Tell me the truth. A lot, a lot. I know, so that's the punchline, right? Now imagine this. When I tell you this, you spent more downtime on not your career this weekend than I did in my entire 20s combined. Oh shit, okay. That puts things in a perspective. I think so. Awesome. I think so too. I need to get to it. Taylor, you need to do me a huge favor. If you really want to win and you want to come to New York in eight years and shake my hand, here's what you need to do. You need to stop giving a shit about what anybody else has and realize that if you put your head down and just work for the next 10 years, no glamor, no new fucking car, suitcase, jewelry, trip, event, no Coachella, no fucking new fucking sneakers, like fucking work, you will have it. And every time you care about one of the things I just mentioned, it will slow down your process of having it. Okay, so in less than eight years, when I'm a millionaire by 25, I'll come shake your hand. I promise you that statement itself made me 100% guarantee that you won't. No. Yes, yes. That's how this works. Being a millionaire at 25 when you're 22 and you're at dick shit and haven't even started is inconceivable unless you fucking hit the lotto. What's the romance? What's the romance of, I wanna make, you know how everybody says Gary Vee, when you get to buy the Jets in two years and then I reply 20 years? I'm romantic about the journey and the process, which is why I'm actually gonna pull it off. You're trying to be a millionaire by 25. How, Taylor? It's just a goal I've always had. Why? And right now with what I'm doing, I guess it's not. That's right. It's an arbitrary bullshit thing that means nothing. Yeah. Wouldn't you rather guarantee millionaire shit by 36 than by doing long-term marathon running versus doing a bunch of bullshit sprints that guarantees never having it? And I promise you, funny thing happens to your self-esteem when you're 31 and not a millionaire because you've been chasing fast fucking cash and you're now six years removed from not hitting your goal. Your self-esteem starts fucking with your head. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Listen carefully. I wanna buy the New York Jets, but when I clarify it to everybody, I want the process of trying to buy the New York Jets more than buying the New York Jets. Understand? Yeah. Cause ultimately that's the end goal, but there's a process behind that. You have to understand, I don't give a fuck about the end goal. I care about the process, the enjoyment of doing it. You're not enjoying yourself trying to get to a million bucks over the next three years. No. You're right. Oh, I know I'm right. I'm just sticking on this right now because I feel like we've gone into this deep enough that I might as well hold on for a couple more minutes to see if I can actually pull you through instead of you just being on this high of practicality for 36 hours and then going back to Instagram bullshit in 48 hours. I need to deactivate that shit. No, you need to learn to discipline to be able to put it in the proper bucket. Yeah. I just feel like I hold myself at this pedestal and it's crippling myself cause I'm not actually doing the things to get there. Of course. So you're playing a fake narrative instead of putting in the actual work that's needed to actually pull it off. And then what's happening is you're living a fake world to yourself, but you know it, which then changes your behavior in the way that you interact with others. It's true. I know. Like for all my bravado now, I was real quiet in my 20s. People made fun of me. Like you work in your dad's liquor store. I'm in Wall Street making 100,000. I got a BMW. I'm like, that's nice, Pat. Yeah. Do you understand the level of disrespect I have for Pat? Do you understand the level of disrespect I have for all those 20, 30, 40, 50 year olds flashing shit on fucking Instagram with short term moves? I can't wait for the fucking world to melt. I can't wait for all these bullshit people to get fucking hosed out when the economy gets shit. Yeah, it's cause they're short term affording these things that are flashy, but in the long term, it's not sustainable for what they're doing right now. Yeah, but meanwhile, you're admiring the fuck out of them. I know, it's a problem. No shit, Taylor. It's really bad. Taylor, you need to start fucking loving the process and the work and the grind. You need to start respecting people that are like sleeping with four roommates and buying their t-shirts at Walmart. Yeah, you know what? I feel like I need that wake up, but I feel like I need to hit rock bottom and have that wake up. I'm too comfortable right now. And it's annoying to shit out of me. I don't think so. I think you're saying you need to hit rock bottom because it buys you more time to bullshit like you are right now. I never thought of that. You know what I mean? Like you know it's not working. You're just saying, by the way, let me go complete left field on you. You're a 22 year old girl, woman. Like it's okay to enjoy a little bit now too. You've heard me say regrets. I don't know how deep you know my content, but once in a blue moon when people ask me the advice for 25 year old Gary, the answer is go have fun asshole. It would have been okay to go to Vegas or Acapoco or like do some dumb shit. Like do you know what I mean? So, so, so. I think I've had my fun in college though and now I feel like it's time to work. Well, you know, no, that's the bullshit PR version, Taylor. The reality, Taylor is still fucking in that zone. Yeah. Don't beat yourself up. Don't hold yourself accountable to arbitrary bullshit fantasies. Just put in work and enjoy that. Enjoy eating shit and dirt and bleeding and the grind and don't give a fuck about what anybody else thinks, why you haven't done it, why are you doing that. Have four jobs. Fucking Wendy's, Walmart, your side hustle, work, train, learn. Don't think you're a digital expert just because you're 22 and you have an Instagram account. Show me how much fucking shit you've sold with your digital social media skills. Okay. Do you understand? No, I do, yeah. You're just completely in the wrong game and I'm holding you on to this because you and 99% of the people that are watching are playing the same game. I know, which is why I wanted to ask the question. But you're looking. I'm obviously not the only one. No, you're the majority and the massive majority. The question is you just need to understand the following. You can trick losers. You're not tricking me. Good, because I want honest answers. You don't need my honest answer. You know you're not tricking yourself either. None of us are tricking ourselves. I just want to remind you that you might be able to trick your uncle Hal and you might be able to trick your girlfriend that was in your fucking college with you, but you're not tricking a winner when you're bullshitting. Got it? Got it. So even if you're posturing and pandering and PRing yourself, no winner thinks you're winning. Yeah, because I'm not. I know. Work, that's the answer to all these questions. Got it. Learn things, do stuff, try to sell shit, learn how to make money, work. All right, I will. Was this good? Awesome, thank you so much. Can you do me a huge favor? Yeah. Can you email me in 30 days and don't bullshit me? What's your Twitter handle? Or Instagram, what's your Instagram? I don't know. That's fine. Instagram is at the fabulous journey. At the fabulous journey. Yeah. Me and my whole team and the entire VaynerNation is watching. Oh shit, okay. I'm gonna smoke you out of your bullshit. Okay. Everybody's watching. Okay, I got it. Do you understand? Yeah. I like your blue dress. Thank you, I got it on sale. I like that answer. That's the best thing you said all fucking day. That's the best thing you said this whole time. Listen, slow and steady wins the race. You're only competing with yourself. Okay. Got it? Got it. Nobody else defines you, not me, not everybody watching, not your mom, not the fucking Kardashians, you. Got it. You can grind and be patient for 10 years. Every day and still be nine years younger than me and I would trade places with you. That's how amazing having time on your side is. Yeah, time's everything. So use it. I will. Good, see ya. Thank you. You're welcome. You keep asking questions, I'll keep answering them.
