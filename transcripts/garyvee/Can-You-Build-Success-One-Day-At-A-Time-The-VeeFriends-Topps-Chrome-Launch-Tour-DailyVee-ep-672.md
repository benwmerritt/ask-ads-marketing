All right, Babin, what do you need? How do you want to do it? What do you see? What did this day mean? What do we do? You know, today's another fucking day of like, a brick in the building. Like, we went out from Wine Library to David Adams' upcoming store here on 35th and Broadway. Stop the fucking start! And fucking Staten Island and Jersey City and fucking Brooklyn and Bloeker. And just fucking, we're doing what I do. We're doing what I do. When? Only for an hour, just running around the whole city. Jersey, Staten Island, the city. But of course the last two days were beautiful and today it's rain, you know? But it's all right, we'll persevere through. I'm gonna say hello in the line. Good morning, guys. Thank you for coming. Thank you for everything you're doing for us, David. Hi! Thank you for coming. It's a pleasure. Good to see you. I'll see you guys inside. All right, what's the plan? I'll see you soon. See you soon. See you soon. Such a pleasure. How are you? Yeah, how are you? Good, I'm well. Could you do a little jubilee? I'll do one for you, brother. Okay, thank you. I'm gonna go. I have a ball of time. Go ahead. See you next week. I don't know, so I have a... Resume? Yeah, this is my resume. I like it. Thank you. I don't know, I thought I'd bring it. Maybe shoot my shot. I think you should shoot your shot. I don't know. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. Tell me back. I'm a sophomore in college right now. Yeah. I've been an accounting major. Yeah. Hopefully... Congratulations on your 28. Yeah. So I'm working on finding opportunities as much as I can. Ultimately, it's not even about financial success. Yeah. What you need to focus on is like, being a happy person. I promise you. I know unlimited people that are super rich and super unhappy. Yeah. And I promise you, they will trade their money for a piece of money. So, you know, mom, mom... It's very real, brother, it's very real. And obviously, if you're this entrepreneurial, you're ambitious, right? There's grandpa had to practice, mom's running it, there's the pressures of like, do I follow that line? But whether you look up to someone like me, or you wanna deliver for your family, all of it has to be secondary to what's in here. It has to be, because you'll end up resenting and being unhappy, you understand? So you need to challenge yourself with this young of an age, to really explore and be curious, and try, you know, like, learn about different things, and you know, you're very fortunate growing up in an internet, AI world where you can get so much information. We have to look up encyclopedias, like it took an hour to look up one fact, now you can get 40 pages worth of incredible information in 90 seconds. You can take advantage of those amazing opportunities for yourself. But I'm gonna help you. So Jen, right? You got that? You can take care of that for me? Don't lose it. I don't want this kid to be upset with me. All right, so let's do it. I got you, my brother, let's do it. What I have been trying to do as a content creator in GaryVee form is 100% what the V-Friends were created to do. Tenacious Termite, an accountable aunt, they're gonna be the GaryVee that's like, that's the clip that me and Babin, you know, made when I was like yelling at you, and be like, shut the fuck up and let's go. Or graceful goldfish, that version of me showed up in a meeting with Courtney that is just between Courtney and I forever, but those characters showed up in that moment. And so I am the V-Friends and the V-Friends are me. Oh, reconnecting, hope he's there. Little reconnecting. It's such a good thing you're always there. It was just about, it was just, blog, it was just about to put the fucking cherry on top of this fucking, this reconnecting spinning thing. Just took it away from me. Took it away from me. What's good, what's good? What's good, what's good? Good to see you, what's up, what's up? Gary, do you think they just pulled? No. Look on the far, look at this. Just pulled for the second go out of a blaster bag. No! Guys, the blaster's the alpha, what the fuck? Yeah. Welcome to the Vodega. Pete. Pete. We met at an issue comment session. Good to see you brother. Justin was there. Charlie. Charlie, such a pleasure. Welcome to the Vodega. Dude, this is the best fucking part of the Vodega. I'm undefeated. You are, let's go right now. You undefeated? Let's go. Oh shit. Do you play this as a kid growing up? Sometimes. Play a lot of this. Yeah, it's good to go. No. Oh. Oh, shit. Whoa. We're finishing this? We're finishing this game. Are you kidding me? Of course we're finishing this game. Yeah! No, no, it's not over. You got time brother, fight. Whoa. Oh. Ty. Holy shit, that was scary. Oh. Yeah! First person ever beaten here. Is that true? That's 100% true. First person? First person ever beaten here. If I was gonna lose anybody, it would be like. I just want everybody to know, you need to support this store forever. You don't know, you guys know me, but you don't know me like that. If I lost this game, there was a 100% chance I was walking the fuck out of here. And I swear on my fucking kids life, 100% I was leaving. You would have been shook as fuck. You would have been like, yo, I fuck with Gary Vee, but that is fucked up. I stood in the fucking rain in Jersey City. Bro, you are a real good player. I hurt my hand. Fucking slam that wall. Babbling my hands all fucked up. Thank you darling, thanks Esther. Thank you for coming. My man. Oh, the Puma my man. Me too, I'm in love with this character. The Puma is fired. Did you read the back of the card? You read the back? Read the back of that card. That's why you should love the Puma. Getting your perspective, that was once your perspective's right. Life is how you see it. Not only, it's not even about ambition. It's about like, is your life good? Most people answer no, because they're on some envy and jealousy shit. But like, I always go to this line and know some of you follow me and you know where I'm about to go, but I'm gonna say, because I can't stop thinking about it, 800 million people on earth right now, 10% of the world can't get to clean water. The fuck is anyone in here complaining about? Clean water, 800 million. Almost three times, 2.5 times the entire US. That many people can't get to water in the next eight hours. And I was like, get me a cup of water. No clean water. Well, we're opening up cards. You get your perspective right. Life is good. That's why I fuck with the Puma. And that's why I made the, why I made perspective of Puma. Cause I knew Pumas are cool. Like, you know, we're gonna, we're gonna ball out that character over the next 10 years. So, all right, let me get these things. She's in. I wish I had said, I wish I had said. Thank you. Thanks everybody. Take care. We just wrapped up in Jersey City. The rain stopped for us. But they got us cards. Was an incredible spot. Now we're headed to Staten fucking Island. You know, the mission of them spreading kindness and compassion, but accountability and tenacity, competitiveness, but caring like a camel. That was always the framework. That I knew that I couldn't, I knew at that point when I made V Friends that I was not gonna be able to reach eight billion people as a personal brand. Not everybody's cup of tea. The world is big. It was just not gonna happen. But I felt that if I built an intellectual property, that was grounded in the principles that my mom and dad taught me, that my life's journey's taught me, that what I believe in the universe, that there was a way that it would reach the world. What up, what up? What's up, man? Good to see you. How are you? Great, man. Thanks for showing us Staten Island, man. Of course, bro. So happy to meet you. How are you doing? How are you doing? Good, how are you doing? Thanks for the card. Nice to see you. All right, let's rewind up because I'm gonna give everybody one pack. We're gonna do a community break right now. Got you? Got you? Thank you so much. You are beyond welcome. My brother. You can use the table. You can use the table. All right. All right. Open the pack. Let's go. Best pack gets a blaster. These are the best. That's your best. Your best is that. I think somebody's, I think somebody's, I didn't push, I didn't pull shit. I didn't pull shit. Okay, that's good. That's, you're in the mix. I wanna see if somebody got another. Monga's good. You're in the mix. Oh, all right. Oh, black hat base. Wait a minute. Is that an alien 50? Oh, that's the yellow one. The yellow, yellow, okay. That's a yellow. You might be in the mix. Is that gold or yellow? Yellow, yellow. Who's got, who's got numbered? All right. Does anybody have a numbered card? To what? 150. What is it? Who is it? And Eater, you got pug to 99. Tyler, get on eBay. This is gonna be a close one. Show me, show me V-Friends slash 99s. Who do we have 50? 40. Crab's a bigger. All right, give me three boxes. On some real shit, cause I gotta keep it real. And honestly, these are like gold to me right now, but the reality is, it's basically a three way tie. So you're all getting one. Let's go. Let's go. You were very welcome, bro. You were very welcome. It was too tough. I wouldn't have felt good. Like I didn't really know where to go with it. You know, like from what I saw. Yeah, what you got the nicks in? I called my brother last night. I'm like, we're gonna fucking losing six, aren't we? Like that's how like, you know, like I'm protecting my feelings. Like it feels crazy right now. Like I can't even like, but then I gotta be honest with you. On some real shit, when I found out that the Pope went to Villanova, I was like, fuck God wants the nicks to win this suit. I feel like God wants the nicks to win this championship. So the only time I thought we could go was when the Pope was announced. They're like, he went to Villanova. I'm like, this is a fucking sign. Hey, on some serious shit, real quick. Thank you all for being here. Thank you for supporting. Why this is funny and why it's fun to document is, I'm doing this forever. And I'm gonna really build this thing. And like my number one goal is to make sure that all of you, when you're older, talk about this visit. You know, like, you know, when like big shit happens, I like all I think about when I'm in here is like, when you're all 30, 40 years older than today, God willing, you're sitting around and be like, no, you won't believe it. When V Friends first came out, I was at Staten fucking Island at a store and Gary was there and I was, I wish I bought all the boxes now. That's like how I think. You gotta see what's right in Staten Island. Ha ha ha ha. Respect my God. By the way, if any of you are gonna be in the city tonight or you got time tonight, I'm gonna be, I'm about to text out and put on Twitter. 7 p.m. we're gonna be at the new Dave and Adam store. Just a lot of people are gonna come through. It's gonna be a good time. So anyway, thank you everybody. Thank you for real. Thank you for coming through. Thank you for the hospitality. The store's incredible. Proactive Piranha. All right. Mature mule. Ooh, shiny. Wave 150. Nice. The energetic electric eel. That's the fucking guy right here. Hustling hamster. They canceled that word for a minute, Babin. They canceled that word. But we're back. And look, the hustle's real. Like work ethic matters. When everybody was like trying to, you know, cancel this word, I just changed my word to hard work. Like, I don't know what people are trying to do in here, but like the hustling hamster is a real gangster. He looks cute, but don't let him fool you. But honestly, I wanna talk about the proactive Piranha. It's too many of you right now. Like here's a PSA. Too many of you are not being proactive. You're talking that talk, but you're not living that life. You're definitely not walking that walk. And you know, I really, I'm a big fan of the proactive Piranha. And I'm excited to develop the character because we really gotta get people out of their fucking mouths and get into their hands and the fucking feet and legs and just gotta do shit, man. Talking about working out is different than working out. Talking about the business that you're gonna build is different than building the business. Too many of you talking. Fucking talking. You know? Too much talk. Not enough action. Too much talk, not enough action. We're good. Just doing some street marketing. Just some street marketing. Look at that, Ty. Some street marketing. Free money on the street. Beautiful. Oh, oh, hello. How are you? Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Thanks so much. Big fan of yours, by the way. My five year old's a huge Pokemon fan, getting into V-Friends. I love it. This is his first introduction. I'm gonna give him a whole, if you wouldn't mind signing some cards for us. Let me sign some. It would be much appreciated. If you could just go. I try to make it as easy as possible for you. Ty, I collect tigers, you've probably seen my post. Yeah, this is the post you've probably seen many times. I've seen it many times, bro. I love your collection. It's fucking fresh. Yeah. Also my son was born in the year of the tiger. That's one of the reasons. Is there? Is the tiger in a rupt? Yes, I've seen it. I think so, yeah, yeah. Pull that, pull that. I'll be right back. Ah! This is my niece's favorite character. You like that little dragonfly? Which one do you, oh, Soso, what about the duck? Yeah, I like the duck. It's that one. Oh, you like the worm? I love this worm too. This is one of my favorites. I love the worm. I love it. Let me just sign some more, I'll be right back. You got your tiger or not yet? Let's go, tiger. I really need to pull the erupt tiger right now and just like dance on these tables. Let's go. Oh my god. Wow, what a looker. Let's go. I just pulled a pack with two black hat. What? Has anybody had that happen? I've had a lands, but I honestly want it. For this party. I want it. I'll be right back. See? You're welcome. Thank you, Eric. My man. My man. Thank you, Eric. You're very welcome. Take this. You know what? All right, pull that first. I want to see if I, yeah, Babbit, Babbit. Yeah, of course. Babbin, get on there. So cool. Best part of the rest of the tour, okay? Come on, tiger. I need this moment. I need this moment. Come on, tiger. Yellow tiger. Tiger, come on. Perfect prison. Like a nice tiger, like a cat. That's a cat. I'll take that. Thank you so much. And you got the yellow. Let's go. That's so awesome. Let's sign that. Let's go. That's unbelievable. That's going to be an entire collection. Let's go. Let's go. He has a question right now. What inspired you to do this? You know, what's really cool is in a little way, you have a lot to do with what inspired it. I have been making a lot of content about positivity and trying to bring love to the world. And grownups can see me on Instagram and things of that nature. But you don't have Instagram yet, right? So I wanted to make a project that would go get a little younger and I wanted to get a little younger. And I wanted to get a little younger and I wanted to get a little younger and I wanted to get a little younger and inspire kids to choose positivity and really fall in love with the characters and then try to aspire to be like the characters. All right, this might be the best part. This is an incredible store. This is maybe the best part. Limit one per customer. How cool is that? Limit one per customer. That's when you know you have something fucking hot. Limit one per customer. Let's go. Let's go. It's one of the few bad guys. Oh, doubled up on it. One of the few bad guys. No way. Are you kidding me? There's only two outcomes. One, unfortunately, got as different plans for me and I go too early. Or two, I'm on this earth long enough, another three, four, five decades to pull this whole thing off. And so I know I'm gonna do it. I've always done it. Everything I've ever done when I decided I was gonna do it happened at the highest levels that I said was gonna happen. The wine store in Jersey, the agency in New York, and now this. So part of me wants to buy all of it and have it all on some flip shit because I'm a collector and a flipper. On the flip side, what I really need to do is get as much of this out there, get the kids to get it. I'm in building mode, right? Like I need every pack to find another home. You know, my man's a fan. Now his brother comes on, he opens a pack, he fucking pulls a black cat, his brother freaks out and now he's fully in. That's how shit like this works. You know what I mean? It's a ripple effect and so just gotta put in the work. Are they breaking? They're bouncing it out. Hey, go look at the gas. Look at the gas. Good, good, good, good, good. Hey look, they're coming on you. Hey look, we're good. I'm not bashful of what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to build Pokemon. I'm trying to build Marvel. I'm trying to build Disney. Why the fuck not? Why the fuck not? And bro, I'm capable. Yes, of course. I'm capable like that. Let's go. We're doing what I do. There was long, hard nights and days for YLibrary. There was long, hard days for VaynerMedia. There was long, hard days for VaynerSports. There was long, hard days for the brand GaryVee. You know that intimately. And there are now long, hard days for V-Friends. And just like the other four things I mentioned, it's fucking going only one place and it doesn't matter if people think it's shit or this or that or I can't. And it actually doesn't even matter if everyone there thinks I'm definitely gonna do it. It's gonna just come down to am I gonna put in the work and I'm gonna put in the strategy. Am I capable? Who am I? Is this, that? And the answer's fucking yes. So that's what happens. ["The Sorrow of Love"]
