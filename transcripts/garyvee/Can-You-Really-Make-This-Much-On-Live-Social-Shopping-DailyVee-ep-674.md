Hey Gary, I've been selling full time on what not for almost two years now and I've scaled close to two million in sales. I'm 22 years old. Stop right there! All the Gary V stuff, what's funny about it is it's very real to me. What I talk about is my truth. I'm very grateful. I don't care about people's opinions, I don't care about money. It makes it easy. I'm over here. Yes sir. DailyVee. Oh shit, DailyVee, what's good? Today's uh, originally was going to be a day in Dallas with Clicks. Am I able to tell people about this stream like after Grand's or what? I don't think a surprise element brings any extra value, so yeah, let's see. But I don't know if you've heard, I need a lot of luck today because the Knicks Celtics right out there. Right there, looking right at it. Big game four. The Knicks don't have a fucking party. But today will be just a bunch of meetings. We're going into tea with Gary V in nine minutes. Chrome is red hot. Here's some eBay comps. This is literally what Dustin's showing you last 12 hours based on his edit. I didn't know what this week was going to look like. If it wasn't what I wanted to be, we'd be going really crazy. Now it's like a little bit more than I want it to be. Like I'm a little scared boxes are going to get to $700 or $800 a box. I'm almost like in a weird way, Dustin. Taking the pedal, not off. But definitely not like putting both feet on the pedal either. I'm just going to sneak a little bit of intermediate work. Gary. My brother, we're going to beat your ass. Listen, listen, I know you're old. Those knees don't work right. They really do work. I don't think the athleticism there though. That might be fair. We're about to, I'm not sure if my athleticism, by the way though, be careful. I got a basketball coach and we're working on lower body athleticism. So I'm getting confident. Listen, I'm excited. Looking forward to it. 515 Sunday, live on what not. Plenty of euphoria. Best t-shirt company in the world versus V-Friends. Best emerging IP in the world. Love you. I'll see you Sunday. Yes, Rips. Yeah. Game 630. So maybe you should have him say that and then we could add it over. Is that what we should do? We'll do overlay, including both in DailyVee and in that video. We'll put, I asked like, game's actually 630. 515 to 615 is the business meeting. Like it'll be funny. Take a photo with this, with the mug, the Y's. Okay, mug. This is fresh. Yeah. Why don't I, do I have another mug for today? We're going to do it later on. But I'm going live now. Might as well start drinking from and building a guy. Yeah. Yeah. I'm really busy. You know, that's coffee. Yeah. That's coffee and I should be honest with Tea with GaryVee. So I'm going to put tea in here. Okay, smart. All right, I'm ready for the show. This is Tea with GaryVee. Pablo is on the ones and twos. Pablo, before you come up, who's going to bring people up on screen with me? All right. Well, I trust that. Braden Mason, I trust. Pablo, we're going to you first. You have a question. Hey Gary, I've been selling full-time on Whatnot for almost two years now and I've scaled close to 2 million in sales. I'm 22 years old. Stop right there. We've been talking about this Whatnot thing. I just need everybody who's on every platform. You've been seeing me talk about live social shopping. Right? I don't know if anybody heard that. Zach in the back, pay attention. She's 22 and has done 2 million in sales in the last 24 months from 20 to 22. Yes, Mike. Keep shaking that head. That's exactly right. Give me that affirmation. Live social shopping is a monster. Like straight up even like this weekend, sign up for a count on Whatnot. Sign up to sell and like sit in your living room and sell random shit in your house. It's like eBay. It's free money, Dustin. Can you explain why it works as a business to make content telling people why they shouldn't hire you? Sure, because it builds trust and a lot of times when you're making content, let's say you're a plumber. If you're a plumber and you know that a third of your clients hire you for 500 bucks to change a little thing that they could have changed if they went to YouTube and to Home Depot, if you make that content and say, don't hire me on this situation, go to this video. In fact, if that person made that plumber made the video instead of pointing them to a video building brand and said, go to this video that I made and go to Lowe's and spend $19. And this is how you do it. The level of trust that happens that when that same family that didn't need to sink, but when their oldest son took a huge poop and exploded their bathroom and it fucking broke and they actually did need help, which plumber do you think they're going to fucking call? Reputation, trust. It's doing the right thing. You know, that's what I think. Pablo, I think why do you tell people not to hire you? Because they end up hiring you when they actually need you. I don't want people hiring me when they don't need me. Wait a minute, I actually think you've invented something here. This looks fucking amazing. Well, we'll throw the champagne out there for you guys. We invented something. Are you aware of how uncomfortably red hot the product is right now? These boxes were accessible. They were $99 a box and $25 for blasters when I priced them. The problem was Topps didn't believe me either on how much demand there was going to be, so they didn't make enough. So the secondary market just completely got crazy fast. We're one one millionth of what Disney and Pokemon are, but you'll get there. But we really are going to get somewhere damn close actually. All right, I got a rug. Take care. Talk soon. The things I do off-camera and behind the scenes are by far the things I'm most proud of in life. I'm pretty proud of what I do on camera for all of you and what you see, but that's my strength. It's just kind of like momentum. I see it in people's eating habits and workout habits. Like I've had a great year and then the last four weeks it's just been so hard. I've been crazy. And unlike times in the past, I didn't beat myself up during the two, three weeks. And then it didn't allow me to get too far away. And then like the last three days I've been able to like get into it. And it's like me and the trainer like both on the scale and what I'm doing. It's like literally I missed nothing. I didn't used to have that like five, six years ago. If I missed like three weeks, I'd be like, it's over. I fucking blew it and I would eat more like, you know, you're stunningly in control. And it's okay to like lose some lives in the game. And it's okay if you don't end up being good at it. I'm being, you have to hear this part. It's okay if you don't end up being great at it. Like it's okay if you don't end up making tons of money on it. You just need to do it. You are very welcome. Just met with a former employee that's, you know, going through it. Always trying to give a little love and positivity. You like that? Yeah. That hit for you? I mean, it's for me, but I feel like, I go into like, what if you don't get it done? I think it's also because I like to move a little bit of a control freak, I think. You think there's a certain right way? That's it, I guess. Like when people realize there's no should, there's no right, there's no supposed to be. When people fucking understand that, I don't want to work out. I did it today again. I bring this up a lot because I'm really fighting it. Force yourself to do something that you think is going to be catastrophic. Going from zero to one is always hard in anything, but you know, that UNO collab was probably the first big collab. Was there anything, was that a harder lift than usual? UNO Mattel didn't want us to make more than 5,000 sets because they'd never sold more and they'd done Harry Potter and Batman and Marvel. And I signed a contract that said that I would buy every set that was not sold after 100 days because that's how confident I was and then we sold out in 54 minutes and they shit their pants and I won. Amazing. From September to May, I'm going to spend 50% of my energy on building up the demand. It's going to be astronomical. This is my quote. I want to maximize production to the furthest you're willing to go because you will underestimate demand again. We're going to figure out which inserts we're excited about and which characters they are. Love it. Yeah. Right now. Yeah. I just need you to, yeah, right now. I mean, oh my God. What? Guys, I can't believe Brandon found this. These are my full page ads. This is Labor Day 1999 Wine Libraries full page ad in the New York Times. There it is. September in 1999. Look at it. This is literally 1999. This is 1999 WineLibrary.com. Is there a fax number? Is there a fax number? Dustin, look at this. Kids, fax number. Five minutes from short, those are all context. Call to join our email service. Dustin, look at this. This is a time machine, kids, because so many people didn't know how to put an email into an email service in 1999. This is fucking amazing. I need this. I need this in my office immediately. Fringed. Now delivering everything to the New Jersey collector's corner. Whoa. Little coupon on there. 20% off. Little 20 minutes outside of Manhattan, even though it's 45. Would love to get a sense if you guys are open to do a mini capsule with me. I'll fly to Europe. Like, I really want to do something and I'm very passionate about this concept of nice guys finish first. Sounds amazing. I love that with you, it's poking. Just straight up, boy, I'm gonna have to tell that. I'm focused on Gary Vee and I'm focused on Vee Friends, my Pokemon. So I'm very committed to start traveling podcasts, events, making content, vlogs, and I want to do things with only two groups of people. Icons or kids that I think have the potential to become icons. Talk soon. Yeah. It's the hottest fashion brand in the world. Yeah. Like literally the next kid, but in Europe. It is my joy. Like, I run all these companies the way that somebody skis. You know? Like, I like it. Yeah. Oh, I got a black hat. Come on, green eyes. Yellow base. Matches the shirt. Yeah. I'll see you all later.
