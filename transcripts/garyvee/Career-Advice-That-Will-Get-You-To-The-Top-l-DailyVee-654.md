I spent 24 hours in Melbourne. It's very clear. So many of you are trying to take the next step in your careers, but you just don't know how. How do you chunk up? Here's a take on that. I date trade attention and build businesses. Legacy is greater than currency. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. I just landed in Melbourne off to the hotel going to shower, run right downstairs, meet a gift goat from V-Friends. Basically, we've got the next 14 hours program straight. I made a crucial mistake on the flight. It was 25 hour flight. I woke up eight hours ago, worked the whole way. This is going to be a rough one. See how the energy holds up? A little groggy right now. 25, 26 hours of travel is kind of rough. I got them looking yet it pricks. She liked I like what I'm seeing. Now we up. That's a pleasure. Gary Luke, nice to meet you. Sharao Nasser-Rey-Gir. Such a pleasure. I'll be in hold on, please. This one I really want. Do you want to win a walkway? Yes. Do you want to rest a little more? Probably. Even though I don't think I can win. Oh, that's why you asked me left-sided. That's all I asked you about. I've strained my pack in Chicago and like it's killing me. And left-sided was funny. Do you think I can beat you in arm wrestling? I don't see it. Oh, it's so big. Look at this. It's not. This is all done. On film, fully documented. Are you ready? Yep. Go. 19. That's... You know we're going to edit it with just the place where I won. Thanks Gary, it's lovely to meet you. Enjoy the rest of the show. Such a pleasure. Thank you. Alright, going into a client meeting. So you'll be not filming this. I've been up late. Viewer tape for the sake of it. Heart due to race on stage. I got here to the great ladies. Slidy slide in the rav like a great full tank. I've been clearing space for me. I've been feeling great. Expecting a lot of these crowds. Over the mountains, I think. Literally, if it's one person, I'll just go hard. Like Rick, what's really wild about it is like I generally... Like of course I'd be like, hey, what went wrong? But I wouldn't be like, oh, I suck or this sucks. I'd be like, Rick, you got a fuck. You know, like I can get really hyped. You mean like this? Piece of cake. Just never ever ever talk about something you don't know. I'll see you later. Take care of yourselves. Hello. Hello, hello. Thank you for coming. Yeah, of course. Thank you, brother. It's good to be back. Honestly, I'm looking to provide as much value in this setting as possible and thrilled to answer any question that anybody might have. Can I ask a boring question? You do so much of it. I struggle a lot with like, I guess chunking up the things that I want to do. Because like, I'll have a product I want to do. I'll have something I want to ride. I'll have this I want to do. I'll have to platform the folks on. Like how do you chunk up the things that you do? A couple of things work for me. One, I'm not scared to lose. So I think a lot of times, a lot of people don't do a lot of things because they can't take the L. When you're doing 31 things, like 7 are going to fail quickly. And I'm just okay with that. And I think that's one thing to think about. How old are you? 26. Yeah, I mean there's just some, there's a level of practice to it. Because I like juggling 30 balls because I'm okay with 7 of them breaking. Most people are like petrified for a ball to drop. Pleasure. I'll see you out there. Hi. Pleasure. You okay? Yeah. Thanks for coming down. You ready to rock and roll? So you're going to fire a side chop me and then we're going to do Q&A? Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, that makes a noise! We're ready! Thank you! Has money, mindset, been an issue with all? Or has it just seemed like a bright product to be all? A bright product. Money is good and all. Like I understand what it is. It's just the problem is I just know way too many people with money that are miserable. And this is where luck comes in for sure. I love business. We're living in a nearer where people have put entrepreneurship on a pedestal and a lot of people are forcing themselves to be entrepreneurs when they're not. Self-awareness is what needs to happiness. Not everybody should be an entrepreneur. It takes a real stomach to be an entrepreneur. Everything's on you. People are like, what's your morning routine? I'm like, I wake up and look at my phone to make sure the world's not on fire. Because my Singapore office is open and Australia's open. It's constant anxiety. You got to like it for it not to be anxiety. But if you don't like it and you were not built for it, it fucking is the worst. And I watch entrepreneurship eat up people every day. I think we should go to the audience now. We have a question for Gary. We're going to ask you to do this lineup behind one of these microphones. I highly recommend you get your ass in line. Let's get going. Hi. Hi Gary, my name is Nick Callow. I was part of Eruption 5. I was the Attitude for 26 years and overcame that addiction two and a half years clean now. So I post my journey on social media. I feel I'm making an impact. I'm still trying to get a fucking handle on life and it's a journey I'm learning. We all are. Yeah, yeah. Like I'm impacting people. I'm starting to be consistent in the gym and I'm getting fucking messages. I'm consistent in the gym too. This is amazing. And the thing is I'm unemployed. I'm just wondering do you have any advice of how I can monetize what I'm doing or... I mean, do you want to get a job? Yeah, but that's, this is me. I love, I love posting my journey. But I'm asking you a really practical question because I want you to win. Monetizing is very challenging. Let me explain. You've got to either get brand deals. You've got to either be a big enough creator where you're getting meaningful money from the revenue share of the platforms. Which you have to get a very high level for that. You have to create a product to sell. You can create a course or charge your audience. I think that changes the entire dynamic of it. Yeah. Monetizing is challenging. The reason I'm asking is I think the same tenacity you're attacking this with, applying to 10 or 15 jobs a day with good copy and good videos is something you also have to give a thought to. Yeah. Because I think the stability of having the job 9 to 5 and then do content afterwards might take the anxiety off. Because when you're unemployed, it's on your mind. Yeah, 100%. And then you may, you might actually be sitting on some, this is very important. I want everybody to hear this. You might be sitting on something very powerful, but you have to keep doing it for another three years before it goes to where you want it to. But if you're so anxious to turn it into money, you're going to lose your audience because they're going to feel it. And all you needed to do was get a 9 to 5. Oh my God. I fucking get that. Okay. Yes. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm a bitch. I'm just a guy. That was like more, like a therapy session. Yeah. You know what keep it going. 술 is looking for the right options. That's really brave, actually. So good of you to hear the reason for it. You just got comfortable. I was asking who you were on the video, Pol carboz trilogy with the Ibiza, would you be happy to explain your experience with me? And all you know is that, you know what I'm saying? Well, I'm going to go back to the set picture, you're probably Massachusetts flaggs. I'm a pleasure. You know, I wanna go in through these lines of a hundred people and taking these quick selfies. You know, I'm pathetic that the event is normally trying to get through everybody. They're probably being apathetic to me and wanna get me home. It's a long day. But the reality is, is like having that microsecond, seeing how people are doing, making sure I connect with them, you know, is very important to me. Walking into a client dinner at 8 to 10 clients. So really double dipping here between the, you know, speaking tour and VaynerMedia business development. Anytime you can get two for the price of one, it's always good. So we're gonna go in here. I'm gonna meet with some VaynerSports past people right after this. Of course, have a wonderful evening. So we'll see you in Sydney. A lot of things I think about is doing things when it's hard. We flew from New York to San Francisco, San Francisco to Melbourne. We're in the air for 24 hours. We land, we shower, and we go right at it. You saw everything we're doing, like fucking meetings and the meetings and the meetings and keynotes and meetings and lines. Now I'm sitting with two gentlemen who own VaynerSports passes, who AJ calls me, you know, three weeks ago and says, hey, there's a couple of holders of VaynerSports pass. They live in Australia. I'd love for you to meet them. And they're in Melbourne. Well, my Melbourne name was super duper packed. And like, as you can imagine, after 14 hours sitting in the lobby of the hotel at midnight and chopping it up with these guys for an hour, that is challenging. But the reality is so many of you that are watching here, you want the finished product. Well, these are the details. Like, are you willing to do something for your community? Are you willing to sit here and bring value? I sat there for an hour and answered all the business questions and I was locked in. Just doing it's not enough. You got to do it right. Meaning I wouldn't do it if I was gonna mail it in because I'm gonna leave a bad impression. And that's a waste of, you know, energy on both sides. And so, you know, this is just a clip to wrap up the day. The reality is I'm fucking exhausted at this point. And the question is, if you want it, like there are gonna be moments where you're gonna go harder and stronger and deeper than, you know, maybe you even want to. Sometimes you gotta go a little bit deeper, especially, and this is the key here, especially for all of you that are talking that shit.
