## Transcript
You don't know if your sacrifices are gonna pay dividends, but you will know that if you don't go for them in your 80s and 90s, you will sit and talk about regret, which is the ultimate poison in society. SnapChat, I got a secret. Daily fuckin' V is back. Batman in the building. But what you do know is you hate your job right now and you're not that happy. So one thing you know, you know that you're not fuckin' pumped. So the fuck's the alternative? You know sometimes doing like little things like this, like mindless five minutes in a world where I'm like maximizing every two minutes. Like, Babin's about to be reminded that I have every fucking second. But like two minutes of like setting up my little screen. Motherf*****. Going into a meeting right now. One of the things I'm looking to do a lot more of is I'm gonna be able to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more of is business development with big brands and VFriends, the IP. Start thinking about, you know, collaboration partnerships. One of the things we're a leader of is live social shopping. Let's put a definition of live social shopping right here. And commerce, payment, something I'm talking a lot about. And for brands, most brands have to figure out live shopping. The QVC application of social media is here. Good morning, Gary. Good morning, how are you? I'm doing fantastic. You're not doing what you're doing right now and accomplishing what you're accomplishing without being smart enough to realize like a lot is gonna happen in the 3PL world over the next 36 months. And it's either gonna be really remarkable or a chapter that leads to a lot of grinding in years four, five, six, and seven to even get back into the opportunity that you're in right now. And I'm sure that's not lost on you. Yep, yep, no, you nailed it. I told the team that I wanted to open the first episode of this tweet that I saw a few weeks ago. Let's do it. The tweet's not wrong. I've been full-pledged, and I mean full-pledged this. And honestly, in a lot of ways, this is my life. You know, we are heading into, and this is why I'm documenting, we are heading into the chapter of me being Gary Vaynerchuk, the CEO, founder, creator, inventor of VFRIENDS. I'm going into my Walt Disney era. I'm going into my Jim Henson era. After 18 months of really being head down Vayner, media VaynerX, VFRIENDS, executive Gary Vaynerchuk, in a lot of ways today is day one of Gary V coming back. I'm doing an open pack. You have a pack on you? Yeah. Let's fucking go. It should be a big part of Gary V. We should open packs. And you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna talk about the attributes. So, all right, entrepreneur L first. I mean, this was layup city on the first one. Obviously a very important character. Entrepreneurship is a skill. It's a skill that you can get better at like skiing. Some of you are born entrepreneurs. You're the ones that need to fight the system. Fuck the school system, fuck everything. Cause that's not built for it. All this other shit, like follow your intuition, have those talks with your parents. And there's others of you that want to be entrepreneurs cause miraculously, especially in the middle of my life, it got cool. Wasn't cool when I was a kid, but it's cool now. Be careful if you're one of those kids. Don't force it. It's okay to be a number two. It's okay to be a number three at a company. It's okay to be a teacher. It's okay to be a firefighter. It's okay to be a stay at home mom or dad. It's okay to be a chef. It's okay to be a lot of things. Everything's okay. Going into a little bit of a power breakfast with Mark Shapiro right before Chrome day. Hello, but gotta get this meeting in. It needs to be okay for you. And if you force wanting to be an entrepreneur cause it looks cool and you think that's where the money is, you're gonna fail anyway. Hi, Babin. I just met with Mark Shapiro, big dog at CKO, WE, UFC, and just a fucking match. Such a good dude. I just love smart and nice fucking people. Nice guys finish first. All right, next sketch to screen. This shows my original drawing to the way it shows up on cartoons now. Can you headstrong, honey badger? I like being headstrong. Not too far though. Be friends is always about the middle. If you're too headstrong, you're stubborn. If you're properly headstrong, you're convicted. I have a lot of conviction. I'm headstrong about my shit. You've seen this for years, Babin. A lot of shit I believed in that nobody else believed in became true. That's good shit. Being stubborn about something based on insecurity or not believing in change because you don't make your money that way, that fucks up people. A lot of people are about to be overly headstrong, AKA stubborn about AI, but you can use it instead of it killing you. And that's the difference. That's why I headstrong like most of these attributes. All in balance. If you're too entrepreneurial and you don't think about your family, you're not gonna be a happy life. Everything's about balance and be friends. Find the middle. Purple, not red or blue. Hello. Welcome. I'm Liz. Liz, Gary. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Okay, we are all about pragmatic action steps here on the podcast. So I would love one pragmatic action step that anybody listening who does have that fear of being perceived as being judged could take to get to the place that you are now. Take your phone right now, make a video, and tell the world what you suck at. And post it. That shit's fucking hard. It's easy to hide. It's easy to be cynical. It's easy to deploy hate. That shit's easy. The other stuff is hard. Accountability, hard. Deploying love in the face of hate, being the bigger person, hard, hard. You really have to ask yourself how many of your decisions do you make day to day, month to month, year to year, based on what other people think? And I would argue almost everyone listening right now has their balance way off on this. It was so nice to meet you. Pleasure. Thank you. You're just an absolute delight. Thank you. My brother. Stay well. Thank you. Next, the speckle. Bang! Sweet swan. Now sweet swan. Here's some alpha for defense. Sweet swan is not named sweet as she's sweet. Sweet as in cool. Remember when sweet was like a slang term? Remember NWO? When they were like just two. Sweet! Sweet swan is less, she's a sweetie. It's more that she's like fucking rad. Like fucking epic. Like phenomenal. Like I'm sweet. You know, like a late 90s, early 2000 slang term for like fucking having Riz or fucking being awesome. Like that shit. I dropped out of college so in a way Vayner was like my college so to speak. You know where I was. Bro, there's not one fucking college teaching marketing that teaches anything close to what Vayner teaches people that just by them working there. It's not even fucking close. You don't learn marketing in a fucking book written 20 years ago. Exactly. I just feel so equipped. It's making it so easy for me to have the confidence I need in the space. You know, it's funny. Gavin's here filming DailyVee, one who filmed me for a long time. One of my favorite things that happens in our world is the kids don't realize how good they're getting. Cause we're playing the most contemporary game. And when they go to other things, they're like, well fuck, I'm like ahead of everybody. But like, you know, and so that makes me so happy. I'm happy to hear that brother. And kudos to you for putting in the work and extracting that value while you were at Vayner. Cause a lot of people don't do that either. And so that's, you're welcome. But thank you for being one of the people that actually like did the work to be able to have it as an advantage under next chapter. Thank you, Gary. And finally, the gracious grizzly bear. This is a trait a lot of people struggle with. A lot of you are not gracious. You know, like graciousness, being gracious is a very, very, very admirable trait. You know, it's like, it's having that level of confidence where you also are really not getting too high in your own supply. Like, I really like when someone's gracious. It's a very classy trait. And I wanted some, a lot of people think graciousness is a feminine, you know, thing, which is why I made, here's a little more alphabets, why I made a grizzly bear gracious, right? Like a big scary fucking bear. But, you know, don't judge a book by its cover as a very big part of it, be friends. So that's it. Be friends, tops Chrome available now. Be friends.com slash Chrome if you wanna get updates. Yeah, so the day was great. I went to the coffee shop at like 7.30 before I worked out and Babbo was there. I'm going to get my coffee. Babbo's already ready. Came into the office, had a busy dev meeting with a 3PL. Did some phone calls. Had a breakfast with Mark Shapiro. Then did Liz Moody's podcast. Traveled back, did some calls. Had some banking meetings. Did some sports card stuff. Worked shop some vFriends future products. Did some admin work. And I've been grinding since like seven until now it's 1126 PM. Just catching up on all my other work that I have to for Vayner and vFriends. And now in 34 minutes I'm going live. At midnight, the official day of tops Chrome is here. The signature product in the journey of me building this intellectual property. This is hopefully my Pokemon trading cards, you know? Things that happened in the late 90s, mid 90s that kind of changed Pokemon forever. That's the swing I'm making really. I think I eat my own dog food as you know. Probably the thing that people like you that have gotten to know me up close and personal is I live what I talk about. Like I work hard, I'm a good dude. And I'm living my truth. And the other thing I believe in is take big swings. It's a big ass swing. I'm trying to be Stan fucking Lee. I'm trying to be Walt Disney. I'm trying to be Jim Henson. That's big shit. Not lost on me. But I think I can do it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, five, four, three, two, one. So you have one minute. So you can kind of work from that way. Yeah, it takes a minute or two for them. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. We are live on the show. It is officially May 7th on the East Coast. Yeah, whatever. Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Rips! Rips! I literally put it. Oh! Oh! Oh! You in?
