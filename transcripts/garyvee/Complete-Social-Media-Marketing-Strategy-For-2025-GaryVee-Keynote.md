The ROI of a basketball for LeBron James is billions of dollars. For me, Gary Vaynerchuk, negative 40,000. I've torn both meniscuses. It's cost me some money. The thing that is most misunderstood in the business and marketing world right now is that people speak about social in a blank statement. Don't sit here and do what all of you do, which is put your head in the sand when a wave comes. Go find your surfboard and ride that wave. This whole room just stood up that Google searches a dominant force in their business and in 48, 50, 66 months that behavior will be gone. Very hard to click a fucking Google ad when you don't even go to Google in the first place. Wake up. There is not even a close second in activity that can grow your business to a proper organic social media execution. That means for this room, taking a step back in understanding how do I post a video and picture every single day on social media on all five to seven major platforms to grow my business? Let me explain it in detail. How many people here do social media for their business? Raise your hand. How many people feel like it's the disproportionate reason your business is growing? Raise your hand. Great. So 80 to 90% of this room raised their hand when I said do it. Three humans raised their hand when they said it was the driver. The opportunity is undeniable. The math supports it dramatically. The reason three humans raised their hand at it is they are good at it. That is a very small percentage. That is the punchline of why I came here today. What has happened in social over the last couple of years, two of the 15-year journey of social, is profoundly important to everyone here. I have been giving this talk in a variation because I so believed in this movement basically since 2007. That is 17 years of this. In the first 15 years of me giving this talk to these kind of events, it was more like email marketing. You had to amass as many followers as possible with your content. And then when you would post, a percentage of them would see it. I think that's going to make sense to everybody. I think everybody can agree that even if you are a very basic understanding of social marketing, the understanding of get followers and those people would see it, a percentage of them was the model. That is why as time went on and people in this room that are very behind on it, it would become daunting. If I sat here today and said, okay, get a million followers and then post, and that might be good. And don't forget, a lot of you, like most businesses on earth, are doing business within a regional area. So getting 100,000 followers and you're in Dayton, Ohio, and only 17 are in Dayton, Ohio, you're like, Gary, get off the stage. I don't give a shit. Here's what's happened in the last two years. Five years ago, you can find videos of me online where I'm yelling at the top of my lungs, asking, begging people to get on TikTok. At the time, most, at the time, there was none of this China talk and all the other stuff that's in your head. It was, people didn't want to get on it because they just thought it was for 14-year-old girls dancing. What I knew is they were just saying the same shit they told me about Facebook. I know a lot of you, when you first heard about Facebook 15 years ago, didn't think it was going to mean anything for your business because it was just college kids. These platforms all tend to do the same thing. They tend to age up. The reason I was yelling about TikTok is, and that story I told you earlier, obvious to all of you, was that Facebook and Twitter were huge, home-run investments. What is less obvious to all of you was that Tumblr should have been the biggest company of them all. Tumblr of the three companies, and by the way, I did great on Tumblr. I invested at $4 million. They sold it for a billion to Yahoo. But it still should have been bigger because what Tumblr understood in 2008 was what Facebook and Twitter did was they built social media, the social graph, who you were friends with. And that's what you would see. But I think all of you know, especially for how it happened and it started with college kids, as you get older, as you live your life, your friends change. Their interest in your interest can possibly change, and your aunt posting about her pet pig was not necessarily the coolest thing that you could see in your feed. What Tumblr understood was what you're interested in tends to be stickier and could follow you. I've loved The New York Jets since 1982. That is a much deeper, longer relationship for me than most of the friends' acquaintances and things that have funneled through. That is what social media, on the back of what TikTok did three years ago, four years ago, has evolved into. I'm gonna assume that the people in this room that open TikTok or Facebook or Twitter or any platform are starting to realize they're seeing things they're interested in now more than just things that they would follow. This is called the interest graph. This is the single most important thing for the people in this room. When I look at this room, and I'm gonna say this, I'm just so you understand. I don't give a shit about social media. Could care less. I'm not a techie. The only reason I'm talking about social media is it's what's working right now. If this was 2001, I'd be thrilled to talk to you about email and Google. If we're doing this in 16 years, I'm thrilled to talk about VR and AR and whatever else. I have no emotion, zero emotion, to where consumers' attention is. I have emotion to grow in my business. Sitting in this room knowing that the average operator in this room who's doing three to $10 million has the actual ability to go from three to six or seven to 13 or 10 to 20 completely on the back of what's happening on social right now, as you can imagine, inspires me to yapp on this stage. What I also know is that 98% of you are gonna do nothing about what I'm about to talk about for the next hour. It's just the way it always happens. I'll be very frank. This is why I'm excited about the Q&A. I'm desperate to figure out which three to six people in this room are gonna listen to me and do something about it. Breaking it down simply, I believe however you do this, preferably by you not hiring your 23-year-old niece and thinking she gets it, and that's why it's gonna work. I need everybody here to understand what I'm about to say. I am asking you desperately to produce one to two videos and pictures a day, brand new ones every day. And then when you post them on TikTok and YouTube shorts, LinkedIn and Facebook, you slightly tweak those videos and pictures and the copy that supports it based on the platform you are on. Everybody here is common sense smart enough to know that if you post organically on Facebook, that is likely to hit an older demo than if you're gonna post on TikTok. Everybody here is smart enough to know, even maybe through their own behavior, that when you are yourself on LinkedIn, you're slightly in a different mindset than when you yourself are on Instagram. And that when you post on what you do, plumbing, pooling, electric, HVAC, that when you post on LinkedIn, contextualizing, for example, are you very busy because you're always traveling for work? Is a good opening sentence on LinkedIn that is less of a good opening sentence on TikTok? If you make an original video and an original picture every day and you post them on all five to seven platforms, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat even is exploding with spotlight is acting more like TikTok and Instagram. Facebook, YouTube shorts, these platforms, Twitter, Twitter is making a significant change to keep up with everybody. So you'll be seeing their video tab bumping to prominence over the next couple months. So you can see more video on there, the way you do on Instagram and TikTok. What I'm excited about, focused on, is telling you what happens next. And what always happens. The next question I'm sure that is running through a lot of your heads in a world where you might be posting once on your social media, a week, a month, once every two months, three times a month, is what the hell am I gonna post? Like cool, thanks Gary, but what? What I think you should post is things of value. Let me explain what that means. For example, in this industry, one of the most significant posts all of you can start with or a framework that you can start with is literally titling the video, so you don't have to hire me. I'm sure a lot of you know that a lot of human beings call you to help them when it's literally the dumbest shit of all time that they're struggling with. Literally a switch, literally a wire, literally nothing. But they don't know, you do. To me, trust and reputation is an unbelievable reason why so many of you are in this room. It's inconceivable to me in this sector and this room that a lot of you have not built on word of mouth on execution for decades for some of you. To me, extending that to the rest of the world is going to work. Videos that teach people the cliche mistakes that people make, educating them for real, truly deciding when you make a video or a picture that you're not there for the sale, you're there for the reputation. When I started Wine Library TV, let me go back to my career, how it exploded. At first I thought I was gonna do QVC. Literally when I told the stock boy to go to Best Buy and get a camera, I'm like, I'm gonna sell so much fucking wine on this. Like I was in full home shopping network, QVC. Literally the camera sits down. It was, you know how sometimes in life your brain can think of like a million things in a nanosecond? The camera goes on, I literally say hello, welcome to my first episode, and my brain goes to, huh, I think this is gonna work. If this is gonna work, everyone's gonna know me. Huh, I better really tell them what I think about the wine, whether I wanna sell it or not, because what if I find myself in an event and somebody hands me a glass of wine and says, what do you think of this? And I say, it's crap, and they're like, got you. You said this was good on the show. I was like scared of like the Dateline guy. I was like, wait. This is literally what I'm thinking in the first eight seconds of my first video ever. And in that video, I literally decided, actually how many people are into wine? Raise your hand, just curious. So wine spectator, all these things, I realized, wait a minute, I'm not gonna be a merchant, I'm gonna be a publication. I'm gonna review this wine, how I see it. Literally in the first couple weeks of Wine Library TV, my father and best friend and cousin, the core of us, the three of us that worked at that store, literally thought I'd lost my mind. In like the third episode, there was a white wine that I was reviewing, we had like a hundred cases of it in the basement, and I think I compared it to like your cat peeing on your rug and you not cleaning it up. Not the kind of thing that makes people wanna go out and buy it and drink it. And that decision, which was very confusing to my family at the time, was the foundation of what I stand on today. You can make content about the tricks of the trade, the things you know, the things that they could do at home so they don't have to call you. Literally the biggest reason they will then call you. You can do videos, this is gonna be a real curve ball, just if you're asking me how the heck are you gonna make a video every day, you can do videos, here's a good one. Actually, how many people here do commercial work? Not just for residential, I'm just curious, just raise your hands, please, I apologize, just a little higher. Here's a huge one, no joke, you can literally do videos reviewing the businesses that you did work for. You can make a video that reviews the pizza at the pizza store that you did work for. And I'm gonna get to why this is gonna work. You can literally do videos of your interests if you're into golf or fishing or barbecuing or watching Dancing with the Stars. You can do a video about something that has nothing to do with your business, but your bio, your bio has your business. The PS in your copy can mention your business. You can literally make a Dancing with the Stars video and complain about what happened last night and then put at the end PS, if you need XYZ service, here's my phone number. These are tactics that work. Now here's where it gets ridiculously interesting. I'm gonna get a little nerdy. Here's why this is important. Let's say 23 of you get inspired and actually start doing this. Let's call a spade a spade. The first three, four weeks are gonna be a disaster. Most of you are gonna make a video. Somebody's gonna get pumped by this talk, especially when you get into the Q and A, and you're gonna go home, and you're gonna post a video, and it's gonna get seven views. And you're gonna be like, that motherfucker. And the next one's gonna get nine. And the next one's gonna get 23. Back in the day, prior first 15 years of this, they would have all gotten like 10, 6, 7, 9, and that would have been forever until you like built up a list. In today's world, some of you who are committed to what you're hearing are gonna get into it, and for some reason it's gonna click, and you're gonna make a video after a month of sixes and nines and 11s. You're committed, you're not a quitter, you felt it, you understand, and for some reason, some video's gonna get 2,000. 2,000 views. You're not going into the viral Hall of Fame, you're not Charlie D'Amelio or Logan Paul, but you got 2,000 and you normally get seven. I heard AI mentioned on this stage prior to coming out. AI is everywhere. Let me tell you the only AI I'm worried about right now in marketing. It's the AI that is on the back of these algorithms that make the content find the right audience. When you get 2,000, you earned it. When you get 2,000 views, you earned it because the quality of the video was a little bit more interesting than anything you did before. This is when you strike, let me explain. This is where it's gonna get very practical to all of you, because you're looking at a kid that grew up on direct mail and Google AdWords. This video now gets 2,000. You now take that video, and you now run that video as an ad in a 10-mile radius of your office. What you were doing in modern social media now is you're posting for creative validation. The algorithms are so remarkable now that when you post, the organic results will give you the indication of what to actually spend money on. You now know that ad has relevance. You now can spend money against it locally. This will give you the highest propensity of that ad actually converting into business. When you switch it to an ad, you might even change the copy and be a little bit more salesy with it. It's an ad. This model, very simple, yet hard, simple what I told you, not complicated. I'll break it down again. Social media's converted into full validation if the creative is good. This has taken out all the risk of advertising. All the money that I've ever lost in advertising in my life, and it has got to be an ungodly amount at this point in my life, has been based on the fact that the video or the picture, or the ad, wasn't good enough. I know this. I did so much direct mail, so much full page ads, so much radio, so much social media. I know sometimes it crushed, and sometimes it doesn't. This model that I'm describing has transcended my father's business recently. My dad, obviously I built my dad's business, then I left and started my own kind of career during that time. I think it was a little blurry to my dad how much impact I really had on the business. I get it, he's a proud dude. The business started to decline after I left, because you know, when LeBron leaves the calves, they suck. It's all about players. He calls me back in, he's like, I need your help. I was very happy to help him. I invented something. As a matter of fact, for everybody who raised their hand with wine, this might be the only thing that you want to write down this whole show. I invented something called Wine Text for him, WineText.com. It literally, you remember Groupon, the deal of day stuff? You literally get a text every day. I think today's is a $38 white wine that you can buy for 13 bucks. You reply with a number. It comes, you literally reply with a number four. It comes to your house. It is literally the easiest way to buy any product in the world. This exploded my dad's business inflated by COVID because I got it out right before. And yet with me re-exploding my dad's business, four months ago he calls me and goes, six months ago, excuse me, he goes, my customer count in the store is really down. I want them. I go, what do you mean you want them? He goes, I want more customers in the store. I said, why? He said, cause. I said, but dad, WineText is crushing. Like, we're better off doing that. But my dad built this. Actually, anybody here from New Jersey? Yeah, has anybody been to the Wine Library in Springfield, New Jersey? Thank you, fellas. Tell them, it's a fucking palace. It's 40,000 square feet. It's made with mahogany. My dad made this like a palace. The Russians, he thought he was a czar. You know, and so he's emotional because I told him at the time when we built the business, the building in 2003, I said, dad, it's a mistake, we're putting too much money and people are gonna go online. You all know this, now there's fucking GoPuff and door dad, like you don't wanna go anywhere. You just want stuff to come to you. Convenience is king. Another insight to things to think about in this next chapter. Punchline. He gets obsessed with having more customers. My great flaw in my life is I like making my dad happy. So I literally run for the last six months what I've been telling you. Social, five, 10, 15 mile radius. It's gone so well. I'm starting to make private label wines for the towns around us. Like there's a town called Chatham, New Jersey next to us. We created a wine named Chatham Neighborhood. Like put a label on it, good wine label, and just running it local. The amount of attention on Facebook and Instagram, Facebook specifically. If I bought your business tomorrow, the model I'm asking you for, I want you to be on every platform, but where I really want you to run the ads is Facebook. I want you to run the five and 10 and 15 mile radius ads on Facebook. Okay, I'm gonna leave that for a more cup because I think the Q and A will answer a lot more. I'm gonna ask the people in the back to throw up my slides real quick, my main slide. I wanna show you all something. Those books on the top right are the books that I wrote. It's all New York Times bestselling books. My mom is very proud of that. But the thing I wanna bring up is the second one. Ironically, the second one, the orange one, the thank you economy, is my least commercially successful book. Still crushed, but out of all of them, it is the least successful business book I've sold. Interestingly enough though, it might be the most important, which is a real insight to how humans work. I wanna talk to you about the thank you economy for a few minutes. I believe, thank you so much, you could put it down, I believe that the only thing, if you were like, hey Gary, bad news, it's illegal for us in this industry to do social media marketing. Now what? I'm like, I got another move. It's called the thank you economy. The premise of the thank you economy that I wrote in 2011 was that the internet was changing so much that there was an opportunity to take advantage of the fact that people are just living online to grow your business by, stick with me here now, being kind. Let me explain. In the book, when the book came out, unfortunately, that's right, it didn't make the book, but something happened in my wine store that I wanna tell you a story of that I think will be another move for the people that are not on prevent defense, but an extreme offense in these next 24 months, which will be challenging because there shouldn't be as much demand. Everybody spent all their money and did all their shit. You are now fully in, I need to take more market share away from the people in my general area. Let there be no confusion. You can wait it out all you want. People are miraculously not gonna have a need for your stuff more. It is going to be a 24, 36, 48, it's just real life. I think that's fine. I actually think if you decided to schlep out to this conference, you're on offense and you're here to grow. And so that's why I'm motivated to go into this part. Thank you, economy's premises that you can actually do many things. For example, no matter what town anybody here does business in, you can literally open your phone right now, open Instagram, type in the name of your town. Type it in, Short Hills, New Jersey, whatever it is. Actually, some of you do this while I'm talking. Go to Instagram, go to the top search, type in your town. What you'll notice, maybe most of you have probably never done this. When you type in the name of your town, your town will show up. You click it. It will show you pictures that were posted in your town. These are people that you could do business with. You could, because I have, you could look at all those pictures and from your business account on Instagram, reply like a gracious, normal, kind neighbor. Your dog is cute. Your lawn looks great. Cool. Thumbs fucking up emoji. Whatever you're in the mood to do. Ironically, I don't know if you know this, most people don't get a ton of comments and they are thrilled to get any. And because you said thank you or good job or lovely, they now know you exist because most of them don't as you all know. That's just a for instance of what I would have said if I wrote thank you economy today. That the world is playing out publicly, which is insane. And if you want to put in the effort and you're not, I noticed what I didn't say. I didn't say go to all those posts and say, call me now to fix your fucking pool. No, no. No closing on the first move. A little romance goes a very long way. Tell them ladies. I believe this in 2011. I had an idea. I said to my internet department, I said every single order that comes in, Google the person's name, see if you can find who they are and then find them on Twitter. It's 2011. This is, Jesus, 13 years ago, it's crazy, time flies. So a lot of people have very common names so it's kind of hard to figure out. But finally they found a name and the team calls me and says, we found someone. I said good, you found them on Twitter? Yes, we found the gentleman on Twitter. I said who bought a very low end Pinot Grigio. I don't think it was Santa Margarita, but this gentleman literally bought like a hundred dollar case of Pinot Grigio, eight bucks a bottle, shipped to Chicago. Nothing, we made like $3.09 on the whole order. Before overhead, we'd lost money on the order. But they found him and they said, we found his Twitter. I'm on the phone, I'm like, what's he tweeting about? They go, we'll read him to you. Here are the tweets, ironically ties back down. Probably why I'm telling the story of how I opened this talk. I'm like, read the tweets. They're like, Bears, stop doing that. Jay Cutler, why'd you do that? Jay Cutler, I love you. Jay Cutler, stop throwing touch up. Jay Cutler, great touch up. Jake, this guy was obsessed with the Bears. Jay Cutler for all the football fans, if you remember, was the quarterback at the time. The team goes, what do you want us to do? I said, go to eBay and buy a Jay Cutler signed jersey and send it to him with a note that says, thank you for shopping at Wine Library. They're like, the jersey's like 400 bucks. I'm like, I don't give a shit. Send it to him, done. I'm like now pumped. I'm like, I finally found something. This is my thesis, the thank you economy. Here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna send this Jay Cutler jersey to him. The guy bought a dinky $100 case of wine. He's gonna get this framed Jay Cutler jersey with a note. Thank you from the Wine Library. He's gonna lose his mind. He's gonna tweet about it constantly. He's gonna convert all his business and all his friends are gonna come and shop with us. This is gonna be a great case study for my thesis. I did a bunch of versions of this, but this is the one that really has a good story to it. I'm pumped. And then four weeks go by and nothing happens. I'm like, this son of a bitch is so fucking ungrateful. And then I'm boarding a plane to go to Napa to go taste wine to buy for the store. And then I get a phone call. Hey, hey, you'll never believe what happened. And just the way he said it, I knew it was that, because that was a month later, I really kind of forgot about it. I go, the Cutler guy did something. He said, no. I said, no. He said, we just got a $6,000 order from Plano, Texas. I'm like, okay, for a bunch of high end burgundy and Barolo. I'm like, okay. He goes, I wanna read you the note that came on the order. I'm like, okay. Hey, Wine Library, can you please hold these wines? Cause it's the summer here in Texas and I don't want the wines to be shipped in this weather to be compromised. PS, your prices on red burgundy are remarkable. Can somebody call me? I have a very big seller in collection. I'd like to see if you have some other things. PSS, my friend who you sent to Jay Cutler Jersey too told me about your store. PSSS, I'm a huge Bruce Springsteen fan. If you go home from this conference, have no interest in doing social because I don't know. You don't like growing and you've decided to use your subjective opinions of the state of the union of the world to not do social media marketing cause you're scared it's ruining the kids or you're worried about China. You're allowed to do whatever the fuck you want. You're not my kids, you're not my siblings. I don't care. If you do not wanna do that, there's something else you can do. When you go home, I believe that if you call every single person you've ever done business with over the last five years and said, hi, I'll use Peter Holland here. If I'm reading my eyes, Peter. Hey Peter, Holland, it's Gary. Just calling you. I know we obviously work, you know, we did some work for you for 18 months ago. Just checking in if it's going well. Is everything fine? Good, thank you. Hope you have the best day. That's the lowest thing you can do. Number two, you could also remember, cause so many of you do, or the people that work with you do, you could also remember that Peter liked wine or like the Kansas City Chiefs, or had 16 dartboards in his basement cause I don't know, he's a fucking dart enthusiast. You could go buy a $50 dartboard and send it to him with a note and say, hey, just wanted to thank you for your business 18 months ago. I believe that if you scale the unscalable. Right, we're in the whole talks of AI now, and everything's so efficient, and it's all technology. And I think if you go back to doing business, the way that our great grandparents did it, and call, not new people who are gonna give you money, no, no, no, thank people that already gave you money, that those people will actually on that action, even more than the quality work you did, the gesture of kindness when it was not expected, even a phone call or a letter or some flowers, chocolates, a bottle of wine. That that itself will substantially grow your business while everybody else is on defense. You have two choices, in my opinion. The choice you don't have is to keep doing what you're doing, because I know that whoever does social hardcore organically, and then has the right model, will outflank you locally, or the person that goes most old school. Do not be in the middle, it is the worst place. Go OG OG, thank you economy, or go new school, new school, social media, plumber of the year, but don't be here, because here sucks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Do we have questions? We only have a hundred questions. Okay, is that true? Can we just clap it up? That means the world to me, thank you. That's awesome. All right. So obviously I'm not gonna be able to get to all that, so real quick, can we throw up my slide? For everybody's question, I don't get to. One of my favorite things to do, I have a tech service. This goes back to scaling the unscalable. I have almost a half a million people that follow me on text. It's a platform called Community. That's my text number. Literally when I go on long flights, I'm going to London next week to watch my New York Jets destroy the Vikings. Eat it, Minnesota. If you text me your question, if I don't get to it, I'll hope I'll get a couple hours on that flight to catch up on text. So anyway, nonetheless, go ahead, sir. All right, so how important is personality in point of view when developing social media? Okay, not to suppose these are important. Yeah, I mean, look, if you're boring as shit, and you're like a piece of paper, nobody's good, it's not gonna work. But by the way, you don't need to be in the content. This is the brain twist. Do I believe that people buy from people? Yes. Do I believe that if you explode off screen and they're charismatic, I think that will work. Let me throw you a curveball. I've watched people that are boring as hell on video, but know their shit doing incredibly well. You're in a business where people want to know the goods. Like, as a matter of fact, you're in a business where if you're overly charismatic, people may not hire you because they think you're a shister. So be you, but also know you don't have to be in the content. Some of you are introverted. Some are incredibly private. You don't want to be. By the way, actually, how many people here do follow me and have a sense of who I am? Raise your hands. Thank you, Humboldt. You all know what I'm about to say. I'm one of the most prolific posters of content in the world, and I never share my personal life. That's for me. I don't need to share my kids or a dog or my relationships to get likes. I keep that for me. You're in control of what you post. So you can do a lot of things. As a matter of fact, I really like the idea of some of you that are really in the trenches of your work, videoing from your perspective. You know, going back to like teaching people how not to hire you, making a video of just showing people how to do one little fix, that might need to come from this perspective where we just see your hands. Especially if you're all tatted up like this dude, it's awesome. So I think that, yes, personality, of course. Like this goes back to three people raising their hand. Like plenty of people have heard this talk from me, gone at it for a year, and have gotten very little results because they themselves are not good at it. So there is a skill set to it, but there's a lot of ways to attack it, a lot of ways to attack it. You could film an entire scene, plumbing, pool, electric, and then do a voiceover and explain what the video is about. There's a lot of ways to attack it. You don't have to just be the front man or woman. How long should the videos be? Like what's too long, what's too short? Too long is when it sucks. Too short is when it's great. I've seen unlimited trash, garbage, atrocious six second vine videos back in the day, and I've seen remarkable one hour 45 minute videos. It's a quality thing. There's no right time. There's is it good or isn't it bad? You know what's awesome? At this point, it's not 2007. Everybody here, everybody here, has consumed content in social. You know what I'm saying is right. You've seen things that in two seconds, you're like, see ya, boring, no. And you've seen things that in the beginning, you're starting to watch, you're like, how the hell did I just watch this for 19 minutes? So there's no time variable. So couple of questions. Let's start with this. Thank you, great question. First and foremost, actually, first and foremost, I need everybody here to do 10 to 15 hours of homework on what I just talked about. Like Google, a book, my latest book, throw it up. Thank you, day training attention, really goes into it. Just throw it up real quick, the slide please. The purple one next to the kid's book I just put out. Day training attention, I need you to read it or listen to it. On the record, I could give a shit if you buy it. I don't need the eight cents that I get from every book sale. You can go to something called Pirate Bay and steal it. I don't give a fuck. I don't care about the book sale. I care that you actually know in detail what I'm talking about, because it will change your business. Whether you use that book, whether you use Google or YouTube, some of you learn audio. I have no reading comprehension I've learned, which is why I don't read books, but everything I ever hear, I remember forever. So obviously, audio book works for me or videos. First and foremost, brother, they have to know it. How the hell are you gonna judge an outside agency or an employee if they're good at this if you have no fucking idea how this works? And I don't wanna hear that you didn't grow up with this. You didn't grow up driving and you figured it out. How many people here are retiring in the next five years? And I don't mean you're gonna crush it and buy an island. I mean, you're old and you're finished. Raise your hands. Who's retiring in the next five years? Raise your hands. I mean it actually. I'm actually dead serious. Who's retiring in the next five years? Okay, for the 11 of you, maybe you can hold your, maybe this strategy can work. But for the rest of you, you better pay attention to what I'm talking about. Cause if you're not gonna do what I'm telling you, somebody else is and they're gonna take your business. And your private equity firm is not gonna help you. This is the fucking jungle. So fight. So anyway, who should do it? You should hire someone. My preference is that you learn how to do it for six months. That's free, right? That just takes away from Netflix or some other dumb shit a meeting that's two hours. That's really 30 fucking minutes. You know that we're doing that all the time. So you learn it for six months. Then you can hire people, whether it's your niece or an outside agency or somebody internally. But if you don't know how to judge it, what are we doing? That's why it hasn't worked for 99% of you already. You don't know how to judge it. I believe that this approach to social media and marketing on the 99% of the time customers are coming to us because something's wrong. How do you turn your meeting into a long term? You don't. This is why I need you to post every day. I need you to post every day because we don't know the day that somebody's gonna be in market. That's why car companies market their asses off every day. That's called business. Sorry, you fucking picked the industry, not me. I like that one. Dustin, please clip that. I'm definitely putting that on LinkedIn. All right, so this might be a tough one. What metrics imagine to prove the times that's spent on social versus working on other platforms, parts of business? Sales, like leads, real life. I mean, this is unequivocally undeniably the truth of where the attention is. And we see it. And again, one of the reasons, you know, I'm being very, I mentioned it earlier. I'm not really doing a lot of events. I'm being very selective. I have the fortune. This is why I feel so warm in this room. I have a lot of friends, relatives, acquaintances that are in this business. Like, as you can imagine, I've been more forceful on them than on a stage with people I don't know for an hour. The metric after a year, don't do it in the first week. You know, this is why everyone loves Google. Google isn't marketing, Google is sales. You know that, right? Google sales. Someone types in a need and then comes to you, it's intent-based marketing. You're not building brand. You're paying Google a toll booth to send you a lead. Google is sales. That's why people like it. You can measure it very good. Oh, you know, brand is a whole different animal. Brand is the game. Brand comes through social and content. You can turn it into sales when you do that converted ad that I told you about after you do some, well, this is why I need you to get into details, but you should measure it based on your business results. So, I'm gonna try to answer some of your questions. But real quick, if we're talking about AI, sorry, brother. But real quick, how many people here, by the way, a lot of my business is served this way, so I'll raise my hand. How many people here really use Google? It's a real driver of their business. Raise your hands. Actually, stand up. I'm sorry to, it's the morning, let's get the blood flow. Don't be lazy. I'm doing this because I want everybody to visualize. So, I'm so glad we got to this. Look around before I let everybody sit down. All right, please sit down. Thank you. We could call it pretty much the room. Relies on Google. Does everybody understand that Google search is fundamentally dead within the next seven years? That everyone's going to AI? That chat GPT just wiped out this entire room? Everybody who just stood up just told me that the yellow pages is their life. You know, again, there's 11 people who are retiring, so they don't give a shit. They're gonna be fishing down here, actually. Usually I say Florida, we're fucking in Florida. So, this whole room just stood up and is reliant on a platform that is getting massively disrupted right in your face right now. How many people here, this will be interesting. How many people here are already using chat GPT instead of Google for things they used Google for just two years ago? Raise your hand. Raise it high. I want people to see this. Keep it up a little bit because I need people to really understand what I'm saying, this is your life. I think we can all agree that the people raising their hands, I'm not talking to a junior high. 40, 50, 60 year olds, this dude's fairly young, but 40, 50, 60 year olds are raising their hands and they are using AI now instead of Google. Don't sit here and do what all of you do, which is put your head in the sand when a wave comes. Go find your surfboard and ride that wave. This has happened. This whole room just stood up that Google searches a dominant force in their business and in 48, 50, 66 months, that behavior will be gone. Very hard to click a fucking Google ad when you don't even go to Google in the first place. Wake up. So you mentioned five, seven sites. What are the sites that we should be posting? Yeah, I mean, look, that one's easy. I'll go to that one. You know what they are. It's Facebook and Instagram. It's TikTok. YouTube Shorts is a monster. I'll tell you why I love YouTube Shorts for all of you. If you name your videos properly, how to replace of that? Again, I don't want to speak to things I don't know, but you know. You know the questions people ask. You know the questions people ask. You know the questions that people ask. You know the questions people ask. You know. You know the Google ad. As an American, you know the Google ad words you're buying that convert well. If you name your videos very smart on YouTube Shorts, you can get length out of those videos. You can get business nine months. Most of social works for like this week, this day, with YouTube Shorts, you can get business nine months from now based on teaching someone how to repair something in a pool or roof or lecture. Like, you know, whatever you're doing because YouTube is the second biggest search engine in the world. Google is one. Not Bing, not Yahoo. YouTube is the second biggest search engine in the world. So YouTube Shorts is a monster. So Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts. I'm obsessed with LinkedIn. LinkedIn has become what Facebook used to be. Like LinkedIn, people are just in there consuming content. And again, a lot of people that want to use you are busy and business people. It's a great demo for you. Dollar wise, busy wise, I'm the kind of person that pays for services all the time for shit that I could do because I just don't want to do it. And my time's valuable. That's LinkedIn's loaded with that. So those are the ones that most stand out. Snapchat spotlight, I'm very bullish on. It does still skew young enough from a homeowner standpoint. That's TikTok's already much older than Snap. So Snap is still a predominant message tool, though their spotlight product is like TikTok and Instagram. I could live without people posting there. Pinterest again, I could live though, or some visual stuff, maybe there's a little bit of Pinterest but the first five are the ones I would go with. All right then back to the original, how much time? As much as humanly possible. I cannot explain to everybody that there's almost nothing you're doing in your day to day. Again, these are not $1 million or $800,000 businesses. These businesses are a little bit bigger in this room. And a lot of people in this room are in the executive life. They have time brother. Again, when I see 90% of the rooms stand up as a driver of their leads, direct mail is getting more expensive and less effective. Google is actually what all of you are doing and it's in deep shit. Google might win the next AI thing, but what do you think Google's gonna do? You think AI is just, AI is different than search. AI is gonna just send you, hey, I have this broken, where should I? They're gonna send it to themselves. They're no longer gonna be interested in being a toll booth for a little bit of advertising. They're gonna create their own services on top of it. My friends, if you do not build brand fast, you will be commoditized. Bookstores got it first. Technology doesn't give a shit about you or me. Bookstores got it first. Poor little bookstores were crushing in 1995. Unfortunately, Jeff Bezos decided to pick that category first. Uber, I was an early investor in, like I told you, really good at investing. I spoke at an event like this, like this. Two years after Uber came out in San Francisco and was about to expand. I said, Uber's a problem. You have to build brand for your black car service. They laughed at me. You know what their thing was, which is different than your thing? They thought they had City Hall by the balls. They're like, in the Q and A, they're like, Gary, do you know what City Hall is? Do you know that we've been supporting the politicians? We're not gonna let Uber in. I said, do you know what billions of dollar in venture capital is, you fucking idiot? Please don't be naive. This is not a business strategy. I need you to start building brand. I need people to know your business. Because when I walk into my home and say, Alexa, I need to fix the air conditioning, they're gonna send me wherever the fuck they want. If I say, Alexa, I need Peter Holland to fix my air conditioning, Peter won. I can't do that if I don't know what the fuck he is. If you do not attack social in these next five years, you will pay the consequences. Mark my words. For the first 10 years that I gave this talk, it was a nice to have. It was added value. We are starting to cross into this being a necessity. This is not little silly pictures. This is where attention of society is. You guys are so under investing in social. So at night, you're talking about how social media is putting like democracy on its knees and needs to be regulated. Cause it's so powerful, you're telling me you can't sell some of your services. What are we doing? Please, please take the energy of this talk tomorrow and convert it into action. Give me a year. It's like working out. If you just start working out and you haven't for a while, it's hard the first couple of weeks. I said it earlier, I'll say it again, you're gonna get six views. You're gonna get nine. But I believe in the first month or two, if you just keep going at this, you'll see something that will make you understand and then you're gonna go. Go ahead. Hell yeah. Okay. So these people are amazing. They are not the most creative people because I've seen you draw my class. And so one of the questions that keeps coming up is what would you host if you were in the trade? If I, yeah, if I bought a business in this and tomorrow was my first day or if we teamed up, the first thing I would do is go search. I would go to YouTube and I would go to Instagram and I would search all the terms of our industry and I would watch every video that has ever been posted in our industry. I promise you, there are people around the world and around the country that are doing content on social in this industry, in these trades. I would look at that. And I think I would use that as guidance, my friend. But I really do think, I said it earlier, you would be flabbergasted how your love of golf could convert and grow in your business. And I don't mean business is done on the golf course. I mean, literally you're making golf videos and people watch golf videos and then one of them's good for whatever the hell you did. And then you took it and converted it to an ad. And oh, by the way, I didn't say this last time. You're gonna spend $100 on the ad. That was the other amazing thing about local advertising. Remember when I told the story about, you can make a video, it gets 2,000 views, now you're gonna run it in a 10 mile radius? Because a 10 mile radius on Facebook is small, especially for some of you that are in rural parts of the country, because there's not that many humans, it only costs you $100 or $200 in advertising for almost everyone that's on Facebook in that area to see you more than once. The reason my dad's liquor store is crushing is when I picked Chatham, New Jersey, they only have 10,000 residents. If I'm spending $1,000, which is what I did in that scenario, almost every resident saw it three, four times. All the Chatham message boards and Facebook groups were lighting up of like, why do we keep seeing this guy with this wine? Because there's something called reach and frequency and marketing. You're getting to them, but how often are you getting to them? Like you will be stunned, stunned. I mean, it's funny, I didn't get to this part of the talk, I'm glad I'm getting it on the way out. I think you've gotten a sense of how my dad rolls. As I've been building this thing for him, if like one weekend doesn't go well, he's like, let's do direct mail. I go, dad, we've done direct mail 80 fucking times in the last two years, and you see that it's a waste of money. You see that we do Facebook for 5,000 a week and get these results. You see we do direct mail and get way less when we spend $20,000. We had one bad weekend because the creative wasn't good. And you wanna go back. And the reason some of you giggled here, and I heard you at different tables, is that's what you always do. When you go into defense, you go backwards. You understand that, right? Your brain goes into some sort of mechanism of like, well this worked in 1984. Well so did mash. I don't know. That's a good way to fucking end. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.
