What if in 10 years, I'm partially or substantially responsible for hundreds of thousands of people who have 10, 50, 100x their lives, their happiness, their fortunes Makes me feel like there will be a lot of vis-dev opportunities in 2027 And so it's an incredible feeling, and reminds me that doing the right thing is always the right thing And so I just got off the phone with one of the five biggest golfers in the world, and that was fun Especially because Nate and Tyler and AJ, a lot of characters around me are big golfing fans I'm just truckin' along, you know, here we are You know, 822, the meeting hasn't even started yet MLK days a day where a lot of people have been calling it a non-day, working-wise And if they have, they've packed it in a long time ago, and I'm proud, I'm very proud that I'll be here grinding until 11pm doing my thing I think it separates me from a lot of people, a lot of people try to figure out why this is happening And sure, charisma and smarts of natural talent is a factor, but don't ever get it twisted I'm out fuckin' working you, and that is a major part of the equation And you can do that to your competitor, it is the most controllable aspect in this warfare of business And for me, I can't make myself much more talented, I can't control a lot of the serendipity I can control the hours I put in, and that feels intoxicating I think you are many, many I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Hey, guys What up, my man?

Good, sign up, try it You hear kids talking about musically good, try it And it doesn't matter if it goes away Vine came and went I made money while it was around I just sit back and collect gold I'd rather do it all on my own No one else could feel it in my own Time is moving, I cannot stay Lost people with a smile on display Like, hip hop people, like now Hip hop kids are gonna be 100 millionaires Because they're getting out, they're trying to Like, to play at the highest level, just like athletes You go back to the 60s and 70s, athletes were They had jobs in the off season Right Like, quarter, like the biggest quarterbacks In the 50s, 60s, 70s, they hoped to coach When they were done Now these quarterbacks, they wanna own the team You know, hip hop kids coming up 20 years ago They're like, oh, maybe I'll get like a good deal Now they wanna own the label They wanna own a fashion brand, sneaker deals Startup companies, like everybody's in for whatever And that's huge, that's game changing I'm just trying to get youngsters to realize Like, don't worry about the president Don't worry about like anything, just do your thing Like, stay laser focused Like, shit's gonna happen around you regardless No matter how popular you are, you're not changing Who the president is No matter how popular you are, you're not gonna change Whoever wants to be a racist or a sexist or Just do you People spend too much energy worrying about What they can't control Only way a guy like you gets the next step is only two ways One, ultra talented, you got the shit, fuck it You're good enough, that's it Like, that's the truth Like, it's just like, it's sports You can be the biggest fuck face going If you got so much talent, you're eventually gonna get to the league But how do you stay? That's a whole different story How do you make it to that second contract, that real money? You're still better off trying and losing And not trying at all Try and shit, pushing those boundaries People don't get it If you lose, over time people forget If you hit, you're a pioneer People don't understand how America works You're better off going one for five Than going O for O Lyrics All right It looks like you're gonna be able I'm gonna My man, good luck to you Looking forward to it All right I'm more than all these maddie kids. I've seen a lot of things changing my perspective. I've seen a lot of things. Thank you so much. People drink a lick and try to fill their emptiness. We'll talk some more. Sure. Some people think you're friendly. There's no money. There's nobody to spend it with. And people like to rumble really, they just gon' be blending in. I keep myself. Just wrapping up another meeting. This is dev life until I die. That's really what it is though, guys. Like shaking hands, making opportunities happen. You know, we go through patterns, right? Like if you look back at these episodes, you know, obviously I'm scratching itches right now around this hip hop community, the culture, the emerging hip hop artists and trend setters. I do believe with the emergence of social, I think we're in a very interesting spot right now where I think the maturity of the young music future players is different. Smarter, and at least not smarter, just relevant for where I see a 2019, 2022 world. And so I'm spending time learning. I'm spending time bringing value. Value exchange forever. And so late nights, worth it. See you tomorrow. Yeah. It's Byzantium. Now we're not. Check it, check it. I said this industry is dog eat dog. And y'all sleeping on these Mickey D's rappers around with that I've been eating. Cause I got my city on the come up and they got my back. They been loving the kid knowing the words, feeling the flow and they going absurd. I kill it. The real is some chapel hill in a minute. We're no limit. You will witness to the game.
