## Transcript
This is awesome. Let me get my angle. This thing is possible. I'm from mom and casual. Got a lot of guys like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Maco. Like a vision boy, I see with clarity. A hustle like my name is Gary V. Sob, I've been telling you. Accounts were stolen by equity. I'm trippin' like giving a pedigree. That meanin' I'm special, my specialty. I puttin' the work, tellin' I'm dirtin' the earth. I'm movin' furniture to heaven. You're my fuckin' idol, Gary. I just found you last night. The competition for that idol spot must've not been that tough. Hey, Mom, what's up? I'm great, Mom. How are you? I'm in Belgium. You know what I've been doing on Facebook? Did you hear? I've been converting my videos into other languages. Now people who only speak Russian can watch the videos and see them in Russians. They can... I need more chitats in Russian. I had to stay up so late. So I'm on from three to four? Yes, three to four and then you have the book signing. You don't do that on stage. And that's gonna take a good hour, right? No, we're gonna do that in half an hour. But we have to have a buffer. We have a buffer. Yeah, we do. What time is dinner? We leave here at seven. Yep. Seven, 15. Oh, yeah. Maybe 10? Yes. 10 to 11? All right, Belgium, you won. All right, Belgium, I have good news. We're gonna do a meetup. He gave me permission. DRock gave me permission. So we're doing it 10 o'clock. 10 p.m. tonight. Details coming shortly. We'll announce location at 7.30. Right? I'm so mad at... Oh, shit. It's okay. Wow, that was like... You didn't catch that. That was literally the best thing that's happened in 168 episodes or whatever we're at. 163, you missed it. Good morning, East Coast. Sorry if I woke you up West Coast. We're very well into our day here in Belgium doing a meetup tonight. Say that. I like that. I'm Twerpen. I'm Twerpen. Tonight, 10 p.m. Belgium. Pass us on. Tag in the comments all of your Belgium friends and your Western European friends. I'm getting focused here in Belgium. Really excited about this long-time friend. We've known each other what, six years? Yes. Seven? Ten. No, I don't think... No, I don't think... I wasn't at that one. No, I wasn't. I know. It was a snowy one. I don't think it was six. We will find it out. Let's make a bet. What's the bet? $400,000 cash. Okay, perfect. Fine. It can't be because I started Wine Library TV February 2006. Okay. So, minimum it's 2008. Minimum. And it's probably 2009. Believe it. Okay, yeah. But then I owe you a lot. Euros, by the way. Yeah, just getting focused, getting ready. I'm in an interesting zone lately. I think the last two talks I've given in Canada and in Ireland, maybe I need to start talking outside the U.S. I think I've found a new cadence. This one should be fun because my friend here has very much adapted into the thesis that I've been talking about for the last decade and has made some noise in this market. This market's different, obviously. You know, the Snapchats and Instagrams of the world are at the cusp, just emerging. Twitter has not been able to grab a foothold here. It is a Facebook environment, but as we were yapping, incredible amounts of direct mail investment, which is crazy when Facebook is so good at that. So we'll go there. I'm going to probably do quite a bit of Q&A. And so the last couple talks have been very entrepreneur, very philosophical, very emotional intelligence, very much works for, what is that? The last 2010. 2010, yeah. 400,000 Euros. Yeah. That's a lot of speech. Yeah, so we'll see where it goes. I think this one will go a little bit more tactical, the details of marketing more so than kind of the philosophical places I've been able to take the last couple talks, which will get more tactical. And that's great, right? That is in itself clouds and dirt. And so we'll see where we want to go. This is a perfect example of where I want to do more Q&A because I want to be able to answer a very direct question to the audience. And so it's a smaller group, which also lends itself to an intimacy that I enjoy. It's so funny for me how much I enjoy both 18,000 people in Lisbon and 10 people in a conference room like we did yesterday in Ireland before the main stage and everything in between. And this is in between. It's a warm crowd. Well, these are going to be all over the place. And so I mean warm in the fact that they have a lot of emotion and relationship to him. He has that for me. It's a it's a it should be a really good really great day here and could do a meetup later, which is exciting. We've got to see, you know, they really put me to work. They let me sleep a little bit, but that made me put me to work. So this isn't in my normal one hour in and out. They've got seven to 10 different fucking events, signed books, the library. Thank you so much. What's your name? Good. It makes me so happy. Oh, I love it. D-rock, get in here. Enjoyed it? Absolutely. Great. Thank you. So much for meeting you. What's up, vlog? I've seen them enormous change. Separate sponsors. We have a thing. I don't know if it's in English. The high trees catch the most wind. I love it. And that will be for until I die. I will always innovate. I have too much confidence to worry about what other people think. All the upside is being a pioneer. I want to be the highest trade with the heaviest wind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 400,000 euros. euros. Hey, guys. Thank you for having me. What I don't understand, I don't care if I'm right or wrong. I'm just blown away that you're willing to not find out. We just sit with our thoughts and theories of what's tried and true. Let me tell you something. What got you here today is not going to get you to the next place. And we sit in theory and we sit in romance and we sit in love. You know, you know how many people in this room make business decisions on how they wish the world was working? The market is always right. Not your fucking ego. And I've got nothing but ego. But when it comes to the market, I only have humility. The market is always right. And we sit in ivory towers thinking we're super fucking smart and we disrespect the market every day. And that's why we lose. In last year's fiscal year, 90% of the people who were in the market were in the market. In the last year's fiscal year, 96% of the Fortune 500 companies in the world lost market share. They lost market share because they're marketing like it's 2005. They're marketing like it's 1997. They're marketing like it's 1984. That's why they lost market share. And I know this because there's only one other time that we have seen this big of businesses lose this much global market share. They're going to be in the late 40s and early 50s when the world transitioned from radio to television. My friends, we are transitioning from television to this. It's already happened. I've been here for a long time. I implore you to join me. Thank you. Thank you. Which one do you like the best? Forehead? Left side? Or across the face? Just completely crushed it. Slayed it in Belgium. This guy slayed it. More than this guy. More than this guy. So competitive for no reason. They're like right here. You're my best friend. Fuck you. Most of your clients agree with you. In their brains, they know what's going on in the world. It's just that their modeling mix internally or their reporting internally doesn't justify the spend with you guys. More importantly, there's a dirty little secret that isn't talked about enough, which is that marketing takes the credit and is to blame for business results often when it has nothing to do with the business. They're scared. The answer is, he, unless you've got the balls to pull it off, needs to go to the CEO or the board and get it pushed down from the top. You need protection to innovate. That's it. No different than the answer I gave the kid that's sitting in your seat. I wish I could give you a better answer, but that's it. Either the most senior person gives you the air cover to get it done or you wait and in between, you find the little scraps of opportunities that you guys have found, just like me. You need examples. You know, for example, you need to put your money where your mouth is. You're getting bigger. Maybe you go to a local business. Maybe they're a friend or relative of one of you guys. Maybe you don't charge them. Maybe you put up the money. Maybe you put up $25,000 for the pizza shop. Do it. Record it. Show them. One step backwards, three steps forward. It's always the same thing. Pictures, videos, words, sounds until we die, until the robots take over. Where is what changes? 80 years ago, 100 years ago, people said, you're not being social. You don't use a telephone. You go to the man's house and you shake his hand and you sit down and you talk. People were upset when letters were invented. They were. You're supposed to go over to their house and draw on their cave. From 16 to 23 years old, I always had $1,000 on me. Always. I didn't have an ATM card. I'm old. No, no. And I'm a businessman. You never know when you're going to walk into a situation where I needed to buy something for $500. I wasn't a normal kid, right? I was doing business. So I might go to Toys R Us and they might have all the power rangers and I'm going to need cash. Now. Now. Uh-huh. It's a real pleasure. We'll talk later. We'll have dinner together. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I'm big on sales. In general, for me personally, and this is not a tried and true answer for me, I love people that have sold stuff in their life. There's something consistent about it that's really worked out for me in the last 20 years. You know, and they can be tech nerdy. You know, they, they, they, you know, the kids I liked coming up the game would like rip music from maps or put on CDs and sell it in school. So it was a little tech. It was a little product, right? I was baseball cards and lemonade. Some people were candy, you know? So I like sales. Um, I, I, I try to figure out as hardcore as I can. Do they need to do this because they can't breathe if they did anything else? Or are they doing it because they think there's more money in it or because it's cool now? I think that 95% of the startup founders that I meet are doing it for the other two things. They're either doing it because they think the most money is there because they get seduced by the exits they read about or because it's now cool to be a startup founder. So I hate the current state of startup. Hate it. I've not been investing at all for the last year and a half. Nothing. I've made a couple big investments and things that I'm really involved in. But the kind of stuff that you guys are mainly doing, I'm not even taking meetings. Um, because I feel like we have the greatest fear of fake entrepreneurship ever. In the U.S. it just became so big and powerful and popular. Everybody did it. And in other places, it was good for the country, the region. It was the right thing to do, which is both true. The problem is it brings a lot of people into the game that aren't meant to be. So my biggest thing that I'm looking for the best entrepreneur and founder is are they an entrepreneur and founder? Or are they acting like one? And that takes, and that's too hard. And unlike the advice I gave downstairs about, well, higher and fire, you can't unfire a $100,000 investment, you know? And so I think that I look for people that are driven, patient, and not fancy. The amount of people that are founders of companies who go skiing on the weekend, who go to every marketing meetup event, who take selfies with microcelebrities. We're in such a bullshit era. Basically, club promoters have taken over entrepreneurship. The truth. And every, and the reason there's giggles and head nods is we know it. It just became cool. Document overcreate, my point on creating content, is instead of trying to think what you make, just document everything you're doing. If you add, do you know the two or three of you, if you just documented the journey of figuring this out? That people would watch your video on YouTube every day of you trying to figure out the school system and that in itself would, what would build your business? It's a story. It's the journey of an entrepreneur. The legacy that I'm creating with DailyVee? Fuck. Now cool, that's going to be when there's ten years worth of my every day. Big day. Big day. Great day. Great day, right? Great day in Belgium. Top-dach. Especially if I pull off very big things. I would love, you know how fun it would be to watch the three years before Drake became famous, everything he did. You know how fascinating that is? And by the way, even if it never changed your business, do you know how much fun it would be for your granddaughter to watch you do it? Really, think about life. You know, inspiring that would be? She'd be like, damn grandma was a hustler. I want to be one too. No, really, right? Like think, you know, I don't like, you know what fun it would be for me right now to see my dad making two dollars an hour in 1979, waking up at 430, driving, working 15 hours in a liquor store and then coming back. That's cool. So, I don't think we think long-term enough what it really means. You know, I look at stuff now, I'm like, oh man, I was so young. Oh shit, I was pretty fat. You know, like, you know, it's cool. That's why I do it. The reality that you're in yourselves just makes it so great. I think everything about me is pulling it in opposite directions. I'm the most inspirational and the most practical. You know, I'm in it. Strategy. I was in there, man. It's my life. The priest was here and there is the skull. It's called in? This is so awesome. It's unbelievably cool. So modern, so rad. I'm excited. I'm going to eat everything in sight. I'm so happy Jordan's not here. Alright, I'm going to make sure I have no fires for three minutes. Then I'm going to do the call and then we can really hang. I just hate when I'm out of commission. I need to charge it, but I'll get that from DRock. Good Snapchat. Here's where the meetups happening. This fancy restaurant in this grassy knoll right near it. Here I am. Next picture. Show the idea of Colin's show. I said a lot of entrepreneurs like to read books, come to conferences, have meetings, but they don't want to do. I said it reminds me of the guy who wants to play tennis. And instead of practicing, what he does is he goes to the sporting goods store and he buys the best sneakers. He buys Roger Federer's headband. He buys the best tennis racket. Brandy shorts. And then he goes on the court and he loses 6-0. That's what I see with a lot of entrepreneurs. They've watched all my videos, read all your books. They've done all the courses. They don't want to do the work. When you look at the guys and girls that are great tennis players, they spend every day of their child playing tennis. There's no other way. I know what you're saying. The guys who are looking at your videos are not real entrepreneurs. I'm saying that the ones... I never watched them. Here's what I'll say. The ones that only watch them and never do are not. And there's a lot of people that do that. They get the feeling for me and that's enough. My best days are when I'm leaving my Instagram comments and people are like, this is my last video. I'm ready to go. And I love it. Not good for my following count. Not good for my views. The best for my heart. Because there's always somebody else. Which is why I spend a lot of time trying to get people to build practical businesses. Because there's a lot of people that can make 100,000 a year in profit. There's not a lot that can build a billion dollar company. And so I'm trying to push the practicality of entrepreneurship and start-up. And it's working. You saw that kid today who said, hey, you helped me. I was going to try to build Facebook. Now I've got this good business. It's exciting. There's no feeling... You know, it's funny. I can go close a four million dollar deal with Kellogg's or IBM. Fine. I come home and I get an email from a kid who tells me there's no better feeling than that. That's legacy. I always knew how to make money. That's nothing new. The legacy of impacting people. That's new. That's exciting. That's hearing that kid would have failed. Now maybe he won't. Not only will he then feel the benefits, but his children will. That's impact. I started working out. It's good, man. How's everybody? Good? Yeah. All right, let's do it. How's the food? The food was fucking ridiculously good. All right, here's my concept for this so I can get through this. Let's just first do selfies and sign books. And then we can do questions because otherwise people have to wait like four or five hours. I've done this before. So just let's first do the photos and things that nature. And then I'll try to answer questions if I can. Where is DRock? DRock is over here. Oh, hi DRock. Awesome. Real pleasure. Who's the best NBA player ever? Who's the best NBA player ever? Yeah. Patrick Ewing. Patrick Ewing. You're not recording. How long does that take you? An hour. Two hours. Two hours. Thanks man. You're welcome man. Thanks for coming. Reverse engineer yourself. Don't try to be somebody else. Not for your parents, not for me, not for him, for yourself. Thanks Gary. You got it. Oh, I don't even know man. Fuck man. You're the one who made me shift you towards gratitude in my business. And how you choose which one to use. Funny thing happens when you make that move. True right? Yeah. You know all these things are switches. Everybody wants these little things. They're binary. You're either on or you're off. There's no half pregnant. The process. The process. Love it. I really want to work for it, but my question is, the only thing that I'm missing is actually a good financial base. I know how to get it, but how can I work it in that way that I still have something to say in my own idea, the best possible way. Well, if you don't have the money and if you raise the money, you don't have the say, then you have to wait until you have the money to have the say. There's the best and only way you can do it. It's the only way if you want to have say. Unless you decide that this idea is worth you learning from. The biggest problem everybody here is going to make is they think their current idea is the end all be all. A lot of your businesses and ideas are stepping stones. So maybe it's better for you to not have say, learn what's good, learn what's bad. You're a young man. Yeah, 31. You know what's great about being a business man is you don't retire at 31 like an athlete. You play forever. So instead of waiting until you make the money to have control, maybe it's better to not have control. You learn it sucks because you don't have control, but you learn maybe you'll make some money and then you can take the money and go do your next thing. You're always going to have ideas. This is your first idea. That's true. That's true. Got it? Don't fall in love with an idea. Okay, exactly. Thank you, man. You're welcome. Gary, yes. Can I ask you a question? Yes, but we need to do people. We're getting, this is what always happens. Let's bang out a little bit more, but I will answer it. I promise you. This is what you think? I want to drink some making in. I serve products. I love that. She's doing the household. Just a happy family. Yeah. 11 PM. Man. Cousin Gary in town. Casing. With a mind here, Gary Vaynerchuk. We're together. Fuck idea and execution is the key. Executions the game. Ideas are shit without execution. Love it. Real pleasure. How are you? I want to say to you that if today I stand there, it's because of one guy who is behind you who got twisted what you said that you have to cut friends from your inner circle to succeed. Yes. And today I know that I'll achieve greatness because I will show him that you have not cut friends to make it. I love it, man. We're good. And may I have a picture? Yes, sir. Respect. Thanks for replying to me a Twitter. My pleasure. And find a way. Thank you, man. Too many people try to make a narrative. The only narrative that works is your true narrative. So many people here are fronting as experts or as coaches and making stuff happen. You're aspiring. You're through the process. Document your best story that will get more people to buy more jewelry than anything is that you guys come out and say, we're just starting. We don't know shit. We just know that we want to put this out in the world. People will relate to that more than you saying, we're this, we're that. Got it? The truth always wins. It might not be winning this moment, this month, this year, but it always wins at the end. You understand? Yeah. Perfect. Look, people's mouths are way ahead and ambitions are way ahead of their actions. Everybody's talking shit, but people aren't putting in the work. So you just need to, but by the way, by the way, if that's your goal, exactly, like, like, you know, great it is to make $100,000 a year and be happy and go on vacation and love your life. It's great. Everybody now thinks they have to build Facebook. It's stupid. Exactly. You just need to know yourself. You don't need to make... And can you start at 28? You could start at 58. And building $20 businesses? Of course. Kentucky Fried Chicken, the guy was 75 years old when he started. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah, hug, man. Woo! The greatest person I've ever met is fucking Planet. Thank you, man. Look what you've done. Thank you, man. It's fucking amazing. Thank you so much. I look forward actually to grow up, like, to follow you like the next five, 10, 20 years. Thank you, man. It's fucking insane. Thank you so much. Thank you. If I grew up in the era that you're growing up in, this shit would have been over a long time ago. If I had eBay and Shopify and Google and fucking the Internet, I didn't have shit. There was no computers. I fucking went to the store, bought shit. Love it. Bought shit, went to the flea market on Saturday and sold it. Like, shit. Like, you guys have it so good, so easy. You have it so good, you have it so good, so easy that it tricks you that it's easy. That's a problem. It's so good and so easy that you're getting tricked that it's easy. It's not easy. You got it? Yo, you ready for this? Yeah. You motherfucker. My business is on the side, I'll take a gap year and try to launch it. Both work. Both. Which one is best? I don't know you well enough. You know. You know what I mean? They both work. Yes. Which one do you want to do? I would like to try to take a gap year, but I'm scared. So take a gap year. Well, that's why you're not asking. Yes. Which one will you do? I wouldn't take either. What will you do then? I can't answer that for you. Fears holding you back. I know what you want to do. The only reason you're not doing is because you're scared of doing what you actually want to do. Right? Yes. Are you scared to do it because your parents won't like it? No, my parents actually support me. Okay, so what are you scared of? Failing? Not failing, but still being at the same place when my friends are at the next level. Huge mistake. You don't want the same thing your friends want. So why the fuck do you care what they have? Number one mistake so many people make is they care about what other people have. I don't give a fuck what anybody has. If I have more, if I have less, it doesn't matter. I worry about myself. The fact that you're worrying about other people's accomplishments is already a losing formula. You need to get rid of that first, then you can focus on yourself. Thank you. You understand? Yes, I do. You just have to talk these things through, and then when you get to the right answer, you answer it, which I love. So the fact that you care that one year later, you do your thing, which you loved, and you decided that you want to do, but you weren't successful, and your friend got a job, and now he's got a little bit more money, that bothers you. I built a $45 million business in four years and was still paying myself $40,000. No fancy car, no fucking watch, no fucking bling-bling, because I knew what I was doing it for. I believed fully she's still here and what I was doing. You're worried about way too many short-term goals when your mouth says that you want big time goals. Thank you. You're welcome. Yeah. Do you recommend that you document the journey? Yes. Guys, the amount of people that are asking me questions, dude, I'm just going to say it real quick, everybody's asking me questions they know the answers to. You know the fact that you used the words, document the journey. You know I believe in that. Everybody, same with you, same with a bunch. You're all looking for permission. That's why I'm afraid of documentaries. That's it. Everybody, that's right. It's all fear, because it's a binary thing. Once you can get your mindset around why you're doing things and that you're doing it for yourself, it all opens up. Both of you back to back care about other people. And that's fine. I care. I don't want to let my parents down, but not at the expense of my one life. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Yeah. Cool. Again, watch what I do. Just start to reach. So listen, do shit. Like when I thought of 60 Second Club, I did an hour later. And I'm a big audience. I have a lot to lose. Right? I have a lot to lose. And then again, I just said it. It's been fucking three months. I switched back. I'm not scared to change. Just do shit. Do shit. I knew that I was a businessman. And when I saw, you guys, most of you didn't see this, that big man that I hugged out, he saw it. I was the wine guy. Yeah. I was the wine guy. So I started making business videos and everybody's comments were stick to wine. Do what you do. What the fuck do you know about business? I had already built the business. People didn't even know me for that. Just do shit. I decided I'm going to start a beanie company. I may or may not, but I'm trying to do it. Right? Remember the honey company? Where's the honey company? Remember for somebody that watch Ask Gary Vee? There is no honey company. VaynerToy's failed. Like there's no honey company. I didn't get to it. I tried to. I got a lot of samples. I got a lot of data. I'm just doing all the time. You're ideating every day, making up shit on the spot. Playing, doing, doing, doing, doing, doing. If one out of 30 things succeeds, it's better than all of the things that you guys haven't started. Boom. Nice. You got it? Go do something. Dude, what the fuck is this thing? I love the old school. All right, guys, thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for coming. The blog. Yeah, the blog. One, the biggest value you can just share with my viewers. Well, what kind of viewers are they? Youngsters? Youngsters, like me, people who aren't starting a business, people who need personal development. You know what? It's patience. It's fucking patience. It's patience. Like, all of you wanted too fast. I'm 41 years old, and I feel like I'm seven. Like when I was 15 or 17 or 22, I thought 41 year olds were so fucking old. They felt so old. I wish all of you 13, 16, 19, and 24 year olds could feel how young I am in my soul right now. It would change everything you do. You would become dramatically more patient, which would mean that you would make a lot more of the successes that you want to happen. Most of you will lose because you're trying to take shortcuts. Wow. The process. The process. I have a question. My pleasure. And you're young. You could make 19 mistakes and start at 30 and get your shit going. Lack of patience. Lack of patience. That's what that ladder is up to. I'm here. I'm here. You got it, D-Rock? Yeah. Come on. Bye, guys. I love you. Bye. See you. I have the idea for an application, but it's not... it's for charity. Okay. But it's not like... no more people, they give stuff like donations. Yeah, I know. Gamification works. Charity donations happen. The combination of the two and the economics around building an actual business, the problem is right now everybody's building apps and they're not building businesses. Yeah, it's true. I know. You know what I mean? Yeah. That is what you need to think about. Thank you. It's the business of apps, not apps that are businesses. Everybody's thinking about apps. Your app might be right. You have a sustainable business. The economics of the scale of what you're building is very difficult. Yeah, that's true. Got it? Cool. Thank you for your... I hope so. I hope so. What's up, brother? No regrets. No regrets. No, I can't think... you know, like... let me give you the best... this is a great... I appreciate you asking that. What value in the world does it have to look backwards in a world where you're going to make a ton more mistakes? Do you know what I mean? Like, reconciling mistakes you've made in the past in a world where you're going to be making a bunch more seems like a waste of energy to me, you know? You learn from your mistakes, but like, who knows if I didn't do that? If something... everything's wired together. If I didn't make that mistake, but would have that led me to that meeting which became my ultimate upside, you can't unwind them. Everybody wants to unwind shit to tactics.
