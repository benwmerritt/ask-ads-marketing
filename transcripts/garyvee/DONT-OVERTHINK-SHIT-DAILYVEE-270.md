How do you deal with the unknown? Like, when it comes to... By recognizing I have no fucking choice. Me and Gary Vee have been in the office. You rap, lapping, walking through corporate. Talks about ownership and leverage. 1800 checks and shout out to the beverage. We're not gonna be able to deliver. This is not the first impression I wanna make. I'm running a business here. You know what I mean? It's just not what we're doing. It's like asking the best media analyst to analyze timber pricing. Why didn't you private get to the book? Huh? Because I tell everybody not to be romantic about things. But I'm not romantic about staying. I'm not a fan of the book. I'm a fan of the package. I'm just trying to stay... I'm just not excited about this crime. That's why I should deal with it. But I'm gonna shoot that little one. Please, I should fucking help. Aside from staying consistent, how would I maintain this momentum with just how much traffic my account's getting me out? Staying consistent. Dude, loving the process means that you're intoxicated with the process. It's just that, right? Like, it's not being intoxicated with, wait a minute, I've hit pager. How do I maintain it or grow it more? Actually giving a fuck about the process and staying consistent. That is it. I'm gonna give you a really good piece of advice off this very short period of time. Be binary about your decisions. Let me tell you what I mean by that. Don't overthink jumping into your front jumping into your first job and then quit it the next day if it doesn't feel right. That's definitely something. That's it. That's... There's nothing else. Yeah. That's it. Don't overthink shit. Because you can literally impose your thing into anything. You just don't know that thing you're jumping into. Yeah. But it's not a end all be all if the first one's not right. That's a good thing. Nobody's gonna give a fuck if you've got four companies on your resume first two years. No place you wanna end up. Yeah. Leaving college, that's gonna happen for the rest of your life. And there was no difference in starting high school and picking college. It's fucking life. Nobody knows what the fuck's gonna happen tomorrow. So how do you deal with the unknown? Like when it comes to... By recognizing I have no fucking choice. Okay. Right? Yeah. Like, because that's actually life. Like zero people exist. Are you scared? Like do you ever fear the unknown? Nope. Like that's what my main thing is. Like with every aspect of life. You have to... Because I'm confident. Yeah. Totally. Like I'm not scared because I know I can handle anything. That's awesome. You know? And I know I can handle anything because I'm grateful for everything I've got and I never envy and want anything else. And I'm driven by that and I'm an optimist. Like if something bad happens tomorrow I would default into thinking well I'm so grateful that I've had it for this long. Instead of like why do they go away? It's all about what you think about it. 100% and you need to chip away at that. And you need to realize what's practical or not. This is an insular game. Every time you let somebody's voice get into your head and their opinion or what they're doing you'll become insecure. Every time you're just about you with yourself and just you, you'll win. Confidence is only about loving yourself. What about the politics of everything? The real. But a funny thing happens when you're not listening. If you... You know you can hear your brother's points of view. You can hear your mom's points of view. You can hear your roommate's points of view. You can hear my point of view. But like when you're actually not listening you're not listening. I think everybody's trying to like control shit that you can't control. I'm about to change open door policy and force time with everybody because it's my job. Your job is not for f***ing or f***ing or anybody you interact with to come to you. It's your job at how high of a leadership you are. It's your job to go and figure out your vulnerabilities if they exist or not. It starts with me. Everything is my fault. I mean it to the f***ing most of my life. To f***ing meet every single thing is my fault. I don't know if it's Dana or God. How we're staying. Tyler let me come in here so I guess we're staying. Hi. Good to see you. I'm so happy to see you. Good. I feel better even just sitting here with you. Makes me happy. Also usually I do this thing where I talk to you and I pretend to understand everything you say. But today I'm going to actually just be like you don't get that or clarify that. Good. By the way, it took me a long time to be good at that. I used to be very much like yeah I got it. I hate that. I've gotten so much better in the last three or four years. Cool.
