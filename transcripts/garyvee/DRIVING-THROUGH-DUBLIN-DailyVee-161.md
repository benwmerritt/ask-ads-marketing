## Transcript
My first meetup was Pete's, do you know what my first meetup is? My first meetup was in 2008 or nine. I was doing jury duty and took my phone out and tweeted, they're like, you have a two hour break, but don't leave the general area. I'm like, what? I'm from mom and castle. Got a lot of ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro, like a vision boy, I see with clarity. Sob, I've been telling you. Please, super humbled for the shout out man. I mean, this day of DRock's life. I'm thinking there might be a real opportunity for your career to change in a very positive way. I'm a Paris boy. We ready, but we're past Detroit. But still paranoid. It's a difference between a man and boy. Earth, hold the city down like Princeton. I give them get the rats like Christmas. I swear I give them stories like Chris did. Wallace, tell when I help my lover, get the shipping dollars. I promise I got it. We've been on the road from the coda to the bottom. But seeing it in the side like Hotel Rwanda, see better friends turn than the foes. Sob, I'm disrespecting words, turn the blows in. Blows turn the shots, now both of them, they like full man. They both spin the box to control the lock, the lock, the lock, the yellow number, that's it I die for, that's it I kill for, that's it I'm so full. Yellow number, that's it I die for, that's it I kill for, that's it I'm so full. Is it ever gonna change? Is it ever gonna change? Tell me, is it ever gonna change? Is it ever gonna change? Is it ever gonna change? Tell me, is it ever gonna change? Tell me, is it ever gonna change? Hopping on the grind, trying to grow my network. My day and day, this is how a social network. Goddamn, they used to be fedote, now when they get... So, here in Dublin, got a nice little, couple hours of nap, little workout, it's more like a stretch. I'm like really kind of tied up here, do you back up. I'm excited, feeling pretty good. I feel like the end of the year is pretty good. I'm excited, I'm feeling pretty good. I'm excited, feeling pretty good. I feel like the energy is building. Oh, Facebook's here. Should probably go there and do some negotiating. It's a new biz. It's a new biz. What a platform. Dublin's been a really fun city to watch over the last five to seven years in the tech space. A lot of big companies have come here, all off Facebook, a lot of great events. Web Summit was here for a long time. This event has become a big deal. I was here not too long ago. Show the clip, the recall. I'm excited, I feel like it's going to be a great talk. Some of the great speakers. And then quickly the Brussels. Some more hustling. That's what we do. I tried to give them some love. See them from outside of... Oh, she's going. Oh, well, very easy. Hi, Mr. Bender. We're going to be in the car by 5.30. Nice to meet you. Thank you, it's very nice. Good morning, if we get a stop. Thank you. That's a great sweatshirt. How are you, man? How are you? We'll talk later. I'm Eric. I got it. Come here. You too. Nice to meet you. Thank you. Thank you so much, darling. Hi. How are you? Thank you. You're welcome. I'll give you a dozen Zouha at last time. Hi from Gary Vee and Marie Claire. We connected. Gary sleeps a little bit. Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you. Fine, my name is Miley. I'm from Cuba. Can I have? Awesome, so nice to meet you. Thank you. Thank you. All good? I did, but I'm a bad student. I don't really go to look at that stuff. Can I grab a coffee and we can talk for two minutes? What are we about to do? Hey, man, how are you? Good to see you. How are you? I can't wait. I understood selling stuff. And I understood brands and storytelling. And wine was like, you know, built for it. This winemaker, you know, did this and what that. You're finding my drinks wine. That's right. Let me say to you, I know you're here this lot, but you are true inspiration for me. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you. Upstairs? I'm going upstairs. What if we take steps? I was going to go down the stairs. Great. Thank you. Do you rock is going to love this shot? Huh? There you go, D-rock. How are you? Hello. Such a pleasure. How are you, man? Hello. Hi. What's going on? What's your name? What do you do? I get a lot of hustlers and entrepreneurs that come to me that want to be in the tech business. And they come up with these ideas and then they want a dev shop to build it for them. And they're going to launch this huge bit. We're going to be the next Facebook. Because of this idea. And then I go, you're in the tech business. And you don't have a tech co-founder. You know, so I see that every day. So I think if the ambition is very large and it's tech centric, you need to have a tech co-founder to really build an actual big business. I think if you are building a fashion brand and there's products like Magento and Shopify and WordPress and already in the marketplace and your ambition is to build a ten-day business, you know, in the marketplace and your ambition is to build a ten-million-dollar scarf business. Well then you don't need to be the tech co-founder. There's tools that can get you there through Shopify and maybe it's more about the marketing skills. Or how do you market the crans. You don't necessarily need. So I think you have to go backwards. I think the thing that everybody makes mistakes with, I think one of the best things I've ever done and I really haven't. I articulated about my love of the journey but I don't talk enough about the way I strategize. I kind of like playing the role of like charismatic crazy guy but I definitely think about stuff quite a bit and I think the best way to win is to know where the hell you're going. And so, and the reason I've been pushing self-awareness is not everybody here is destined to build a five hundred million-dollar thing. I also think it's crazy that people don't realize how amazing it is to build a one-million-dollar thing. If you can build a one-million-dollar year business and run on 30% net price, you have a crazy life. And so we have this whole world of everybody trying to achieve for something that's virtually impossible and they're putting themselves in a position where by trying to build something impossible they're going to end up working for a bank. Because the one thing that people haven't factored in yet is globally the economy has been pretty good for the last decade or at least eight years. And my biggest concern is the next economic slowdown. Everybody has their own micro-economic things but I think the reality is globally, right now, things are good. People are tense about politics but economic realities end all the people that made money in the 2000s or have family money are pouring money into start-up land. A rugby start-up can actually get money from some individual that made money prior. I mean the amount of $25,000 and $50,000 stupid checks I've written in the last five years, you know, and so when that goes away what happens? How you guys doing? Good? Good. Nice to meet you. Real pleasure, David. Thank you, brother. You want to get some content from here? This is always my favorite moment. I always just love this kind of like 10, 7, 8 minutes before taking the stage. I get into almost like a boxer mentality, I guess. You know? I get very competitive. It's weird. I get competitive with the audience. I'm like, I'm gonna fucking if you already love me, I'm gonna make you love me more. If you have no idea who I am I'm gonna make you know who I am and if you don't like me and you're cynical and you think I'm full of crap you're about to be exposed. So I get into that place mentally and it's just a it's a really interesting spot. It's very like it's this incredible mixture even though I've done this hundreds of times at this point it's not a nervousness but it's definitely a different energy. It's a competitive energy. It's how I used to feel before playing like floor hockey in high school. I remember used to play floor hockey was huge in my high school and we played it after school and like the whole school. This whole school paid more attention to intramural floor hockey. They would announce the scores to the whole school the next morning. It was like bigger than almost every team at our high school besides the wrestling team and literally every time I had a game I would I love clapping. I would go and throw up almost like put my pants like in the last class I'd have to go to the bathroom because I'd get so revved up. That's how I get. I get so revved up. Are you revved up? I'm so revved up. Revved up. So as long as it's hanging up there the whole time that'd be great. Thank you. I figured I'd try to make a challenge for you guys. Awesome. Thank you guys. Here we go. Here's the big one. He says it's our role in our CPC. He's a very fun person to play. They make him turn into this guy. Okay, I show it. What's up, Dublin? Back to the reference of that. I've done this a lot. I've been very blessed to be able to speak a whole bunch in the last decade. And I can tell you that this is a remarkable execution for a first year event. So I think we should all collectively clap it up for these fuckers. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm super humbled to be here. I really want to focus on a couple things. I'm going to frame up this talk I decided just now. Because I'd like to improv it up in clouds and dirt. Some of you that pay attention to me know what that means. For the rest of you, I'll explain it. I think almost all of my success and when I talk about my success, I want to make sure I'll use this opportunity as well to clear that up. It's not about how much money I make. It's not if I actually buy the New York Jets, my football team that I'm trying to buy. It's that I just genuinely wake up every day being extremely happy. I think the world is in a much better place than the majority of people. I think that I'm an optimist. I think there's enormous gifts in being optimistic. I hate cynicism. I think people lack perspective. I think people don't realize the math between becoming an actual human being. When you start understanding 400 trillion to one is the odds that you're actually sitting in this seat. It's so intense, it's hard. You're completely driven by gratitude. When I think about my success as a human living happy so that I can do my thing, I think about it in clouds and dirt. I think about it in clouds and dirt in my success of being an entrepreneur as well. When I understood the diversity of the audience watching here and watching and live streaming, I thought it was the right place to go. Whether you're a startup founder or an entrepreneur or a student, whether you're 18 or 81, the one thing that has been consistent in success when I have analyzed it is this notion of clouds and dirt. What I mean by that is the following. For example, there's a lot of marketers in here and the reason I believe that they will not be macro successful to their ambitions or their wants and dreams is because they're just headline readers. They're just in the clouds. They've read the articles, they've read the books, they've heard the theses, they've heard somebody say Facebook ads don't work, they've heard somebody say Facebook ads do work. They've heard people say Snapchat doesn't matter anymore because Instagram copied the features. They talk in theory. They lack being a practitioner. Others are in the dirt. And so for me, it's all about top-line strategy. And so my top-line strategy nine years ago was this. That this was going to become the primary device of our lives. That not only was it going to be the remote control of our lives, but that this would become the television and the television would become the radio. And so nine years ago I basically committed my life to understanding that this is the television and that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube were the BBC and CBS and NBC and CNN and SkyNet and I was going to figure out how to make the best shows on it. Whether that was me, whether that was Wine Library, whether that was my clients and I promise you that that thesis has worked out and I implore everybody here to start thinking about their lives in success right? From a clouds and dirt perspective. I loved the last presentation. I barely listened to anything. I consumed no content and so much of what I heard as I was getting ready was so right and makes me think a lot about how I was being parented and how I want to parent. Right? My macro clouds in being a parent is I want my children to be as happy as I am because I'm real fucking happy. So that's my clouds. It's simple. Right? Most parents tie their own self-esteem into their kids accomplishments. That's why they put stickers of what they did in school or what club they're part of. I don't care if my kids want to be entrepreneurs, non-entrepreneurs, if my daughter wants to make paintings out of tomatoes she'll get my support 1000%. I want to reverse engineer them. I want to know what they want to do. Right? That's my macro. Then my micro is the details of that. The actual practitionership around that. Like how much do tomatoes cost? Right? Like that. And I believe that 99% of this room plays in the middle of clouds and dirt. I believe that the market plays in the middle. A, they don't have top-line strategies and understand where the world's going. And B, they get fancy and they don't want to get their hands dirty. Much like my intro which I appreciate, the reason I stopped and took a selfie and said hello and shook hands is who the fuck am I? Like do you know what kind of feeling it is to have people admire what you do? Do you know what nice it is? Do you know how nice it is that somebody will DM you and say hey? Like do you understand what that feels like? You have to pull from opposite directions. Clouds and dirt. That's called really big fucking ego and really massive humility. Stop fucking complaining. Thank you. One, you can know what your ambition is. Right? Two, you have to figure out if what you're doing now is just the place where you're transitioning into the next chapter of your career or is this the thing that you want to try to build? And so if you actually decided from a strategical standpoint that the next two, three years is really just about learning. Less posturing, faking it to make it more just learning, tasting it, understanding the grass is not always greener. Yeah, startup land is better than finance land because people aren't as douchey or this and that, but there's a lot of things that aren't as good. Like pressure. Like it's all on you. Like da da da da da da da. Well then if you've made the macro decision that this is a stepping stone and this is how you're going to go about the world, all of a sudden you're not spending most of your time trying to figure out how to make the most money out of this. You're taking it in a totally different mindset. You've almost got a university like mentality to the execution. You don't want to go out of business. You don't want to have to go back to get a job. Seriously, you're inspired with the seminar business. Thank you man. Good luck to you. Patience. Patience. You've got so much more time. That's what's going to trip you up. You want it too fast. Everybody young wants it too fast. This is advice I'm giving. I'm giving advice to everybody right now. You really have to know what you're doing. Like at the macro. And the other thing is you have to be flexible enough to know what changes. What your ambition is at 19 and 15 and 22 is different than what your ambition is at 41 and you have to be flexible in that reality. So I think it's a it's a strategic answer. You know, and I think that I think you need to think about I think you need to think about tasting everything because you're a young man and you want to figure out what the hell you like and what you're good at. There's just an incredible you know, like kind of access point of like what you're great at and what you love. When you stumble into being somebody like me you really win. When what you're naturally great at is what you naturally love the most and away you go. The amount of people that I meet every day that are great at something but have no interest in being a CFO they love they're insane with numbers but they don't want to do it. They want to sing. Right? Or you know like and so that's tough you see it in athletics like people don't understand athletes the amount of athletes that just do it because it was the best way in the same way that somebody goes and becomes an accountant and they don't love competition and they don't love the sport it's crazy you know when you look at them because you're like you're one of the 15 you know and they don't love it which is why they're not the greatest athlete of all time the greatest athletes of all time are the ones who love it and have it and so I think what you need to do is taste everything. It's kind of like food. You don't know what your favorite food is if you only eat one food. That's why I love Q&A. It's the place where I can do my 301 course instead of my 101 course 301 course DRock that's where it is how are you? So I would take advantage of your youth and flexibility at this kind of age and try to taste everything play with everything figure out what you might be good at what you might like and then you make a decision you know when I think about being 41 years old and feeling as young as I I feel like I'm 10 years old this is a Gary V takeover I'm stealing people's fucking snapchats that's how we do it you got it. Stay with me. Take care I feel like I have my whole life in front of me and I think it's very difficult for youngsters to realize that I'm sure some of us that have lived a little bit longer you know you just don't like when I was how old are you? When I was 26, 41 seemed like a fucking long way away like my 8 year old cousin who worked with me at Wine Library seemed old to me you know he was 34 when I was 26 so 41 fuck like it's funny for me to think about how you're seeing me but I'm telling you you're going to feel exactly the way you feel right now at 41 and so that's interesting because when people understand that you can start deploying more patience because right now you want to prove it you got right? Yeah quickly you know I can read that because you're in the fake like first words out of your mouth always are such an indicator of what's on your mind you know I don't I never cared to fake it till I made it because I didn't care what people thought how are you? Any advice for us Gary? for today? Yes you're going to die so do something about it a pleasure real pleasure man continue success when you can eliminate that shit changes real quick you know even think about high school and then going into college like high school is so tough for people because it's the apex of when everything's about what other people think and then you love the transition to university or to last year high school because you care a little less right? But those first couple years of high school I don't know the school system exactly how you guys do it like everybody's wrapped up in that 12 to 17 year old age of like everything's about what everybody else thinks and that's why so many people hate that era I just never went through that luckily just hard wiring good parenting, serendipity circumstance wrapping my self esteem and things that I was great at I'm not really good at thinking about what I'm bad at even in interviews the only time I get stumped is they're like what do you struggle with or what's a failure? I'm like I just don't even like quantify it I don't think it's worth it I think people dwell too much class? You sure can look at the pink sky that's a pink sky you like pink skies D-rock? Yeah I love pink skies D-rock loves pink skies I had a new strategy today which is I gave a little thought to the first thing which I decided was clouds and dirt and I then thematically improved it the whole way it was cool what I did that was cool you know what my first meetup is? my first meetup was in 2008 or 9 I was doing jury duty and took my phone out and tweeted they're like you have a 2 hour break but don't leave the general area I'm like what and this is before Vayner yeah this is before Vayner had an office I was in New Jersey there's nowhere to go couldn't get back to you up to the east side so I was like look opened up Google I was like I have an idea I'm gonna open up Google Maps there's a pizza shop I'm like so I tweeted I'm like hey I'm going to this pizza shop like and like seven people showed up seriously? yeah and that was like that's before meetups like that the phone had just come out that's so crazy and I was like what the f*** I was like this is cool you know like real pleasure take care of yourself I'm gonna see you soon yeah alright gonna wake up at 1.30 in the morning to do something pretty cool for the plan of the apps secret thing you'll know about it you'll reference this you'll reference this when you reference it but um good day Dublin I love you Brussels I'm about to love you see ya alright DRock wants the vlog to be better so we're gonna do a piece of we landed in this is what you get when you try to produce me ready here we go just want you to watch this yesterday I left New York City and I landed in Dublin this morning at 6am or so 7am boy boy met us at the you're going to ask for that I mean even the driver knows we've just been hanging out for half a day
