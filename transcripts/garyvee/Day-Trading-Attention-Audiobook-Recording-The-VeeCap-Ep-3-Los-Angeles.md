## Transcript
Are you a videographer and want to travel the world? Like, I don't know, Mexico City? Obviously I love you, Dustin. But I need alternatives. We also have to keep him at home sometimes to do some shit. So it's right, the D-Rocks, the Babins, the Caleb's. You've been seeing it through the years. We're adding a videographer to my team. I'm looking for applicants that really do this. We're not looking to train up anyone. When I did it with D-Rock and created the genre, or was one of the creators of the genre, we needed to train it. We don't need to train it anymore. A lot of you do this for other people and you feel like you've got the skills. I want the recording ability and really know how to record me when I'm traveling 24-7 and be hidden in the background and capturing the moments and mentally making note of the moments that we need to chop up. But I also want somebody who's an incredible storyteller in the post-production, in video form, in long form YouTube. So that's who we're looking for. Are you one of those people? Apply here in the copy here. I don't know how we're going to post-produce this, but I'm looking forward to traveling the world with you. I am actively recording my audio book right now and it fucking sucks. I'm really struggling with this shit. You do know this is my single least favorite thing to do in my entire professional career. Here we go. Harper Business and Harper Audio Present. Day trading attention. How to actually build brand and sales in the new social media world. By Gary Vaynerchuk. When you first start working out, maybe you just want to get your stand-in up and it's time to go on the treadmill. Yeah, I got it. Think about it. Think of it like working out. Think of it like working out. When you first start working out, maybe you just want to get your stand-in. I'm going to go off script here. Me and my team, when we're at our best and either I'm not being lazy or they're not just mailing it in, we are tweaking that video slightly for every platform and the copy for sure is different. I'm taking a break. Battling. How you doing? I'm doing. Oh boy. No. Yes. Fought it off. You carbs. I had expected you to be struggling more. The last time I clicked in, the last book I read, something happened. I think I learned how to read. I'm being serious. Meaning looking ahead. Looking ahead. Already gone off script more. That call was fun. That call is insane. Hey, man. Hey, man. I'm recording my book and I was reading it and I just had an idea that I want you to do. I want you to do an ad walking through the wine aisles next week that says, hey, local area. We'll run in a five or 10 mile radius. Hey, local friends. We know these ads are working. I want you to email me at branded at wine library dot com. Which wines do we not carry in the store that you'd like us to permanently carry? Just email me down below in the copy. We're going to run that in a 10 mile radius. The ad is literally going to tell people that if they email you, we'll take into serious consideration and we'll look at, we'll get all the feedback. I think it's going to work. I think it's going to make people feel part of the community of the store. I think it has a chance of going crazy. You like it? Yes. I 100% they feel a part of it. I just think it's a really cool version of the social media ad. Yeah. Yeah. Like for a local store, that's like so many words in the lead. Each platform has its own context, which impacts how the piece of content is being consumed. I'm going off script here. This is huge. Think of yourself right now. Again, I know so many of you are listening this working out, driving, walking a dog, that whole thing. So just take a chill pill for a second. I need you to pay attention. By the way, the chill pill recall. That was very 1993. You as a human, when you are on LinkedIn, think about how you are versus how you are when you're on Instagram or TikTok or Twitter. There's different versions of you. If you make content that understands that, you will overindex. I use different words and I have a different tone and tenor and use different content on LinkedIn because I know it's business time. Whereas I don't post my garage sale videos on LinkedIn, but I do that on TikTok because that's entertainment. That's almost more like television. And I could and I might occasionally, but I promise you the copy would be different. The copy on LinkedIn might be very different of like looking for a side hustle versus the copy on TikTok might be like, hey kids, want to make a couple bucks this weekend? Very different. Keep that in mind. It's not a game. It's a ring. The reality is, is the business world does not care about your feelings. Nobody's going to cry for you if you're not willing to do this and you like doing direct mail on yellow pages 30 years ago. Marketing has changed. You either change with it or you don't. Clips on YouTube shorts and TikTok. Clips on... Are you guys live? Hey live. This is what someone who's naturally good at most things looks like when they're doing something they're not as naturally good at. And how you can use that uniqueness to your advantage. I'm taking one second. Sid, did you sell any books? One book? Can I bang out this little part so I feel accomplished? Cool. Yeah, I'm feeling it so I'm not going to... I'll just get through this. Pay attention to your Instagram profile. Pay attention to your... Next. Pay attention to your Instagram profile. Next. Pay attention to your Instagram profile hygiene. I'm going to take a quick five second break. I want you guys going on for like three, four, five, seven minutes at a time and just trying to sell. I think we're just going to stay live on TikTok. I don't know. I'd rather do little Bert. Well, that's okay, but you've got to really do it. Part four. Some of the comments include it's the constant gratitude for me and turning that rainy day check to a rainy day savings account. Huge W dude. Amazing. In fact, I am going to take my phone right now live. Go to TikTok and literally make a piece of content right now. Are you one of these people that like mainly focuses on things that you're good at and that come easy? But I am. And I'll tell you right now, right now I'm in the middle of reading my new audio book and I'm grinding and it's hard. My reading skills are just not that strong. I just want to make a video and just say, you know what? I have a huge amount of love and just huge respect of people grinding through things that they have to do. And so I got love for you. See ya. Snoop, what's up brother? I hate reading. But I'll go in studio with you and drop some fucking lyrics anytime I got. I love you. You're a legend. Did you get snooped by the book? You stink. Taking a second. That was rough. How many pages are we in? We're on page 181. We need to hit 200 today. Okay. So we're well on our way and I think one page at least is fully images so we're skipping that entirely. I think we'll watch that next week. Let's do that. By the way, I'm doing a fucking picture book next time. I'm Gary Vaynerchuk. Thank you. Look, it's coming out in May. I'm in LA so I've been in studio the last two days and I literally, I would literally rather climb the tallest mountain in a t-shirt right now than read 100 pages of a book. It's that hard for me. It's a, I'm so glad it's day three. Almost over. I mean like I really have reading comprehension issues. Like the team will tell you like if they give me two paragraphs I'm like five minute meeting. So to read 100 pages it's like it takes me, you know, I'm in studio from like 10 to 5. Lunch break. Like, you know, it's like a, it's a five hour, five and a half hour day and it takes me five and a half hours to read 100 pages which I'm going to assume is slow and it's like a, it is a fucking grind. It's like I'm battling these pages. And what's tough is like because I'm having to read it, it's me reading what I talk about in like a worse version of me communicating it because I have to read it which is a weakness versus me talking it which is a strength. So my brain, my brain is reading it and wants to actually say what I'm trying to say but I have to follow the page. Like it's a fucking mess. The reason I have to do it. Oh yeah. Like my audio book crushes plus I also go off script. I'm like, you know, when I wrote this LinkedIn had this but now like, so like the book is also, the audio book is fun that way. But man, it's a fucking grind. Anyway, almost right. The truth is building reputation and brand is how you make your money. Oh, I like that. That was good. How do I find what's relevant to them? I use Google Trends. I read comments on social media for an hour to a day. I search different topics on social media based on demographics I'm trying to learn about which means for my, which means my for you page across social media platforms helps me stay on top of what's happening across all demographics. Let me go off grid here because I'm using these social media tools to really do research. My for you page is not just jets and wine and business stuff and that sometimes helps me with serendipity. So some of you could actually create a separate social media account just for your research and search a bunch of different stuff and these algorithms are going to show you a bunch of cool stuff. There's a little hack that I think will help you. Day trading attention isn't about predicting what's next. It's about staying on the pulse of where people's eyes and ears are today and marketing for the now wherever that happens to be. I hope you put your effort into truly becoming a practitioner of that with this book as your guide. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Coming in. Oh my God. So the way that this will work is I have a sample to play for each of these. So we'll look here the sample and that will allow us to kind of match like the general sort of pacing and vibe as well as we'll hear the error and know so we can know what to fix. First sample. Maybe your skin care brand made a funny reference to a Netflix series you like. And the next time you went to mall or a drug store, you picked up their product because subconsciously it felt closer to that brand than their competitors.

Before they became a trading card company, Fleer included baseball cards and their bubble gum. Before they became a trading card company, Fleer included baseball cards with their gum products. Well that went well. That was fun. Yeah! That was awesome! I'm pumped it's over. Let's go. Thank you my friend. I thought that one day that what takes me three days is going to take like 14 seconds. It's wild. Yeah I mean we've definitely looked into you know using like the voice cloning to essentially make author reads for the authors so that they don't have to like say here and do it. It's not there or there yet? Yeah. Because we've been testing it but what's happened just in 18 months? I mean for sure. 18 months ago I was like hello I am Gary. So like now it's like hello Gary. Pretty close. Yeah it's getting there. Yeah so I mean it'll be a thing that will happen eventually. Always. Technology always works. Yeah. Talk to you soon. Later. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thank you my friend. Nice meeting you. Thank you. I actually think that whole thing is a really funny clip.
