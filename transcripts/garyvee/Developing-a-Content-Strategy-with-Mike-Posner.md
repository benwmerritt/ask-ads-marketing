## Transcript
Going on the street and talking to people is a genre that will always work. There is a lot of people that will never do that. And it's okay to not do that, that's not you. It's not me. Good, right? But hiking and literally just fucking spewing thoughts for an hour, that's you. How they do that, I said it with my friend. Right, now I recommend hiking along with your Dustin. It took me two days to realize why reality TV worked. I'm like fuck man, D-Rock's been following me around for the whole day, I forgot he's here, this is real life. You're not having to hold it and now you're just in the fucking stream of conscious. Like the shit I say to myself is the best shit I've ever made. It just never saw the day of earth. Like especially in the last since COVID, I haven't been doing the filming the same way. Man, there's probably a hundred things that would have been my most viral videos of the year that died in my head, cause nobody was around. I'm just so inspired like, one, I'm the best I've ever been in life. That's awesome. I'm sharing with your team. And I'm just like inspired and I am building right now. Good for you brother. And like my team I set up before was just for music. I remember. And I'm, I know what we're here for. And so I'm inspired by your team because like you built that. And they went around the room and we introduced ourselves and they said how long they've worked here. And we were talking about how in music, like if I sit down at the record label, the maxing is there's three years. That's the same in advertising or marketing. It's worse. But you're doing something different. Yeah, I care about them. Exactly. It's not super complicated. It's the hardest thing for people, but it's actually the easiest thing. And I think, look, I'm very excited about you being here. I've seen it from afar. I'm a fan. I want you to win. We have a lot of insights. We can really help. But by the way, it all comes back down to what you just, like you already have the punchline in four minutes. The punchline is going to be the humans we select on who they are as people. And then how good are they at the craft? We can audit how good they are at the craft at scale. Truth be told, they probably might literally be sitting in my company right now or had been in this company because we already know who they are. And like this is a very fun gig. There's like, you know, there's a lot of people that would want to be on your content team. I'd want to be on your content team. I think what you, so I think really, there's a couple of things. What's different between you and I is I'm also a practitioner of it. And you'll be less at this point of it. And I have, I need to get a sense of how much you want or not want to be knowledgeable in the platforms, how they work, things of that nature. I don't think it's a requirement to be me. But if I'm at a 401 class level using college terminology, you can't be in high school. You're gonna need to at least be a 101, preferably a 201. And I think any person that wants to build an audience and get their message out has to be capable of auditing their team. One of the things that is absolutely true that is foundational to things that work out for me is I know it. So when I'm working with them, I know it. That matters because if you don't know it, then you're in trouble. It's why people get their money stolen from them because they don't know finances. It's why people don't get the results they're looking for in something because they don't know it. It's why people get hosed by loyters because they don't know it. It's like, it's life. So you're on a mission to get this out. You know, especially when you come from a music framework and you've had some real hits, you know what it feels like to have something you wanted people to know, hit scale. You've tasted that, which is rare. Most people on earth will never feel that feeling. You're right? So you know what you're up to. You know what you want to accomplish. The content version of that, look, there's viral videos. No different than having a hit song, right? It happens. But the reality is back to making the comp and music. The real career is there's a lot more there than just, right? And so that's what you're gonna build with this. There may be things that pop off. You already have a big fan base to begin with. You have a nest, at this point, because we're not 18 anymore. You have even something probably more powerful than you realize. Even, this is something that I'm really excited about. The nostalgia aspect is real. Like, you know, the fact that we can, you can recall moments where people first discovered you is gonna be very valuable. So I'm thinking a lot about that. But this is brick by brick. And it's gonna come to making a team and then deciding very simply, how are you gonna make the content? And so what do I mean by that? The way I make content is happening right now. I just record my real life. There's the concept of coming up with a couple of consistent themes that you're gonna do. Events that you record and produce. Like, you're gonna need that kind of anchor to get the post-production from. So I think that's a big, big part to think through. But the biggest thing that will be the variable of difference here is you not lying to yourself. All the things that we're frustrated about with my content is because I'm incapable of doing it. I'm just too busy. I can't do it. Like, we know on my team that if I brought back tea with Gary Vee, like I did during COVID, we'd be crushing the world. If I woke up every morning and did eight to nine a.m. on tea with Gary Vee, we'd have no problems on my team. We would have four to five clips every fucking day that are worthwhile to break down into. Post-produce, and we'd be fucking moonwalking. On the flip side, when I'm deeply operational with B-Friends and VaynerX, and they're the first people that don't even get two minutes to run in and capture some content. And that gets hard. So the recommendation, why did I tell you that story? The number one mistake that the MP in this scenario always makes is they lie to themselves about what's their, that's your initials. The MP, you know. I'm like, does that's a oral lunch shit? That's a oral lunch shit. That's a oral lunch shit. That, the person that's making this decision, someone famous, someone to come, just what I wanna do, the mistake, especially when they've already had success. Kids know they have time to run and do anything. I wanna be famous, I wanna be a TikToker. It's when you are a grown up and have a real life and have had a career and you've got your cadence and what have you, you need to be real with yourself. For example, going on the street and talking to people is a genre that will always work. There is a lot of people that will never do that. And it's okay to not do that. That's not you. It's not me. Good, right? But you fucking, like hiking and literally just fucking spewing thoughts for an hour, that's you. How do they do that? I sent it to my friends. Right, now I recommend hiking along with your Dustin. Because what that does, I'll tell you, when I first started doing the thing that became the thing, it took me two days to realize why reality TV worked. I'm like, fuck, man, D-Rock's been following me around for the whole day, I forgot he's here, this is real life. And so what that does is that you're not, think about the difference. You're not having to hold it and now you're just in the fucking stream of conscious. Like the shit I say to myself is the best shit I've ever made. I just never saw the day of earth. Like, especially in the last, since COVID, I haven't been doing the filming the same way. Man, there's probably a hundred things that would have been my most viral videos of the year that died in my head because nobody was around. That didn't happen for five years, which is why I was able to build what I built. So I think you've got to find a team. What I'm doing right now is setting the strategy. Because this team could show you everything when they take over this meeting and then we'll do it again. Like Hannah said yesterday on email, like this is not a one and done thing. Like we're here for you. We'll help you through this whole thing. The biggest thing you need to do is not lie to yourself about what you're willing to do or not do. But challenge yourself on things you may want to try. Yeah, let me respond. Please. You said you want to get a sense of how much I want to learn. I have unlimited time for the things that I care about. I understand that. I care about my mission. My father used to say there's two ages in life, health and happiness. My mission is to make people healthier and happier. I love it. I have a lot of love inside me. And what's frustrating to me is I'm not giving all that I can. I get it. And I know that. And you know that. So I am totally willing to learn. Love it. Yeah. The learning is easy. And not lying to myself is very easy for me. Good. I have a very strong internal. So great. Let's just go to the next level then. Cause I buy all that watching you from afar and knowing a little bit about you. What do you think your pillars are gonna be? Like, cool. Like I let you rent the best team in the world. Tomorrow. What are you doing? You think? Like talk to me? Cause the pillars of like. Content. Oh, the content. I think the number two option. Which is? The podcast that you mentioned. You want to do a podcast. Yeah. Good. Documented. Got it. How often do you think you want to do it? What's your gut tell you? My gut tells me to start off with a commitment at least once a week. Love. At least. That's a monster. That's a back to you backing up your words. That's the right answer. Next. Where do you want to do it? I want to do it in LA. Great. Makes it easy for people. I have a few locations I've already been scouting. Like where like, I mean studios are like setups you want to do. Yes. Yes. Do you have a sense of where? There's a place, I live in Topanga Canyon. So it's like beautiful nature, ice baths. That's my vibe. I get it. So there's a place near me I can rent. That's not like a studio. How far is that from like people, like for people that landed LAX? Like how far is that? 45. Oh good. It's perfect. Okay. Great. What else? If anything. Content pillars. Content pillars. I had this idea this morning. It's like you're talking, where was the camera? I am someone, I wake up every day and I do like Tony Robbins incantation. Yeah. I want to create my own for those people. Good. I want to fucking like you go on my feed and it says, if you're tired, listen to this. Yeah. And I'm guiding you. If you're angry, do this. If you're happy and you want to go all the way to joyful, do this. It's like, listen to this. So I want to create like guided content that change people's internal state and improve the quality of their life. You want to do that in the form of, so you want to go about that more like doing an album. Like actually this is always the cool shit. Some of the favorites like that. My favorite bucket. When I tell you this shit scares the living fuck out of my soul, I respect these dudes the most. You want to go out there? When I tell you this shit, I can feel it in my stomach right now and I'm not even on the fucking platform. I'm better with heights overall net net, but like that shit's just crazy. We're fucking up here. And he was like leaving. He was like, he was in. He was in. I get it though. One of the other things that's like that is public speaking. When I tell you, Dustin, you've seen this a bunch. When I'm backstage and they're like eight seconds, like 15 seconds and I'm like still like texting Sid, like post it now or like completely chilling. People are like, what the fuck? Cause for a lot of people, that's the scariest thing. You know, anyway. So you want to go, yeah, public speaking scares the fuck out. It's the one thing that I think I do the best for me that I know is really hard for others. And it's that I'm leaning. Like I'm like one minute in front of 20,000 people. I'm not even thinking about it. I'm like pure improv. It's like walking out of this room. So you want to do that more structured. Like instead of making the content day to day, be what that represents. You want to go up, which I fully understand. You want to go about it and record that. That's fine. You'll bang that out. I can bang out. Like those are always coming. All day, all of course. You can do that audio to your phone. Yes. And then have a team and then have a team produce post. Yes. Okay. What else, if anything? So I also provide experience to like companies and teams. I go like I just did my TED talk at TED countdown, crushed it. So like I'll go to corporate corporations or to professional sports teams in San Francisco 49ers. I'm a certified Wim Hof instructor. So I'll go do 10 minutes, inspire them, keynote. So do you want to rev up your public speaking career? Yeah. Even are coming by at 11, 15. Amazing. Yeah. I just crushed it 10 times. Do you document any of that currently? Like when you're filming that stuff, is someone filming? There's some. Yeah. Yeah. Before I bounce, what about music? Where is that sit in the world? It's like the soil from which everything sprouts. Yep. And it like I'll never stop doing it. I'm the most creative I've ever been. Would you do a daily vlog like I did? Like literally film yourself all day and then put something else on YouTube? If we had a dope guy that I liked that didn't annoy me, like him, he'd keep up with me. That is a piece of cake. I mean it's not meaning I've had plenty of dope guys and gals that I didn't want to work with, but plenty that I have. And I feel like when you have a lot of love inside, you can, your filter is not as hard as you think on that. And we surely know what he or she looks like. So we can help on that too. Let me be true in integrity. That to me is like, let me see how it goes. Good news, you do one. It's like anything else. Before you jumped into a cold bath, you had to do it the first time. You clearly had a, you might have thought it was gonna be awesome, but you still had a, let me see how this goes. Fuck yeah. Right? Same with this. You do it for a day or a week? Nothing longer. Well, I'd like you to do it forever if you want to, because it's the most profound way. It's gonna be weird for a week. You do it for a month and you really know if I'd like it or not. Yeah, the good news is, the good news is for like, here's Stan and you're like, I like Stan. Here's Stan, Charlie and Sally and you meet them and you're like, I like Stan. And you literally, if you text me and be like, yo, I can't do this after the first day or if you did it for a week and be like, I can't do this or if you did it for 30 days and be like, I can't do this, it's all the same. Or you'll be like, I can do it. Like it's really, I'm really agnostic to it. I think you should consider it because it does put you in the best position to succeed for what you want. I'll tell you what. I think where my resistance comes from is having stuff like that and not having it be converted. Like not having an A player editing it. I get it. So if I had that, I think it'd be a lot more exciting to me because my actual life, like first you said to me, you're fit, it's not an accident. Like my life is inspiring and I wanna share that. And I built that over decades, you know? Like, and so there's a lot to share. Reaching. There's a lot to share. You know, like I was selling wine and was like, I need to share. Like I understand how it happens. I lived it. I think the genre that he's walking into, which is a really modern, the modern version of spirituality is really neat. Cause I think what I sense is it's similar to what happened with fitness. Fitness in the 70s and 80s was much smaller. You'd be stunned what people wrote about going to the gym in the 70s. Like it's a little culty. It doesn't mean anything. Like who gives up? Now it's like, he's growing up in a way. Like that's just like showering. Like having an exercise regimen of some sorts is just like the most normal thing. Whereas I'm old enough to know like nobody thought like that. Except like the golds gyms dudes. And so I think today, even the last five years, the concept of being spiritual. Like the breathing, the baths, the mental health. Like all of this, you know, five years. I mean, I've been making content long enough to know like I was touching on it without even realizing I was touching on it and it mattered. Now it's like at the forefront. And I think the appetite for it, we haven't even begun to fill. So when I hear what he wants to do, there's not enough supply for the demand. And especially on the male front. And I think Mike has more, we have like him and I share something. Though mine comes across more aggressive than his does. It is in nature a more like warm entry point to it. You know, it's not like, you know. I think it comes from a really powerful place. Like when you talk about the music as the foundation in this all spirituality, sometimes spirituality for the sake of spirituality can get a little on the nose. But as a part of a much larger ecosystem of you as a creative musician, you know, like then it, I think it becomes very relatable because everyone has multi hyphen. Everyone's multi hyphen now, right? Whereas like the old golds gyms like, well that's what I do, I'm a lifter. Now it's like people do that because everyone's around the sun, Sam. It spurs whatever else is going on in their life. Yeah. I lived it, man. I was born just kind of a shy depressed Jewish kid from the suburbs. And I looked like my real life is bigger than my dreams were. And like that, I came and explained that. And so how did that happen? Well, like, I'm not just a dude sitting behind the mic. Like, you know, try doing this. Like, dude, I put my life on the line. Like I almost died of malinverse. And I'm the guy that almost died and kept going and got this like, so I just got something to share, you know, and it's deep. And it's like, I look at my socials now and it's like, it's one color, but in this, I feel like this longer format, I can share a lot more, go a lot more. 100%. And I'm excited. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Let me ask you a question. There's no one to be respectful of your time. When I think about building the team around me, I think about hiring a president. Yep. Who's like, with me, compliments me, knows how to sell, knows how to market, knows how to build a team. My recommendation is go with more of a SID, of a creative lead. So what are the metrics you look for in that creative director? And what are their KPI? I should measure. The things that you're measuring is growth of consumption of your content. Not follow count, but growth of actual consumption. Views, qualitative feedback. And honestly, your subjective opinion of if you're feeling that you're growing. Do you know how I judged it? When I went to the airport, it felt like more people were saying what's up. That was it? That's how I judged it. And can you help me find that person? That's the main reason you're here. The main reason, like I could have said this to you over Zoom. I want a bunch of people to feel you and then we'll all debate of like who's out there. Yeah. God bless you. We'll talk soon. Enjoy the rest of this meeting.
