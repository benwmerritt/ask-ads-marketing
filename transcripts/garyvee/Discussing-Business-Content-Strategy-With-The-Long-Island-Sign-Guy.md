## Transcript
I think you should find tons of articles on the internet that talk about the value of freshening up or good signage on conversion to in-store traffic. Like literally I would type in better sign in in-store sign and then green screen. Hey, have you had the same sign? Have you had the same window signs? Have you had the same buy to get to free banner on your poll for nine years? Like this article says, if you change your core offering on your main outdoor advertising, every quarter your business goes up 31%. I'm the one outside guy. That can crush. Attention is the number one asset. How are things? Good. We were downstairs at the desk when you walked by. Oh yeah? You only walked by. I'm sorry. I'm excited. How's your week? Good, very good. Long week by Tom, it gets to Fridays. I'm excited about this. Very excited. Yeah, me too, I can't wait. I'm excited about this as well. Really excited to focus and listen and try to provide you as much value as possible. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Why don't I do some listening? Okay. I'm sure you gave some thought to what you wanted to discuss or get out of this. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Would love to zero in on that a little bit. Well, so you know, I'm gonna start really just recent is, so I've been doing social media a lot of posting. We do paid advertising. I've got a guy who does my paid advertising. Internally or externally? Externally. How much do you spend a month? A grand a month. Respect. So does really well. All of our business growth is from it. But what I see more than anything, and we do, I do a decent amount of posting, not a lot. On the organic side. On the organic side. Decent amount. Educate me on that number. What platforms, how many? TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, not as much and just started since you've been pushing LinkedIn, just started doing some posting LinkedIn. YouTube Shorts? YouTube Shorts just really started getting into YouTube Shorts. I've had the YouTube... The reason I like YouTube Shorts is that if you title them like, need a sign for my store, like, you know, whatever, we'll get into the details. YouTube Shorts, YouTube's the second biggest search engine in the world. So like, you know, whereas a lot of this stuff is kind of like running a commercial, like if people happen to see it, YouTube lasts longer. So nothing about it. So you get both. But keep going. Well, so a lot of what I've been doing when I first started was literally standing in front of buildings that we were doing. Hey, we just put up the sign. Yeah, I was doing a lot and getting... Let me, what's the... What's the YouTube sign? At Long Island Sign Guy. TikTok and Instagram are probably the most active of the two. Makes sense. Go ahead. So a lot of it is that, and I started to add the... I started to add the educational business, local business marketing, local business, things that are going on that I see. What I've really seen is I walk into a client now. Someone tracks me down on Instagram, whether they do a lead through paid or just my organic. I walk in and it's like the deal's done. Of course. You've already built brand. It's, I mean, I've never... You're not in sales anymore when you do this. It's why you buy a Ralph Lauren or a Polo. Like it's already done. It's done. Correct. I think the thing right away that I'm excited about, I asked the team, we just got it. I'm gonna give you one of the first copies. Thank you. I'm excited for you to read it. Like right away, the thing that I'm most excited about with you leaving here is getting great at it. Let's say we were talking about health and wellness right now and not business. You would say, you know what? I started eating a little bit better and going to the gym. I'm like, that's good. You're like, I want bigger muscles for my wife. I'm like, okay. Well, I've come to learn the last 10 years, there's a proper way to do hammer curls. And then there's the way that now, occasionally when I'm traveling with Mike, we have to go to an equinox or something and I see all these characters doing workout. I'm like, wow, they don't do it right. They're like swinging. I don't know what it is. That's what I see here. A lot of what like your last 12 posts in a row on Instagram, all of them not best practices. First, second of the video. Like, so for example, this one, which I like actually, I think this could be a very good format for you. Just like, you know. I'd like you to keep your eyes on the road a little bit. But, but. We're in traffic, it's a long island. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not gonna get it, trust me, I know. I don't know what the behind the scenes views are, but or reach, but eight likes, two comments, couple tweaks and just like to use those because I can see them. Let's say they got a thousand reach. You'll pull it up. It's gonna be really cool. Like that's gonna be something we're gonna focus on. And honestly, I'm incredibly obsessed for us to, I'm incredibly obsessed. So everything's ticked on. Yeah, Instagram's right next to it if you close it. But that's all, they're all repetitive. This is a big part of what I'm excited about. He's not afraid to be on camera, which I know. He's got it. He listens to how I listen to you and like you're like so many people are afraid to be on camera and he like. That's not him. He's so not afraid to be on camera. There's a couple of different things I'm thinking about. A lot of different things I'm thinking about. So one, it's important to me, given how gracious you've been to my dad, that this isn't the only value we bring. So one of the reasons I wanted to sit in Carly, here is I wanna focus on as much as I can give you that I think is uniquely, maybe not uniquely me because they know me so well, but I'm gonna give you what I got and then they're gonna do some follow up with you as well. So that we can really refine down to best practices. I wanna talk about beautiful. And then, depending on how much you accomplish, amazing. You know this, I'm very hot on the local mayor thing. People always talk about like, it not working. I get a lot of that feedback, but then I get the occasional feedback where it really works and it just becomes a game of the same thing. Are you good at it? So one of the things that I think about when you're the Long Island sign guy is business development with other businesses that don't need your sign. So let me explain. What's the most famous deli in the town that you live in or closest town or pizza shop or restaurant or ice cream shop or something, give me anything. In the town we live in? Robkeys. Robkeys is a big restaurant on that. I'd like you to do content with the owner of Robkeys outside of Robkeys where it's very visual where people know it's like, one of the things that if you look at the ads Brandon's doing for Wine Library right now, that first second, yeah, that first second's everything. You can imagine if you're going through the stream, if you can see the big Robkeys sign, if you guys are standing outside, you're just gonna get a lot more awareness. Go ahead. Let's see if we can do something. Before I got into the sign business, right before I decided I'm gonna try to do this and I started something called Meet Long Island. And the idea was just I was gonna interview business people on Long Island, nothing else. And then the format became long and I sort of dropped it, but now my day is spent. Literally I go in, talk to you about your sign for five minutes and then it's 20 minutes I'm growing you on your business. I love talking about the businesses. So I talk to business owners all day long. Are you filming that? No. Good. But that's what we're gonna do. That's what I've been trying to figure out a way because these guys are all talking to me. It's also gonna set up your post this career. If you do this well, you'll do consulting when you guys move wherever the fuck you wanna move after this. If you do this well, it will significantly grow your current business, but being known as a business consultant, it's my trajectory. I did it for Wine, but obviously being a business strategist leads to, I mean I could obviously run that, I could like hang it up and just go to Florida and be on a Zoom a couple hours a day and live a very, very nice life. I think that's great. If you're actually doing that, then we need to go ham on that. That is my day, all day. I think we need to get a kid to film you from Long Island. I think we need to get you into much better practices. And then when I think we need to spend the rest of the time with me on it is macro strategies of things that are sustainable that can get you content. So, signs. So obviously you do the building sign. I'm obviously aware of that. Any, all signs or just big building signs? Anything, anything from. Go to the lowest. Banners, yard signs. Someone walks in and they want yard signs for their power washing business. We'll make them 50 yard signs. Got it, they're just sticking people's yards. They're gonna stick right up. We do banners for schools for anybody. We'll wrap the inside of a building walls, all your wall vinyl. We do all that. What about the outside stuff that's like sticky? All the glass. All the graphics on buildings. Yeah, it's all vinyl. It's all the same sort of vehicle wraps. We had a, it's the afternoon, a customer of mine calls up and we've gone and put some vehicle graphics on his truck and he goes, I just got a new cement mixer. I'm like, I'll come by. He's like, I'll bring it to you. So there's a cement mixer on the side. My guys are wrapping it. I think they're all excited to play with the cement mixer. What did anything? What's a, from the business model standpoint, what is the best things to sell? The bigger the project, the more the market? No, vinyl. Great. Vinyl is the highest market. Educating on that. So vinyl is, so you don't have any, but the door graphics, your dots on your door, someone put those dots there and those little dots. And sometimes where there's, you know- Are you making a lot of content around vinyl? No. Not as much as we should. So in the shop, we'll fabricate, we'll print all that, we'll cut it, we'll lamb it, we'll get it ready for the installers to go in. Let's talk about the shop. Okay. So are you aware of what's going on with live streaming? Where people just streaming the mundane? Is there an opportunity? I know it won't be you. It might be people- It'll be me sometimes. Sometimes I'll be there. We're back in there. Is that an opportunity? Yeah, we set up the GoPro at the end of the table and just like on fast forward, have he's put videos together of doing all the shopping. There's nothing that happens that you're concerned about or anything like you'll be able to live stream it. Because obviously GoPro, you're in control of post production. Live is live, right? Yeah. No, there's no- Okay. You're making notes? It's kind of a- There's just kind of like this, what I would call professional ASMR porn that people just like. They're just like watching voyeurism. Like people just like background noise. Like it's wild. Yeah. You'd be stuck- As long as you interact with them too. Yeah, that's right. You've got to talk to them. Like that posture. Yeah. How long does this take to do for one client? And you can- That's the whole set of questions. That's right. You do it in bursts. Like you don't have to like constantly look. Like you could be like, I'm gonna answer in 15 minutes. Coming back in 15, you answer. We don't have to go live 24-7. We don't have to go live the whole day because what usually happens in our shop is we've got guys in and out all day. We've got the shop can be open and nobody in it for four hours. And then all of a sudden for three hours, Of course, bustling. All over the place. It goes back and forth. What? And so as long as we get, we could absolutely, there's nothing going on there that's- No, no. No. What else? I've got other ideas, I wanna make sure I don't- I've looked at it because everything I focused on is Long Island. Everything I focused on is Long Island. So I've, you know, I see a lot of the local- Would you rebrand the tri-state? Signed I have. We could. There's issues working in the city outside. Makes sense. Licensing permits. I can do anything inside. So I can go outside. So we've avoided Queens, Brooklyn for now. Makes sense. So it's just a pain in the neck. And then you've got in Long Island. I mean, it's big. It's best? We've got 3.7 million people, I think. So it's a ton of business. Keep you busy for a while. Keep you busy for a while. What's that? Yeah, yeah. And the- What's a competitive landscape look like? A few big players and a ton of different names. Big Apple printing. They're all, Marcus is universal. They're all, but the big guys are five and 10 million. Even there's a big Sinerama that's probably a $10 million company. But the real landscape is the million guys that have worked out of the truck, worked out of the garage, or have $300,000 shops. That's the big landscape. Debt by a thousand. That's the big one because they don't have overhead. They don't have insurance. They go out and they just, I'll do that for half the price. That's the big landscape. And it's not just, there's one guy running around doing that. There's everybody. Everybody that works for me used to own a sign company. They all used to own sign companies. That's the landscape. Interesting. That's exactly what it is. But none of them, we get a ton of, this guy, the guy that I said about the concrete truck, he's a customer. We took care of him. And he literally said, I got a new truck and pulled his cement truck. He said, I need it wrapped because I can't take it out on the road. And it's probably a $100,000 truck. And he said, I need it wrapped now. I need the graphics. I need my DOT numbers on it. He just pulled it up and he said, get this done. So, and that's the, so we build the customer relationships. Small guys don't have that. The low guys that are working under the trucks or working under the garage just don't have that opportunity. But the only other thing I'll say is, I got into this a year and a half ago. And I had been in internet marketing for 20 years. Mostly I had a security software company, email marketing, just that type and I was done. Search. Search. Affiliate. Yeah, all affiliate. Big email marketing. I used to own a security software company. Direct mail? No, no direct mail. And I just played around with some social media, but not a lot of fun going around with security software. It's not a lot to do. No. Not a lot to do. And you know this, like social's hard. Yeah. Like it's actually hard. That's why it's so lucrative. It has all the attention. Yep. You know, back to your, a bunch of guys running around with 300K. You're competing with the whole world. Literally actually. Yep. Actually. And like the book I just wrote is like a textbook. Like I was bored reading it in my booth. I'm like, because it's just, it's gotten hard, but it's so lucrative when it's right. You know what? The fact that you wake up every morning at one post can drive your business in perpetuity? That's bananas. That's ridiculous. It's like there's nothing like it. It is. You know? That's why I like a little bit of the local stuff. Like to me, I'm trying to think of like, what could hit the psyche of all of Long Island? And I think it's Long Island institutions. Or I don't like politics, but like, I assume those politicians that put the lawn signs on, they have to make signs. Yeah. There's, you know, my mind went there. Then I'm just trying to think about like, where and what and how. Well, so, a buddy of mine owns, guy used to work with for a while, owns LA in a minute. Which is, I don't know if you've seen it, it's a TikTok channel, it's all LA. And he does, now he's gotten to the point where he's left his job. He does interviews. Big people now. Yeah, now we interview. And that's what he does. And I just, I am, you know, you always talk about doing something you're passionate about. I don't know if I like talking to business people about business. Yeah, I think you have a whole line. I think yours is exactly what you said. Like, if you're gonna be there for 25 minutes, get content out of it. And once you understand, if you're, again, back to that, that was a restaurant, right? That you mentioned. If you do that at like the counter, and it's you in the first second of like the image, if it's, you know, like, when you look at something like that, it's, you know, like, you're dead already, the beaver gone. Yeah, I thought that was cool. I think it's cool too, by the way. I think it's cool too. Sid will tell me, he's been here with me the whole run. Many of my favorite moves don't work anymore, or never worked. Yeah. This is why I'm excited. But anyway, back to the restaurant. I need, I need like the two, the Wine Library thing, right? Like that was, that's great. Because I saw, and obviously I know Wine Library, but you know, I think that you and that owner, this one again, is also hitting it. That, basically that, for the right 25 institutions. That being the thumbnail. That being the thumbnail in the first second, and maybe the quick inside joke, you go right into it, like the hedgehog, right, everyone? Like, you know, this is like Long Island lore, right? Like, that's it. That's it. Because then you, then you could start creating mass awareness, right? And so, they're just like, I'm just thinking about and. You could do this and that, and one quote from an interaction 25 minutes, have you thought about putting a root beer fountain in? Oh, that's a good idea. That's your business. So like, I just think it's a volume game. Yeah. And best practice, quality and quantity ratio is how I talk about it now. Obviously if you post four times a day and they're all bad, then they're all bad. But if you post four times a day and you understand core principles, and you have a couple go-to moves, and you've created a system that creates content, now you got something. Yeah, those, I, the people that I talk to, that see my videos, are a lot of the same people over and over again. And I realize that. Well, I think. Because I'm not. I think there's a couple things that, let's go ahead, I want you to think about it. Well, I'm not getting the distribution. I get it, I'm not getting the distribution. And what I think is probably happening is your paid media buyer is probably going to reach in frequency in a short area. He's just focusing on that's unsuffic. That's. That's all, well, that's all I want, right? That's all I want, everything's on that's unsufficant. Do you have any idea how he's doing his media? Or are you kind of like letting him do his thing? Oh, what do you mean how he's doing it? Is he targeting Hispanics? No, there's no. It's a. It's a. In Suffolk County and your first piece of content starts with, you know, Spanish translation. Zip code, zip code over. And I, I don't remember the age, but I think we start them at 35 or 30. Just because I, my preferences, my preferences B to B. I'm not really, I don't want the, the, the PTA mom. PTA mom's a headache. Of course. So, so I don't really want that. What I'm looking for is the, is the. So is he only targeting male? No. But he's business. But he's. No, we don't, there's no targeting beyond age and zip code. I'd love for us to look at his media account. My intuition is that there's a lot there. That, you know, bucks a month in a small area, you could do damage. We do. Yeah. I don't know what I'm. We do. I know exactly what's happened. Yeah. It comes in first too. And you're feeling good. Correct. But you don't know that. I used to think Burger King was good enough until I had like a real steak. Yeah. Yeah. Correct. You know, when I used to run the Google ads, my security software company, we spent a lot. Real money. We spending. Yeah. And that was intent marketing, not branding. Yeah. So it was a different game. Exactly. Sales. You know what I noticed a lot of also is I can't convince you to buy a sign. No. Like I may be able to. You have to be in market. That's right. I'm in your face all the time. You can convince me to consider a sign that I didn't know I even needed if you talk broad enough about all the things you got going. That I would say. Yeah. That I would say is, you know, I got one for you. Please take a note of this mentally or team. I've got a really good one for you. This has a lot to do with why we're getting a new sign. Like, you know, we have figured out local advertising with my library, with exactly what I'm gonna do for you. And like really have figured it out. Like there's a text from Brandon from five Saturdays ago at 9.01 a.m. that says I haven't see literally quote. This is the craziest thing I've seen in 25 years because it was like a hundred customers in the store. 9 a.m. We should have been at four for the first hour because everyone seeps in. So where was I go? Oh, so now that we fit, you know, because it's a 75% internet company. But now that we figured that out, I'm like, all right, we gotta kind of fucking care about the store again. Like we really, it's really been really weirdly secondary. It's been like a warehouse infrastructure more than like a story, even though it's a beautiful store. So now I'm focusing on everything, like landscaping, the signage, everything. It's looks like we're going out of business with all that side. So I'm excited. I'm very happy for my dad. But where I was going with that is, one of the reasons I'm doing that is through the years of having meetings with Walmart or Best Buy or GameStop, this can make sense to everyone, but like it really fucking matters the outside aesthetic of your store. It's like wearing, it's like fashion. So I think you should find a ton, this is a fun one. I think you should find tons of articles on the internet that talk about the value of freshening up or good signage on conversion to in-store traffic. Like literally I would type in better sign in in-store. And then green screen, hey, have you had the same sign? Have you had the same window signs? Have you had the same buy to get to free banner on your poll for nine years? Everybody's driving by the fucking, what's the, you know, LA, I'm trying to think of the secondary, it's nonetheless. Jericho. They've seen the same site, they tuned it out. You gotta refresh it. Like this article says, if you change your core offering on your main outdoor advertising, every quarter, your business goes up 31%. I'm a long outside guy. That can crush. That's convincing someone. That would convince someone. That's why Brandon and Jeff are texting you probably right now, cause not only that, I was like, sign, but when I came over, the signs they have on the windows, they're signs from our distributors, just cause they wanted to put them on. It's bad for us, their wines and liquor, that we make no money on. And so like let's make our own signs. And those signs are not expensive. Yeah, absolutely. So that is what I want. I think you should do a lot of that. Outside aesthetic conversion, there's unlimited articles and blog posts that have been written the last 20 years that are on the internet. You have to get very good at search. Probably want to use AI a little bit. Yeah. But like those green screens, like that pitch I just made, that's how you convince someone who's like, wait a minute, we have had the same fucking banner like lobster this Friday night on sale for the last six years and it's got stains all over it. Piece of shit. We just redid the Lazy Lobster. That's one of the exact same redid. He said lobster. I think, or did you know that if you hang a banner under your core sign on your business, then obviously town, I get it. You don't worry about that. That, I think if you start talking about, and by the way, you want to talk about poking on a zit, every local business is getting annihilated on in-store traffic. Every restaurant, every store, it's all Postmates UberEats and Dotcom. There's not a fucking person that owns a store right now of any kind that isn't stressed. That customer count is down from the year before and the year before and the year before. And so if you're a fucking nail salon and you see that and you're like sitting on your fucking desk, waiting for people to come in and you look at your window and you're like, I've had that same fucking sign of a girl with some nails on it being like, open now for fucking nine years. I would pound that. You could also talk about like, hey guys, long on sign, big thing that you guys don't know is I was in an internet marketing for 20 years. So now you're talking a little bit about your marketing. Now you hit them back with like, look at what happens if you do that. I think you could crush that. That's a whole genre. Like what this is, is what we're doing right now is strategy. And like that one strategy, like actually spending 30 minutes because in the beginning you'll find a bunch of articles and then it's gonna have to go deeper and deeper. I would do that. All day. All day. Those green screen. But again, notice how I broke down those two. Yeah. Like it's real business. You're really talking right to the business owners. I'm not even going for awareness. I'm going for like the fucking guy who knows the gal that knows like she's down a hundred customers a month from last year and she knows why. Because even though she's in a good script mall, people are ordering fucking delivery. The guys that are super on Long Island, the guys that are making it now are the ones that are, they're building their businesses around the new norm. So in other words, they're not like restaurants are not opening up and building out a restaurant that's huge. They're building, they're taking old restaurants that are smaller and redoing them and using a different like roast goes in. They've opened, they keep looking for old locations and they've got this really small. So they take a lot of inbound. They don't pay for a lot of seating and they've got this back and they've got their back for their food and they're used to a lot of people coming in and out. And those are the guys that really seem to be adding more and more and more. It's all ghost kitchens. Everyone's like, it's the middle's gone. It's delivery and super premium. You gotta get me out of my fucking house. We're all like people think people are lonely now. We're gonna be in fucking pods and VR and never remove. I think you can really attack that. By the way, I also think it's gonna work for them. It feels nice to buy a thousand dollars sign and actually has eight thousand dollars in value for them that year. Hey, we put up the, we started using AI for design work. Nice. And so I need a barber shop and I have a design and we put up an AI picture for an ad generator picture for a barber. It's an amazing looking picture. Really clean crisp on the side of the building. And literally the guy two days later, he's like, people are sitting at the light and walking in and commenting on those pictures. Of course. He's like, this is ridiculous. The sign that we're gonna put on the Milburn Avenue sign, not the main. That fucking Walgreens across the street. It's busy all the time. It's a blank building right now. And we assume that everybody knows this because we've been there for 20 years. It's not how humans work. No, they're forgotten. It's lost. By the way, the amount of people that are about to come into that store, one of the biggest mistakes I made in my career in that store was not put the underlining level of beer, food. I remember people that walk into wine lobby like, oh, your beer? Yeah. What the fuck? What the fuck? You know, so like. Wash that down. Shit, I gotta go to this. All right. So what do you think about the thing that you said about if you wanna work with brands, make a free ad for them? Like what do you think about reviewing signs for local businesses that he wants to work with? Here's what I think. I think that I have to do this meeting. That you guys should jam on that. And I enjoyed this so much. And I'm so grateful actually, that we'll allocate even more time with me. We'll do this again. I'll find a little more time soon. Perfect. This is too fun for me. Thank you. And I'm really, really grateful. Hey everybody, I wanted to say that a new book is coming. The follow-up to Javjavjav, right hook. Originally called Javjavjav, left hook. But I finally captured what I've been doing for the last 20 years as an entrepreneur, as a creator and influencer, as an operator of a marketing company that works with Fortune 5,500 companies. And really the punchline of what I'm seeing in society, which is day trading attention, how to actually build brand and sales in the new social media world. I'm really proud of this book. When I read it, and something you follow my social enough to see the clips, when I read it in studio, it got so deep, it goes so detailed. It goes macro and micro as I like to roll. And so if you've not picked up a copy yet, go to garyve.com slash DTA, which stands for day trading attention. I have a feeling that this book, much like Javjavjav, right hook, literally gotta know if they just read it. It's 10 years ago. The updated version of the marketing manual for your marketing team, definitely be a social media person that runs your stuff. You need to get a book for them. And definitely the marketers and Fortune 500 for your staff and the entrepreneurs and creators and influencers who are trying to build something for themselves. So proud of it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy putting it together. The manual that we are gonna give to everybody when they join in the media to read. And hopefully the manual to the modern marketing world, and especially social media first world, day trading attention out this May, 2024. Pre-order your copy now.
