Yeah, I think I think it's scary to me How passionate I am for to spit in this mic to everyone is listening like simplify your stuff Simplify because here's my thing. I I know a lot of people that are winning in life fame Money and so many of them are not happy that I'm like this isn't it Yeah, and even the ones that are happy when something bad happens like they lose a parent or something even worse a child Which is the scariest thing? Direct so I'm like wait a minute if this is life the hell am I worried about anything other than The health and well-being of like my circle my family the friends that have become my family I'm just attached from the Gary Vee from the money from the notoriety. I'm grateful for it I want to play it's like a it's like a game when I if we if you all like now we're playing pick up basketball Yeah, I'm gonna try so hard But that's how I think about life and business like it's a game I'm gonna try but I'm gonna keep my shit simple. Would you say if you're a broke? And I think it's so easy to say what you just did because what you're doing right now is the right question This is the point of what I'm trying to make The thousands of people that knew me when I didn't have a dollar in my name until I got to like 35 36 will tell you Well, I believe that more back then than I even do now I Know like let me ask you real real question. Do you know people that don't have a ton of money that are happy? Yeah Kind of Buy what they want to buy so I guess they have to settle honestly. I don't think of it that way I think that I think I listen let me frame. I think you're bringing up the proper context of the culture we live in But I just do up you know because I grew up with in such nothing circumstances the majority of my friends are not wealthy and I know the ones that are bitter about it like fuck this shit all of that right play me, you know And I know a lot of friends. You're fucking this up. He's been for one minute No, actually, you know, it's so crazy. You know, it's so crazy. Well, the base of right, you know, it's so funny He's going to the best part actually, okay, good. Yeah, he's doing it. Okay. You might get a reason Let's see what those it's super real like it's it's the question. It's the conversation The only people that think money is the gateway to happiness are the ones that haven't seen it or lived it at scale I can give you a great point. It's just the way it is like I didn't know the reason on the way I am is because my mom was so gangster also and we had so little growing up I just was always happy. So I knew by the time I was growing the money wasn't it? I've been happy. I am that you know what I mean? I was having this conversation earlier actually we're talking about how we're both kind of in the process of you know Trying to renegotiate contracts where it's an occasion thing and I was like it's so funny though because Prior to the money. I was so happy as well. Like I was I didn't think about Financial I don't know anything you mean what did he it what did he and biggie tried to tell us a long time ago? Very true more money more problems It's much scarier to go backwards Than the alternative the reason people are stressed when they get somewhere is coming down. You don't want to lose it Of course I have a friend who cries about not sitting courtside at basketball games anymore and because he can't afford it So he sits third row and he cries about it because he tasted it And so now he's fucked up that's crazy I'm just telling you real talk you posted a video and I thought it was so important It kind of ties into everything you you're talking to 20 and 30 year olds been saying slow down and and stop You know that you can touch on it more back started so important I don't know why people at 27 think that they should just be millionaires already They don't want to live like it in 60s when they are in the name as it means they wanted them now Then make a million dollars like my point is like cool. I understand But having that mindset I'm trying to go frantic and cut corners is why you're not gonna have it You gotta buy that I get it that's spoken like someone who doesn't know what 60 feels like to though How old me? No, you know, you know, crazy, you know For I'm 48. Okay that I figured you were my range ready Could you ever imagined being this age and feeling was young? You feel young? Oh, yeah I did not feel young why I got three young kids man They keep me up at the sleep me out. I worry about it like you said Of course the only thing I care about is the health of my children. So that's a constant Underlying fear and worry make sense. Yeah, make sense. That's because the media has scared parents We used to go outside and play now. You don't even let them do like like it's about what you look at life Is perspective what you're looking for is what you're gonna find It's never been safer for kids in America in the history of America doesn't feel that way Doesn't mean the data supports it We buy what we're looking for It has never been safer for a child in this country yet modern parenting is scared of their shadow Yes, we are So this is the game for me This is the game and I'll tell you where to get the real wisdom from forget me go spend time with 70 80 90 year olds That are not your grandparents Ghost we don't we put youth on a pedestal everyone's trying to be younger, right? All that stuff We need to put we need to get back to the old school and put the elders on a pedestal Why do you think people don't I mean, it's really weird. What do you put on? It's a great point. Why do you think? That people don't take the wisdom from elders. We've become selfish In a way that has never been real. We've become very insular. We've become less family oriented We've become less neighbor oriented. We've become me me me me me me Everything is that and that is a popular culture thing and that's cool. I mean you're done alone So that's why boys eating you even then you're dead when you're alive. It's we we we You die alone. Sweet. They're breasts. No, I'm speaking the real I'm speaking facts when you die You have no idea what the fuck's going on. You're dead That that's a statement This is back to what I believe has happened the last 45 years and negativity has been very successful at brainwashing us You die alone break that down for me. You'll die and you then know nothing else Every moment up to that is life and life is this It's a keep on that's how I see it. By the way, I ain't trying to convince nobody I'm not sure. I'm right. I'm right for me I know that I am happy and I know that most of the people that I observe that play it similar to me Ten to look happier regardless of income level. I think it's more we need to love people more There's a lot to this. I know we're running out of time But I if this sparked any thawing people's mind keep digging to it look for optimism Because if you're looking for negativity, it's out there But if you're looking for positivity, but if you're looking for positivity, it's out there. It's there, too Close it out man. We need the middle. We gotta talk to the nice you got I got a kid's book coming out I think I think back to what we just talked about everything we just talked about I think the world's gone too red and too blue the answer is purple find that middle purple That's why Steven is walking around in that suit
