## Transcript
Wednesday. Got to pay. What? Gonna hold it in. That shouldn't be how you actually start the episode that way. Me and Gary Vee up in the office. You ride, flap and walk through corporate. Talks about ownership and leverage. 1800 checks to shout out the beverage. Alright, let's do this again. Now this time, we're gonna... Oh, there's AJ. AJV. You got a call? AJ and Avener Sports Call. That was exciting. It was good to see my girl. Alright, let's go downstairs. Downstairs is where PureWow is. If you're not subscribed to PureWow.com right now. See, can you put a link right here for PureWow.com? That is where this is. Hey. Hey, how are you? I'm super well. How are you? Good. Good. Do you want to do some filming? Yeah, I'm just doing a little filming. Fuck it. Why not? Alright, let's see what's going on down here. That's all PureWow over there. Hey, Lisa Buckley. Hi. How are you? Good, good. Oh, well? I'm super well. Hey, David. Wow, your hair is legit. I really like that. Hey, Pure. What's up, Maria? You guys like his hair? I like it. Hey, Mom. How are you? Hi. Hi. This is PureWow. I'll just show you something real quick. This is Ryan Harwood when he was 30 pounds lighter, but he's still a CEO. So it didn't affect him. He actually didn't affect him in his ability to be the CEO of PureWow. We have rare opportunity for D-Rock or Iris or Justin or not around. Now I'm in the office by myself. So let's give a little bit of a tour. This is the quiet riot room for all you 80s kids. There's quiet riot. That's it. There's a couple, I don't know what the hell's going on in here now. There used to be a big ass table here, but something's going on. Let's see what's going on here. That's right, Shirley. Glad I caught that. Hey, great. Amazing. Hey. Make sure that's huge and everybody sees it. Can I meet everybody? I don't know. Let me actually show you around a little bit since the first time you're here. And then we'll come back. It's right here. I have one skill. I really understand people. And in my will, in my act of will, it says, if the human race figures out how to measure emotional intelligence, I want to be scored. That's how deeply I feel. It came to me at a genius level, but we don't talk about that. The only people that make the move care about one thing, legacy. If you do not care about legacy, you don't trade on this moment in time. Andy. Babin. DRock. I've got to figure it out. Here I'm going to sit. Hi. Sounds awesome. The practicality of like, I'm going to learn a crap this summer is ludicrous, because there's too many things that are not in control of that being the situation. Hence, why I think it's about the people. And plus, in reality, anything you would learn in six or eight or ten weeks, you're going to learn in the first 90 days of a job. At this point where you're questioning everything and you're still, so many of you are still in that place where you're just checking the box of what the right thing to do is, because that's how you've been trained for the last 20 years of your life. This is exactly the time to start debating it. For real. Because you wake up in your 32 real quick. Right? I mean, we were just sitting in, this is Eric Kaskner, he helped me build Wine Library. And we were just sitting in a small cubicle five seconds ago, building this website. So it happens real quick. I don't know. Combination of being an immigrant and having a ridiculously big time mom. Because I don't. And it's like so real. I just, I really wish you could have it too. Confidence, right? Like just not wavering. Like just fundamentally not caring about what anybody else thinks or feeling that anybody else is impacting me besides myself. But that's what I will do to the end. So. Thanks guys. Thanks everyone. How are you? Really good. How are you my friend? Real pleasure. I was the first Black sender comedian in South Africa. Really? About 19 years ago. Almost every Black comic from South Africa I found them. Or I put them on my show. I put a show called Black Song in the Comedy Show. Which has been going on for about 13 years. Incredible. So coming here now, it's a bit like. It's fun. I just book a theater. But then I'm not going to be part of this. I got it. I got it. I kind of need to get into that. Social. Yeah. Fast. Yeah. You know what you need to do? You need to call in every favor. If you take a picture every single goddamn day. With some comedian who has 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 40,000, 5,000,100,000, a million. If you just do it every day. It will matter. And then if you in between that make good content. You're on your way. And that part comes easy to you. Because you're a successful comedian. Thanks for making it happen. I would have done anything. Thanks man. Thanks. Real pleasure. Let's stay in touch. DM me anytime. This is the fire from the camera. Love it. Hi. Hi. I'm Jordan. Nice to meet you. I'm Gary. Nice to meet you. Good to see you guys. How are you? Good man. Hi. Hi. So I'm Jordan. I'm an actress. I'm the director of the film. The film is a film with a big impact on the world right now. And I set it to the email, here's a guy 23 years of school. Three graduate degrees. Orthodox. As pro school as there is out there. Telling his daughter, when she comes back from a week long program in Louisville, figure out what your future is. She sees somebody speak about social media branding. And I say to her, if social media branding is what you want, and that's where you want to go, intern. It's like this bizarro world. She's like, that college is fun. I want to go to school. I'm gonna go find a bunch of good looking girls, pay them money to take us to Riva. To hang out. Yeah. I love it. That's like a hashtag, like the Gary VFX. But you know what's funny about that? Like, or she could do college the way I did, which is like actually understand that truth, have fun in her sorority would have you, but in the time that would have been like study hours, hone her craft, right? Like she could kind of go to college and war, there's a version, you gotta go to a shitty enough college is just the truth, where you can actually have a job and have college life. Like some colleges will kick you out of school, right? Some won't. I went there. Like I literally went to four classes in my life. So the key is she needs to go to a shitty enough college. Shitty enough college that you can still get the college experience, but you have eight hours a day to actually work on, like you could have four years of getting great at social by literally working, if you go to Ohio State, working at some Columbus, Ohio, small agency, like nine to five, should be going to class. Now Ohio State will probably kick you out, but like this is literally my thesis on this. This is like one of those millions of conversations that now you've created in homes that didn't exist. I get it. I get it. And I was just like, you're like, what are you talking about dad? And I was a crap. And where are you now? Like a sophomore, junior, where are you in high school? I'm gonna be a senior. I'm gonna be a senior. I'm gonna be a legend. I'm gonna be a Johnny to your daddy outside. Ordinary people staying going, going crazy, fucking outlier. I'm gonna kiss you like a greasy, missy be my cherry, but now fire. See I ain't never running from a rumble only if I got my grandfather. My is my word. My park is my fire. My cool world, my lips, girl, love your girl. Love your words. Seeing that I'm leaving now, and later loving longer, longing for you, my dear. We believe in bleeding, we can even wear that. Baby, I swear. Bottom line is like, we've really figured it out. Like I really know what to do. Like you could become unbelievably recognized every time you walk around Portland. Like in a way that would stun you. Like I don't know what else to say. It's basically like, I think of it more like Lucille Ball and Bob Hope. Like when radio went to television, the world still thought a radio star was bigger than a television star, but it wasn't true. And it took about a decade for people to be like, fuck. That's basically, like Logan and Jake Paul are way more famous to anybody under 25 than virtually every other person you can name. That's it. Think about it. I just saw a headline, said one piece of content can change it all. No seriously, like Tim Ferriss wrote one book that literally launched an entire career. You've got two or three videos. Even better bro, even better bro, to your point. That keynote I gave at the Javits Center at Web 2.0. Then went on YouTube on Ted Talk, changed my career. Led to crush it. You know, it's one piece of content. But if you have brand equity, but if you have brand equity, you will be fine. There is never a bad time when you believe, when you work hard and when you know what you're doing. But you have to do, this is where it's crucial. You have to do what you love. Because let me tell you something. It gets tough, but if you love it, you will win. The only way to succeed now is to be completely transparent. Completely. Everything is exposed. Everything you do. So your legacy is your ultimate life. It's all you've got. And you can build so much on that. When you have brand equity, anything can happen. Written word, audio, video, pictures, four forms of communication, have the ability to do them all. I mean, it's the best job on earth. It's literally what every single 14 year old on earth wants to either be a YouTube star or an influencer. Like why wouldn't you live your life and make money? These are fucking hot. I have so many cool sneaks. Who's a 10 and a half around here? Who? You are? I don't think I'll wear these. You want these? Bang. You're 10 and a half? No. What do you think? You're 12? Yeah, I got it. I nailed it. I'm good at guessing people's shoe size. That's a random skill that people don't realize I have. Oh, so you're really trying to be a winner. Yes. This is fucking rad. So why don't we take a step, don't spend the money so fast. Like for example that, we should take two interns, literally just DM every single fucking Facebook culture page and pay them just to share it. Yeah. Like we don't have the, what we're not good at, what we need to do is replicate something. I'm trying to do a Vayner. This is back to my intern idea. We need to have like a slush fund of people. Like the way I roll, the right model is there's five guys and girls on our team that actually don't have anything to do other than the thing of the moment until I take them off the thing of the moment. Like right now if I had four people, and think about who they have to be. They have to be more of our cloth, which is they have to be completely utterly not fancy and have to be willing to eat shit and be like, for example, back in the day, like when Meanie J launched Please Dress Me, the search engine, the T-shirt search engine, the best thing I did, the thing I was most fun was staying up to five in the morning DMing people or whatever that was on the time, emailing blogs randomly. Like I think it's cool to now, like I'm gonna weirdly like start sending, once Z is up to date, like Tyler's gonna like, I think it's, and I don't care who does it, like it can be, like it's the, like to me nothing's smarter right now than spending 15 hours messaging every Facebook page that has a million followers, that's a culture page, and be like, hey, we have a video we'd like to share, how much? Control C, Control V, listen to your favorite fucking album, 50, like I can't wait for my vacation in August to do that. I just wanna remind you guys that that's probably why my Instagram and podcast work, because I went on vacation, did that a little bit, and was like, this is what we, so like we need to figure out how to hire and how to frame up for people to realize that's the best thing to do, not, oh wait a minute, I'm a filmmaker or I'm a business developer, like I'm like, you know what I mean? We need unbelievable amounts of humility to get done the kind of things I most believe in, because what I most believe in is all these people right now, like I just want to basically DM people on Facebook. This is Gary Vaynerchuk, and this is episode 260 of the Ask Gary Vee Show, and I'm super fired up. All right Linda, tell everybody who you are. All right, the two cents, all right, here's the two cents. Three cents, three cents, okay. Legends get three cents. Okay, nobody has hosted more sports centers than me on Instagram. Yeah, let's just say that one more time. All right, nobody, male or female, has hosted more sports centers on ESPN than me. Linda, come on. Get cool with that. All right, thank you so much. Gary. You keep asking questions, we'll keep answering them. Awesome. On this episode, LFC stops by. You guys are good? Oh, hell yeah, I'm getting good at this. Uh, yeah, an hour and a half by work. Bye Gary. Bye. Good? Good Gary.
