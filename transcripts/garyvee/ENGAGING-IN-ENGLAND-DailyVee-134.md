When people leave comments on YouTube, you suck, you're not funny, you're not interesting, feel bad for them because if they have enough time to leave a negative comment on your channel, they've lost. You focus on the positive, put out content. And here's the number one key, document, don't create. Don't overthink it. You can produce unlimited content every day, every day, every day, obviously of school and other things, but don't be crippled, don't be romantic. Just do, do, do, do, do, do, don't listen, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, don't listen. Because we're gonna be legends. We're gonna get their attention. We're gonna get high. What we're doing here ain't just scary. It's about to be legendary. We're gonna be legends. We're gonna teach them our lesson. Got this feeling in our souls we can't breathe. What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? We're in London right now. So Gary and I left New York at 6.25 p.m. That was when our flight left, but this flight sucks. Off to London. Gonna make some magic happen. Across the pond. 24 hours of hustle. UK style. When you leave at 6.25 or 6.30, whatever, you're not tired, so you can't go to bed. And when you arrive in London, you start at the beginning of the day. When you leave at 6.25 or 6.30, whatever, you're not tired, so you can't go to bed. And when you arrive in London, you start at the beginning of the day. Facebook video is so important to me. I just want us to be the best at that. I believe it's the modern day commercial. Influencer marketing. I want to go deep and execute four clients. That, you know? What I'm trying to go against, or what I pay much more attention to, is, do they think about retention and growth? Not how much do they make? You know, what are they worried about? Like, what is, you know, like, that's what I'm more fascinated by. Like, are they on the offense? Do they know how to handle it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. On the offense, do they know how to upsell? Do they have the senior relations? Like, one of the biggest things that I'm pushing everybody for more is, like, farming, not how I'd say... No, Tom. You know, like... Which is what you were saying even five years ago, to be fair. Yeah. I think last year I was very passive and wanted to watch the natural behavior of, like, leadership. Plus, we had a whole re-structuring of our creative capabilities, really. I mean, you know, we have so many... We have six GCDs now. We're not at this point last year. Fightin' out, beatin' bros on Ike type, standing against my Nikes type. All these distractions, we just fallin' into the trap. Like... Going in to see a potential client. No cameras allowed. See a ref. So that was fun, the first meeting in. The bag, just really, like, just kind of introspective, was walking out of there. It's incredible to be sitting in a room with one of the biggest companies in the world. And just having the level of conversation we're having around content and distribution. And I'm just, like, I'm just, like, I'm just, like, I'm just, like, I'm just, like, I'm just, like, I'm just, like, I'm just, like, I'm just having the level of conversation we're having around content and distribution. I mean, when we started Vayner with AJ and I started Vayner in 2009, people didn't even know what Facebook was. You know, people didn't even believe in digital. And here we are, you know, eight short years later, and people really having detailed, knowledgeable conversations, just fun to see the world evolve. And I'm sure the pioneers of television know that blood in the water, right? That, okay, it's coming. It's coming. And so, you know, people are not being romantic about radio anymore. They're starting to understand that television's real. Television's in every home. And so, I'm excited. It was a good meeting. Snapchat, Pinterest, Instagram, right now. And so when you do something, you have to know your craft. Hey. Clouds. You have to know your craft. Facebook commercials and influencer marketing will continue to be the big push, like in the org. So two things. One, I just want that in your mind. Even look, even like, I like the idea of that being in your mind for you walking down the street randomly and saying to yourself, you know what, I'm going to ping Andy K from Gary's team. Or you may not even know that. Great. So I'm going to pick Andy. I just want to get the analytics on Gary's long form videos on Facebook or things like, you know what, let me hit up just Waldy or Dunk or like, it's just going to be the thing. And so the more your brain knows that, the better. We couldn't time that better. So I could have been. No. You'll be here. I think you're coming late. So, so fucking good. Oh my God. My name is DLC. I'm from Manchester, but I've just traveled all the way down here. What's an hour from the trains to get here? Just to see you speak to you, man. Well, I said last year, like this year I'm going to come and see Gary Vee. A friend of mine said, you know what? I might know something for you. He might be here. So I was like, fuck, I need to be there. I'm running so late for a meeting. Do you want to get a picture? Yeah, I can get a picture, but I really wanted to run something over with you as well. Say it as we're doing it. Okay. And then maybe we'll set up an actual call because I'm really, really late. Oh, that's all good. Yeah, we already talked. That's quality. Give me some context and then email me right now. Yeah, I'll do that right now. Right now. Yeah, I'll pull over to Tyler and I'll get us 15 minutes. Give me the framework. Yeah, it's a sports app. Such a pleasure. Respect, man. Thank you for the love. Respect. Big love. Yeah, I mean, I can jump in here. I mean, I think, you know, from my perspective, first of all, thanks for your time. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym. Thanks for your time. You know, I'm always paying attention to market behaviors and things that are going on in culture and how I interplay with them from a personal brand side and my agency side. You guys have really crushed it. It's super impressive. And truth is, I'm not really looking for anything at all and other than starting to meet people and build relationships. My favorite move is how do I bring value? I am. Yeah, I'd love to meet you and get a better sense of how you're thinking about things and hear your story and that story and your overall arching kind of world as well. I love reverse engineering, right? Like, the more I know, I'm real, real long-term. So like, three years from now, nine years from now. So I think it's a marathon. So I'd love to meet you. And I don't even like phone calls. Like, I just really love face-to-face. So I'm looking forward to that. He comes through New York once in a while and not that often. You know, to me, it's a good time of year. I would recommend getting to Chicago if you can because they're still planning their money. You wait until March or April when he's in New York. They may not even have it even if they wanted to do something. So that's my recommendation there. And then, Mike, work with Tyler and get us together in New York. I'm away the next two weeks filming my show in LA, but I'll be back after that. So I posted something about saying you're an entrepreneur is different than being an entrepreneur. Somebody left in the comments that they usually agree with me, but then once in a while I just blow up and blow it. And their point was that teachers teach. They don't degrade their audience. So interesting to me that a statement like that is interpreted as a negative. I actually think I'm helping. I'm trying to help the millions of kids that have been sold of the propaganda that entrepreneurship is for everybody and they're not deploying self-awareness to who they actually are. And so to me, just because you're getting critical feedback doesn't mean you're hurting somebody. I think we've gotten so soft in a lot of arenas that even debating something that may feel not warm and fuzzy is met with the thought that it's a negative. I can tell you right now that my parents taught me a ton of shit that wasn't delivered with honey. And so I think we need to debate what teaching is really about and more importantly that there are many delivery styles and ways to deliver a message and not all of us react the same way to every one of them. And so some people respond extremely well to one way and some respond to others. And I think the earmark of trying to provide value is trying to reach and communicate to many different people in many different ways. Okay. What up Instagram? I love you guys. What are you doing well? That's it. Eric, what up, it's Eric. Good to see you. Eric, Robert, how are you? It's a pleasure. Thank you. It's a pleasure, Robert. Hi, guys. How are you? Good to see you. How are you? We'll do the number one scene. Yo. Hey. You can see it again. I'll do it again. Good to see you. What's up, bro? Sorry, that's a terrible head, boss. That's all right. Gotta have some bad ones, have good ones. Hey. Hi, how are you? How are you? Good to see you. See you later. Good to see you. Such a pleasure. Hey. I'm Helen. I don't think we met last time. How are you? Really well. Did you get a bit more sleep last time? No, I'm really, I've not figured out my way. I've gotta figure it out. But I think I got a concept this time. Yeah, I think we probably will edit it. Yes. Marcus, how are you? Real pleasure. All right, thanks. Can we go inside? We're gonna go over there and go to the conference. Okay. I'll be doing more, but I wanted to say hi. Hi. I'm Jessica Jolio. Hi, Jessica. You gave me an endorsement on my book. Is that right? I wrote the Catarina Walter. Yeah, how are you? I know I haven't seen you in a long time, but just like, I'm going to go over there and... I'm gonna see you. Yeah, are you doing well? Yeah, really good. I'm hosting a startup event here tonight. Awesome. How's it going? Good. We're gonna kick off at 7. Awesome. Good luck. I'll let you go and I'll miss you running around. Good to see you. How are you? Thanks, Gary. Nice to meet you. Good luck. Thank you so much. How are you? I'm really good. This is a super honor and privilege for me. Thanks, man. It's very kind. Thank you, man. You've got to do it. Okay. We'll continue the conversation, my friend. Can you send this to me in digital form? Gary, a banner medium. There's some names on the back. Okay. I just wanted to give you some granularity. It's great. I'm a weird dude. I'll make way more decisions on this than I will on that. What I tend to do is I want to make sure that you're not vulnerable to what matters to me. There's a guy who's about to get blown out and just didn't hear me. Cool. Let me do this. Thank you so much again. Good to see you, man. Really appreciate it. Stay well. Take care. Hey, thanks for everything you're doing. Thank you, brother. I'm sorry. Thank you, man. Thank you, brother. Good for you, man. Let's do it. Can I have a small video or just a quick picture? Just a quick picture because I'm solely with her. I don't want to... Thanks a lot, man. Keep it up, man. Thank you for the love. Take care. Love you, pal. See you tomorrow? Yeah. Love you pal, see you tomorrow? Yeah, all right. All right London, going to head out, going to the hotel now. Gonna go work out. I gotta work out now, whatever it is, 10 o'clock, and then I gotta work out at 6 a.m. Fucking Jordan. See ya, see you tomorrow. What's up guys, what time is it? I don't know, it's all right. Eleven or something. It's what it is, 10, 10. 10, 10, and Jordan's making me do 300 push-ups in the next 40 minutes. This is when my life's come to. Trips from New York to London, no sleep, and then because I needed to get a quick one hour nap in, now I have to work out at 10, 10, and tomorrow again at 6 a.m.? Yeah, exactly. What are we doing tomorrow? Legs. Yeah. What?
