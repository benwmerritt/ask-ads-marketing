I need money actually. You really, yeah I'm sorry. I will literally wear these tomorrow. I know, but listen to you. Listen to you. Thank you so much. Tyler, make sure I wear these tomorrow. Hi, Mike. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hi. Go ahead. What is your advice for startups who are growing too fast and they can raise enough money? What, one more time, they're growing too fast? What they can raise enough money? To slow down their burn. Let's slow down the burn. Sure, I mean, you only got two options. Either you can pay your bills or your camp. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. You either can pay your bills or you can't. You either make enough money to pay your bills or you raise enough money. A lot of times startups grow, but because of the markets and the position it's in now, they can't raise the capital. So you gotta turn down your burn. If that's not the problem and you're just sad because you can't be as big as you need to be, you just need to deploy patience. Yeah, it's very basic, right? This world gets you thinking differently. But if you take a step back, there's only two or three things your situation requires. So do you mind sending him a video message? Jake, it's Gary Vee. We're here, but you're not here, Jake. And I don't know where you are, Jake, but we're very upset. I'm here. Yeah, you're asked here, Jake. Jake, I hope I run into you. See you, man. Aw, thank you. You're welcome. Oh my gosh, thank you so much. You coming to my talk? Everybody behind me. I'm sorry. You see, man. Long time no see. You well? Yeah, when are you and Ellie next? 27th. Let's hang out. How are you, Sarah? How are things? I'm so thrilled that you're here again. Thank you. Do you guys wanna walk over to the room? I'll take you back there. Yeah, let's do it. Perfect. I wanna go to the front of the room and thank people for coming. Yes. I'm not kidding, actually. You're lying at your wedding, though. What a room they have. It's a combo of rooms combined, I think. EFG. Last year, Gary needed a bigger room with an ET and but not the biggest room. You got me so. Hi, that was such a nice thing to say. How'd it go? It was, I don't know, how was it? I'm sure it was great. Yeah, I am. I just want water. Hello. How's it going? I'm Gary. How are you? Thank you. Hey, is this the vlog? This is the vlog. What do you got to say? I just wanted to say, my fiance, Adam, is one of the biggest Gary Vee supporters. He makes me learn so much stuff from him. I'm not joking. The first thing he said to me about South by was you need to go meet with him and you need to talk to him about social strategy and all that stuff. I was like, okay. And then he texted me your session and I was like, that's the same ballroom as me and that's right after my talk. So I just wanted to say thanks for all the tips for the advice and I'm so excited to see you're so looking back. All right, let's do this. We're gonna get our seat front row. Anybody have gum? Nice. You know you have a reputation for just like being everywhere talking to everyone at South by. Like a good one? I first started before last year, they were like, he's not gonna go to the green room. You're probably just gonna see this guy talking to all these people in his session room and that's him. And that's exactly what happened. That's what I like to hear. I was like, so you know with the Gary factor, what's happening? I have this one from last year. He's great. What are you talking about? I'm doing full Q and A. Q and A. Full Q and A. Can be all inspirational. You know, I tend to be inspirational. It should be like a Gary, like a daily V. You know what I'm doing? I'm doing an Alexa voice skill in the morning while you brush your teeth to get like. I love it. I think it's cool. Isn't that cool? The daily V. That's it. Daily inspiration. Daily. That's it. Awesome. Thank you. On this one. Like this? Right here. Okay. Okay, cool. Nice shirt. Hey guys. Hey, thanks for being here. What's up guys? What's up man? Dude, good playing this morning. Yes. How are you man? Good to see you. Gary. Yes. Dude, pals. What up man? You're so handsome. How are you? He rocked. I saw him at the airport last night. You guys are cool like that? Yeah. I'm just gonna thank people for coming in. I'll be up in a minute. You stay on the offensive positivity if you believe it. You managed the amount of time you spend looking and rubber necking at negativity. How do you do that? Do you have a- I don't give a fuck. Like I see all the negativity. I just know that life is like this. Like I expect like things to be difficult. Like I wanna remind everybody, no matter where you sit on politics and things of nature, just data, this is the greatest era to be alive. As sad as you are about certain things, I promise you it'd be worse right now if the black plague was doing its thing. And so I think we get crippled, right? You know, I think a lot of people here need to go and spend more time with 80 and 90 year olds and ask them what they lived through. Nothing's perfect. We're always gonna have it bad. It's always going to be something. We've always picked on each other for being different. It sucks. So if you're lucky and you don't have that in you, I think you do what I'm trying to do, which is be completely utterly on the offensive positivity because if you're positive and you're happy and you're optimistic, you owe it to each other right now to get louder because the only people that are loud are the people that are upset, right? Negativity's on fire and happy people are clamming up and staying away from it. That's how we stay happy. I went the other way. I'm going right at it, putting it out every single day. That's number one, but we're all wired differently. I'm able to eat shit at scale for the rest of my life. It's why I'm a leader. It's why I'm a company. It's why I put myself out there. If you get fatigued, you need to take yourself out there. It's okay to not be there every day. Read every comment. Like you don't bust through on day one. If you do not love the process of what you're up to, you've already lost. It's true. This shit's hard. Like what do you want? You want your first fucking podcast to be number one on fucking iTunes? Who the fuck are you? Do you know what I mean? I mean that's the part. You have to love it. I love when people shit on me. I love when I showed up to the tech world and like the wine guy thinks he's gonna win this thing. Yep. You know, I love going to Madison Avenue and being like this Twitter, Business Week said Twitter Boy tries to start an agency. I said fuck yes. I'm about to do this TV show, right? On Apple, Planet of the Apps. Recode writes, Planet of the Apps has four celebrity mentors. Gwyneth Paltrow, Will I Am, Jessica Alba and others. When I tell you that article made me so fucking happy, you gotta love the process, man. I think people will have to listen to it. You either have to be massively entertaining or really know what the fuck you're talking about. And when you have both, you know what I mean? But there's plenty not massively charismatic over the top assassins in what they do because they fucking know their craft and they say it their way. And by the way, maybe they are better off in, I'm obsessed with getting everybody understand. You have to find your medium. Maybe you're a great writer. Maybe you're great in podcasting. Maybe you're in video. Maybe you cartoon it up like Hugh McLeod who dominates this scene of the early days of South by. You've gotta find the way you communicate if you wanna communicate to the world. Don't do podcasting just cause it's trendy. Got it? Good luck, man. The loudest and best relationships never win. It's just what people that aren't winning think. It's the people that are the best that win. So, the market proves it for you. So let's go in detail. Like, tech crunch doesn't pick the winners, right? Like, the Wall Street Journal doesn't pick the winners. Three cool kids in the crowd don't pick the winners. The problem is everybody wants to be anointed a winner or best at what they do before they've actually done it. Let me just remind you and everybody else here. I built a business for 18 hours a day, every day, running a wine liquor store for 13 years every day before I ever had the audacity to come to something like this and talk. So, let me tell you something amazing. If you're good enough, you will win. But if you are upset that somebody else's grandpappy got them ahead of you, then you're gonna lose. Everybody started ahead of me. I'm just catching up. And then, so just how would you then balance being ambitious, being patient? By recognizing you have no choice. Do you understand? I'm the most fucking ambitious and most patient person you've ever met, which is why I'm gonna win real, real, real big. Find your version of that. You have no choice. Who's gonna cry for you? Like, what's the choice? Are you ambitious? Awesome. I don't think you're as patient. Yeah, that's the problem. No shit. And the problem right now is that we're all living public lives and all this whore shit. This is what entrepreneurship and success looks like. Going to fucking Bali and fucking watches and private jets. It's all whore shit. Whore shit. But it's fucking with people's minds and they're getting impatient. I don't give a fuck what anybody else has. I'm focused on my shit. Start focusing on your shit. You're a young woman. How old are you? I'm gonna punch you in the face. You have your whole life in front of you. You know what I mean? Put your head down and do whatever this thing that you want to prove that you're the best at. Hardcore, if you actually spent all your time doing instead of dwelling, you'd be much further along. Awesome. I think with that I gotta go. I love you guys. I don't know, listen, we're all wired differently. Literally, and I've lost plenty. I just don't, I can't figure out why I would spend any time on it. But you keep trying like with the same thing? Yes, there's been many people who've won slight variations of the same thing on the third time. So just because you believe in a thesis, the way you executed within it, maybe you believe in pies and pies are gonna be huge, but maybe you made a pumpkin pie and it was supposed to be a strawberry pie. Got it? So it could still be the same thing-ish. All right? You have to make a change. Sitting in your trapness is not gonna do anything. Right? So like, you have to basically get paid. You can go work at like seven, 11. Like you just have to reset. The fuck are you gonna do? You know what I mean? Like that's, what you're doing now is clearly not gonna work. I think what you're doing is better for most people than what I just did. But for me selfishly, I wanna answer this person's question that's right in front of my face. Just the health of my family. Business doesn't scare me. Business is what I do, you know? I just don't understand that people, like the social aspect of homeschooling is the thing I think is fascinating, like the pros and cons. The education's non-debatable. Like the kids are being forced. Literally, I would have been aggressively medicated if my teachers had their way, if I grew up in today's game. I suck shit at school. I'm not stupid by any means. I'm the worst all-time student. I don't think I'm stupid. So like, here's the thing, it's like- You're not interested, probably. I mean, I just could kill, I feel like I could be doing better things. That's what I know. My bet is that my mom would have thought it off because we're old school Eastern Europeans and it's weird for us to even take Thailand all. But I literally watch kids that are little me's being completely stripped of their magic. Binary conversation. Can I get some video? You sure can. Amy and Shridhar, this is gonna be a very interesting video. What got you successful isn't necessarily gonna get him successful. Everybody's got a different path. Call his bluff. If he's such a big shot and he's so awesome, give him a year to prove it to you. And if he doesn't, drag his ass to university. Vietnamese. I don't know why. I don't know what to do. I need some time. No one's scared of you from the lies you love me. Just runnin' with my heart. Take her down. She's got my heart. Take her down.
