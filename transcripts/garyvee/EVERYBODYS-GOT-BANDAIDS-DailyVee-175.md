## Transcript
Rolling up to JFK, feeling pretty good. Headed to Detroit. Quick keynote for Dan Gilbert and his whole family of businesses. Owner of the cabs, quick and a bunch of other businesses. Amazing American entrepreneur. Quickly back to the airport. Headed to London. Seven, eight hours of London meetings for Vayner London. I'm on a plane to Hamburg, Germany. Quick shower, right into the speaker's dinner that night. Get some sleep, give a keynote. Flip it right back to NYC. I think everything's something to the top. I think they feel at home because I feel like I'm a parent. And I think all my actions between the room they live in and the psychology I deploy and the listening and the talking, you know, I think people only feel at home when the parents make it feel at home. I think it's a job of every senior. Yes, businesses can start actually giving a fuck about people and how much money they make. Because a funny thing happens when you give a fuck about people. You end up making more money. I mean, I don't think it's unfortunate. Those companies should then make what is appropriate and all the people that work there, they're more than welcome to start their own company or work somewhere else. You know, this whole narrative of like these businesses are shit. Yes, do I want businesses to care about people more? Yes, it feels nice and it feels right and it's a legacy I want to leave and I think it'll actually make them more money. But the employees aren't being shit. You know, slavery, this is not slavery. Everybody has to be accountable. This isn't just the man is fucked up or the business is fucked up. The employees fucked up if they're in a shit situation. Instead of going home at five o'clock and drinking beer and complaining, go on fucking job listings, interviews, networks, find a different fucking job. The good cafeteria, the free, you know, granola. I just think that's horseshit. Those are tactics that bullshit companies do to try to make people, the people are inspired and feeling good because they feel safe and they feel like they can grow. They feel like safe and they feel like they can grow. That's the shit that matters. Not fucking free Cheerios on fucking Tuesday. And you guys have to hound me until you get this out of me, which is with you guys and the SVP of the business. I'm probably going to start bringing you guys to them, one of you, so that it's even faster. But I think a lot of times it'll be the first time like the guy wouldn't have brought you to. You know what I mean? Your job is to not let me off the hook after I have a senior client meeting. Or like inspiration. I like putting up signs and I do that shit, but I don't think people at Vayner are happy and killing it because I have a picture of me saying your funeral matters. That's up there because I like that. Not because that's there as a tactic. It's all religion. They have to feel safe and they have to feel like they can grow. And that's it. And like everything else, nobody's going to trick people by having 24 hour massages in a fucking room. You know what I mean? Band-aids. Everybody's got band-aids. Nobody gives a fuck about your hard-word floor or the soda fountain machine. They're nice, but I don't... And we have them, but I'm not the one who's ever making that happen. That's other people in my company that decide those things. I have no interest in band-aids. Shit works because I give a fuck. This is the man right here. Stouty. How you see him? They're the best thing that... They're the best thing since the actual phone. Best thing since the actual phone. Best. Alright Nate, I gotta go. I got a friend here. See ya. Love you. Bye. So you just filmed him the whole time? Yeah. Steve, honestly, on a very serious note. This is what you should do. Truman Show. Truman Show. You should do this. You know what's great about this? You don't fucking do anything. You don't fucking do anything. Yeah. And that's weird. And it takes a few minutes to get that. But it's getting way less weird. How many meetings have we been in where now that's two people doing it? It's a foregone conclusion. Brand meetings? Yeah. Very rare. By the way, some clients want me to. That's crazy. I mean very rarely. And we never put anything that's... There's never been... I mean I have to... It's the only downside is I have to watch it because I might say something that... Of course. How can you control... I can't control it. I'm gonna say something that... You're the editor. A secret. No, no. It's what I do. I watch it. And it's... You know, after a while the team kinda knows but you still gotta like... You know you're saying something that's subtle. You rock. Can you email Alex DeSimon, Zach Nadler and Tyler and tell them I'm really into fireside chats because it makes me do new stuff? We just have like two silly questions for you. You need your arch-nemesis and your proudest mission? Tom Brady. Okay. And Michael Jordan. I'm putting two. Okay. Proudest mission. Um... Proudest mission is... Becoming the foundation of my family. Cool. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, Rock. You had this filming. I'm so proud of you. You're so funny. I literally went Instagram Live because you walked away and I wanted you to feel bad. And meanwhile, I didn't... Guys, don't touch anything. DRock did it. He left his camera right here the whole time. And he knows me. He knows me so well. This is how fucked up I am. DRock goes to take a piss. I don't know what the hell you just did. Piss. Great. And I'm like, you know what? He's going to come back and be really sad that he missed out on like 10 minutes of footage. Unbelievable. Anyway, thank you. Thank you all for the love. Sergei, good to see you. Angel, good to see you. I developed my level of patience. VCNTX5. Brother, there's just no other way other than just doing it, right? Like, you know, you just... DRock, you feel like you've gained patience with me. Let's interview DRock. I don't have a good idea about you. Let's get the switch. When you're patient and you don't need anything from anyone, you treat everybody... The same. ...in the afternoon. That makes sense, right? Because whether you're the owner of the cabs, who I'm about to go on stage with, or you're a cabs fan in the last row, I'm actually in zero need of either of them. And you just became very, very full-fledged. You like that? You have different behavior, but you have different... Well, there's different topics. Topics. Right. I love that. I think... I'm fucking done anything yet. I haven't done anything yet. Yeah, I mean, it's super around you. They know that. They know that, right? Every day we're like, wait till they see six months from now. Wait till they see six months from now. Wait till they... Yo. Yeah, this is legit. GaryVeeShop.com. And then I've got the book in January. And the VaynerMedia thing. I don't know how many of you were part of the live stream last night, but this was awesome. I came up with a new business, and I've been thinking about it, but Zappos and Disney sell tours. So we're going to do that at VaynerMedia. It's going to be programmed. Jeff paid media, video production. I'm also... Did you see... You didn't see the email. I'm also going to film it. The whole thing. And all 10 people are going to do an interview of six questions I come up with. And we're going to give them a piece of content to leave with, kind of on the manifesto of how do you start. Fucking awesome, right? That's worth the... I'm trying to figure out how people are like, holy fuck, for $10,000. Yeah. Like if you could make something worth $50... That, the keynote, and then... That's it. And the keynotes are going to be like, Ashton Kutcher, Tony Robbins, fucking, like, you know, Farris, Kevin Rowe. It's going to... People are going to shit. This is the whole day. 11 hours immersive. And then you're going to make connections too. So think about the like-minded people. Then you're there and be like, hey, you want to go out to dinner? We're going to send... Me and Nate came up with some shit. We're going to send people to certain dinner spots where they're going to get hooked up, hunting fish club, places Rigo. So like, randomly, I'll be there too. And we got some ideas, like, swag packs and like... Basically, how do we make it worth $100 for $10? Anyway, if you're interested to be part of the first groups, it'll be remarkable, be the best day you ever spend and can change your game forever. Very focused. Detail shit. Not the motivation stuff. That's for free. Details. This is how we execute paid campaigns. This is how you should be thinking about video. This is how you should be thinking about... Vayner talent. Like, fucking real. And then I'll come in and answer questions for this group, obviously. Small business team, video production, account strategy, global strategy, how you do the ads, how you make the videos. Designers are how we brainstorm ideas. It's a great fucking huge... All right. It's just about starting. So many of you are stuck. I can't start. And so I've actually, for the first time in my career, like literally, like not for the first time, like you've never seen me do this, D-Rock, right? Like literally send you guys a text of what I wanted to make. It's just not how I usually do stuff, but it's like so important to me. And I broke it down into the what, how and where, right? Like what? Every one of you that has not started your business or started your personal brand or building your influence, you need to make something. And that thing is a manifesto. There's this classic video I made back in the day while I was on a London flight. That was just kind of like my thoughts that day. It wasn't kind of like episode 101 of a recap or anything like that. It was just my thoughts of where I was at at that moment. I was kind of talking shit, actually. It's gonna be fun to look back at that, D-Rock, right? I was kind of like, you guys don't know, right? It's gonna be cool, actually. Anyway, nonetheless, they just don't know me. They don't understand what I'm going to do. They don't understand that it's early. People just don't understand how early it is. I'm 36. I'm a kid. Every one of you needs to sit down and make a piece of content whether, and this is now the how, whether this is video form, whether this is audio form, whether this is written form, right? Audio being a podcast, right? Heck, you don't even do a podcast. Put the recorder on your phone and just speak your truth. Get in front of a camera, selfie style, or set it up on a tripod or have a D-Rock, your nephew, your sister, your aunt, your daughter, I don't care. Or you write it, but the way all of you need to do this and how you actually start is by doing. So first you start. What are you gonna talk about? I've broken that down for you. I fixed it for you. Here it is. Tell the world what's up. Either how you're feeling right now and or what you're about to do. That's it. I'm done giving you guys the top line strategy. I'm gonna go detail it for you today. This is it. This is how you start. I'm gonna help you right now. Either tell people how you're feeling exactly right now and what you're thinking about yourself, about the world, about the state of the union of coffee, or tell me what you're gonna do, right? Tell me. And you know I say fuck you're gonna, but you need to put it out there. You're stuck. You haven't started because you're stuck. So here you go. What? What are you gonna talk about? What do you wanna be known for? You wanna be in health and fitness? You wanna be in strategy? You wanna be in social media? You wanna be in sneakers? You wanna be in coffee? You wanna be in electronics? You wanna be in fashion? In fashion? I don't care. What do you care about? Meritocracy. First you said you love dictatorship. Yes. Now you love meritocracy. Correct. Both. How can it be both? Easy. When you're pulling from both sides, you win. The contradictions are where all the magic is. You wanna be successful and go fast? Don't give a fuck about what anybody thinks about you. You wanna go fast and win? Care about what every single person says about you. Yeah. Empathy matters as much as ego. It's the balance of the opposite things that allows the winners to really win. I'm not sure I know who I am right now. So who's up? We have Reggie. Let's go. Everybody wanna make millions but not everybody been working Everybody know they got brilliance but not everybody been searching Everybody rap about money and hoes but they got neither Everybody knows In any way you wanna be the legacy of a positive actor. I dictate the 10% that matters to me the most. I'm a dictator. I'm the 10% that matters to me the most. And then open for everybody on the 90% and then reward the people that are winning. Question about short form and long form content. I've heard a lot that YouTube and Facebook are really into long form content. Did it just change overnight? No, remember how I said headline readers versus practitioners? The headline sounds right. Do it fast. Make it short. Sure. Or if a three hour movie is awesome people will sit and watch it. It's just completely based on the content. I'm so happy to hear this because I do long form and I want to have you on my site it's called a drink with. We just had a drink with Dan. I love it. And it is a little bit longer and I've been like it's just been a little bit longer. Good. People will watch. You talked about fear. Yes. Ladder up. Yes. So how do you push through that with no ladder? By talking to them. Okay. Communication is the only thing that solves anything ever. Enjoyed that? It was so funny. The best part was that Dan like I know you like you get up and do your thing. Yeah. And I'm like I see the two chairs and Dan's like try to interview. That's going to go great. It was unbelievable. That was a lot of fun. It was fun. What gets people hired? Tired. Doing. You don't know when you get that job or what you're doing. Actually making content. Like actually doing. Okay. Like when you walk in like this is how I built my Instagram or this is how I thought about pre-roll on Facebook or this is how I made a long form. Like if you actually can like I design these filters on Snapchat. Okay. Doing. That kind of stuff. Yes. Okay. I don't have a company here. I'm just got by Dan. But I'm like this is great. Doing. Experience. Doing is always the answer. Alright. Awesome. Yeah, nice to meet you. Good man. Good to see you. All right, Lin. Hey, just had a question. Yep. I was just gonna say nice to meet you. I just wanted to try to get a repair truck. Yeah, let's do it. He's kind of waiting. I'm gonna miss my fucking flight. Everything I wanted, I got it. Always wanted more, so I'll never be stopping. Everyone asking when a new drop in. Pressure been building, but it's a good problem. Graduated college and never got options. I was bringing more, all these rappers take caution. Always been bossing, everybody watching. Love every friend just know you're not forgotten. I feel like in 20 years when I have that thing, and the me coming up does it? That everybody will respond well to it because it's that pure form of it. I keep on going till the lights go down. Yeah, till the lights go down, down, down. Till the lights go down. I'm trying to figure out how big of an impact I can have at this kind of budget level, which will then give me leverage to buy businesses. You know, I mean, I'm at a place right now with my career where I'm getting the kind of emails I get are so strange. Entrepreneurs are funny now. They're like, I'll give you 40% of my business to be my partner and we're doing seven figures. Like, I'm like, this is getting weird. Like. I've seen it coming, it was all or nothing. I knew the future gonna give me something. I'm putting the time, putting the work on my rhyme. Knew all along I'm a shot, I'm on down. Gonna take care of it, stay well. Is that what he said? That's bad, we missed the twice. I'm doing what everyone don't know. When I'm on it won't change me. People thinking I'm crazy. It's about as late as we've pushed it. Fuck. We missed this flight, I'm not going to London. That's my girl. I've been feeling all right. I've been taking what's mine. I've been running out of time. I'ma keep on going up till the lights go down. Down, down, down. Down, down, down. Thank you. You're welcome. You guys can just stand right over here. She'll take care of you, okay? Okay. What are you guys up to? What are we up to? Your life. Your life? Trying to buy the New York Jets. That's me.
