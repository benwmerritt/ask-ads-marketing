## Transcript
On this episode, I tell a lovely lady from Atlanta to listen to 21 Savage. Hey everybody, this is Gary Vaynerchuk and this is episode 237 of the Ask Gary Vee Show. Big, big, big, big, big day. As a matter of fact, Tyler, I know we don't really edit this show, but put it up right now. I'll talk over it for a couple seconds. Just the Wall Street Journal article. Very big acquisition by now, the holding company VaynerX that owns VaynerMedia over here and now PureWow or the gallery over there. PureWow being one of the three or four most important women modern media companies. Whereas VaynerMedia is an agency and buys media and does creative, PureWow is a publisher. It is literally like a modern day people magazine. So I'm very excited about that. We are going to do some serious damage and I hope you reach out to PureWow, sign up for the newsletter if that kind of content interests you, pass it on to your significant others that may have interest in that content and I'm excited about it. It's the biggest acquisition of my career. Oh, we get ready to show? All right. Fine. Hello. Hello, this is Gary Vaynerchuk and you are on the show. Hey, Gary, how are you? I'm well. Who is this? This is Candace. Candace, how's it going? It's going excellent, sir. How is it going for you? Super well. Where are you from? Atlanta, Georgia. Very nice. I love Atlanta. Are you a big 21 Savage fan? 21, I don't know what that is. We just moved here the last year. So tell me what that is. I will go check it out. 21 Savage is a rapper from Atlanta. I think you'll like him. Check out his music. Oh, cool. I will just get out of. Okay, cool. What's your question? So I'm in between. I have a bunch of opportunities and I don't know which one and I know your philosophy of work, work, work and I'm trying to figure out how to fit it all in. But I'm a cabinet designer and I have the opportunity to basically go work for a very high ed firm and continue to do and try to continue to do my own stuff and become a rap. Like all of these opportunities are coming all at once and I'm trying to figure out the best way to balance them all without basically suffocating myself. Yeah, that's exactly burning out. So let's work backwards and this is what everybody needs to do. It's so easy to make decisions when you have clarity on what you want to happen. And what you want to happen is always short term and long term. So talk to me about what would you like to happen in the macro from a financial work life balance and the kind of things that you want. I mean, it's just choices. Right? Like life is very simple. Like because I chose that I want to own the New York Jets, my work life balance is not as good as it would be if I was okay with where I am now, right? I don't know if you saw the news of the PureWow deal. I wouldn't be buying this big media company because I'm rich enough already if I wanted to just be rich, right? No, I want to buy a football team. Thus I have to be on the offense at 41 years old. Like I have nothing and I'm 20. Got it? So the biggest thing I totally understand. So help me understand the financial situation of all of this. Like do you want to make lots of money? Like your financial situation, do you have to make the money? Like where are you in your life with family? Like how much vacation time do you want to do and where do you want to end up? Like what's like work backwards? Give me some data. So right now we're basically an empty nest for both of our children are in college. That's huge. It gives you a lot of flexibility. Very huge. Yep. Yes. So and ideally like my big picture scheme is I would like to get into house flipping and doing air bee and bees and stuff like that because again being a cabinet designer I look at all these people who flip houses around here and go I know I could do that so much better. I love that. I think it's going to be a great market until the real estate market. You just got to not get caught of when you've got momentum going in two or three years of having too much inventory that you're sitting on and then the market gets soft. So as long as there's not a collapse of the housing or Wall Street market you're going to cruise and as long as you're conservative and don't get too big for your bridges as you're buying and flipping don't overextend yourself even in a crash as long as you're playing with house money you'll be fine. Right. And that's part of my problem and looking at the big picture is right now we're a little bit in debt if I again bust my tail for the next year I could get a completely out of debt and then in five years I could say you're in a half to ten months or something. Let's start right there. Immediately do that. I can tell by your energy and your vibe work your face off for the next year and get yourself out of debt. Take all the jobs do all the things. Punt everything leisure right now. Do that. That's just a good idea. Right. I mean it. And then. I mean it. Oh I've worried it. One year is nothing. DRock and I were just sitting in a hotel in Vegas saying like hey this daily V thing is going to be big. It was five seconds ago. That was one year ago. Like one year goes real fast. Debt compounds. There's no reason to have it if you're that close and your energy feels so good that you want to do the work anyway. It's like eat that crow for one year period no doubt a hundred percent and like be smart like speed up the process to nine months by not buying you know eight dollar lettuce instead of six dollar lettuce and like flip some shit in your garage like all that stuff like just make that your core number one thing. Definitely do that. That's number one. Yeah. No I was waiting for you to drop the eBay thing. Yeah. Telling my husband I'm like he's really good. He likes old school cars and stuff like that and he knows that stuff and music like the back of the band and I'm like okay you need to like figure that out like yes. Find things and store some stuff like that. Okay. Do that. Yeah. So that's my big picture thing is trying to figure out how to get there and also because once we get out of debt I'm trying to figure out how to balance that like do I go take out loans. No let me tell you what I would do. Let me tell you what I'd do. The housing market's been good for long enough. Here's my advice as if you were my sister. Crush your debt. Go crazy. Your husband if he's deeply knowledgeable about automobiles will be blown away and you live in Atlanta which means year-wide garage sales and things of that nature because of the warm weather. He's by accident going to make 20, 30, 40 thousand dollars. It's going to happen. I'm telling you right now that's based on if he works like I do which is all in right. If he works less then he'll make 5,000 instead of 30,000. Clear your debt year one, year two, 2018. Work your face off and save money. Right. Save and then whatever you save let's say you've got 48,000 dollars great. That means that's your down payment and then get a mortgage on the rest for your first flip. Got it? Right. 24 months of eating shit to be able to eat caviar for the rest of your life. Yeah because that's my big picture is I want to be able to when quote unquote retire and I say that very loosely because I don't want to work for a paycheck anymore. I just want to work because I enjoy working. The best way to do that is to go extreme. Please try to drag that out over eight years and take a vacation here. Make 5,000 on eBay instead of 20,000. Work one of the jobs not two of the jobs. The best way to do it is you never promise tomorrow. Even though I talk about patience I'm aware that you're not promised tomorrow. When you can do something do it. So crush the next 24 months. Clean debt. Get 10, 15, 20, 50, 80 thousand dollars in savings whatever it ends up being. That is your deposit. Get the mortgage for whatever else you can and do the flip. If that doesn't get you the house that you want for your first flip then eat another pile of shit in 2019 and now you've got 90,000 dollars for the deposit and then you put that down. Got it? Oh yeah. I'm working it up there. It's clouds and dirt. It's going all in for the next 24 months and not being glamorous so that you can be glamorous for the rest of the way. The problem is everybody hedges and they're half pregnant the whole 50 years. No and that's what I don't want to be in. I'm like you. I'm about the same age and I'm like okay no it's full speed ahead now because I don't want to wake up in 20 years or 10 years and go we're still here. Really? You've got to be kidding me. All three jobs. Stop. Don't watch a single thing. Don't go anywhere. Work for the next 24 months. You will win. Gotcha. All right. Love you. See ya. All right. Thank you sir. Bye. Bye. That was really good. I'm going to be like seriously this calling show is going to be like that. Guys I'm telling you I see some of your comments. I'm reading you guys all the time. I understand some of the clunkiness. Chris's got his call game down better. You know I understand but I'm telling you and we probably need to do the audio. If you're probably really smart so I don't have to hold the temp. Like though I do think that's a little funny and I think that just might be a whole thing. Yeah I'm ready. This calling show is going to be a beast. Are they happy? Are they happy? Yeah. Yeah. Jesse. I'm Jesse and you're on the ask Gary Vee show. Holy shit. What up Jess? Oh my God what is going on man? Where are you from? I'm from Southern California. I'm out here in Mojave. Love it. What can I help you with? Mojave Desert. Love it. What can I help you with? All right. So here's the thing. So I've been trying everything out. I've been doing. I just failed. I did marketing. I did some startup business. Some small stuff. I've been sitting in the same job for the last six years growing. Speaking out mentors. Been doing my thing. I've been trying out the eBay thing and I just got hit yesterday with my first couple sales so I'm super stoked on that and thankful for that man. Shit dude I'm fucking stoked right now. You know what man? Before I ask the question I just want to say thank you for everything that you do man. I freaking, I throw your name out there anytime somebody stops five seconds to listen to me say it. Everything that you offer is freaking huge man. My brothers, friends, coworkers. I'm like Gary Vaynerchuk they're like Gary who? I'm like look him up right now. Follow everything he does. Thank you man. So anyways I'm doing all this stuff. I'm everywhere right now and I'm trying to figure out what is the next step. I mean I'm trying freaking anything and I'm not in it. You know I want to make money. I want to be successful. There's no doubt about that. But you want to be happy. I'm not chasing them. Exactly. You don't want to buy things. You're chasing the money. You want to buy the jets right? And by the way, by the way, let me actually this man this is calling shows going to be great. If I, like if I wanted, like if I didn't love what I do all 19 hours a day then I wouldn't be talking shit about buying the jets. I got lucky that the thing that I love most is building big businesses. Right. Like if I loved you know being an architect more than anything in life and that's what I gravitated to Legos and drawing when I was 6, 7, 9, 12, 13 instead of selling lemonade and selling flowers and selling baseball cards then I would just be talking about becoming the greatest architect of all time and that wouldn't have made me trillions and that would have made me successful and rich and I get it. But like or very honestly like if I was wired like by the way and this is why you like me so much I if I didn't have the DNA of a salesman and an entrepreneur I would be a guidance counselor. Right. Like I love I live for deep bro. Do you know how much money I leave on the table by giving you this by doing what I'm doing right now? I'm leaving a lot of and and and by the way it's not because I'm such a great guy. It's because hearing you say that in the beginning of this call is a greater high for me than any deal I've ever closed in business and that's not even close by the way. Having another human being tell you that you're having a positive impact on their life. I promise you this. You're not coming to my funeral because I made $1.7 trillion in my career. You're coming my funeral because I might have made you $1,700 more and tweaked you in a place where you had 49 more years of happiness. Right. Dude honestly this is very simple to answer your questions why I went on a little bit of rant. What do you like when you're not working? Build a business around that. Right. Like what do you like? Like I gotta tell you right now this whole VaynerSport thing I'm getting scared I might shut it all down. I'm in love with it. Having these football players sit at VaynerMedia John Toth yesterday offensive linemen center for Kentucky. He's gonna be on the Packers in six months. It's the weirdest thing. Alvin Kamara is gonna rush for 137 yards on a Sunday and I'm like wait a minute that's my dude like it's crazy and I love it and watching AJ's happiness. He's not gonna make anywhere close to as much money as he did at VaynerMedia but watching the happiness in his heart. Like what do you like surfing? What do you like? Like t-shirts? What do you like? Hip hop? What do you like? I'm being that I like to be honest. For a while it was like an extreme sport thing but now what it is is building people. That's what I like. I like seeing other people. So the one and I think you know this I'm very scared of the life coach business because I think people are ripping people off so as long as you feel good about it like here's an idea what about starting a club? Like what about like dude there's so much shit you can do. Let me throw you rogue ass shit. Why don't you get a job at night at a restaurant where you tell the owner that you want to work as a bartender because you want to start a club in his restaurant or her restaurant every Wednesday night for aspiring entrepreneurs or for people that want to live better lives. So the exchange is I whom way over qualified for this job I'm gonna work here three nights a week and I'm gonna meet people that come here and I'm gonna start a club in your restaurant and then what you're gonna do is once you test out what a club and a group together at a restaurant looks like you may go then get investors or buy your own or save money or sell everything on eBay and get your own like do shit is the answer. Do you understand? Right. Totally and on that the craziest shit about that which Jeff said is that today at 1130 I actually orchestrated three weeks ago starting a club at my business the company that I work at in the first day of the club start today we're going into leadership and I'm gonna do my best help and learn from other people at the company who want to be bigger who want to be better who want to do more not just to work. Can I ask you a question? Absolutely. Off of that what just happened when do you think the world's gonna realize that I'm actually a genie from a different planet? That freaks me out when stuff like so cool. Anyway listen listen my man keep focusing on this I like the vibe of your voice that's one of the reasons I kind of I'm very big on tone and energy that's why the calling show is gonna be better because when I read it I don't have the tone I can tell the goodness coming out of your mouth I can feel it let me tell you this it sounds like you're fairly young how old are you 29? 26. Good. Patience brother keep doing good keep bringing people value and don't think about what's in it for you what's in it for you will happen when you are purely pushing to bring people value shit just happens. Hell yeah. And you've got time brother you've got five years do me a favor don't try to charge a thousand bucks ahead or 500 bucks a month do this just keep bringing value and I'm telling you for five years online offline random just keep bringing value it will work itself out you got a lot of time to cash in on doing that good move. That's all I'm gonna do. Alright brother take care. You too. Bye. I feel like a muffled brother and called on my mother for a second. Anyway I'm really enjoying this format. You wanna say hi? Yeah let me say hi well he's doing that. Oh whoops Instagram Instagram Instagram what's up. Guys watching the show right now on YouTube and Facebook if you're not following me on Instagram there's a lot going on down there. Over the last 30 days it's gotten ridiculous it's gotten super ridiculous. Max McCoy good to see you. Good. Who's this? Jason. Jason. It's great right? Yeah. Hello.

Oh Jersey baby I love East Brunswick you said? East Windsor. Oh Windsor yeah I know it I know it I know it how you doing? I'm good man oh my god I'm just watching you I'm like I got a call what the hell. What can I answer for you? Okay man so I'm a website designer I've been freelancing for about 15 years now. Love it. All in all been good. I want to do niche based website design for different avenues and I'm trying to build my portfolio but it's like the competition is so big so I'm trying to figure out how to monetize that and I want to teach younger people as well to do it and code and things like that and provide jobs because I'm good at what I do as far as like designing but how do I so let's start first things first before you start teaching other people how to do it we need you to be ridiculously successful so that you can afford to teach people to do it otherwise you're going to charge them too much to teach them to do it and then they'll break got it? Yes. So look at this you want to build websites in a specific niche or just in general you know that everybody in the world needs a website and that the long tail of niche stuff it's a lot easier to get Joe the plumber to build his website than Pepsi is that what you're saying? Yes. Good. So how much do you want to charge to build somebody's website that's a small business or an entrepreneur or an influencer? What's your what's a nice range? Nice range is about $300-400 but I like the subscription base like you know 25 hours a month so I'm like you know I like like in Atlanta I've lived in Atlanta for a while and a lot of barber shops. And so are you are you are you so you want to do the whole I'll charge you 500 bucks to build your website and then 25 bucks a month maintenance recurring so you have recurring revenue in case they need you and that's how you scan right? Okay so are you building on top of WordPress and Squarespace and things of that nature and Shopify that's why you're able to great my man I'm going to give you a piece of advice that is 100% and the only reason you won't be successful is because you're not hungry enough and you're too lazy you ready? Yes. Good I want you to go to Instagram are you watching me on Instagram? Yes. Good I want you to stop watching me on Instagram I want you to start this process and I want you to do it before five to seven hours a day you ready? Yes. I want you to search a hashtag I want you to go to the search up top I want you to search grocery store local butcher plumber when you search it will be a hashtag and then I want you to spend 25 minutes hitting every picture that has the hashtag plumber and see if it's the account of a plumbing company or a plumber who has a small business I want you then click the URL that is linked to that person's account and look at their website if they have a good website leave him alone if their website is shit I want you to go back into Instagram and hit the top right corner triple buttons on that person's profile and send them a message and say yo this is me I'm the best at small business website design your website is not on point I've got a thing that's 500 bucks upfront 25 bucks a month and you will crush it and you will return on that investment in one day let alone one year because your website will be stronger that you're linked to on Instagram and you'll convert better and I want you to do that for five to seven hours every single day which means that you'll message between 70 and 250 people a day and you will do a lot of business.
