## Transcript
The first second of your video on social media is a staggering variable of its chance of being successful. First second, because as you know. So what then has to happen? Because in a second, nothing can really be accomplished. It seems like not, but tonight, when you just happen to look through your phone, pay attention for a second and be like, yeah, like a second or two, I got this, like I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, oh, pretty person, I stop. Oh, loud noise, oh, visual, the thumbnail, like you'd be surprised, it's real strategy, but then the next three to four seconds really matter because really like that first second gives you a hundredth of a hope and then the next three, four seconds really can either hook them or not. Attention is the number one asset. I'm here with one of the smartest guys in the room, whatever room he's in. Gary Vaynerchuk is kind of a legend at this point. He is the CEO of VaynerMedia, he's the chairman of VaynerX. He's probably, I would say the leading mind on what the fuck is gonna happen next. I think I just kind of summed it up. He's got something like 45 million followers across his platforms, 300 million impressions every month. He's got a new book out, it'll be a best seller, just about every one of his seven books has been a best seller, this is the seventh. Day trading attention, how to actually build brand and sales in a new social media world. As an old media world guy, I'm excited to talk to him. Gary, how are you doing, my friend? I'm well brother, you look great brother. Thank you, I'm trying, 67, it's no joke. You really look great. Thank you, thank you. Meanwhile, let's talk to you. What are you giving people stress instead of taking it? I don't, you know what it is? I'm not in the agency business anymore, that's why. Exactly. I don't have to sit those three and a half hour client meetings when I know how they're gonna end in 90 seconds and I wanna blow my fucking brains out. I literally was just at a meeting two hours ago and said to a client, the reason I usually lead meetings is if I already know the outcome, what am I doing here? And you always do, and by the way, meetings that's like, they're like particles and atoms. I love when they schedule meetings two hours. If you scheduled it for 15 minutes, not only would you save an hour or 45 minutes, you'd probably get better, faster, more linear thinking. Oh my man, we are really alive. I've always loved you before this, that one hit. I really believe actually just to give people value here, I genuinely actually believe this without hyperbole. I believe almost every corporate meeting is double the size of what it's needed. And time and people, time and people. By the way, it's why I have a lot of, I do a ton of 15s and in many environments, including my own career for a long time, those were 30s. And look, when you're trying to accomplish things to get things done, that adds up in a very nice way. Let's talk about the most important thing first. What do we think about the Jets pick last night? I was pumped. You know, last night was a tricky night. The Knicks lost to the Sixers, a little bit beyond that. But you know, I have a sports agency, VaynerSports, and we recruited him for two and a half years. So we know the kid inside out. I think he's really good. I'm super pumped with him. That's great. That's great. One other just quick political thing, because we're not gonna talk politics, but you were born in Belarus, emigrated over here in three years, and just thoughts on what's going on in the Ukraine, or just from a guy who's just kind of comes from that region, you know? Bro, you know what's so crazy? Like I was a really poor student, which was rare, by the way, for immigrants coming to the U.S. during the 80s, and that era. But I was always very good at history. I got really good grades in it. By far my best grades, besides gym class. I was a gym class hero. And... I love it. By the way, they didn't even give grades in fucking gym, it was like pass or fail. Hold on, get it, get me this please, if you don't mind. Can you grab it? It's the top one. I'm gonna show you. I know this is probably audio. No, it's video also, it's video also. Nope, nope, nope. Not the other one. The other one, closer to the, nope. There you go, that one, top one. Bring it in. Yeah, I need this. This is very important. I'm sorry everyone who's listening. I just grabbed my report card from high school. Oh, that's Jesus. Donnie, it's a really small print, but I'm gonna show you. Okay. There's only four A's on the report card in four years of high school, and they were all gypsy. That's amazing. What good for you, my friend. That's something to be proud of. I love that you still have the report card. You should be proud of it. So anyway, to answer your question, look, the world has always been complicated. Unfortunately, one of the, man, when I tell you I love humans, I love man, I love, well, man, I love humans, I really do. You've gotten to know me through the years. I really like people from natural. You can, I can. But unfortunately, it's been proven over time that humans do have an incredible tribalism and are deeply ingrained in trying to find ways to not like each other. Gender, race, religion. I mean, even now what's going on, generational warfare. Like you and I didn't grow up in an era where boomers hated Gen Z. Like to make Gen Z and boomers go at each other, the world has a very good way of getting us to go against each other. And I like it when it's silly, like the Knicks and Sixers, and I hate all my Philly friends for a couple weeks. Yeah, that's good stuff. That silly stuff, that's, you know, that's fun banter. But unfortunately, people take that to real life stuff. And so what's going on? I mean, you have incredible wants and needs of a small group of individuals to recreate empires, to find reasons to hate, all grounded in deep insecurity. And it's really too bad. And you know, to segue into what I know we're about to talk about, it happened twice again today. And it happened 12 times this week. You go into these big meetings, you and I were fortunate when we were running, you know, when you ran your agency, we're on that now. Most of the meetings you're gonna have are with CEOs and CMOs and like, it's the big wigs, right? You're in a lot of meetings, but you're in a lot of meetings with the big wigs. And when I tell you, and a lot of them become your friends just like a career, and you know, the first five, 10 minutes as you get back to wasting time and meetings, people settle in. And right away they're going into the politics of everything, of course, that's the era we're in. It's more like the sixties, but it's funny. I have these CEOs and CMOs of the biggest, Fortune 500 companies in the world, spend the first five minutes as they put milk in their coffee, talking about how God, TikTok should be banned or social media, or like, all this stuff of like the power of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, this, or Elon Musk, this, the power of changing people's perception on things, which is what marketing in Combs is. So the first five minutes, Donnie, they tell me that these platforms are too powerful, must be regulated or shut down, and I see you know where I'm going. And then we go into the meeting and they're like, ah, Gary, I don't know if we should be investing that much into social media. I feel like I do more. I'm like, you just told me that social media is putting the democracy of America, one of those powerful things in the world on its knees. You don't think this sells lipstick? That's amazing. They still, And I will say this only because it's like an honor to say it on your show, given your career. I'm even not surprised, but it is very clear as we sit here today together, organic social media creative. Organic social media creative. To find organic, you're talking about what, when you post. People are posting their own stuff that they created. You know, Coca-Cola, and BMW, and Donnie Deutsch, and Gary Vaynerchuk, and the mix, the post, the organic creative. Yes, yes. Not with paid amplification like you and I grew up with, where you make a good 30 seconds, but then you pay media to have a lot. That will drive it. Organic creative. Content will drive it. Is now the most important skill set and variable in all of marketing. And when I tell you on a good day, Donnie, at a church in Dwight, at an Audi, at a pick-any-of-them, Toyota, on a good day, it's the 25th most important thing that these companies think about. Incredible. And that. I'm actually shocked, you know, I'm out of the business because to me, it's almost such obvious price of entry at this point. Like I always used to think, I think back to presentations I used to give, and you'd start with, you know, the strategy and everything. Then you'd show the big TV campaign, then you'd go into newspaper, and at the very end, it's like, okay, here's the source. And I would assume it's completely the opposite at this point. Like if I was running an agency, I would always start with the granular, with the, I mean, because that's just the fucking world. Yeah, but you were all so good at what you did. Meaning, you know, you and I, even though we ended up having different chapters in our careers on the Madison Avenue game, I believe that this is why I think we've always kind of intuitively, and then we got to know each other more. We just care about where the attention is. Like when I think back to the big idea, right? That's actually where we first met. That's where you, was that your first TV appearance? Big idea? Yes. I love, very proud of that. I'm proud of that. That's the feather of my cap. I was very honored to be on. That, that, when we, you know, that, I remember watching from afar, and I'm like, this guy gets it. Like he was smart enough to be on this plat. That's the, that's where all the business attention was. And you weren't in an ad, you were the actual content. It's funny. One of the things that you would get a kick out of, people say to me, you know, at these stages, at Cannes Lions, at all this stuff, or industry stuff. Gary, I get it. I get it, but man, people still watch sports, bro, on TV. You watch sports, Gary. I'm like, you're right, I do. I'm like, but I don't watch the commercials. I think the Super Bowl is the most underpriced ad in marketing right now, today. Because it's the only fucking place where people lean into the advertising. And beyond the obvious exponential that you get in everything, it's literally, it's the day America not only doesn't turn away from advertising, leans into advertising. It's the only time it happens. And by the way, it's bullshit as far as the award shows, and everything else, completely different. Completely different, yeah. That's right. The best ad in television is the Super Bowl, the worst ad is the Grammys, the Oscars, and the AFC and NFC Championship game. Yeah, because you're paying, you're paying, you know, not Super Bowl dollars, but second best of Super Bowl dollars, and it's being consumed like an ad on any other day, like you watch a CSI. That's right, that's right. And so, you know, it's, you know, these are the things, but what's interesting is, everybody is really missing what you and I think what came intuitive to us, which is, first, you have to know where the attention is, and are you able to even get it? Right, the reason organic social, just to get very nerdy on anybody who's into this, social changed three years ago. It used to be like email marketing when I was building. Get as many people to follow you as possible like I did, and then a percentage of them would see it. Yes. Now, Donnie, you actually, this might get you pumped. You might have to decide to get crazy and get eight billion people to know who you are and get, like you would be, you would crush the new social media. All right, talk to me about it. I'll tell you why. If you never even created a social media account for the last 15 years, even though I've been screaming about it, tomorrow you create an account and your first piece of content could literally reach millions of people if it hit with the audience. So how does that, ask you a question? It's because I am on social media, not to your extent, but I have a nice following. And some of my stuff just connects, you know, and all of a sudden I'll get, you know, 50,000 likes and other times it'll be, you know, 1.20th of that. And it's not, and I always go, okay, is this content that much, is I think people are always looking for a secret sauce formula. And you basically are saying, there isn't. It's all, the play is the thing. What I would say is, no, there is, I mean, by the way, that's the main reason I built this book. There's real strategy behind it, but like, look, I think nobody's been, I'm not sure how many humans on earth were more pop committed for the last 15 years to figure this thing out. And every day I miss on things that I would have thought I would have hit on. So it's humbling, which is amazing, which is a great way to play a game. It's like golf, right? I think of social media. It's great analogy, great analogy. Right, you're playing against yourself. Yeah, and it's a tough game and you think you have a beat, you hit an amazing shot down the fairway, and then you're in the fucking rough and you're all fucked up, right? You know, I do myself as like a top golfer in the world that didn't make the cut at the Masters because I had a bad weekend, right? Like, it is humbling. That being said, of course people stumble into luck of virality and things of that nature, but just to take a step back before I go into detail, for every marketer, which I know a lot of will listen to this, it's really cool that there's so much science and art behind being great about this, and most people mail it in as matching luggage to their campaign. And so my framework that we believe in is PAC, platforms and culture. So if you don't understand, there's seven or so major social media platforms, right? Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Shorts, TikTok for now, we'll see what happens here, YouTube Shorts, Snapchat, LinkedIn is a place where you could go bananas. Right. And all of these platforms now have four U pages just like TikTok did, meaning their algorithms are now extremely over indexing towards the individual merit of the individual piece of content. Let me give you one immediately, Donnie, I think this is gonna change your social media game. I am surprised, but I'm gonna really push it, it's gonna be such an aha for you and everyone who's listening. The first second of your video on social media is a staggering variable of its chance of being successful. First second, because as you know. Yeah, yeah. So what then has to happen? Because in a second, nothing can really be accomplished. It seems like not, but tonight, when you just happen to like look through your phone, pay attention for a second and be like, yeah, like a second or two, I got this, like I don't care, I don't care, I don't care. Oh, pretty person, I stop. Oh, loud noise, oh, visual, the thumbnail. Like you'd be surprised, it's real strategy. It's, you know, but then the next three to four seconds really matter because you really like that first second gives you a hundredth of a hope and then the next three, four seconds really can either hook them or not. So what gives tips for somebody out there? So what are the important, and there's no simple formula, but first second, first four seconds. I'll give you one right now. I'll just go through it right now in my phone on the spot because it's fun doing this with you, like really being a practitioner. I'm just opening my Instagram for example right now. And like the first thing is like maybe a trade that something just happened, sources, the 49ers have listened to calls for Devo Sam. Okay, so now like that blue update. Like when I opened it, my eye went right there. The blue, like this, you're gonna love this. You know what's so funny? When people really listen to me and advertising, like the OGs that are still in the game. Like, you know, it's funny. They, let's say very senior people coming from very big companies that are coming here for the first time. A lot of them come with cynicism. I mean like, let me see if this is all bullshit. Right? And then they're like, I start to open it. They listen for an hour and they're like, wait a minute, this feels like very tried and true. I'm like, it is. Yeah, it's the same formula. I believe in the principles. Yeah, like when I look at this, I imagine myself in the 1957, like in Madison Avenue, going over someone saying move that because it's not gonna hit in the New York Post tomorrow because you need to, when they turn it, you gotta stop. Yeah, it's print advertising. Yeah, yeah. The first second is print advertising. That's a great analogy. And so you- Or like the way this update hits, right? By the way, if that didn't have that word update in there, you would just, it would just be another fucking thing. And like you think, oh, maybe there's something new I don't know about the Niners. Ironically, this video is gonna be of me in a second. Here we go. Oh, yep. The Post yesterday, Vine question. Right, so it starts with Elon's Post yesterday. Yeah. The Post yesterday. Elon's Post. Yeah, yeah. Those are the first words that I'm like. That wasn't even me. I was on someone else's podcast. They did a good job. Elon's Post yesterday. Wow. Right? This goes back to jingle copywriting or radio. Yeah, or the burst in the ad, that we gotta get you the first thing that you see. Johnny, it's really wild. The only thing that's changed is the mediums and what ended up happening is now you have an entire industry at the Droga Fives, at the Wyden Kennedys, at the Crispin Porters. They're derivatives of your early era and obviously the OGs that we saw on Mad Men. And they're in this half pregnant environment of like half Mad Men era, half overvaluing big data. Don't even know what they're talking about. Don't even know what the fuck big data is. That's the amazing thing. And analytics, yeah, what the fuck you're talking about. So you'll appreciate this analogy, I think. Right now, current Fortune 500 advertising looks like Vanilla Frankenstein. I call it Vanilla Frankenstein because it has all these particles that are disjointed and they don't really understand because it's some of its new tech, some of its, yeah, like old school, they work out, everything's gotta be on brand, which means it's the opinion of three people in a board board. And it's Vanilla. If you're gonna do TV first, when Toyota does its brand positioning, Toyota's current brand positioning, Donnie, is let's go places. That means, as you know, because you did this for a living and I've done it for a living, that means they can actually come up with anything because in theory, let's go places, it could be physically or mentally. Right, right, let's go places, you could be anything. And that's the good news and the bad news about that. Bingo. And so it's all Vanilla. So anyway, what my thesis that I'm putting on the industry is look, there's seven, this is now the television. Right, absolutely. Not the radio. Right. The television's the radio now. He's holding up his iPhone, okay. For those of you. Yep, and on the iPhone, there are seven channels that matter, just like pre-Cabin. There were seven. There were seven. It was actually, that's ironic. Wow, what a great little tidbit factoid that we're in the same exact place, seven fucking channels. And the job of all of us, Donnie, Deutch and Gary Vane, who are currently right this minute, are actually trying to be Lucille Ball and Bob Hope. Like as a personality, I'd like to be big on ABC, NBC, CBS, and the brands are trying to do what Procter and Gamble did, which is integrate commercials into it. Same formula. And that's it. And the ones that tell the best stories, win. Forever and ever. But the problem is, Madison Avenue, current agencies, they tell stories in the format of a commercial for PR or for an award at Cannes. Can I just say this? When I was in the business, I always said, fuck awards. I used to go to clients that you're not gonna win awards here. The only thing I care about is an FE or whatever, something that's gonna affect me. And when I would see somebody in my office going through awards books at the time, they used to put that award. I go, what the fuck are you doing? What are you, like, am I gonna go to a client? Look at this creative award. No, no, what am I doing for you? It's not what I'm doing for me. That's because you were a businessman and you knew if their business was good, that'd be good for your business. But as you know, for creatives, if they win an award, then another agency wants a higher. It's a very high-end industry. Yes, yes. Right. So my big thing is, the problem now is, the biggest companies in the world are losing market share because they keep over-investing in traditional, creative, and fake media reporting, impressions. You know this, the PR companies, I mean, look, one of the companies I most admire, Edelman, right, independent, global, big. You know, the Weber, Shamwick, the Edelman, they sell PR impressions. They're fake numbers. Yeah, yeah. Just because you got a mention in a newspaper, you didn't get 28 billion impressions. You got your name showed up in a newspaper. It's a circulation of a newspaper, multiply by 40,000 in case somebody drops it at a bus stop. As if anyone even saw your mention in page 19 of a newspaper. What is even a newspaper? Yeah, yeah, that's amazing. That's amazing. Anyway, I think that marketing has gone from lots of smart thinking by lots of smart people, I would call it mutual fund buying. Like if you have an investor, like you do a lot of thinking, you get to a presentation, you make a decision. And now I think it's day trading. Like you're buying by the nanosecond. So let's go back to some news you can use. We started doing some practical stuff. So I'm somebody, I'm starting up a new business, or whatever reason, I wanna build my personal brand. And now I know, okay, I'm supposed to go on TikTok. I'm supposed to go here, I'm supposed to go here. Now you've got every human being in the world playing in the same swimming pool. And so what do the smart guys do to win? They create cohorts. They know who, you're gonna love this, consumer segmentation, but not 18 to 35. That's ludicrous. More like, let's talk about how I do it. I know that a certain group I always wanna make content for 22 to 25 year old men and women just getting out of college because I've come to learn through my journeys, very anxious years. And I'm gonna say probably skew 65% men out of that group. Yeah, it's actually, it's exactly, right? Very, very important. So for me, I know I'm making content. So if I'm gonna make a video, I know I'm gonna talk about their dynamics with their parents, maybe, hey kids, get off the parents payroll. Because if you don't want your parents to have say in your life at 25, the only reason they have say is because they're giving you money. And the second you don't take money from them, you don't have to actually answer to them anymore because you're a grown up. But as long as you're taking money from mom and dad, they may have a little more say in your life because you don't wanna upset them because you don't want that faucet to stop. Because I knew who I was making that video for, that video is going to have a better chance of being successful. Cause I'm not just trying to make a video for everyone. That was made for that person. Oh wait, oh wait. They call that targeting back when I grew up. You know what I mean? But unlike when it was television, you would buy mash because or Seinfeld or Dallas. Now you're creating the content based on the audience for a person to do the way around. And the data is so much better, Donny. You know, like, you know, and now you can target gender, race, in the sense of believable how you can make this stuff. And if you come from that, but then the other thing that happens is, so for anybody who's listening, if you're a flower shop, you can literally run $30 on Metta, Facebook or Instagram on a three, on a five mile radius of your store with your content. Five mile radius. So now you're doing direct mail plus television for the cost of nothing, Donny. But it's just nothing. And you post it. Now here's where it gets fun. It's the reverse of the way we grew up, Donny. You post it and the algorithm will take it and it will go. You posted it organically. If it goes well, then you pour money on it. So if you're a local business, you may wanna pour money on it right away because look, if you have a great flowers video and you're in Short Hills, New Jersey, but everybody who's watching it is in California, Arkansas, your business is not conducive to getting that business. You may wanna do the paid media local. But if you're someone who's just trying to build a brand, you have a dot com and you're selling all over the world your chocolate bar. Well, you're just posting it. And if the seventh one does well, then you're taking your media dollars and you're amplifying it. What percentage of clients that come in today have any idea about this when they walk in the door? I mean, they know social media, this is there, I gotta put my mind where. But what percentage of clients actually understand it? You'll appreciate this. This is why I wrote the book this time. We're in a crazy place and this is gonna make sense to you because I know you pay attention. In the Fortune 500 ecosystem, truly Fortune 500, where Deutsche and Boehner are playing, zero. Yeah, amazing. Because they're KPIs, they're MMMs, they're MMAs, all the reporting, all the justifications, none of it, the systems, right? They do for Walmart. It's the upstarts that have it weaved into their formula. I'm gonna break it down for you. From the Fortune 5001 to the Fortune 5000, call that private equity-backed business and things of that nature, 5%. It should be way higher. That set is missing the mark. In the venture capital-backed CPG direct consumer businesses, 30%. That's why you see things like Poppy. That's why you see the Logan Paul and KSI, Prime Energy Drink. I'm sure there's been things with your circles, people throw it and you'll be like, do you know this brand? Or personnel's like Dr. Becky. These things that people are seeing that are hitting. And then the crew that most knows it, which is wild, is individual human beings, whether they're building it for their personal brand, or they're very small. Oh yeah, I would go to my 16 year old daughter if I asked her how to do it. Like, okay, I'm not sure what I'm doing here, but how do I do this? And well, Shil Crush is on the sea in pack, culture. She knows what's happening. She's like, dad, this Swedish candy store downtown is killing it. Or Ralph Laurence, Mocha, Mocha is built. Or the Crow Nut, or Mad Happy is a hot hoodie. Like, she'll know culture. What she won't know is that on Instagram right now, it's better to post a two post carousel than just posting a video. What's a two post carousel? You know, when you post on Instagram, and like there's multiple pictures or videos in it? With posts. Yes, yes, yeah, okay. What she won't know is, I'll show you my account. You know, you look at my account, my grid, and it looks like Schizophrenia. Yeah, but that's what you want. This is what drives everyone crazy about me from the outside that doesn't know anything about social media. They think that this is off brand. It's all over. No, that's your brand, because that's where you're going to all these different places. And you do, sometimes you're a psychologist, sometimes you're a business consultant, sometimes you're just a sports fan, and all of the above, you know? That's right. What I also know is that 90% of the content is being, 96% of the content is being consumed in the grid individually, not people going to my profile and consuming grid. That's really interesting, yeah. Aha, aha, aha. What was that, what movie was that from? Aha. Let me give you this. So like this, I also know that I have to use my trending sound on Instagram, and the carousel has multiple quotes, because it'll show up. I know, I know that me talking about a green screen of something, because that picture went crazy from the Knicks game, so I talk over it. This format does well versus just posting the picture. I know this one does well, because I'm asking people to ask questions and answer questions. Watch this data, Don, you're gonna love this. So this is a post that I've created recently that's really working. Ask one group to ask a question, ask the other group in my community to answer it. This post has 2,298 responses. The post prior, the post prior to it has 313. Right, right. That people engaging with it shows the algorithm that there's interest, which will show it to more people. You're gonna love this one. For the first time in marketing history, the creative is creating the reach. Yes, yes, that's well put. That's well put. I mean, you know, for you and I, that's like, it's a free travel. You know, there's an iron, of course, to the average outside observer of quote, marketing and selling, they would probably say, oh, I think it's the reverse now. It's being driven by the system and the pipes, and that it's basically everything is technology now, and everything is the media, the media is driving the content, and ironically more than ever, it's the content driving the media. As you know, somebody had to say yes to the Donnie Deutsch show. Yes. Somebody had to buy, you know, you had, Donnie, Deutsch, when you were running it, you had to buy the media to get that 30 second video of a big client of yours, commercial. You were actually dictating it. Now it's a complete meritocracy. And everybody wants to talk about Mark Zuckerberg being the Wizard of Oz or China manipulating the kids. It's a fucking meritocracy. People don't want to hear it. Listen, I was born in a communist country. I don't put anything past world powers, not America, not Russia, not China, but what people don't understand, taking it away from politics in the mundane, BMW today does not have the same power it used to with money. Right now, if you're good at making content on social, if you understand the principles, if you understand the first second, if you understand the copy, if you understand the tactics, if you understand the platforms, I'll give you one right off the presses. Tic-toc, excuse me, Snapchat has a part of Snapchat that is more similar to TikTok. Okay, I'm gonna sign into my Snapchat because I would just want you to see it. So there's a part of Snapchat, right? That is called Spotlight that acts more like TikTok and Instagram, right? Right, right, right. The organic reach on it is exploding these couple of weeks because a lot of kids are starting to get nervous that TikTok is gonna go away. Just going away and then you're in a new home. So they're starting to hang out at Snapchat and get used to it. Will you explain to young people that it's a quarter of a trillion dollar business, TikTok is not going away, it will just be too, there's too much money, there's too much America money, there's too much Chinese money, it will just be in different hands. Look, I will say this, it went away in India. I personally, Donnie, I'm gonna take a different tack. I actually don't think China will, I don't think China's gonna allow my dance to sell it in America. Really? Interesting. I believe it's in China's interest to create the social unrest in America. Of course it is, that's the whole issue, yeah. Well, guess what? For China, a trillion dollars is a pimple on the ass. No, I guess you're right, I stand corrected, I stand correct. You know what I mean? I could be wrong, we'll see how- No, by the way, that's exactly what, as a geopolitical enemy, they should be doing. I mean, it sounds sleazy, that's what we do. It's us against them, and they're like, oh, why, wow, we've gotten into the mines. We're get into the minds of young people. We're gonna, maybe we wanna incite problems, so we're gonna give 50 times more videos about Hamas than we are about Israel, and get everybody going. And listen, as you can imagine, this starts getting into territory that like is for over a bottle of wine, you and I. I don't think people, people jump on headlines, and especially in this political environment, I don't think people are paying attention to what's happening on Instagram and Twitter, and Facebook, and these are US-based, by the way, that's the biggest danger of this whole thing, as someone who's born in a communist country. I tell my dear American friends that I'm an American. It's a, you know, historical truth. This is a slippery slope. First, you ban something that's a foreign entity that's bad for America, and then you ban something in America that's bad for America. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, you and I have been around the block enough to know, like, they forget about the briefcase that have the names of all the communists inside of America. Right. And the truck, right? Yeah. Yeah. You know? We're not gonna, you and I could spend 97 hours on the politics of all of this. 97 hours, but I would say this, because I know with us two on this, who's showing up for here, let me say this for the marketers and for the entrepreneurs. For the entrepreneurs, good news. The companies that Donnie and I have worked for and currently work for are missing the mark. They really genuinely are. We've done a great job and built our company, but we're still very small in the marketing ecosystem of a publicist and Omnicom and the holding companies. There are ungodly amounts of money being thrown directly in the trash by the biggest companies in the world. And so for the kids that are listening, this is the hugest opportunity ever, because you can actually fight with the biggest companies in the world. If you start a pretzel brand, or a peanut butter or a deodorant, your fighting chance is so much more. There was a complete bar in entry. One thing that's so important that you talk about a lot that young people have done is authenticity. You can't say, oh, this one's doing it that way, so that's the way to do it. That is, I think, more of the sniff test now than anything else. However, they smell it out. Like, you're not gonna win. By the way, it's not fun to not be your authentic self. It's stressful, it's boring, it's not sustainable. You're absolutely right. So there's that. And then for the Fortune 500 CMOs or CEOs or the board members or C-suite, look, the activists and investors, you know this, you know, big business land, the activists and investors, they're gonna figure this out pretty soon. That most of the biggest companies are just wasting 90 cents a dollar, and they're gonna come in and they're gonna swoop in. And so I tell all the Fortune 500 CEOs and CMOs, and I talk to them constantly. I'm like, you better fix this before it gets fixed for you. Yeah, what's their reaction to that usually? You know, Donnie, I think you'll understand this because I know obviously we didn't cross paths at the same time, but this is what a lot of people revered about you as well. I think when you have the luxury of shooting it straight. That's what they want, because they don't get anywhere else. That is the number one thing they want, someone to be fucking honest with them. And I think a lot of the friendships you made and the ones I'm forming now, they knew you were right back then, and they know that I'm right now, but they realized their system can't change. I met with two people retiring from two of the five biggest CPG companies in the world this week, separate companies, they don't know each other, they're both in their last six months. For years, they would eat, I didn't really, I didn't know either. For years, they told me they wouldn't even consider working with me, because it seemed too crazy, this, that, the other thing. And they're like, it's so ironic, isn't it now, Gary, that I'm here in this office with you because I'm asking you for help for my next chapter, because now I need it to actually work. Yeah. It's not just line items anymore, and for the next board meeting, and I don't have the patience to explain to these 90 year old board members why we're moving all of our money in this way, so we, and now, now it's gotta work. That's amazing, that's great. When merit takes over, people go to social media, when politics of corporate America take over, people do television and billboards. You've been a real advocate, you talked about young people, particularly young men. There's a lot, so many, so much dead-end study today about the disenfranchised young men and all how things are stacked against them. My good friend Scott Galloway just wrote a book about how to transfer wealth going in the wrong direction, and what you're, give me your, give me the optimistic side of what you're seeing with young people today. The optimistic side is very optimistic, but it starts with incredible accountability. There is not a capable young man and or woman on earth. In the world we now live in, where there's less barriers stopping you from what you want than ever. That won't get there. On earth. Donnie, the biggest issue with young men, if I'm gonna stay in the pocket of your question, especially in America, is they're entitled as fuck. Yeah. Brother, I see killer 25-year-old guys who are Hispanic, black, white, Asian, Indian, crushing right now, Donnie. But they all look the same. Their mommy and daddy didn't make it so goddamn easy for them. Donnie, you're really- We had the luxury of being hungry. 100%, even if we had, we grew up in an era where even if your parents had it solid, they made you work- Yeah, I grew up very comfortable. My parents didn't give me shit. I mean, they gave me great access to great education. And then they were like, figure it out. Because you were smart enough to know that even if they were gonna hook it up, if they just gave it to you, like remember in our era, people borrowed money from parents, borrowed. Yeah, yeah. That was a very common thing, right? You would borrow, you know, you'd get married and you'd borrow a little money to get an apartment and you'd pay your parents back. Yeah, yeah. That is a form, you know, that's an incredibly foreign concept. That doesn't exist. That doesn't exist. I wouldn't think to do it. So how do you, what's the fact, talk to us as a dad now. So now the voltage you are to your kids. I'm gonna give myself a solid A minus as a dad. And where I don't get an A is, because my kids are, I have daughters, they're entitled. And they're great kids, but they've grown up a certain way. And I don't know how to, I put some of that toothpaste back in the bag. Toothpaste back in the two. Yeah. That's it. Look, I say to all my friends, and I've gotten very fortunate, I also live in an environment where my, I mean, I came to this country, lived in a studio apartment in Queens with seven family members. Now I go to court side at Nick's. I mean, that is a, that is a- Well, I had the pleasure of sitting next to you. Yes, that's right. Are those your seats or you move around? I move around. I'll see you, I'll see you game five. I can't wait, boy, I can't wait. I tell all my friends that have been forward, especially, you know, you can imagine, this will make sense to you. I have so many friends, because they know my story and I know theirs. The ones that really, really didn't come from much, is you can imagine, they really struggle with this conversation, because they're petrified of it. And I just tell all my friends, I'm like, you can't fake environment. You can't send your kid to Africa to build a school and think they're gonna have, you know, gratitude and humility. Like, all you can do is raise kids that have good principles and you continue to remind them that it's not their money. I don't think there's anything else. I think, you know, you want them to be good human beings. I start with good human beings. That's your main job, is to be a good human being. Second job is to do your best in school. We'll figure everything else from there. You know. I say, you know, I have a different thing with my kids. I can't bullshit. I put out 48 million videos a year. That's cool, doesn't matter. School, I'm like, be self aware. My daughter is annihilating it in school, in one of the toughest schools. And I'm like, so proud of her. I just want them to be, honestly, to be frank, I want them to be passionate about their life, the way I am. And I don't need them to be an entrepreneur. They can be a nonprofit worker. They can be a farmer. They can be a hairdresser. They can be a coin trader. I don't literally happy, but please have passion. And be doing something. And I think what you're probably teaching them also, of course, is such a big part of you, is giving back and caring. And like so much of your content, and it's real, I'm gonna go back to authentic, is when I see you talking to young people at conferences, and you say, like you fucking care. You want it to work for them. You're not out there selling shit. You're selling them and them on themselves. Honestly, you'll appreciate this, because I know you're the byproduct of good parenting as well. I got really fucking fortunate in the parenting. I did too. I was too for two. My mom, I was too for two. I was too for two too. And I got it in the right order. I got my mom hardcore for the first 15 years, because my dad was working in the liquor store back in the American dream for himself. So I got all that love, unconditional love, but my mom held me very accountable. Like if I got out of line, see ya. And then my father, I started working in the liquor store every weekend, every summer vacation when I was 14. And I got the hard work, the kind of like, just the tenacity. And I'll tell you what my dad did. I like giving him this rose. I had so much gift of gab, like you. That when I was nine or 10, I could sell any, forget about kids, I could sell any teacher and parent on anything I wanted accomplished. And you don't know how to calibrate that power. And what my father did for me at 14, he scared me straight on the following. Your word is bond and no embellishing. I remember this vividly. I wanna give my dad some flowers. He called, we were, we wrapped up the day in the liquor store, 12 hours, I'm fucking 15, 12 hours, nine to nine in the store, on my feet, no lunch, no breakfast, like immigration. He told me when I got there, you need to sell this Kenwood Chardonnay. He told me what to sell, right? He's like, I gotta move some cases this. I'm like, I got you dad, I was me, right? Yeah. We get in the car at nine fucking 15 to drive home, close up the store, put the money away. He goes, how many cases did you sell? I'm like, dad, I crushed today. I was like, I sold 29 cases, okay? Next day, Sunday, I didn't work in the store. It was a Sunday, Monday, my dad in the, I'm sorry, Tuesday, I remember vividly, Tuesday, not even the Monday, because I didn't see him that morning and that he came home light after I went to sleep. Tuesday morning, because as I was going to school and he was going to work, he came up to me and scared me shitless. He goes, when I ask you how many cases, you tell me the real number. You didn't sell 29. Probably till it's 27. No, no, wasn't that close. He said, you said 19 and a half. What happened is, I was gifted Gab embellishment man then. He start to believe your own shit and you actually probably even took yourself into it. I thought of it, I was trying to trick you. I just thought it was 20. I didn't care to the detail and I would always shoot high. It was like, you know that guy. I was like, you know, and it really helped me because I do wonder if I didn't have my father and I didn't have him from 14 to 18 when I was still moldable that would have I been a worse version of myself, a little bit more bullshit, a little bit more. Interesting, so you got from both. I got from both also. I pinched myself. I just lost my mom a few months ago, but it is. Yeah, I'm gonna let you go because you got your son's basketball game. What a pleasure talking to you. You're one of my favorite guys around. You just fucking get it. You're just your decent soul. You're loving what you're doing. And I get pumped talking to you. The book is day trading attention. How to actually build your brand when sales in the new social media world. It is a must read. I don't care if you're an expert or an ex-expert like me or you're just starting out building something. You need this book. This is a must read book. Gary Vee, stay well my friend. See you at the net game, all right?
