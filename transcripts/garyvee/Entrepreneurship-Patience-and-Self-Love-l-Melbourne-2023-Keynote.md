People struggle with patience because mainly most people are insecure. They worry about what other people think about them. So they're rat racing quick to get the paper so they can buy something to impress people they don't even like. And I'm trying to change that narrative. Melbourne what's good? Thanks for coming out Gary. Thanks for having me. Your parents have both had a massive influence on your life. Can you speak about both and how they kind of shaped you and stuff? My parents are very different but obviously have a lot of similarities. I think my mom just deeply overloved me you know in a way that's just profound to me in hindsight. I just thought I could do anything. I thought I was capable of anything. I was you know purely loved but she did a great job. She held me accountable. I was a terrible student. I got punished and grounded. So loved me but she didn't love me in a way that made me think that there weren't consequences. Modern parenting struggles because we don't hold kids accountable and so she found that balance. My dad scared the shit out of me my whole life even though he didn't do anything about it. Like meaning he never did anything to do it. It was just my mom used him as the bad cop. Plus my dad has these weird eyebrows where they're always mean. Like so that was scary but my dad was huge because when I was 14 and I joined the family liquor store business he really taught me some great principles especially like your word is your bond. He's a very honorable businessman. If you say something you do it and he really rounded me out at a time where by 14 I really had the gift of gab and I could sell shit and to me the only thing that I cared about was selling the thing the lemonade the sports card and I think my dad caught me at a good time and really taught me good principles and so I was very fortunate. I am very fortunate. My parents were 22 and 20 when they had me. So when you become like 30 or 20 even 20 you're kind of in the same general ballpark. So I have a great friendship with them but it's none of this modern shit like my parents are my parents. You know I was very I'm one of the reasons I'm comfortable being so out and about about everything I do but including my accomplishments is I actually am not very attached to my success when I hear that pre that video that just went up like you're this your marketing G you know everything I hear I'm like that's for my parents that's my parents like they built me I'm the product of that. So I'm very proud to make them proud and it's a very big currency in my body. How do you how do you react to success today? How do I love my friend? I don't think being a good businessman deserves any different treatment than any other person. I'm extremely uncomfortable when people give me credit for normal shit like there was some guy in the airport in SF in San Francisco on the way here I met him took a photo we talked he's like man you're really nice that's fucking amazing and and I know what he's saying and I get it and I don't feel comfortable in that I I feel like money and fame and don't change you I think they expose you and so I'm detached from the brother like I'm proud of it I've worked very hard nothing nothing I love when people like you're lucky I'm like you know nothing about me like I'm very proud of my success but I give a lot of credit to my parents I give a lot of credit to the circumstance and I definitely don't feel like it makes me special I'm humbled by the attention I'm humbled I mean do you know what this feels like like when you go to the complete other side of the world and many people want to come and interact and consume you're like this is humbling I appreciate it I really have a lot of love for all of you thank you for being here but to answer a question in a different way and then we'll move on I'm gonna die one day maybe I'll get some good action for 24 hours on whatever the way we communicate digitally those days and then everyone's gonna move on with their life and I think being grounded in that humility and understanding that even if you accomplish special things the world will move on the day after you're gone I think is actually very liberating for me and that's how I think about my success when you were building one library at the start did you ever know you're gonna make the vein of media or was that part of Slater on? I feel like very early on I wasn't only thing I thought about was I'm gonna build a big company for my parents because I love them I didn't even think about myself and probably until my late 20s early 30s when the company got really big and my dad was still paying me nothing I was like this might be I was like this might be a little fucked up you know when I tell kids to be patient like I was I worked 15 hours a day six and a half days a week for 10 straight years and my dad never paid me more than $70,000 a year and I built a company from three to 70 million so I would have been way better off getting a job somewhere else they would have paid me a lot for doing that but I'm 34 years old I started VaynerMedia with my brother AJ and we had so little money because I got so little money though I had some savings but I had just invested in Facebook and Twitter I bet the farm on it we started VaynerMedia in the conference room of another company because we couldn't even pay rent and I was 34 years old you know when I was 30 how many people here are under the age of 30 their hands like when I was 32 I was stocking shelves in a liquor store so you can imagine when 26 year olds come up to me and they're like oh I'm fucking finished I'm like I'm like mother fucker you haven't started so people struggle with patience because mainly most people are insecure they worry about what other people think about them so they're rat racing quick to get the paper so they can buy something to impress people they don't even like and I'm trying to change that narrative and for the people that are starting from scratch how did you get the first time in VaynerMedia what was the process? Well the reality was I really believe in asking like you know you can just ask like especially today like if people are just starting and they need a customer you post content and you DM people like when people people always like Gary I can't get a customer I'm like how many people did you hit up on LinkedIn how many people did you cold email and how many people did you cold DM yesterday the answer is always nothing and reality like for me it's just like what if you want something why aren't you not asking you don't want to be annoying you don't want to be a spam bot but if you don't ask you don't get and so you know for me was asking I mean mine came a little bit different because I was already starting to build brand and there was definitely people coming to me but you know the reality is it's just very easy to ask in today's environment I still believe for most people putting proper content on LinkedIn speaking about your expertise and or passion leads to an incredible amount of business opportunities and most youngsters don't even think about LinkedIn because it's a TikTok Instagram world and I highly recommend this room get way more serious about LinkedIn content because the opportunities of business development are extremely strong there even if you're selling a fitness app or t-shirts or banana pudding like it's not a B2B environment it's B2B environment but it has people in it and people buy banana pudding so what about so when the people see you do so much content how you speak you can always be overwhelmed if we are communicating yes so is that kind of bunch of what should they actually go about it well maybe you shouldn't be communicating in video form I mean there's a lot of you that I've seen your videos you really should not be doing but you might be great at writing like the written word is dominating like you can take a photo of something and then write a fucking three paragraph banger and accomplish the same thing I can by speaking or maybe the camera throws you off but you are a good speaker and maybe you should be using the memos app on your phone and then putting that over an image so there's many different ways to communicate or maybe you can't do any of them you can't speak you can't speak on video and you can't write then you get a partner who can there's always an answer but I love when people like Gary but I can't communicate this is fucked up I'm like well I can't play basketball and I'm not saying it's fucked up that nobody's paying me 40 million a year to play basketball like there is no fucked up there's merit if you're not good at something you shouldn't be compensated for it and the reason there was so many laughter is that let me give you the insight we are living in the greatest era of entitlement in human history the reason everyone just laughed earlier and clap now is something happened let me tell you what it's called prosperity it's been so good for so long in Australia and America and Europe and all these parts of the world of course not for every person of course but the net and so for some reason people just think because they're breathing air shit should happen that goes into parenting for a lot of parents here they don't realize paying for their kids lives is fucking it up if you're a parent in here and your child is over the age of 22 years old and you give them money bad things are happening when it comes to building a bigger business so many people have almost a money mindset and they can't they're not deserving a certain amount of money for you has money mindset been an issue with all or has it just been like a bright part of your byproduct yeah I mean money is good and all like I understand what it is as a kid I really thought one day I'd really like to make a hundred thousand dollars a year I had a number you know I got there and you know really you know look I think it's tough to be like you know every time I post content and I post a lot of this content about the money thing versus the happiness thing people lose their mind they're so mad at me they're like fuck you sure you can say it because you're like I get it it just the problem is I just know way too many people with money that are miserable you know and so you know for me I got very lucky and this is where luck comes in for sure I love business I did it as a kid when I was five and six and seven and it's the summer the most fun thing for me was to sell lemonade or wash people's cars like I like the game I also think similar to we're living in a great year of entitlement we're living in a year where people have put entrepreneurship on a pedestal and a lot of people are forcing themselves to be on the first one or not let me remind a lot of you in here as you go through your journey the number six at Facebook and the number 12 it's black and the number 17 at uber made a lot more money than the number one in 99 percent of companies you have to be self-awareness is what needs to happiness not everybody should be an entrepreneur it takes a real stomach to be an entrepreneur it sucks to be an entrepreneur everything's your fault everything's on you like I wake up and people like what's your morning routine I'm like I wake up and look at my phone to make sure the world's not on fire because my Singapore office is open and Australia's like it's constant anxiety you got to like it for it not to be anxiety but if you don't like it and you were not built for it it fucking is the worst and I watch entrepreneurship eat up people every day even the babies now your messages has kind of changed lots of the Joe Rogan play passes the more recent play passes news how do you what do you think's been the biggest switching in you personally for the last seven years to me I'm a reverse engineer of what I think is valuable to talk about you know like if you talk to my friends or the people that know me best like I'm I'm in the same pocket you know in 2009 when the economy was melted in 2008 and the internet was starting to hit this scale it was important for me to talk about the opportunities after work like of course I'm going to talk about what's available to people from seven to midnight when 99% of the emails and dms I'm getting is I lost my job what do I do right now I talk a lot about mindset because 15 years ago I didn't get emails about anxiety and depression now every dm I get is that so you start thinking about different things I didn't talk about entitlement you think I said that thing earlier about if you're paying for your kid's life at 22 is to razz people I'm not here to razz I'm here to give love I'm saying that because the number one thing I see that people are struggling with is when they think their parents don't think they're capable in the number one way the kids think they parents don't think they're capable is they're paying for their life parents think they're doing something good they're doing something bad the kid believes that you don't think they can do it and a lot of parents do it because they want to show other parents that their kids okay and they're doing well when they're not that really want to really fuck up a kid buy a bmw for them not because you're buying a bmw for them but because you want other people to think they're doing well but you and the kid both know they're not doing well so like I the biggest difference is society is different I'm in the business of talking about things that I think can bring value and so I'm following the conversation and then trying to bring value to the conversation from my perspective to the best of my abilities you know I think a lot of I think there's a lot of conversation I think AI is definitely in the conversation from a very technical standpoint I think you know I think people are tired of the fighting you know I think there's a fatigue in people canceling each other that's definitely a conversation I think people are just tired of like the conflict I think people are trying to find their niches I think I think there's a little bit of you know generational warfare going on the boomers versus gen z thing is fucking fascinating but I think there's a little bit of that I think boomers are shitting on gen z way too much especially since they created them I think Gen Z's shitting on boomers too much without realizing they haven't lived like yet and it's really cool for you to tell everybody how to live but you're 17 shut the fuck up so there's some of those right like you know you should be doing this I'm like you were shitting your pants five minutes ago what are the what's one of the biggest mindset shifts you had to make over the last few years I had a real kryptonite in my happiness which was a strength that ended up being my greatest weakness I had to learn how to deliver candor to people that I love my candor on stage right now is off the charts when I'm not talking to anybody directly this is all day the second you are even shifting from acquaintance to friend my ability to tell you things that I don't like started to disappear if I love you I had nothing to say I was just going to make it good for you and so I really struggled with that and it really led to a lot of resentment when you can't articulate things to people you start to resent and that really caused me a lot of all my pain in my personal life and my professional life the single reason I wrote 12 and a half was to talk about my inability to be candorous and to talk about this concept of kind candor which has really worked for me and is working for a lot of people that are reading the book and understand the concept which is can deliver critical feedback or even something potentially that sounds negative it was something I had to go through haven't you started to improve that skill set is it happy or how do you what do you kind of go about the same way people go about getting into shape you go to the gym begrudgingly the first time and you feel like shit and you can't do shit and it sucks and it's the worst and then you just go back the next day and it's a little bit better and then a year later you're in the game I started making myself uncomfortable once I realized it because it was subconscious for so long once it became conscious to me I started to I was I just knew that I wasn't going to be able to live a life where I had now become aware that I was bad at something and I was going to sweep it under the rug that would go against every way my chemicals work and so I just started practicing what what's the current state of personal brandings in today's world do you think some people say it's too saturated for their marketplace how do they come to stand out that's their mentality well it's definitely not too saturated every day people are popping off the reason people say it's too saturated is they're not good enough I love when people like yo here's my favorite dm yo gary v i'm fucking shadow band it's not over saturated it's competitive because now more people know the game exists you stand out by bringing value the biggest thing I see every day is most people post from a selfish place follow me like me buy my shit I think the easiest way to stand out is every single time I post something on social media the only and this is real talk the only thing I think is why would this be good for anybody it's why I never show any parts of my life that are not about what value is a post that you see of somebody boarding a private plane what's that doing for you everyone's when I razz my friends about it they're like oh it makes it aspirational I'm like for like three people the other four billion people feel like shit so I think that it's not saturated I think there's more tension than ever yes there's more competition if you want to break out you've got to ask yourself why is it bringing value to people like why is this post valuable and I think all of us if we opened our phones right now when the screen you can see it as clear as day the first 10 posts you look at are not valuable for you they're valuable for the other person which is why most people aren't sustainable and what about the selfish thing to be able to be like well maybe because many people think they're not good enough it's twice anything so how's the main tell you about selfish things good in that well now you're getting to the most interesting shit I mean I think that's a big deal like self-esteem is everything to me like I think parents number one number one job in the world is to build non-delusional self-esteem in their children and I percent of us the person that made you insecure is your mom or your dad and that goes into some deep ass shit which is why I'm so happy that the stigma of therapy is going away during this generation right for all of us that are sitting here every one of us that are sitting here right now no matter the age your parents lived in a world where no one talked about therapy or you know it just had crazy stigma if you want to go see a psychiatrist you are crazy the fact that we are so fortunate to be living on earth where that is now not the case is huge has someone builds the self-awareness to help to kind of become more vulnerable with the team and with their staff members themselves experience I think the more things don't work out the more you're like what do I have to do to change I mean vulnerability is a superpower and everybody thinks it's a weakness it's a superpower like like there's nobody on earth that's perfect and I think people should lean into their vulnerability and it's hard for alphas male and women but to answer questions directly I think I think the reps when you see your bullshit doesn't work three four five times in a row you get to a crossroads where you have to make a decision am I going to live in a delusional state with my own self or do I want the success that I'm trying to achieve and I think if you if you believe in the merit of the game you start conforming to the truth instead of your own delusion and so so yeah what's the latest with with the bay brands that you say you want to build next for most Disney have you always had that vision or is it kind of congressman I've had it for a long time I you know for the last 10 15 years I've wanted to buy an intellectual property I thought it was going to be something like Scooby-Doo or the Smurfs the Snorks which was this weird Smurfs underwater in 1984 alf was something I was trying to think about buying so I was really hot on it for a while and then when NFTs came out I saw it as a platform to be able to launch an intellectual property a year before COVID came out I came up with this concept I started working on called workplace warriors which are going to be little toys to put on people's desks because so many of the DMs that I was getting were coming from people upset at work and I noticed at work and I'm sure all of you know this in the office is people have little toys on their desk or little statues and I was like if I make patient panda or empathy elephant maybe when they're having a bad day they look at it and it makes them feel better and I was excited about building this toy brand I dragged on to a little while COVID happened that killed it NFTs happened and I kind of refurbished it rebranded it as v-friends and built this universe I now think of it as Pokemon meets Sesame Street you know there's a lot of like Pokemon to it because I'm very hot on competition I like the v-friends competing with each other the card game that I've made which is like a magic the gathering Yu-Gi-Oh Pokemon thing is very based on this but the Sesame Street part is I early on I called it Disney but then as I got more educated on Jim Henson and what the purpose of Sesame Street is it feels much more in tune to what I'm trying to do I'm trying to make these characters popular because I realized that I have been able to build an audience and I resonate with a lot of people but there's a lot of people I don't resonate with many people here who went out of their way to be here today which is very humbling also have a friend or family member who thinks I fucking suck right and so I can't resonate with everyone but v-friends 10 and so through animation and movies and coloring books and toys and pajamas and backpacks and candy I plan on building this property for the rest of my life what are some of the biggest mental traits that you have that you think has been the most important of your success self-love nobody's been able to ever say anything that has veered me away from how I feel about myself ever for even a second now that doesn't like I think I make mistakes every day I think I've bad days I think I've bad weeks I think I've bad traits but I've never felt that I suck like and nobody's have been able to ever convince me that I'm bad you know and so that's been huge um hard work like tenacity matters like if you're going to build something real like you're going to have to put in the work I love how people realize that in health and fitness but then try to make pretend in business that there's some sort of system like you know there's no passive way to get muscles I mean I guess you could get fucking like have implants but like and yet people keep thinking there's a shortcut my favorite bro is all these fitness people that start businesses who all their fitness contest is there's no shortcut for putting in the work in the gym and eating right and you've got to eat properly and your protein ratio and you got to eat clean and they go all the way there but then right away they're looking for a shortcut in business you know and so I think tenacity I think tenacity I think self-love I think curiosity here's a big one for a lot of you that I don't think's talked enough about I think a big reason I've succeeded in a lot of things that I see in others working is curiosity too many people say no the like watch this no bullshit please Melbourne please don't bullshit me it's okay this is not like a rad session I just want you to raise your hand if the first time you heard about AI no way that's bad raise your hands raise it high higher that I think about a lot the actual point is there's almost in my opinion one of the great missteps of opportunity is being in the business of no if all those people would attack the information something new with at least maybe I think that would be very fruitful for them in life to me knows and yeses should actually be met with maybe much more often right so like the same people that just raised their hand that said no to AI 20 years ago said no to cellular phones you know people said no to email people said no to cell phones how many people here had a black berry raise your hands do you remember when the iPhone came out how you were like fuck that shit I need my buttons how many people here have a blackberry with buttons right now that they actively use you know many people here said they were never going to be on social media you know any people in here said they were never going to be on tiktok I've always been in the business of maybe I've learned a lot including the 99% of things that end up being no I learned by just going and exploring it which helped me understand the yeses I want to go back to self love for a second so you said no one no one else can really impact the way that you see yourself yes the people in the room that don't have that kind of self esteem yet how do you how do you respond emotionally to a bad comment or a hate I how do they respond mentally I mean I the way the way I respond in the way that I would ask you to debate is I respond to those comments with empathy could you imagine being a human being that goes around the internet looking at people's videos and pictures and deciding to spend time to make them feel bad I feel bad for them brother because they're in pain they're in a bad place if you are in the business of tearing other people down you are deeply unhappy inside so you know the next time somebody comes on your page and says you're stupid you're ugly you suck shit don't feel bad for you feel bad for them like I've never spent a second trying to tear other people down let alone going around the internet to find something to tear somebody down about like you know and I understand that if you don't have self confidence it's going to trigger you I think the more interesting question I've been debating for decades how do you build self confidence I think one of the fastest ways is to cut out people that are tearing down your confidence around you I think the conversation that needs to be had are you going to limit your time with family members who make you feel that like you know I'm not telling people to stop talking to their mom but if your mom is making you feel like shit and is constantly complaining and everything is bad maybe you don't need to speak to her three times day we have to take on accountability and protect ourselves and decide what we're consuming in life you find what you're looking for if you want to find good shit you can literally open your phone right now and find unlimited good shit people like the algorithm I open my algorithm and it's like man saves boy from the pond mom loves son happy is good that's my algorithm like your algorithm is exposing you not trying to trick you trying china's not trying to get you you're paying attention dumb shit
