Everybody always wants to think everything's either dead or alive, it's not that binary. I trade attention, you understand? But when Vine's hot, listen, back in the back in the back and you would've loved to be on TRL. Did he build this whole fucking thing on TRL? Now you don't want to be on TRL. Cause it doesn't even exist, let alone anybody watching it. So to me, Vine would've been amazing. I wish you were the number one artist on Vine. Not even artists, like Person. You know why? You'd be making $40 million a year right now. Cause you would've leveraged off that. You see where I'm going? Everybody's so obsessed with, is this gonna be around? I don't care if it's gonna be around. Right now, is the radio station gonna be around? Yes, no, who gives a fuck? Tell me where everybody's attention is. The streets, where it's underpriced. Listen, I want a TV show. Go ahead. Please. When you say underpriced, you just talk about life. Attention. So attention. Where's underpriced, what I call underpriced attention? Instagram influencers. If you take all 300 million Americans, and you ask them to sell this bottled water, and they had unlimited budget, everybody had a million dollars, how would they sell it? I believe that 90% of Americans would make a TV commercial. Or do a billboard. When that's some bullshit. Correct. What I would do with my money is I would give it to a bunch of influencers on Instagram, and I would make one or two great videos for Facebook, three minutes long, and that's what I would do. And that's exactly what these big corporations is doing like Nike, even with Adidas, with me grabbing me to go to sneakers, like they grabbing these influencers or social life. Correct. Because you know what it is? You're underpriced. And they can get you. Of course, because just like me, my book, my book sells 100,000 copies in a week. I'm making them money. They give me a $3 million advance. I'm happy. Because I'm using them as a bank. You're using Adidas as a bank. You're getting the advance upfront. It's like the label. I'm using the label as a bank. That's all it is. That's all it is. By the way. I'm using Yalla as a bank. That's all it is. That's all it is. So what I do is I care only about them. I only care about Miranda. I only care about King David. I only care about Nicholas. I only care about Bala. I only care about them. Because they're the only ones that matter. Because they're the attention arbitrage. And that's why I give them so much love. And that's why I give all of my business advice away for free. Because I want to be more valuable to them than they are to me. And if I'm more valuable to them than they are to me, then I can get all of them. Gary Vee. Gary Vee. I broke my flight. I'm moving west. I'm up late. I need some rest. And I'm sorry, my mom leaving. Got something to believe in. If I don't slow down on my mind, I'm gonna cry.
