Get a real fucking workout in. Real stuff. Real stuff. You agree? Killing it. Bench. Rose. Rose. Bench. Sob, I've been telling you. All right, all right, all right. Here we go. Here we go. Facebook, good to see you. Let's see. We are live. I hope everybody's super well and doing great, enjoying their weekend. I'm trying to find different ways to hack daily Vs when I'm not surrounded by Tyler and DRock and all those characters. So decided to do a Q&A on Facebook as today's daily Vs. So while this audience builds, why don't I yap a little bit and tell you guys maybe a week in recap tomorrow's BizDev Sunday. But today was a good week. I was in Ireland. I was in Brussels. Last couple episodes of daily V have been remarkably strong. Oh, by the way, you guys have to see this. This is actually amazing. Actually, some of you have seen this already. This is my macho man hoodie. But this is really, and this is pretty remarkable. I'm actually going to do this entire daily V as macho man ringy and sandwich. Yeah, unjustifiably in a position that I'd rather not be in. But the cream will rise to the top. Yeah. All right. So I'm going to do this daily V as macho man, Randy Savage. Let's do this. Let's do some Q&A. What I learned in Ireland and Belgium is that so many people still are just looking for permission to do their thing. Way too many people asking and looking for permission. So what do you think your biggest weakness was in your mid-20s that kept you from reaching your current status? Henry, I'll be honest with you. I think way too many people are paying close attention to their weaknesses. Even this is, I think, symbolic. And I think the theme of maybe this episode, which is, Henry, I'll be honest with you. I'm not sure what my biggest weaknesses were. And I'm not sure what everybody's weaknesses are. But I know that way too many people focus on them. I would be blown away and happy if more people would pay attention to their strengths versus their weaknesses. I don't know what my big weaknesses were at 20. I really don't care. I knew my strengths were selling, leadership, intuition of where the market was, not being fearful of new technologies. And my answer to your question is, you're asking me to give you an answer about a weakness of mine so that you could address this. I would tell you that your biggest weakness is the same biggest weakness that I see from 99% of people, which is you're more inclined to focus on your weaknesses than your strengths. This is the binary switch. To me, this is like a switch. To me, this is very simple. I'll give you an example. Here it is. To me, it's this. It's just a switch. Either you're on or you're off. And to me, way too many people are on on their weaknesses. And I just want to be on on my strengths. So it's my answer for that. And that will be the theme of this episode, which is enough focusing on your fucking weaknesses. I mean, we have to get serious about strengths. We just have to please, please. Anyway, a couple more questions and we'll keep it going. What are the top five things angel investors look for in early stage startups? Israel at this point in 2017. This is a huge mistake for so many. They don't realize this is the case. Be so really over. No more bullshit startups getting funded that the 2007 actually 2010 to 2015 bubble is over. Israel, you need to actually make a business now. You need traction. You need hundreds of thousands of users. Or you're going to get shitty BCs or dumb money. So news alert. Another theme of this episode, better your strengths. Here's the second theme. The party's fucking over. Dumb fucking businesses are not getting funded the way they were three, four, five years ago, two, three years ago, even 18 months ago. People have this applying demand of real entrepreneurs, real good startups. It's really difficult to figure out now and people are being way more selective. The angel investors that I grew up with, the Dave Morns, the Socas, you know, the Kevin Roses, the Travis's have gone on to either build great funds of big businesses or focus on their own thing. And so I think you've got to actually build something with traction. GaryVee, I'm 39. I just started my own business in September as a health and fitness coach. What advice would you have for me to get word out there through advertising? Francis, there's a lot of ways. I mean, I did an episode on how to do DM, you know, marketing on Instagram, not too long ago. Hustling 24 seven on the Instagram DM. It is the 2017 opportunity. Content every day, you know, you know, hashtags on Instagram, DMing Instagram, other fitness people, just putting in the work, man, patience. I mean, just started everybody, you know, there's so many ways to do it. If you've got money, you run Facebook ads and influence ads. If you don't, you just put out content and you wait. I think way too many people when they start off with zero are fancy and they're not putting in enough free work free as such a negative, you know, it's not free when you don't have anything. I love when people like don't do free work. If I was a trainer and nobody knew who I was, I would DM everybody who has 100,000 to 500,000 followers or more on Instagram and offered to do it for free. Right. Period. You know, and so I just, I don't understand why so many of you that are just starting out are so damn fancy. My biggest strategy when you're zero and nobody wants to pay is to do shit for free and then use the exposure for, for, you know, for new clients. I mean, to me, I love doing shit for free. I, you know, and so that would be my number one strategy to free workouts with people that have huge audiences and tell them you'll give them. And it's not a free workout. You're asking for exposure in return. You know, so that's, that's kind of how I see it. We cut radio and direct mail, Facebook drive sales into our brick and mortar and thoughts on how to leverage traditional channels to drive social. No Chad, just use more social to drive social. Like you don't need traditional to drive Facebook, do more Facebook, do more Instagram influencers, you know, do more searching on Twitter, do more digital, you know, like, why are we holding on to traditional? Fuck traditional and fuck digital. If it doesn't work like banner ads or, or, or pre rolls, you know, or overpriced other things that nature. A little hot tip on a Saturday night, Snapchat's open filter filter marketplace $5 an hour for 20,000 square feet. It's a, you make a custom filter. It's incredible branding. More and more of you have to pay attention to it. Check it out. Geo filter on demand, geofilters. Check it out. It's, I'm starting to really get excited about it. Cool. One more question. And thanks all of you for hanging out on this Saturday. Appreciate it. Thank you so much for all of you that are giving love on, on, on Instagram. It's really going down on Instagram. Look at this. John Bates, I've been in the fitness industry for over 30 years and I've done thousands of free workouts right on because you're smart, John. That's why you've been in it for 30 years. People coming into some new market for 30 minutes and they think they're fancy and like, I'm not doing spec work. My time has worked something. Your timing works shit if nobody's willing to pay for it. If nobody's willing to pay for your shit, your times were zero motherfucker. Anyway, shit gets me mad. Everybody's so fancy now. Fancy damn entrepreneurs. Fucking bled out of my eyes my whole life. People think it's like luck and like, like privilege or stumbled into shit. Put him work motherfuckers. When you're at zero, I came into the agency world after building 60 million dollar wine business built up my brand, books, speeches. And I still did work for free because I was now in Madison Avenue and I had to establish myself there. I'm not getting paid any work close to my commissions for my time now at VaynerSports helping AJ build that. Like when you're in something new, the market doesn't give a shit what you were before. Nobody cared that the rock was the best wrestler. Now that he came to Hollywood, he had to pay his dues. Nobody gives a shit. Nobody gives a shit of what you came from before. When you come into something new, you gotta fucking work. I built a huge wine store. I wanted to get into tech. You know what I did in my first three tech meetups? I didn't walk in like I was somebody, even though I had a top 1000 followers. I was born in a thousand top followed people on Twitter on my way to being a top 100. And boom, boom, I get into the tech world. First three meetups, I pour wine like I'm the hell. Like I'm a fucking waiter. Like I'm the fucking help because I knew how to eat shit. I'm ending it with this. That's it. There's nothing else to say. Like people are fucking fancy. Get the fucking work. Here I am, fucking family, Saturday night at the top of the game, but I made a commitment to do a daily vlog. So I gotta hack it. What do I do? I get on fucking Facebook and answer questions for 10 minutes. I don't want to necessarily do that, but I gotta put in the work. You want to win climbing the mountain, put in the work. Love you guys. Thanks for having me. See you tomorrow. That was a scam for you. Why put you out of the grave when you out of the game?
