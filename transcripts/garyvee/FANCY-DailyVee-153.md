What am I doing right now? Like, where am I going? What am I doing? You're on this for Damon Jones' book. What am I doing? You're talking with him? He's fireside chatting me? Yep. Great. Yeah. Macro, I'm from mom and casual. Now that I got like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro, like a visual boy. I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Garry V. Sob, as I've been telling you. Accounts are talking about equity. I'm trippin' like giving a pedigree. And me and I'm special, my specialty. I'm putting no work till I'm dirty. Now earth I'm movin', furniture to heaven. You've been thinking all night. You've been sleeping all night. By the way, everything I do is always intended to figure out who's a winner and who's a loser. So it's about, it's binary. How you react to something is a telltale sign of your feelings internally. That's how you scale. That's how you really scale EQ. That's how you scale. You do things that expose people. How people react to things is who they are. Let's cook it. I just wanted to talk to you about the- I'm glad. And like make you win for what I can control. You've got your part to control because of the way I've managed. I know a lot more about you. I need those white spaces for you to be you. Strengths, weaknesses, curiosities, growth, historical context. So when we do things, it's also an insight on people. You people who are literally A plus players, crushing it. Every feedback they've gotten is phenomenal. We have a restructure and they're crying and texting or they're gonna lose their job. That's important for me to know that, oh my God, that person's massively insecure. So I can help them. You see where I'm going? But if I circumvented it up front and went, hey Sally, you're fine. I would never know. Communism, capitalism, got it? Macro management, not micro. I'm doing it because I wanna help. Okay, cool right? That one I got, good. That one I got. That makes sense, right? You know how much that helps me? Now we can help that person because we want them to be here. Cool, I love spending time with you. I was like, oh it's 2017, let's just, just have a little QT down. Let's do it. Let's go. Hey, Finn? Yeah. I like my Timo, this is very good. What's up, Sammy? Hey, how are you? Good. How are you man? Welcome. Hi, I'm Bobby, I'm Lacey. I'm gonna be here. Yeah, Sam just gets a dab. Actually, you know what, Sam? We're bringing it. Yeah, man, we're bringing it. Hey guys doing? Welcome, I'll see you soon. How are we operating? Is this your whole like, now that I'm doing this thing, I'm just not gonna cut any hair off anywhere? I would. I see it. How's everything? You're a man. You're a, you're a man. No, you're a man. You're just a man. You're just a man. Yeah. More, more, more. Hello. Hey bud. Hey bud. If you're gonna impart some wisdom on a sales person to try and get them to get a straight answer from some type of prospect, what would you say to them? Because it is so hard. I mean, you're not the other person, but what do you need to do for them to come back and say? I'm a little bit different on this one. My answer. I don't know if you're different. Well, let's find out. Yeah. My answer is don't chase them and move on to the next one. I do not sell the unsellable. If you don't return my email, and if you're dodging me, and if you're coming up with excuses three minutes before the call, I have no interest in chasing you. How long do you give it? How long do you give it? Not a whole lot. I'm a salesman, so am I into it? Try to go back. Go back 10 years. I'm going back to being a 13 year old selling baseball. I'm telling you the truth. This is why I told you I was gonna be different. But I also think that I'm as good of a salesman as the most attractive girl on earth. What I mean by that is, the most attractive girl on earth's advice to picking up guys is gonna look different than the average pillar. She's not working it. It's coming to her. I think I've always sold stuff I believe in. I've always been great at selling. And so for me, I just have no interest in chasing you. And so what I'm getting at is the following. First of all, salespeople, and boy is this the best piece of advice I can give. The amount of people that are in sales that sell shit that they don't believe in is extraordinary. Let me say it 15 more times. The amount of salespeople that sell stuff they don't believe in is extraordinary. Which means you've already lost. I will say the one thing that non-winning salespeople do, the 85% of the market, who are successful, but eventually won't be, or will play themselves out or tap out, is they say no for the other guy and girl. Oh, they're not gonna, you know. If you're a salesman that says no, you've lost. I love you guys, you're welcome. Good to see you. How are you? I'm good. You're really good. Awesome. It's like when you put a challenge in front of me that I'm passionate about, that's the thing. No, my only concern with sports has always been like, I never wanted to get pigeonholed because being a female in sports, but now I'm pigeonholed in a different way because being a female in tech, it's like, oh, you're a female in tech, side or other. You're a minority woman, you're gonna be pigeonholed your whole life. Like, people get pigeonholed. You don't get pigeonholed, you break out the box and make up your own shit. But I get pigeonholed, right? The first article about VaynerMedia was, Wineboy wants to start agency. People get pigeonholed. Like, you know the best way not to be pigeonholed? Execute. Punch them in the fucking mouth. That works for me. Right? Like, we're all pigeonholed, whether you know, no matter where you come from or what, everybody's pigeonholed. Do you know the level of disrespect I have for white rich kid on the upper east side? I don't think he, white rich boy, I don't think he has fire. I pigeonhole him that he's been given everything and he can't be me. So like, everybody's pigeonholed. So instead of like everybody debating, everybody being pigeonholed and they're one struggle, the whole game is what you've done, you've executed. I need this history lesson. I think we all have too much, when people say to me, oh sorry, I didn't know who you were. Like if I'm in a good setting, like South by where I, I'm always like, I know. Like 99% of people don't know who I am. Do you know what I mean? So I think like, the other thing with pigeonholing is like, I tell my people all the time, like, here are egos getting the best of you. Like nobody really gives a fuck. Yeah, true. Very true. Right? Right? So like, I'm not worried about that. To me it's the reverse. To me it's like, shit, that's the game you love. So is there something to be done there? Okay, send me that email. Yes, absolutely. All right, good to see you. Yeah, of course. I was intrigued to do it. I love that you're so efficient with time though. It matters. Look, I said, you know, time is more valuable than money, because money can always make more money. The other thing, the other thing, the other thing you're feeling here is, I wanna get a deal done. Let's just get right to it. And if we can't, great. We got a long journey. We can do it in 16 years. But I think a lot of people just take meetings, like, they take up time because they're not trying to get anything done. I'm trying to get things done. Okay. Look at that good-looking man. Not only is he very good looking, but he's one of the great athletes of all time. What's up, brother? Good to see you. Were we live? No, this will be on DailyVee, not live. How you doing? Good, man. It's good to see you. How was Super Bowl for you? It was cool. Everybody was just saying you were really hustling. I'm like, of course he's hustling. Like Superstar off the field. So you guys talking about the website right now still? Right now I'm in the house. It's coming in when I talk about people. You will have thousands more people going to your gyms if you just listen to me. Yeah. See, that's the deal is like, it just, you get the wrong strategy. It just doesn't work. You know, get a thousand new followers here. 300, it's just too much work, to be honest. I get it. So like, let me tell you what to do that will bring you the most value. It will cost you three. And then there's always something new popping up. Snapchat, this, and that. Great, there's new ways they cover you. You adjust it. It's overwintering. It can be overwintering. It's a lot going on. Listen, especially when the fucking other brand in Marshall does shit and you gotta deal with it. I pay attention. I understand life. I'm just telling you that, you're gonna regret if we don't do this when you had me to do it. When you're gonna leave tens of millions of dollars on the table. So what am I supposed to do? You're supposed to, we need to figure out a day to hang out. I'll bring somebody, probably Nate, because he's on my team and he can scale all the projects. We'll tell you exactly what to do. We'll hang out for three, four hours. We'll literally make sure everything's on point on your phone. We'll all talk together. We'll create a program that is feasible. Not something you don't, like, all we wanna do is really talk to and understand what you do and don't wanna do. And then reverse engineer that. I'm not gonna make you do shit you don't wanna do, but I'm gonna tell you and explain to you what you should do. You're gonna pick from the menu of those things and it will change your game. It's where all the economics are. Come with me, Brandon, show me my office. Come on, Mish. Chris, call the office. It's a huge Bears fan. What? You don't get to come in the geist of a Bears fan? Hi. Hi. All right, give him a hug. We're gonna do it. What's up, man? What's up, man? Can I get a picture with him real quick? I don't know. He's a grown man. He's a grown man and I'm like acting like a little kid. It's so weird. Oh, my God. It's so weird. It's the best. Of course, Chris. It's awesome. Good to see you. Good to see you. I'll be in one sec. I'll go in here, actually. You don't film this. That's right. So I want you guys to do the following. This is gonna fucking work. All right, iPhone. I want you to record. And fucking, for everything, because they're improv, but there's 50 of them now here. So I don't give a fuck who it is. Get me two improv kids in this office. I want you to literally film this. I want you to literally film them either in the office or go film them at a bar if you got a second on the phone because I want to show this to them. It's going to be like, basically this skit is like, hey, I'll take a picture and the other person's like, I want this slide. What is it, 2009? And I want the person to punch the person. And then I want you to impose the logos on their faces. So the one. Guys, I think it's gonna be a homerun meeting. I think the reason I'm so fired up, and this could be the meeting that changes the course of our agency. I think they're gonna make us do it. I know if they do what I want them to do, it'll work. I don't debate it. It's a hundred. It's just, can we get it? Like, it's an aggressive corporate America campaign. It will work. All right, good work. Yeah, cool. Thank you. You guys take the rest. Okay, okay, okay. 10. 10 is gonna be the guy there. Yep. Big bro on the baseline. Okay. For 2110, for 10. Okay. What's up, Jeff? What's up, buddy? How are you, man? Long time no see. It's good to see you. You too. How did it know you were here? Sure am. You're the cop? In the car. Belarus flood, baby. Where are you going? To do something with Damon John from Shark Tank. Cool. Hold on, I was just calling to say hi. Things are good. How are you? Anything interesting? That's a smart, that's a good strategy. What? Well, it's... Thank you. You're welcome. What's your name?

You know how many people you inspire, daily? More than you think. I know. Amazing. It's amazing. And do you pat yourself on the back for that? Yeah. I'm really comfortable. I'm my number one fan on a serious note. Like, it's the best feeling. Yeah, you should be. It feels awesome. Cause I do it all by myself. I have a five year old and I'm running my own company and I listen to you every morning. Thank you so much. It means a lot to me. It's inspiring. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being here, yeah. It's awesome. Were you filled in on any of this? This space? Yeah. Yeah, but I'd like to hear it from the horse's mouth. Basically what happened was we moved into this building last January. How do a patio right here in Manhattan? This is insane. That's incredible. So typically you can see them first table there right there. What if we just got here by a statement. Oh God, I love New York. I just love New York. I just like love New York more than every other city combined. Yeah. This is a cool area too, cause it's a fashion district and all these people, they're all working, trying to make it happen. The thing with New York is you never, ever, ever go wrong. My man. What's up, Gary? What are you trying to like steal all the outdoor space in New York? I am, I am man. I appreciate you man. I really appreciate it. No worries. So simple. Had my people call your people and that shit just happened. That's the way it's done. That's how we do it. I know I owe you. It's all right man. I'm thrilled to do it. How you doing? This is incredible. It's great. We're gonna have a good time here. The outdoor stuff is just incredible. Yeah. How's your family doing? They're just really good man. Hey man. Hey man. I'm gonna look at it one day and be like, what the hell was more, more, more? Cause I was on it for three days. Look who's here. Hey, it's going well. Amazing. Good to see you. All right. All right man, good to see you. What's up? What's up? What's up? What are you doing here? You got the crew here. Come and see you guys. Well I love it. Clearly tell me where you want me to roll in and I'll crush the shit out of it for you. I'm gonna micromanage the whole thing to bring it the most success. So I just wanna have a clear, so tomorrow what I wanna get out of it, whether it's a dollar or whether it's, and you know me. I'm like, this is all family, all of us. So I don't want you to worry for even 30 seconds about what my allocation is because I want you to be successful. It's way more important for me of that than whether I get 200, 500 or 74 million. I'm about to take stage with Damon John for this fireside chat, but when I get off, I will call you. All right, bye bye. Had a humble brag. Oh please welcome Gary Wayne. Thank you. Thank you for being here of course. Everybody give it up for Gary B. Thank you Gary for having me. And now being here with us, I appreciate it. Let's get the fuck up out of here. I'm gonna use those words now. Thank you. Thank you. Great, thank you. I still wanna talk about fancy. Let's talk about fancy. Can we stay another minute? Can we stay on the, I'm not fulfilled yet. We're fancy. We have to have this conversation in this space. Like we've got it, every entrepreneur in here has it so much better. It's called the internet at scale. So many things are easier than what we came up with. Right, you can DM the person and maybe get to them. I just, I want you guys to win, which is why I talk about this. Like when the money dries up, when the economy gets tighter, all of this goes away and the majority of this market right now is on bubble gum and dreams and like, you've gotta know how to make money. Like you have to have a business. Your product has to bring value. Like the tried and true is the only thing that's gonna make you successful. People running around here trying to raise money. Oh, I can't get raised money because I didn't go to that kind of school. Or they don't, I can't raise money because I didn't come from that kind of neighborhood. Don't raise money. Make money. Doesn't take a hero to give up a piece of their business. Make it. So should you, so all the balls are the wall concept. Should you quit your day job or not? I think you have to be practical and hungry. Like you should not quit your day job if you've got crazy compounding interest on your student loans or you've gotta pay your mortgage. But what you shouldn't do is have that job, talk shit that you're gonna build some big business one day and then at six o'clock at night, not work. Like you need to go to sleep at 3 a.m. Like you need to back your fucking mouth up. Everybody's talking shit. Everybody's talking shit. Everybody's talking shit. Everybody loves to hit me up. Gary Vee hustling. I look at their account and they're like playing ping pong at 430. Like people don't understand what hustle is. I took one vacation in my 20s. But I have crazy aspiration. You should take 11. But don't come telling me you're gonna buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And so like the first thing is figure out who you are and what you want and then deploy real self-awareness. But I'm telling you the thing that I'm fearful of and the reason I didn't step off stage yet is it's been so good for almost a decade. This has been easy. There's so much money out there. Everybody's getting money for their dumb ideas that make no money. And if you're not, then you should really even question that. Like if you haven't been able to raise money, you really fucking suck. Because the market is ridiculously ridiculous. Like terrible. Like people are getting funded for everything. So if you haven't been able to figure out how to get money, you're a triple loser. So the way to answer that and punch me in the face and tell me that you're not is go make money instead of dwelling why you haven't raised it. I'm not gonna say my cash is lump sum slam. Rust move, rust move, quite smooth. I'm gonna have to go and pass in your hundred. Two minutes, two minutes. So many minutes like which one of yours is this? This one of yours is this. One, two, three, hey. Now let me see you put your hands high inside. Yeah, cause I want it by land side. All right, let's go. Yeah, let's go. Ready? Let's go. Let's go. Hi. The thing that confused me was when you said, if you're looking for money, you're a loser. Yeah, you're gonna lose. But some people have to look for money because they take the concept this far. I get it. So they can't take it any further without money. What I said, let's break it down. What I said was in detail was a lot of people's startups are gonna fail here because they're starting the business just for the money. No, no, that's actually not what I said. Cause I still believe in that too. I said the reason their business is gonna fail is cause they're building it to sell. That's different. That's what I actually said. And that's different because. There's no love it. There's no love it. And it's not only, that's right. They don't love it. So they're looking, that's why everybody hits me up and says, should I go into the marijuana business? They're looking for trends. Should I go into KL? They're seeing trends. And they're like, oh, that's where the money's gonna be. And so they go there. And the problem is if you're not doing something you like, you can't work hard enough to actually succeed. It's too hard. You said a bunch of things. You said, some of my employees don't give a damn. You can't expect the person. But here's the problem. How do you, one person I've seen do that real good is Puff. So Puffy has found a way to get his employees to bust their ass, but maybe it's also the culture. Well, I don't know Puff well enough to know, but the real way to do it, and it's really worked for me as well, is I keep talking to these guys and figuring out what. I spoke to Tyler. I said something to this kid. When I saw you at talent, I said, okay, tell me the truth. Do you wanna work here for a year? Leverage that you worked with me and go do your own thing, because I'll help you. We'll have a nice one year courtship. This is how they date now, right? We'll have a great one year courtship, and I'll put you on more. Because if you tell me the truth, then I know what I'm dealing with. So I think the way to get employees to really, really crush for you is, do they want money? Do they want work life balance? Do they want fame? What do they want? What's their version of success? And where really, this is where you gotta be real good. And this takes a lot of leadership. You gotta know it's gonna change every day. Because when they're 23 and coming into New York City for the first time and they can work 18 hours a day, but what happens when you fall in love and you gotta start a family? What happens? You know, like. You know. You come back, whatever. But the thing is that if you're trying to build a company, the way that I'm looking at it now, based on me, is I don't need people who are gonna shit in the desk. I need playmakers. So how do I find a playmaker? You gotta speak to them, and you gotta find playmakers and then tell them what you can bring to them and ask them what they want from you. You gotta get them. You gotta make them feel safe to tell you the truth. It's very real. You gotta tell, you gotta get them to feel safe to tell you the truth. Because then you can play. I'm sure. You have been coming up more and more recently. No way. Son of a, how are you? It's a real pleasure, man. Real pleasure, stay well. To me, it's, what's really interesting is, in CPG land is, there's so many variables besides the marketing. That's the reason I've been able to build my company. It's just a macro game. It's always a macro game. It's always a macro game. The other thing is, I think people go to work. They go to work. To make a difference. It's, you know, I mean, it's also the confines of that game, right? Like you're an unusual kind of character. It's why I'm allocating this time. It's because, it's not because I'm doing anything other than reacting to what you're doing. I'm just counter punching the reality of the conversation. I promise you something about money. Money is real funny. Real funny. Money doesn't care what you look like. You don't care what you look like. Money doesn't care what you look like. You may think it does, but that's your fucking excuse. Money wants to make money. If it's, I'll give a Patriots fan money, that's how much I want to make money. You understand? You can say anything you want about, you don't look the part, white woman, black woman, not from this country, money wants to make money. So if you're not getting it, you suck. So then go make it instead of dwelling that the old white guy in VC lands not giving me any money. It's because your shit sucks. And so the only way you can prove me wrong is to go execute. Another day of grinding ends midnight. That's how we do it. That's how we do it.
