It's not getting nice around here. First I went off on the fucking bullshit ass, loser ass, no chance ever winning Troll that was in here. And now D-Rot throwing down on the Portuguese Wonder. Chicks trying to get married. Like shit's going down here on the delayed flight. I'm from Marmin Casso. Got a lot of ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Maco, Maco. Like a visual boy, I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Gary Vee. I've been telling you. I'm telling you. I was talking about equity. I'm triple H giving the pedigree. And me and my specialty. I'm putting the work till I'm dirty in the earth. I'm moving furniture to fabric. Don't let nobody tell you what you can or cannot be. Or what you can or cannot do. All you have to do is listen to that voice inside. And know you have greatness within you. It's time to fly. Yeah, yo. Amsterdam ambassador. And it's straight hurting dudes. Out spit your crew. And I know a lot less English words than you. Thinking of time. Rappers was thinking of rhymes. Stinking as monsters. Just thinking of bribes. I'm thinking of tribes. Of people digging me for who I am. Madam C's are a part of me. Call me who's the man. Still watch the DVD. At the crib with TLM. Talent is not predicated on your age. Especially when the game is conducive to the youth. Right? Like my 30 years of basketball experience is not helping me against the top recruit that's going to Duke this year. And, well, I don't know about that. We haven't had our 101. We just have it. I mean, listen. You're talking. You're talking. You're going to get actually posted. He won't score. He will not score. D-rock. I will give him the company if I don't score. Give it to him. Give it to him. Document it. Sign. Put my fucking signature on it. There's no chance you're going to score. There's no chance. You might not even hit the backboard with a shot. There's no chance one-on-one that I don't score. And to be very honest with you, if you keep fucking talking, I'm going to just beat you outright. I don't know what else to say. D-rock, he's not watching enough videos of his actual game. It's a problem. I know my game limited, but I'll tell you one thing. I think I'm going to win. I don't know what else to tell you. Hey, how are you? Gary. Gary, thank you for the pleasure. Hey! Hey! We know that every fucking 22-year-old in America grew up editing film for the last 10 years and have real skills. We're sorry that that happened. We're sorry that you don't have to go to film school anymore and just start learning. And then of course by the time you're 36, we apologize that technology came along and talent. You know, it's like you want a 40, maybe an algae today. You want a 41-year-old basketball player like me because I've been playing for 31 years? Or do you want the kid that's going to Duke? Like talent is a variable. I know he's 17. He's been playing for less time, but that's what's happening. And so, back to where I was going. I already forgot. I want to send one or two of our film guys and gals to these places. Just leaving Chicago, my PepsiCo client. Great day. We had a lot of fun. Intense meetings, important meetings with some agency partners and with current clients and now heading to LA. Good day, very focused so far. Early morning, what's going on? Snapchat just had an update. And I'll look into that right now. I'm going to call the Resi CTO, catch up with him. That's it. There's a huge baseball bat right there. No, no. What are you talking about? Oh my God. Thank you. Yeah, no, it's a good way to end that little. Leave a comment if you want in from 6 to 9 p.m. secret event. 15 or more. 20? What do you think? 15 and 20. 15 and 20 of you are going to come to a secret event with me in the Hollywood area in LA. I prepped this video the other day. Couple videos down if you want to see it. I'm wearing like a pink shirt. But leave a comment right now if you want in. And I'll let one or two plus one. So if you want to tag the other person that you want to come with, that's a little secret thing. Shh. But we're going to DM you. Something big. Super Bowl big. It'll be really fun if this happens. Small percent of chance. But if it happens, I'm going to recall this moment and you'll be like, oh, that was it. That's what happened. What a, you know, it's amazing to be working with progressive clients. Hey guys, it's Gary. I'm just going to be here at the airport going through my Instagram DM. Because that's where it goes down. No, I cannot be your mentor. You guys can hear me, right? No, I think it's good. No one knows the CTA. Okay, good. Can you hear me right now? Instagram. Can you hear me right now? Los Angeles. I will see you. I will see you tomorrow. So as I can get in this fucking plane, I will see you. And I will bring it. Secret thing. 25 people trying to get a couple more slots right now. We're working on it. Some of you are probably getting hit up by Sean Mack or Alex DeSimon. Fat Gary was fun. 2009, 2015. There was a couple real bad shots out there. We need to dig those up and like really do a collage of Fat Gary. We need to make a Fat Gary t-shirt. You like that? You like Fat Gary t-shirt? Oh man. Went in the wort. Heart. Good to see you. Love it, love it, love it. Alright, let's do a ridiculous contest. You know what I liked the other day? When I made everybody take a screenshot of the live stream. Post it. Whoops. Post it. Crap did I end it? No. Post it on their Instagram and tag me. But I should give away something good. What about an hour shadowing DRock and me? Like in New York. I was actually just on the live stream and I actually see you. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Amos. Amos, really nice to meet you. Pleased to see you. I want to show you videos. Thank you brother. Inspiration for sure. Thank you brother. Take care. Wow, 3,000 on the live streams. Nice. Okay, here's what we're going to do. I'm going to give you guys the opportunity to hang out with me and DRock for two hours. Not one. They can shadow you. I'll find like five minutes here, two minutes there, selfie, and circle click. But I'm going to live my normal life. But you can come to New York, hang out at the VaynerMedia offices for two hours. So that's what you can do. So what you have to do is you have to screen shoot this. You have to screen shoot this and you have to post it on your Instagram right now. And you need to tag me because that's how I'm going to find you. I'm going to use the tag functionality. So tag me in a photo. Like tag me in a photo or use my handle in your copy and say, Gary V, give me. Give me the two hours. You need to fly into New York on your own dime or drive or take the path if you live on East Coast or whatever. But it expires at the end of the year. So if you live somewhere and you're going to visit New York in the summer, we can do it then. That's what we're doing. Let's do it right now. Take a screenshot right now of this. Let me take some nice glam shots so that I can look at it on your Instagram. Oh, actually, you know what? No, if I'm going to do this and I'm going to clog up your feed, you need to tell people why you follow me because I'm attractive, because I'm attractive, because I'm friends with Kevin Rose, because I'm attractive or maybe it's an inspire or I bring value. So not only do you have to say, give me it, you have to say why you follow me and tell them to follow me because that's what I'm getting and what you're getting is two hours with us in NYC. How long do I create content to ask for a favor? Drunk it all depends on how good it is. You can put one piece of content that's so good that everybody wants to give you favors right away or it might take you eight years because the collective, it's really just a value exchange that people don't understand. This is all value exchange. So it's not about how much content or how many days it's the quality. It's like how much value did you bring? You put out one video that changes everybody's life. You could have taken one day, right? So that's what's up. Canada, good to see you. Kyle drives me as legacy. I have this innate feeling in my body that I'm special, that I'm all time and that I was gifted with unbelievable talent, enormous self-confidence and humility, which means I'm balanced and I'm focused and I can do shit. And so I feel almost like guilt of the emotional intelligence that I was gifted. And so thus, legacy and guilt and ambition drive the fuck out of me. I don't care about money. Money's already come. Money will continue to come. People understand when you level up into passion, ambition, legacy, passion, legacy, ambition, then when you go with those kind of tactics, you start the money always comes, especially if you got talent. DRock is here. Tyler is here. Jay. Jaydeep, I'd love for anybody to try to expose me as a fraud motherfucker. Come see me, Jaydeep. You real fucking tough with no icon. Come see me, brother. Come fucking see me. Expose me for what? I ain't asking for shit. Why don't you come see me? Bring your tax fucking receipts to show me what you got, Jay. Show me what you got, Jaydeep. And you got what you want, troll. I gave you some love. Enjoy it. Drink it, motherfucker. Enjoy it. I love it. I am savage, Nick. People don't know. I'm nice as fuck. Tyler, what percent? What up? Want me to come over? All right. People at the store want me to come over. Trying to be on the live stream? Get over here. How you doing? I'm live. What's your name? My name is Kelly. Hey, Kelly. Hi, life. Tell them what's up. What's up, Instagram? Get your hair right. Wait a minute. Follow my Instagram and Kelly on the square back. K-E-L-I-E-B-A-D-D. B-A-D-D, double D? Yeah. Double D? I don't really know what you do. I'm just a businessman. This man told me you were going to own a jet. That man was right. Really? Are you married? I'm married. Why you wanted to make a play? I like your style. Good luck. Wait, can we take a picture? He knows how to do it. Are you with him? He sure is. That's D-Rock. Awesome. Good. B-M-Beats, mother of five, first of all, you're incredible. You got to start a business that's practical because raising five kids is a triple full-time job. I would say late nights trying to build your brand, trying to sell stuff. The two things that I think is most practical is either building your personal brand on social media or selling stuff on Letgo, Etsy, eBay. Those are the two most practical things that a mom of five can actually pull off because those are the things that you can actually do damage at 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 p.m. You know? Well, 8, 9, 10, 11 p.m. 12 a.m. 1, 2. You know? I love that DailyBee 101 is incredible because every time I see D-Rock, he's all sad that dude came from Portugal and put together the bomb piece of content. I know, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Big ups Brazil. Oh, Andy's in the chat. He's like, sorry, D-Rock. I think you guys have a real rivalry. The Portuguese wonder is your rival. He hasn't filmed anything. Nice, D-Rock. D-Rock's throwing down, Andy. It's not getting nice around here. First I went off on the fucking bullshit ass, loser ass, no chance ever winning troll that was in here. Now D-Rock throwing down on the Portuguese wonder. Chicks trying to get married. Shit's going down here on the delayed flight. Los Angeles excited for the 25 people that are going to win the contest tomorrow. Secret event that you're going to be a part of. Looking forward to it. Looking forward to it. He gave you a touche. He has respect for you filming. The web show. The webby show. I know you love it, D-Rock. Stop. Everybody knows you're a bad guy, D-Rock. You play a good guy on camera, but we know he's a bad guy, Ty. He's the worst guy we know. I'm doing as I'm going. I'm going to sign off right now and go into the last post I posted for the LA Secret event and I'm going to go pick six random winners right now. So if you haven't done that yet, go do that. All real, real, living to them. Wasn't nothing, never giving to them. I don't know what's wrong with everybody. Want to be El Chapo? Got a killer on the mic. Never caught a body. No job, but got money. Who he Tommy? I know he's down in the hole. I know he's out on parole, man. I say the whole world is a prison. They can try, but don't let him get your soul. Getting fast money is a rush. Getting clean money is a dream. She said getting money is a must. I said, baby girl, I need you on the team. We've been getting to it ever since. Still a pillow just to get the scent. Put a ring on it. Don't ask what he spent. Put that thing on it. Don't ask what he meant. Corky still got me stressing. Take my advice. I'm a living lesson. Graduated school. Niggle who you testing? I look at the hard times. It's a blessing. I'm walking that real road. Keep a heated, get real cold. All that talking, it get real old. Never been a fool. This is real gold. I be dropping jewels on them. R.I.P. to fall and drop a deuce on them. Put a bead on. I get loose on it. So much control. I just juice on it like. I be swerving in and out of lanes. Dark cloud in and out the rain. For the good time, appreciate the pain. When the smoke clears, I remain. What you think we try more like? The police planting evidence. So why you think we lie more like? Why you think we die more like? I be in the zone. I'm a fuck around the killer zone. If you thinking about it, don't. I be on that shit to break some killer zone. I just want a world tour. So sick and it's no cure. N****s shoot cuz they got no pause. Everybody want to be a dope boy. I don't want to sell dope no more. Just a lot of tickets to a lot of shows. Get high cause I got a lot of lows. Sly, nigga. That's just high goals. Take the punches and just roll with them. I don't sit around. I'm a go getter. This is my soul, nigga. I never tell what I told n****s.
