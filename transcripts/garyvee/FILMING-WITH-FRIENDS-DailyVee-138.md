Talk to me, help me, I'm not letting you This is why I'm doing the Colin show Because the old show I would have done your tweet I would have answered it, I would have felt great I would have done it and I could feel like I almost got you there But I'm telling you right now, I don't think you're gonna do it And if you're gonna do it, you're gonna do it half ass So help me here, listen I'm on your team So help me here understand What you're scared of Tell me, tell me the truth Yeah, okay, so for me Like just because of like You know like pedigree and like How much education and like They've sacrificed like having a safe job So I can do what I want like I don't want to like Disappoint if that makes sense Let me help you here, yeah Disappoint for 18 months and then make them feel good again Okay Just tell them, tell them Listen, I love you for that, means you're appreciative And you love your parents, tell them the truth Start with that, I don't want to Like either your parents love you And will respond to you or they love you But they're so deep into structure And it's been their whole religion, their whole life That they're incapable even though they love you To break through and see it a different way The problem is, it's your fucking life And it's gonna end up one way or the other Hey Next What we can win here is If we can do a little bit more insights Digging into the heavy users Or the customers of this product And segment them From a psychographic standpoint Or from a demographic standpoint This is exactly where we can Tell our story which is However you guys creatively interpret the right 1-2-3 minute video We're gonna compete against one video That's 30 seconds, that tries to tell a story I want to walk in with a strategy That has three videos You know, obviously I want to be empathetic If you have to come up with six different commercials For her to munch on That, you know, you're not gonna be You're not gonna be able to storyboard and everything Like, you get as far as you can But minimally six manifesto, right? Like, German woman with two kids Walks into, you know, shopping center And then flash dancing happens And every baby on earth is cured Yep, I got it I don't feel confident that I can make a 30 second commercial Yeah, I mean 100% That's it? That's what everybody is Like, that's the part I don't think That's my reality Like, I can't get my juices going Because I don't know what that commercial is It's so hard I think more videos are Over indexing on social media Not brand, just in general Than any commercials And I think if you do that behavior You've created your upside Marcus is one of the smartest guys that works here It's why he's in the office of CO My point of view He also pushes back extremely well And just anytime I can have with him To see if we're crossing our T's and I's together He's in the trenches He's always had a good cadence Of accepting, forming, pushing back And forming And so those, you know, that seven minutes Is what most people spend an hour and a half On going through a deck and that's how we do it here I have a fairly big update on Can somebody give me any details on the Snapchat update? What the hell am I doing? It was all up to you It was really nice Send it to Gary, send it to Andy Yeah Ask Gary if it's like your first time And then you're like, what's up with that? And then you're like, what's up with that? And then you're like, what's up with that? Ask Gary if it's like your first time Make one very cool also Like that That was pretty fucking quick That was very quick You are quick You're quick on the court now Don't you know how to take compliments? I've noticed that when I razz That was a quick move I snapped and you like, that was fast I'm not strong I'm real strong by the way I want to continue crushing YouTube From there I have this whole other world That's just like, dealing with opportunity right now Alex has been talking to my main guy I've built out a team, so I have an Alex now Who's just like keeping my world in order Which is incredible quality of life Has gone up like a million percent I hit 4x30 under 30 Yeah dog But all these big things that I'm getting up to Like maybe really high on demand My social clout and perception is like, clear up here right now And I've got like, the medium good following And whatever else I have a medium good following and tons of social perception Clout right now I'm so over on brand compared to following Yeah exactly That's why I'm at and that's the direction I want to keep going I don't want to be making funny videos for the rest of my life So I'm going to keep doing Snapchat I do like one every other day I do a daily YouTube video I start to decide a YouTube channel, I have a guy that runs And edits my YouTube, my DRock And I think everybody else is using talent as a north star And you're making a very smart decision About the wealth I'm creating versus what other people are doing Exactly So now let me give you a really good piece of advice Tomorrow, get your shit together on Instagram Okay Here's why, I just believe in it the most from a tension standpoint And I know that you in four hours Can fucking figure out all the right things To make it way way way bigger Here, this guy, Gary B I'm high five there I love it So Gary is the reason I first started my very first business Which worked, thank you And the reason I continue to crush it So Gary, all my fans These guys right here They're huge into chasing their passions Like lawnmower business people Fitting a street in college, whatever else Got any advice for them Look, I mean first of all if you're following this phenomenal man You have figured out a ton of stuff But I'll give you a couple things, I really believe in patience So many of you are youngsters And I have thousands of youngsters hitting me up every day Like how do I get this, how do I get this Patience, Shawn you've put in so much work for such a long time now It's true And so if you want great things All great things take time And so one of the reasons I started DailyVee Was to show people it's fucking work I don't know if we're not the cars beeping for this But like it's work my friends Patience and work And then driving from that passion spot You can win this game Hi, it's great to officially meet you That was fun, thank you for doing that Thank you so much for having me Real pleasure, sit, sit, sit But if you remember anything from this meeting It's think about Three, five, seven and ten year terms For sure Right, so like build your snapchat Cause right now everybody's like snapchat's dead What if they make a feature tomorrow that's not dead Right, like build your Where's your Facebook at Shit Exactly, and it's more important than any of them It's the only one that's guaranteed to be around So like do you have a blog Do you have an email newsletter I have an email newsletter I have a ton of emails Notice how weird I am right Like I'm sitting at the top right Yet I don't have anywhere close to the biggest numbers on anything Right But it's the collective right That helps me win and not being good Like it's just the collective Proper, it's actually having a business It's actually like I don't have the most followers But I also get paid 125,000 dollars to give a speech Right And I've created everything What if Instagram fucks up All the other stuff Do not be at the mercy of a platform 100% Thank you so much Awesome, great to see you guys Thank you I don't want it to be like Romance And I have a lot of everybody By the way It's 100% of my day Based on romance So I'm never mad when romance hits my face I'm not mad I'm not mad I'm not mad I'm not mad I'm not mad I'm not mad I'm not mad So I'm never mad when romance hits my face It's all I have in front of my face I just want to set that tone And then very honestly With my new found partnership With Ryan who I think is great at selling too I'm like fuck this Good night Good night It is my full belief that every product Will be smart eventually not just our phones And I believe that Even more importantly as I think about Where AI, AR Smartification of our society goes Everything that brings value to consumers Is interesting to me Not just the current thing like social media So I'm always going to bet on Where the attention of the world is going Where speed can be picked up And I definitely believe that smart Products were one of those places So VaynerMedia is one of the Early preferred partners Of Amazon's Alexa Skills platform This is a game changer in a lot of ways A lot of people may not think this is a big deal But in four or five years they will I think in 2009, 10 people didn't realize How big of a deal of being an early partner On the Facebook platform was And so I'm very proud of our company And very proud of Patrick who runs our VaynerSmart Very lean team of one, two, three Incredibly Proud of him and Super excited for our brands to get the benefit Of Amazon's skills that I think Absolutely be disproportionate If there's a first-mover advantage And you win a skill that people really enjoy And have hundreds of thousands of people Learn how to do push-ups Or eat this specific dish Or learn how to drink wine Whatever it may be I think it's going to be an enormous opportunity And I'm excited about honing my skills deeper In the Alexa skills world And voice activation and things of that nature And I'm really excited about it I'm going to tell them Yo, what's up dude? How you doing? I'm good, I'm good dude. I love you Good to see you So fun man. I love those things Oh my god, I fucking love them. Great to see you man I've been so looking forward to this It was the first conference I ever went to I was so pumped I come up to him, he's in the corner A bunch of people in front of him And I'm like, hey Kevin, yeah I do this wine thing And my show once was on the first page of dig Why do you have your badge on right now?
