## Transcript
Hello? Hello, this is Gary Vaynerchuk. Oh my god, I'm so happy to talk to you. Oh my god. Yo, I started my morning. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Romance, a girl, a little bit here. What's your name? Cause we're gonna be legends. Gonna get their attention. What we're doing here ain't just scary. It's about to be legendary. They're gonna be legends. Yeah! Got this feeling in our souls we can't breathe. This is the last Monday morning of your life. Hey guys, it's me, Gary. Actually, perfect. These guys, this one and this one, just came in here and said, you know, hey, this episode is so iconic, you should chop it up into three episodes. So this is not something I want to do. I'm blaming these two characters right here. And so we're gonna do this three-part episode. Did you have the audio? Am I going to like? Oh, is that what it is? Good. All right, we'll see what you think. I've been driving in circles just so I don't have to get out of the car. Absolutely intrigued by this Gary Vee guy. Hey Dana, it's Gary Vee. Thank you so much for the love. Hope you have the best power together. What did the last girl say on the radio sound? We couldn't hear it on the... The last call in from Joe was, I was driving and Gary was making me super uncomfortable because he was saying, stop complaining, but I love complaining and I live my life complaining and it just hit me. And it was amazing, it was just amazing. She was like, he's right. And crap. It's easy to complain. Complaining is the easy way out. Negativity is the easy way out. That's why people don't realize what I'm doing is so hard because I do it so effortlessly. Because it comes naturally to me. It's not because I'm so cool. Because I got lucky from a hard wiring standpoint and then I was self-aware about the luck and then I put in the work to make myself the best version of it. And that, what? 100%. You're lucky if you're gorgeous, but if you break up, if you eat like crap and don't take care of yourself and do drugs and drink alcohol, you'll not look gorgeous. You're lucky if you're 6'11 and can sprint like a gazelle, but if you don't work on your craft and you work on your outside jumper, if you don't work on your intensity and your endurance, you won't be an NBA player. So yes, I got lucky that I can win the game of life and entrepreneurship, but I put in the work for the last 25 years minimally and maybe even longer to be the best version of myself at this thing. Sissy. Wow, look at that. I get it. Like, I can feel it there. I mean, it's so fun for you to like, because it's actually something you listen to, right? I know it's a... I know it's a... I know it's a... I know it's a... I know it's a... I know it's a... I know it's a... I mean, there was a point there where I was like, listen to the Gary Vee show. I'm sorry, we're here at Alvis today. Yeah. Everybody knows. Everybody knows. You got it. That's exactly... Of course, well, that's the whole... Yeah. Because it's a brand, right? And so, yes, I think about brand in a world where I think most digital marketers think about sales. Well, I came up with something very smart a year ago. We started something called Daily Vee, which is my daily vlog on YouTube. When you heard me earlier yelling DRock, that's my whole film world. David Rock... He's actually sitting... We are in an inter-report right now. I'm looking at him. He's filming me right now. So, I'm documenting. I'm not creating. And then from that content, if I say something clever in this interview, it may make the Daily Vee, and then my team will email me and say, hey, you said this quote. Do you want to make that a quote card, a quote image on Instagram? I'll say yes. Then they'll send me a bunch of pictures and posts every day, because it's my image over a quote here. Then they'll listen to this whole episode and maybe it becomes a blog post and my writers will ask me a couple more questions and I'll take all my words and create an article. We'll take one clip of this for 31 seconds and it'll become a mini video for Facebook and YouTube. So, what I've done is I'm spending all of my time and none of my time on my brand. So, yep. So, when I was a young kid, I made a lot of money selling baseball cards and comic books and toys. Then I started working for my dad's business and I was making, you know, when I was 22 to 28, I was making $35,000 to $55,000 a year. But I had no expenses. I didn't go on vacations. I didn't buy fancy things. So, I saved my money. I saved my money. I saved my money. And then when the, you know, I had hundreds of thousands of dollars. I didn't have millions. I had hundreds of thousands of dollars because I didn't spend anything. And then I started making $100,000 a year and $150,000 a year. And by the time I was 33, 34 when I had that opportunity, I still not bought a home. I was still in an apartment. I was 33 years old and I was renting. And because I was saving cash to go on the offense. And I knew something would happen one day and did. And so, when I had a chance to invest in those companies, I put hundreds of thousands of dollars, not millions, but those hundreds made millions, made tens of millions. And so, that's it. Nothing crazy. Nothing, I didn't have any crazy, crazy advantage. There's a lot of people that make $55,000 a year when they're 23. The problem is they go to Coachella and they want to buy a watch and they want to buy a BMW. And I didn't. So, I ate shit for 13 years and then I had a moment and I struck. And that moment changed my financial outcome. Little bit of a curve ball this morning was going from Newark to Chattanooga for our Chattanooga Holiday Party. But that was canceled. So now I'm flying to Atlanta connecting and then driving for two hours to Chattanooga sucks. Just because I'm missing out on three or four meetings that I had to have in Chattanooga. Super inefficient. But curve balls happen. That's how we do it. So, that's what's going on. All good. Have a good conversation with my sister today. It's good stuff. Super proud of my brother last night. My brother AJ was honored as Man of the Year at the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation. So, I'm very proud of him and I love him very much. And I'm proud that he's come out and talked about his disease and bringing awareness to it and hopefully find a cure for a very tough disease. Obviously for some of you guys know that was the main reason he left. That's the reason he left VaynerMedia. It's an emotional family day. It's great. I love him very much. And now it's off to Atlanta. I'm in Newark Airport just about to board a flight originally to Chattanooga. Cancelled. Now I have to go to Atlanta and then drive for two hours. So, that's that. So, that's what's going on. So, would love to answer some of your questions. Would love to bring you some value. I'm... I don't want to call people. I'm more into this live right now. You want to do the call show? Yeah. Okay, I'll call one person. What up Italy? Hello? Hello, this is Gary Vaynerchuk. Oh my god, I'm so happy to talk to you. Oh my god. Yo, I saw it my mom. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Romance girl a little bit here. What's your name? Josh Smith. Josh, how are you? I don't understand. Instagram and Snapchat and Twitter these places, the best ad product in the world is Facebook. And so, and then Google AdWords. And so, for a conversion based thing. But Facebook can convert and build brand. But Instagram content is fire. And if you know how to use hashtags, oh actually, you know what? I have a concept. I'm actually going to go off of Instagram live right now and go on the new Facebook live, Twitter live. Watch this. I'm going to give the most tangible great piece of advice. This is for you brother and for everybody who's watching. I'm going to hang up now on Instagram. I'm going over to Twitter. I'm doing a Twitter live and I'm going to go look at the trending topics on Twitter. And I'm going to pick one that's trending. And I'm going to go live. Which will then make that tweet show up first. And I'm going to build awareness to audiences that don't know who I am. Alright. I'll see you guys on Twitter. Going to Twitter, it's GaryVee there. If you don't follow me there. If you don't have a Twitter sign up for it. Don't be a dick. This is literally how my brain works. Just if you really like again I keep saying it over and over. The reason DailyVee is going to end up being the biggest piece of content. Ask GaryVee is better. I get it for the people that are students. And that's what you are. But if you really, really are wired in the way where you understand DailyVee being better. It means you look at, you're more like me. There's no one but plenty of people are more successful in me being students. If you're a student you like Ask GaryVee. Because it says boo boo boo boo. But if you really understand and watch what I do and how I do it. And observe me and watch me in my environment. And that's why we edit so lightly. You know you're just trying to put together something proper. But we don't edit because we need you to see like I'm in the middle of something. I think of something. I don't put it off. I don't ponder for another day. The end. Here we go. Hit search. Thursday's thoughts is it confuses me when. Thursday thoughts. Both are interesting to me. I'm going to go Thursday thoughts. I'm going to hit that. Now it's got it in there. I'm going to hit here. I'm going to go live. It's telling me now you can go live. Okay got it. I assume. Twitter. Live. Queue. And. Hey. Now what we may learn here is that by doing this I'm getting more awareness from people that have never heard of me before. See if that works. Because again on Instagram that's my community. And there's no shareability in there. So there's no discovery mechanism. Whereas right now here we go. People are showing up. Very nice. Nice and fast. 440 470 489 516 they've seen us. 543. 599 609 609 Hey guys. Hey guys. Hey guys. And we're back and we're back and we're back and we're back and we're back and we're here and we're here Denver and house from Instagram. Everybody who's from Instagram say from Instagram. Oh Tyler. Oh my. Calm. Yeah calm. Yeah calm. No no no no no. Oh. Mark. It's gonna kill that too. I try to put on like Do Not Disturb. And instead I put a. Oh. In my life. That would work right? Would that work? You think if I do not disturb the calls won't come through? No no no. The call. That's what happened. I didn't have that on. That's it. Alright. From Twitter Live. But I by the way everybody who's read. Let's go on a retweet story. This retweeting is first of all house. So this is the thing that I'm interested in which is if I don't ask you for money or for courses or all that bullshit. But instead what I'm really asking for is your attention which I'm so humbled by and then for your word of mouth which then brings more people in so that they don't go and waste money on bullshit internet marketing fucking bullshit motherfuckers. Then we can really do something massive. And I'm fascinated by that. Look at all these retweets. It's interesting. Some are retweet and some are shared. I think that's where the periscope difference is. Look at this. Look at this. Retweet retweet retweet retweet like these guys are the best. Alright. Let me catch up on my world a little bit. I love you guys. I'll be back on shortly. My flight's delayed. It's been a long day already. See ya. I've got a new idea which I like. Cody Gardner brought it up. 31. He just tweeted I need a sign book. I'll send you my signed Joe Namath Jersey if you give me your sign book. Done trade completed. I'm now trading my sign books or signed other things. Things I like are Randy the Macho Man Savage and Wrestling in general Nix and Jets and anything really weird and rare and cool.
