One final question that I have. What is your day actually look like? Sabas, I've been telling you. I put in work, you don't want to dream. I got the ethic that works, no, I can get it like me. I'm being a booze, lose some sleep. I got the ethic that works, no, I can get it like me. The other route we can go, the other route we can go is level this up, make it more valuable to the people and subsidize it. I put in work, you don't want to dream. I got the ethic that works. So I call this meeting because I have this ambition that I've not been able to accomplish yet, which is do a quarterly or two times a year, all hands on, town hall, where all it really is is one massive Q and A session with me. You're trying to make decisions that are going to benefit you. And you do that by being selfless. Correct. It's why I win. That's an economy that's hard to grasp. It's why I'm going to be all time great. And so I think the same with, when it comes to someone talking to you, it's like, cool, I want to be about this company because this company is about this company and it's about Honey Empire. So I need to be selfless. But I want people to be selfish. I'm comfortable with that. I don't expect, listen, if you got the distributions of the profit of VaynerMedia directly to your bank account, then you could be selfless. Do you know how much fun I make fun of my friends when they tell me things like, how do you get your employees to work as hard as you? I'm like, you don't. What the fuck are you talking about? You work for them. Right? I get that. Yeah, man, look, we're going to win because we're even just having these conversations. And it's one person in here moved 30% in their score of this place because of this conversation. And then you build on it. Right? And then that leads to six months from now, something happening, and you come and talk to me. And then the way I react to it changes everything for you. That's where we most win. The reason I want the one-on-one is because what happens out of the one-on-one. That's where we're building trust. It's all actions. That's where we're winning. I love people who just want to stay in their lane, maybe get one more or two more promotions, have insane work-life balance, work nine to five, check out a here every day at five, do their work that's valuable. There's always an exchange. I'm not going to tell you how to live your life. I just want to provide a good trade for you for that life. A place you want to work, a good place, the right... You know what I mean? I'm very... And by the way, things change. You're 24 and you want to be the CEO of VaynerMedia. You're 31 and love one kid, and you love taking her to soccer practice, and you're just not willing to work 18 hours a day to be the CEO of VaynerMedia. It's all good for me. We need them all. I don't want to be in charge of your ambition. I just want to give you more than you give me so that you stay here forever. You know? It's important. That's real life. That lacks ideological POVs, and that is just practical. Thanks for hanging. Hang me up if you need me. Awesome. Hi, I'm here with Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO of VaynerMedia, investor, Jack of many, many things, and host of the wildly popular Ask Gary Vee show. Thanks for being here today. Thanks for having me. You're a pride global. Thank you. So your entrepreneurship goes way back to lemonade stands, baseball cards, and it turns out you're going to be in 2047, the owner of the Jets. That's the plan. Is that right? That's right. So you say that it's going to be 30 years due to your behavior. Yes. I once heard Tim Ferriss say that someone had told him, what if you were to condense that business plan, that lifetime business plan into a year? What would that look like for you? It wouldn't look like anything. It's so funny. I answer every question always. I'm sure they're already laughing. I couldn't even comprehend that. It's just not my wiring. That's like asking me, hey Gary, how do you start flying like a human being? It's impossible. I'd have to become a gambler. Right? I'd have to take all my assets and do something crazy. So I'm a marathon runner. Marathon runners don't win sprints. You know? They just don't. They don't have the body shape for it. They don't have the mentality. They don't train like that. It doesn't even feel good when you ask me that. And I genuinely believe that's actually the reverse of most entrepreneurs. I think a lot of fake entrepreneurs want to do this for the watches and the private jets and the champagne bottles and the boats. Fast fix. I just don't have it in me. Hi, how are you? I mean guys, it's been unbelievable to watch entrepreneurship impact the whole world, but especially athletes and really artists, I think, just really thinking so much smarter. It's amazing to think like 15 years ago for you guys, being interested in this stuff was far less than it is today. People are really thinking about off the field and somewhere around fourth grade, I realized I was more likely to buy the jets than play for them. Everything that you are. So like, what other interests do you have? And you may not have any others. It doesn't really matter as long as it's your truth. It has to be your truth. Hands up. Two, three. Beautiful. That's good. I like that. Did dude get back to us? Yeah. And every 10 months, they're all supporting you. Because you know, and what about the career from social, from the standpoint of what happened on YouTube, what happened on Instagram, what happened on Twitter, what happened, like how did it, give me the narrative. I don't know when I need your help now. This is what we're doing. Vayne the water. Hopefully this is going to make you make good investments. Smarter. You get smarter. That's all right man. Good to see you. How are you doing man? I'm good. Good to see you again. How was London? Good. Since I did, since I've been, I mean, but since the last time I saw you, I've been to five countries. Tell me about what, how many understand where your guys' world is at? Like what, tell me about your career right now. What do I do now? So they were like, come on the Gary Vee show. Because you know, Gary, basically this is his life every single day. This is what episode 139. 172? No, no 172. 171. Right? 173. So 173 is now my lucky number. Okay, so 173. I bet you the pick three. If you're in a state where one, 174. This is going to be 174? What just came out today? 173. Came out today? Yes. All right, so 174 is your lucky number. So 174 is my lucky number. Let me get it over here. If your state gets 174 and it's pick three today, send that in. We got gifts for you. So once I decided back in 09 that it was going to be a pillar of our society, I started really, really understanding the business rationale. The bottom line is, and it's tried and true, it happened long before hip hop. When you are yourself and you do not waver, you will win if you're good enough. We'll be in touch. Yeah. See that, it'll be right here. Excuse me. Oh man. Much love there. All right, let's do it. I have some of my kids putting on Instagram. It turned into brands reaching out. I went down this whole path that I never even knew existed. You're like, wait, people will pay me to put this product in a picture with my child? Exactly. Something that I love doing and people started paying me for it. And I was like, all right, this is amazing. This I like. This I like. Yeah, this is really cool. Okay. So I've been pursuing that and worked with a lot of good brands. I've been reaching out to some of my dream brands I ended up working with within a year, which I never thought imagined. Just by DMing them? I put together like a media kit, sent them an email. Good. Showed them some of my sample work and they gave me a shot a couple of times for free and then I eventually ended up getting paid. Say that one more time? A couple of times for free and then I had to prove myself and then they had to prove me. One more time? Yep. Had to work for free and then prove you so. This conversation pisses me off. The amount of people that don't realize that free is the gateway to paid. Absolutely. I mean, it's the three of ours lives. It's the audacity to think that you're not being compensated when you're trying to get a shot in a world where there's a lot of photographers taking pictures of their kids. Supply and demand motherfuckers. That one copy you did? Oh, she's... Can I... Let me get a copy. Thanks man. How you been? Really good. It's really good. Music is hell just like you, man. On this episode, the legend stops by. Miguel, to answer your question, I've now had a career for 20 plus years. 20 plus years at every minute was running one of two companies. Wine Library or VaynerMedia. There was never a day in my life where I didn't have something that I called the 80% of what I do. That's right. That's exactly what you were saying. I call it the meat, the main dish. You can go and have side dishes and if your meat, if your steak is perfect, you'll always be able to absorb the losses because they're smaller losses and then when something over here becomes bigger, you can turn that into the main part and that could become the steak too many people have all side dishes and no steak. What's that? Wanna see Tony? Yeah. Big dude. I've set a monster meeting. Monster fucking fired up. I've been quiet for less minute because I've been sending emails about how excited I am about it. Nothing like a good client meeting. Real good. I want to do it with you and so I'm willing to do it for less but at the same... Brand. Brand. I do things that are not scalable that are about brand and that's why I think I'm winning. First I did a lot of things before I took it over. So I spent years chipping away at him trusting me so that he could give me as much room as possible to do my thing. So sometimes kids go to university, never work in the business or do different things and then they just show up as an adult and so you're starting from the beginning. So what's your situation? So you're in that situation? Yes. So had you worked in the business before? I've been around but I haven't read that. So that's the part I don't know. I don't know how much all you want is air cover to do what you believe in and all the parent wants is their own balance of how much they believe and don't believe in the kid, how much they believe and don't believe in the direction and how much they still have in their tank. We finally figured out how to bring value to small businesses and so that's a scoop. Oh by the way, I've got another idea. I'd love to get this big. Guys, you know how Disney and Zappos do this thing? I've been thinking about doing a 12 hour digital media detox tour at VaynerMedia for $10,000 ahead where you come in at 9am, breakfast, there's a lunch keynote, some days I'm here, some days I'm not but basically we go through all our disciplines and we basically do a one day consulting sesh for 10K where it's all based around the Vayner world. You tour here, different days you meet executives. Like you know, I don't know if you guys know this but we have old people too. Like we have them. Really thinking about this concept like Disney and Zappos does where you spend 12 hours at VaynerMedia for $10,000 ahead, I really think we can make it valuable when I look at what people are doing for like these $10,000 offs like really trying to figure this out. So if you're interested in 10K, see a bunch of you already answering that you are, send me an email. I promise you you'll be the first people before I announce it officially that you'll be in the first beta run. When you're tug of warring, why do you want to dig into the family business? The only reason is because I'm great for my parents but I think they've done and it's the potential of how big it is. You can explode it, okay? And what's pulling you on the non-profit? Non-profit is because there are so many needs in the world to provide it to. But normally it's taught to me, you do it to others but you don't even see it. So I think there's two debates, equal. So, legacy huh? Love it. Yeah. Is it 50-50? Yeah, right this second. Non-profit. You should do the non-profit. You'll just regret that you don't. Me neither. Meeting's over. It's just obvious. It seemed like that's what it was for me. Like that's where I thought you were going to go and if you answered 50-50 I was literally going to tell you to flip a coin and never look back. But I love that you answered 60-40 because that's what I felt was happening. Just gut, that would have been my guess. I wish I wrote it down. It would have been cool for the camera. You should do it. What if you're truly 50? I hate people sitting on shit and I think there's times when there's 50-50. I have it. I don't flip a coin. I just literally just say to myself this is stupid and I just go. So there is time for me to do it. So there is times for 50-50. The problem is 98% of people are sitting on 50-50 their whole fucking life. Which means they're 00. So when you're 50-50 you get one day and anything else is you're just fucking sitting and bullshitting. So fucking flip a coin to pick the one you never looked back. But if you're truly 60-40 don't spend any more time. Don't underestimate speed and action. Moving is important. Because you can change the course. You can stop doing the... If you don't give a fuck about what people think you can do everything. I know. That's why I told you. So good. Go do the fucking NGO. You'll never regret. You'll never think back. The lumber company is going to be there. Dad's doing this thing. And after four months if you don't like the way it tastes or you're like fuck this. You see what I mean? But the quicker you start the quicker you do. I'm telling you that. I've already started. Good. Do it. Go all in though. No more brain power to like should I do the lumber thing. Just go all in and then do and watch. Be in it and watch yourself from above. And just move. Constantly move. Fucking change shit. I gotta go. Thank you. You got it. And there's something quick to the audience. You guys watch a lot. You guys watch his daily movies. He's great. But he didn't do the day-care-and-treat execution. So get out there and actually do shit. That's it. Cool. I'm worried I might miss. Take a step back just to highlight this. They coming up to me worried I might miss. Can't wait until I'm ready. Build your high-li-ritch. Chilling in a fantasy with my sci-fi bitch. But she just feel where Wi-Fi is. She's superficial. She ain't coming with me cause it's lonely at the top of all these high-rises. And I don't sleep. Always rock open islands. Sick and tired of chasing the horizon.
