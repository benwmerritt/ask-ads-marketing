11 What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Hey, how are you? Good to see you. Good to see you. How have you been? Great. How are you? Good. Good. How are you? Such a pleasure. The whole castle collapses. You get the one wrong politician who wants to make an agenda. I'm not even going down that path. Now, I assume that that means what it always means which is Instagram obviously has its policies. Influencers on Instagram should be a piece of cake because their policies are in place there and accepted by your company to do that. I don't know if you guys are thinking of using animation. Animation is one of those great videos. Meaning animation? No. I mean, to me, I wasn't thinking about it yes or no, but if it's a no, there's so much we could be doing. I agree. Including if we really want him to come to life, let's go pay for the costume and have him run around the world. Yep. I want to, I just know, I know exactly what to do. The only thing is they're speaking to the 19, 17, 22, 28 year olds and I want to be smart about who we pick and how we do it. Such a funny conversation. It's funny because this is all we ever do and it works, but it's the ambition of my company to get people, this is unbelievable. The level of importance this project has for me is enormous. I actually think like transcended our business. We exploded the growth of that brand. It is the **** now and it was all because we took money from TV and put it into influencers on Instagram and Snapchat. It just happened. It just works. So, can you win with one when everybody else had eight? You sure can if you believe that seven was wasted. Right. Yeah. You know? Basically that's the entire thesis of the next 20 years of my life. Why do I have the audacity to think I'm going to buy these things and take them from 20 million in sales to 100 because that's what I've done in the businesses that I've run and because I really think so much money is being wasted because I think the nuances of interpretation like Dunk would never consider this influence for him in the way he looks at it. This is like mainstream, you know, but for our world over here, right? This is so influence compared to me like mainstream like commercial don't even exist. It's like saying have you seen a dinosaur? Who have more of a psych background like went to school for psychology. I think I'm the most talented psych person on earth and I think it comes from myself. And so, I don't want to become a data nerd. I love the idea of you feeding me things like so the fact that you've just said that sentence were set. Feed me things that you know I'll react to like hey this study on gratitude said these four seven eight nine ten things. Right. And we'll just jam. Okay. So things that bounce off of you from a pure data perspective or a mix of this is the give me all the big intense. Yeah. Watch something I put out and be like hey did you know like you know it's like a hey did you know kind of thing. Gary, meet Priscilla. Priscilla, how are you? Thank you so much for the interest and hello. And if you dig into the details towards the end I'd break out hey this is what I was thinking. Yep. My six years of brand experience is what I think the split could be. Yep. But as part of the pitch and part of the ask is for you guys to come back to the recommendations and how to break out that. Awesome. I couldn't ask for anything more. Right. And then and the truth is that is the most interesting because our belief at Vayner and I think we're very different than the market that a lot of working media dollars in the digital space are being thrown in the garbage through a lot of the things that people are doing around programmatic or banner or pre-rolls that could be dramatically more maximized in a social environment. And since since since part of this pitch is for us to bring what we would do if you know I always think if I own the company what we would do that's all I could ask for and so then that gives me the freedom to give you our best at bat. It's too crazy but it's all like stuff that's like I'm kind of into his his the million dollar man in wrestling's line of everybody's got a price is still one of my favorite all time like cultural like. How often do you have to do bat plays? A lot and I hate it and I'm not good at it. I you know one of the reasons you know historically this company is going to be better than Wine Library was I wasn't good at delivering vinegar. I was much better delivering honey. Has happened is I've gotten better at it. It's been very monumental. You have to be able to be able to both. But what I will say is even when I would say hey I don't like the way you're not letting you I would it's honey with vinegar right. It's like hey I love you at a macro. You've got to fix this and tell me if I'm wrong. Here's my observation and then when you have a winner they'll be like you know they're pumped because you gave them the honey they feel safe because they feel like they're safe in a macro and then the per I'm going back to this exact example. So he's like yeah you know that's just kind of it's tough to break that pattern. That people got undermined in the companies I've worked with before because the junior person will go over and they just blindly fire this senior person. I'm so 360 you know we take forever to make those decisions here. And this is the jumping off point for our next chapter together. No more viral videos together and trying to convince people Facebook was important. I think they believe that now. Yeah. How are you? Real pleasure. How are things? Good. Good. Like you look if you're looking backwards it's over. Who gives a fuck that you got nothing but time and you've got it. You spend on being mad about anything is wasted. I'm mad about everything and I spend no time on it. You're going to win my man. I'm telling you. You know what I mean? Right? I'm telling you. Listen I've had a little bit of time with you. The thing you've got nobody can take from you. All right. All right. So we'll really really break but let's do a late dinner and then we'll go out or something or like or like. Up to London. Going to make some magic happen. Across the pond. 24 hours of hustle.
