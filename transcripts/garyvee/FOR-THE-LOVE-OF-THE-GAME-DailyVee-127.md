That's how I do. That's how you do it here. That's what you do in your life. That's it. How are you? You're good, bro, man. You're just a man, man. Thank you, man. Move like a man. Thank you. I run a business. You do? An agency, a social media agency. So we help underarmor, Toyota, do all the Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat shit. You like that, man? I do a bunch of things, man. Good luck to you, man. Keep up the good work. Bless you, man. All right, man. Stay well. Love you. Moral, that story is you could be picking up 5,000 people a day on Instagram. But if you don't take the time and say hello and put just one person on, that's only going to last for so long. What up, my man? What's up, man? How you doing? How you doing, my man? Good to see you. Oh, Mamet. Mamet, it's my man. What's up, everybody? It's Gary Vee. Wake up every morning with Breakfast Club only on Revolt. You got it. Thank you. What's up, man? It's a pleasure. Real pleasure, man. Real pleasure, man. Woke that ass up. That's it? Yeah. Wake that ass up. That was the best part. Cool, man. Thank you, brother. Gary, I wanted to have you do one more job. How are you? I'm doing really good. Doing well. You know what? You're doing really well. Thank you. What's up, my man? How you doing? I saw you at CS. You were sitting with some guys. I was with Dan Gilbert. Sitting right behind you. I was calling your name. Then I got pulled. Then I looked. Then I didn't see you. Then I had to go. I was like, fuck, where did Mamet go? It's all right. It's great to see you. That was a great meeting. That's what got me big. I never go on anything. I went there with Tom Hanks and Howard Stringer. We was head of Sony. Yes. And this is probably 10 years. We was playing with the show, watching. It was when it was really an electronic show. Now it's just a business, see, man. I love it. Good to be a success. Dr. Ross, can I grab you for a second? Yeah. I have a quick promo tune in video. Said that you're going to be on the show. I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. I love the kicks, man. Good to see you. Life is good? How's your little man? He's good. Got five. They're all good. How far are you flying the jets? I think I'm very far and very close. So let me explain. I love patience. I got a lot of things in place on third base that I haven't cashed it on. There's a lot of things I can do if tomorrow it has to happen. Call in all those favors, cash in all those chips, sell all that. You know, my company just did a huge transaction that valued the company at a $400 million valuation that puts my net worth at $200 million of what I own of that. I've got all this paper money on Facebook. I can cash it all in. It's on the stock market. I've got private money and Uber and other things that I can convert to somebody else. I've got pieces. But Woody's not selling. And the truth is, I don't have the $2.7 billion. I'm nowhere close to that. And I don't want to go round up a lot of people to be a partner. I want to run shit. I need to win a Super Bowl. So the good news is, he's still young. I wish him health every single day. I would love to have another 15 to 20 years to make the play. But the truth is, the journey to try to buy them, that's the game. That's the game. That's how I feel the same way. That's the game. Last night, Richie Saffin and Boyd, we go to the studio. You know why I love hip hop the most? Because people that are really in it, they work. I'm in corporate America. I'm in Silicon Valley. Actually, that's why I fell in love with Silicon Valley. Those nerds, they worked like my hip hop friends did. I'm like, wait a minute. These kids are coding at 2 in the morning? Right? Like going to the studio last night in midtown at 12 and watching everybody work. They've used to work. He's working. They're working. Oh, you were there with Young Berg and everybody? I was with Berg last night. Oh, he was on the show with you, right? Yeah. And you know why? It motivates me. Because in corporate America, when I go sit with CMOs and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, they don't work like this. They're done at six. I got Gary Vee. Always a pleasure, man. Love you, man. Yes, sir. Love you too, brother. It's a real pleasure. Pleasure. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you, my man. See you around. I'm about to use the link in bio right now. One pass that I'm about to sell and then the other two I'm keeping because you know... I'm really looking at all of them. We're talking about thousands of people whose life is better now. Like crazy shit. That's a good way to set up the voicemail. We can have people call and leave questions. Oh, that's a cool. I love that. I do like the voice. Yeah, whatever. We can do this too. I'll get her. All right, my man. Stay well. Talk to you. All right. Bye, darling. Thank you. Bye, guys. I'm happy and I feel guilty about my happiness almost so much so that I just want to give it to everybody else. See you tonight. See you tonight. And let that be a lesson for the next 50 years that we jammed together. I'm sure you've heard of this. The day after I stopped doing Wine Library TV I did it for five and a half years. I did it five days a week. In five years I did 1,089 episodes and I didn't do weekends. So like when you start compounding that math, it was like the world came off my shoulders. And it was my favorite thing but when it was over and I knew it was over, I did something weird. I actually did something a lot of people don't know. I did Wine Library TV to episode 1,000, and then I started something called Daily Grape, which was a shorter mobile version, because I knew I was done at 1,000, but I wasn't ready to let go. It was this weird thing, so I'm like, well, if I'm gonna do it, let me learn something new, and I think these mobile devices are gonna take over. So I did that, but I only did it for 89 episodes. It never had a chance, and I ended it. Too early, taking a time. No, it was killing, and I was making money, because I actually, for the first time, actually was selling wine reviews, like Wine Spectator. It would have been a huge business. I was just done doing daily content that way. You know what's an interesting vertical for me? Don't put this in the video. It's not a by accident that good things happen to us. It's this zone. Absolutely, it's just that traditional media has existed for so long, and it's so slow to change, it's so big. It's not their fault, it's too big. They can't pivot, they can't. Which is why this move by them getting you involved is so right. Instagram is so important. You see their daily numbers for stories? 150 million. Daily active users in stories. So that product is what, a few months old? Yeah, they have the attention. They funnel people in that way. What you do, again, the people that win, you do not disrespect that attention. You'll do nothing than disrespect that attention. So once you figure out, once you figure out exactly, you'll deploy it against that attention with value to that attention, and it will be a hit from the game. That's exactly what's gonna happen. And that's why they stole it. In a world where everybody's like, I was like, people don't understand magic. People don't understand. I like your view of the Empire State Building out of the window. This is the view of the Empire State Building from my bed. Yeah, okay. You know what's the Empire State Building? This is my bed. It's because I need to eat and sleep in your video when I wake up. I'm gonna go to the camera. Solid meeting. Thanks for having me by Gary. Ha ha ha. You gotta come down. Anytime. You gotta come down too, you see the shot. Ah, I fucking love it, man. Just watch the video I posted today. So it's about exactly what you just said. Cool. It's about this idea of, are you gonna watch it? You're not gonna watch it? Yes. Yes. I would never hold you to it. I would never hold you to it. I would watch my first KC video. I would never hold you to it. It's like eight minutes. I don't know. D Rock, have you ever watched a KC video? Nope. Ha ha ha. But the one thing is about sort of this thing that Felix Pewdiepie talked about last week, which is like, Whoa dude, five is my favorite number. Five's not your favorite number, is it? No, it's four, I'm sorry. I love, you've watched everything. That's like, I'm the, give me something. I'm moving to the rhythm of my intuition. Anything I want. We'll talk soon. Bye bye. Love to see you on the internet. No problem. I'm living. Hey, Andrew Dayes, I don't know if you, you know, this happened to you guys, but one of the kind of objections that we get all the time is, you know, we have people who do this, or our kids do this, or you know, we've got people internally who do this. And it's, you know. I tell them that there's a big difference between the way I play basketball and the way LeBron James plays basketball. There's no accident that Ella's the best you've got. Right. You just tell them right to their fucking face that we're better at it. Yeah. Yeah. And if they say, well, we don't value the difference between our B player and your A player, then you say Mazel Tov and you go into the next building. Yeah. Don't dwell on that conversation. Tell them right to the face what you believe and move on. Cool. I mean, it's that basic. Yeah. What are you gonna try to convince the unsellable? Right. I don't give a fuck what your excuse is. It's the excuse and I'm leaving. You need to really nail that one in your brain. It will be the best thing that happens to your business. Awesome. Sitting in your bed crying about the girl that didn't wanna go out with you for a year is not gonna let you find the next girl. Yeah, agreed. Next. Agreed. So. When you're an entrepreneur, you have a wavering eye. Yeah, totally. You're unfaithful. That skirt looks cute. Right. I get it. I've never, you know, it's, when it comes to entrepreneurship, I'm playing the field hard. I'm super in love with Vayner, but I'm like, who's that? Right. And that happens to me every day. I'm a scumbucket when it comes to entrepreneurship. And I would tell you that you can go and have a little more fun once you've got a little bit of an established situation. So I would say that be very careful of not doing it too early and realize, you know, there's something I said the other day, like, eat shit for 24 months and then eat caviar the rest of your life. It's not that exact, but that's how I think about it here. Build something that gives you the fuck, you know, build something and then when it's got enough strength, go do it. The reason there was a big gap in me putting out content was I needed 2011, 12 and 13 to build Vayner. It allowed me then to get back into content, do the PureWOW deal, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was very kind. I really appreciate it. Thank you. So happy I worked out for you, man. Thank you. That gratitude, brother, drive with that. Do not let any, like, when I give you that first answer to that question now, that should be a foregone conclusion. Comparatively, do never, you know, this is what happens with life-threatening events, you forget. It's like when the cop car goes and then when it drives back by you, you get and then you start driving fast again. People don't realize this. You do, I understand it. Thank God I've never had it. People forget. Do not forget. It's just a video game for me now. But you know what? Don't say it, live it. Losing that client, somebody saying no, means nothing. Right. Thanks, Dora. Bye, guys. Bye-bye. I just want to make sure. Let me sleep on it. Get me some context. OK. I mean, we're spending money, but then it's like you still have to maintain the account and so on and so forth. Hi. Hi. I'm Kelly. Kelly. Nice to meet you. How are you? Hi, Dana. Dana, how are you? This is so weird. Building my dad's liquor store, it should have been a $200 million business. I wasn't smart enough to go all in on Google AdWords. I kind of went all in on AdWords. It's insane to me. Like, I don't even want to actually put my brain on the table for you guys to see on how I think about PureWow and Instagram because it would make you nervous because you would then be concerned that I'm so disrespectful to everything else. So with that opening statement, that's how I feel about things. That's why I think I win. So to me, that could go away tomorrow. The reason I've been successful with clients, with my investments, with things that are not 100% my call, we're super successful because we look at each other and we just do it. Everything else is hard. Vayner's hard. This is easy. We just do it. I just do it. And when I have an idea, I'm like, do it. And just do it. And we do it. And it's just doing it. Vayner's hard. We have to do it. Like, so I do it, but I have to do a couple of things beforehand. And this will be one even step more of the nap. And that's OK. But this is what I'm about. And it's going to work in a real way. Love you guys. Thank you. See you. See where the opportunities are. That's the right mood. Help first and then figure out the right way. I'm excited. Don't be. You're back. How are you doing? I see you like every day on TV or on YouTube. So I'm like, hi, Harry. I have a crazy proposition for you. OK. I see you. This office is amazing. Yeah. So this is just like, it just like makes my heart swell. See this. This is so great. Here's my feelings as a father and as a man in the world and someone who's tried to focus a lot of my life on impacting as many people as I could, as far as why, as I could in a positive way. And suddenly I brought the phone. They got real small. All I cared about was just being in the room with them. They got real small. And it was this conflict of, do you try to live as big as possible or as small as possible? And where do you find a balance? And you know what the best part is? Yeah. The answer is always both. Yeah. And then that's where I was. Clouds and dirt, baby. And that's where I was. Clouds and dirt. It's like, well, for a moment I felt like I just, I don't care about anything. I actually want to be in this room with them. And then I realized, well, they're going to grow up into the world. Well, parents and marketers and business people, they cripple themselves. They cripple themselves. In not realizing, you can be 100% on something even for a year. Everybody thinks in the micro. Like if I want to be super selfish for two years, it's two of the hundred years I'm going to live. Like people don't quantify that. I'll go into dirt for, like for VaynerMedia. I was in the clouds for the last six months. I'm getting into dirt. You know, people judge themselves too much. It's OK to go on a business trip for three weeks. It's three weeks. Yeah. Yeah. That's been the new thing. It's OK that, you know, especially, I mean, look, this is so much of the advice I gave you on the board, right? Like, well, let me give you the mission you updated. Yeah, I want to. And I want a lot of your thoughts and thoughts. So. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Listening to my old songs back when I would talk about things that hadn't happened yet. But now I get to talk about just got back from South Beach. Collins have short club. Always celebrating what I want to see more of. Took my mom with me. Let the soak up all the sunshine. Let the watcher rain stop all because of sunshine. I don't even read the business plan if somebody puts in front of me. Somebody else would never even consider giving you money. Correct. Reverse engineer the person. Cool. Customize it to that. Yeah. I mean, this is why you get conflicting opinions. Yeah. That's why everybody gets conflicting opinions because there's more than one way to do it. Yeah. But you need to know who you're doing it with. You come in here and give me a business plan and you actually read a little bit about my spiel. I'm out. Like, if you didn't know me. Is that just like your personal sort of approach? Yes. Yeah, because it's just how I bet. Got it. Yeah. You know. But like, you go to a Goldman Sachs kid who like has public information that she only believes in data and you walk in and try to do the Gary Vee thing. You're fucked. Yeah. I think just personally that's where I've just like been hitting sort of myself. It was like, what do I really believe in most in terms of how I want to sell it? Well, the answer is both. Always. It depends on is it 50, 50, 80, 20, 100, zero, right? Yeah. And get that balance. Like, yeah. OK. Yeah. The other thing is just do it. Yeah. Like, it's a hell of a lot better for you to go 0 for 7 pitching your business than sitting in your head on your couch. Yeah. 10 years making beats. Patience tastes bitter, but the aftertaste is so sweet. Could have stopped at any time. Wouldn't have believed this. People used to talk down, but now I got them speechless. That's what I call foresight. That's what I call manifest. Yes, yes. Ooh. And to the rhythm of my intuition. I'm hopeful. It feels a lot better today. I go from buying cheeseburgers. I'm about to buy you a nice dinner. Like, it's good. And then it goes down. The economy gets fucking terrible. You got to start over. There's like so much shit. You just got to keep fighting, especially if you love it. That's the other thing about music and technology. If you love it, then that's a whole different thing. Then you can, I can eat cheeseburger. I'll be straight up. I can eat cheeseburgers every day. I don't need anything fancy. I need to play my game. That's what drives me. That's why I'm the best. Because I'm going to win because I played for the game. I don't need shit. I don't need shit. And I don't hate on people that want stuff. Everybody knows what they want. I want the game. I don't even want the money. Really don't. You know this. You know this better than anybody. You know my, you know. You do. You know how I play. I want the fucking action. I think that's what I'm saying. You connect with me. You know this is exact advice I gave to Sabah yesterday. Get into culture outside of your own fucking world. Yeah, that's not my word. He's a gamer. Like you guys should go get a country singer to sing a hook on some of your shit. That's some pretty blonde girl that has 800,000 Instagram followers and does country. Like I don't know what kind of musician you are. The one thing I always don't is touch the art. That's what people do. But I'm always giving them. If you're into it or if you're that kind of artist, you do it. Your shit will pop. I remember the first time I got offered to speak for real. This is a good story. Dude calls and goes, we want you to give the key note at the internet marketing conference. How much do you charge? I was about to say bet. Like he was talking slow. He didn't get to say how much you charge. I was almost going to be like sure I'll come just pay my trip. Right? He goes how much you charge? I was like, oh okay. I was like, alright. So I'm a business man. So I'm like okay. I have no idea what people get paid to speak. But I'm going to throw out the craziest fucking number ever because I could always come down. Like $5,000. He goes okay great. I'm like holy shit. He said yes fast as fuck. So I was like fuck. He's talking. I'm blacked out. I'm happy and I'm like how do I get more? And so he goes, I heard everything he said. I go okay okay okay let me recap. Pay trip. March 9th, Florida. It's actually Florida. $5,000 for a 30 minute talk. He goes no no no no. I said an hour. I said oh. I said $10,000. He goes okay great. I'm like fuck. I need some more. I need some more. I need some more. I need some more. I need some more. I need that walk. Ooh I like don't take it. See you say little smile. Yeah you're fucking swishy. I gotta glow y'all right now. I gotta put some ice up in my mouth. Right now. I gotta put some ice up in my mouth. Right now. Right now. Right now.
