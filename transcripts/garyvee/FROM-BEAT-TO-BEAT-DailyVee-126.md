Two years ago, I judged Miss America and this lovely lady won. You know, it's funny, I was just, as I was turning the corner looking at this, I was like, fuck man, I really miss 2011 Vayner a little bit more. Like, the same thing, you know, it's not, we started this company literally within weeks of my daughter being born and literally this, the other night I put her to bed and I saw a picture of her when she was like three and I was like, fuck, all that shit, like older people tell me, like, enjoy it, this and that. I was like, yeah, like, she's just not like, my daughter's seven going on sixteen. And so, and that's kind of like weirdly, I just had that same exact feeling turning the corner here, I'm like, fuck man, controlling fifty or sixty personal feelings and like, the mission is really easy and fun compared to what the fucking insanity we're dealing with right now, so, I'm gonna try something, it's gonna be a great year, it's gonna be a great, great year. Last year was, give room. So what I love to do is like, go and then clean up and then focus. Last year was go. And Justin's smiling because he saw it at Wine Library too when you go from thirty to seventy, like, you go? Oh my god, we made a local commercial. That's right, I mean, we produced it, we fucking killed the commercial, we made a commercial, I forgot. Hey, we're ready. Mind if I take picture with you? I prefer it. I mean, we can win real big and I'm willing to do it. Now I have clawed too, fuck, I can really do it. Like, literally trying to get into a place where you're the bigger person in every situation and then having a place where you can take that poison out, because you wanna get it out, you gotta eat it, is how we built Vaynergically. For real, that's how I got the right foundation at first, like, just getting everybody religious about I will be the bigger person. Like, I disagree, but I'll be the one that bends right now, but then I'm gonna go punch Gary in the face or Kelly or AJ, now Claude is much better than the combination Kelly and AJ, like, this is a real thing. So that's another thing just to think about, because that's exactly what I'm gonna say to them as well. I mean, it's insane, there is no separate, there should be no separate, I understand physically even how big this division is, it makes sense, but it's going to be a constant pressure on everybody from me in a real way, starting very, very soon to not let that happen. And so I'm glad, and I think we had those conversations in summer, you know, one of the things of that nature that allowed some movement, I think in the fourth quarter is a preview to it, and I'm sure some pockets are good and some pockets are probably exactly the same, and that's okay. It just won't be able to be exactly the same bad very long. Thanks guys. Have a great day. Hit me up if you need me. Is that you? No. Can we start with anything I personally can answer for either one of you to help this? Thank you brother. I heard you on the billion it is. Thank you. That's great. I mean we've got unlimited capabilities like your company is exactly the kind of people that we can help. The issue with companies of your size normally without knowing the details, you know, that they think of social and digital media as a secondary thing, and they're allocating dollars to PR or direct mail or other things that then usually gets them into a place where they're not putting the money. I don't care if you spend a dollar. A dollar with VaynerMedia. If we can figure out how to take that dollar and do something, I will do it. That's not what bothers me. It bothers me that you're spending a dollar with us when you're spending six dollars elsewhere on things that don't matter as much in 2017, and that's the thing on a call like this or with a board or a CEO or CMO or head of marketing that I'm always trying to have the first conversation around because every dollar we don't have is less things we can do for you. That's just common sense. A lot of people chintz or like, oh, let's test a little something. This is a real thing. This is the communication of human beings in our society today. The only thing I would say to you is, look, make the biggest commitment financially, emotionally, strategically that you can to this. If that's a dollar, mazel tov, that's the way to think about it. Hold on. My phone's dead. I'll get a picture. Richard, real pleasure. Your phone's dead? Yeah, my phone's dead. I actually just watched your interview on Breakfast Club. Yeah, I'm going to hook you up, man. Really hook you up. Of course. Cool. Is Derek Rose going to play in the game? He's going to show up. To be honest, I'm thrilled. I mean, I was so upset two weeks ago when this thing looked like there was going to be a three or four seed, they were going to sign D Rose, they were going to like, this needs to blow up. They need to get rid of everybody that got one way to do it. All the way back, put yourself in a position to go all the way this way. It doesn't happen all the way back. The Cubs finally did it because Theo knows what he's doing. You fucking go all the way down, get all the assets. Now they could get hurt. It doesn't mean you're going to do it. But next year, the Jets should go on 16 and force it in the best way they can because there's two to three big time quarterbacks coming out. It's the year, but classic Jets will probably go eight and eight, not get one of the three kids to get all the leverage before the moment. People are like, but you don't have anything. I'm like, no, idiot. In one year, you're going to come back here and be sad because that's what happens. I believe it. You have all the equity. You just believe? Yeah. That will all happen, I think. And then brand stuff too. It's not just body related. It's also brand related. So I think what we can do is that in the same way that I talked to big versions of this CIA rock nation, I'm like, look, we're all going to compete on everything. Everybody's going to compete on everything because it's all colliding. So to me, I think the thing to really have a serious conversation about is how do we navigate it so that it's co-winning instead of like inevitable bumping heads? Like we do brands, we do sports, you know, I'm so pumped. I'm so hungry. I love it because I was like, fuck, you put me through so much shit. Why can't I eat? It's my full-time health trainer. No. I'm Jordan. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, man. Are you mic'd up too? Is everybody mic'd up? No. I'm the only one not mic'd up. I'm kind of mad at it. I'm mic'd up. I wish I had a mic. It was nice to meet you guys. I hear it. I want the brand. That text is unusual for you. What happened? Something good happened? Didn't you text me? You're in G-Pen. I'm in G-Pen. I'm in G-Pen. I'm in G-Pen. I'm in G-Pen. I'm in G-Pen. Really good job of working with you. What happened? Something good happened? You know what I did. You were DMing? No. I did My Own Stixie Second Club, but my email list. I did a seven-minute waiting club. So, I got an order from a few people. There you go, it's dead. You're not even close. I think that me and you guys see the world the same way, and I think that we've been and executing against that world longer, so we're further along, and the truth is, like, nothing would make me happier than to be a match for what you guys are up to at a macro level, and it could take a million different forms, but I'm super not scared of it. You guys wanna sit here for a month? Next to my team, you'll learn everything. I'm crazy. I'll give away, I'll give you all my milk, I'll give you my cow. I just think it's all execution. Lindsay, he needs to get hip double legs here, in front of my mind, good to see ya. Man, you're in shape, huh? It's sneaky under there. It's sneaky under there. Wow, my guy's sneaky athletic, bro. Yeah. He's got a mighty sneaky. Hey guys. Hi. How are ya? Good to see ya, really well. How are you? Hey guys, how are you? Oh, is it just a night one? I don't know. I just, I don't know. It's a line Wednesday. Oh, it's a line Wednesday? Hey guys. What's up? Big shout out to Ryan Conlon. Sorry I fucked up. I didn't see that you made that video. I thought that was a team. I just tagged you on the post and I love you. I love him. What do you want? I love the man. Love it. Pumped. I want the t-shirt now. Get it on the t-shirt so I'm ready. What? Fucking gary corn. I realized I'm a unicorn. Ugh. I did, yeah. For two weeks we went to five, six days to Ingeela with my wife. I got it right this time, thank you. And the kids, yeah. And no, the four, five days we had just us, which is a real cool thing. I had to ask myself some very serious questions. Why am I doing this? It's very important to know. If you want to end up somewhere, you have to know where you want to end up. Then you have to have a compass of knowing how to navigate. So for me, is it an artist or famous? I know I wanted to be an artist. Nothing against fame, by the way. It's just, which one do you want as an experience for your life? I wanted to be an artist. So every day I made decisions based on being an artist, not being famous or rich. And the other kind of interesting caveat is I was offered a million dollar signing bonus and I turned it down. I'm glad we did this, man. I haven't looking forward to it. Like if I could do what you did, I'd be real fucking famous because I really understand distribution. It's the ideas I just gave you. It's not how people are thinking. People always take the easy way out. The easy way out right now is make something hot. Let's put it on fucking SoundCloud and Spotify and hopefully something pops. Fuck hopefully. Beautiful. Right? Right? Like distribution. Of course music. I want people to hear it. Yeah, I mean one thing I'm really good at is knowing what normal Americans that aren't into music will like because I'm actually that. I'm not a good, I'm not a very good music person. I'm being serious. Like I know that for fact. But boy do I really understand America. So I know, Billy Williams, like I know that's a hit. I'm always right about that shit. So like, get that fucking song out. I know it. I just know it because I'm that person. I'm not Boyd who really knows music. I'm being serious. Do you understand? Like I don't know when people are like, oh that artist is done. I'm like, I don't understand. I know hits. Sabah motherfuckers, I've been telling you. I've been telling you Chicago. Definitely have. I wish you well. All right, Boyd. Hi, Gary. Hi, M. I follow you on Instagram. Thank you. And the other day, I was like, he's in the husband yard. Can I get a bitch review? My husband is gonna freak out. He's like, Victoria, you have to always, he's like, you gotta follow him. And then I started following him a couple of days ago. This is awesome. Thank you so much. You're welcome. It's a nice embrace. Thank you so much. My husband's trying to rent out on his own. Well, wish him luck. And you follow to your great inspiration. What's his name? Jamal. Jamal? Yep. Jamal, what's up, man? Gary Vee, just wanted to know I'm rooting for you, man. Get it, get it. I'm proud of you. Do it. So nice to meet your wife. And I hope you win, brother. Talk to you soon. Go? I'm saying that some people may hear Miss America and may think that you're a dumb pageant girl. And some people may think that you're Miss America and want to do business with you because of it. I'm busy. Why did I say yes to Miss America? Because when I was little, we first came to America, my mom and I, and my sister would watch it. And it felt like a very special part of my life. Yeah. Now that I know a little bit of my air schedule, I'm like, damn, I'm gonna be a judge for Miss America. I was also in a very different place in my career, even three years ago, four years. What was it, three years ago? Two years ago, I judged Miss America and this lovely lady won. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm a legend in the making like I'm Billy Rand. Wanted I'm a ticket like I'm Billy Rand. Feeling in my spirit that ain't anything I can ever fall. Legend in the making like I'm Billy Rand. I'm a ticket like I'm Billy Rand. No, thank you. I'm a spirit that ain't anything I can ever fall. Coming down, all right, all right. I just ran out of time. I'm just running out of time. Whoa. That's something. That's something. I'm turning up, folks, from me with the kids. From my perking up, fucking bags, Niggas made us work for our streets. Pre-ain't early enough, flexing on our beach. All right, my whole thing, my whole thing, done. My dad's gonna be real happy. Sasha V's gonna be real happy. Here. Oh, go. Dad, take a shot. Look, four, three. Thank you. He's broken it, he's not deserved. He's not deserved. He's broken it, he's not deserved. Salute. He's broken it, he's not deserved. You broke niggas, don't deserve no money. I'm a street nigga, I don't know no lies. In the trap, we back, hold the rock, baby, that ass. Play it for me. Oh, man, thank you, man. That's tremendous. I was just, uh, she was telling me she was coming through. I'm just like, Gary Vee, coming through. I was like, hell yeah. He didn't let me finish. She said out your whole name, and I didn't know the whole name, but I said, hell yeah, let me come through. Why'd you use that for the time? I appreciate it, my man. Seriously, man. Thank you so much for the love. It's real good, man. Like I said, it's so weird that the hip hop artist that ended up blowing up for you is going to end up being me. How you doing? I'm good. My boys love you. Yeah, I'm good. They've been hyping you so much. I'm like, I can't wait to meet them. We had a good time. It's good. We had a good time. You guys need water or anything. Gary, it's for you. It's for you. To me, there's only three or four pillars of culture, right? Right. Music, sports. And so, I don't know how well you know. You guys know each other, Boyd? We never met before. Got it. So Boyd's incredible. You'll get to know him. I put up the money for Boyd to manage Rome Fortune. It's so hard to have something happen like it happened to you. It's hard to be LeBron. It's hard. It's hard to even where Dave's at right now on the cusp. Like, it's hard. And the only thing these kids are doing is either trying to be Steph or trying to be you. And the reality is the math is bad. Meanwhile, like motherfuckers, you can make 100,000 a year if you get your shit together and just focus on this shit. In addition, go try to do that, but do this too. And so, that's what I'm really passionate about. I just think that it's dope that you really care about other people just making a different way. You know what it is? I'm good enough to get mine. So like, I'm already, you know what I mean? Like, when you're good, you want other people to win too because you don't need to tear down other people's shit. You've got yours. So, I've got mine and I want other people to win. That's how I think about it. Are you going to give it back? I give it back now. So, the guy by the name of Scott Harrison who did Charity Water, he caught me real proper once. We were having dinner like this. Jammin', he's like, I know who you are. I'm like, okay, what you know? He said, you're going to make a lot, a lot of money and you're a good dude and when you're 60, you'll start giving it away. I'm not feeling that. That's what he said. You're not real until you give back. You meet these guys. And that's what he said to me. It's just like you meet somebody like you and give them that same inspiration. I'm talking personally. I want to see you give that back. It could be me. It could be anybody. It could be the next person. But just give them that inspiration. I agree man. And I see how you move and I see all the people you're with. You inspire good energy. I appreciate that my man. I feel a sin about you man. But let's just turn up. You know what I'm saying? Next time let's go to some hospitals if you really about that. In. That's easy. That's easy. I'll go to my doctor. I'll go to my doctor. I'll go to my doctor. I'll go to my doctor. I'll go to my doctor. I'll go to my doctor. I'll go to my doctor. I'll go to my doctor. That's easy. That's easy. I'll go tomorrow. I'll change my schedule. I love that shit. Like you only live like. In. That's exact. Okay I'll show you. Alright fellas. Take care, stay with us All right fellas See you tomorrow I'm out You
