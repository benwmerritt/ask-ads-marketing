It's weird in here. We'll do a root canal right here. We'll pull that shit out What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life I Woo Yo, what up my man? I'm heading to a new business pitch. Hey Gary V here on the streets reporting. Monday morning doing my thing. Nice and cloudy. It's exactly when people don't want to do it. I love when people don't want to do it. I love that. Not about D-Rock. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. Oh no. I'm a flexible see. I'm a flexible see. It's all audio. Remember this we did the last time it was video. I'm going to jump on one of the things that you said. Facebook. Yes. You were an early adopter of Facebook live. Can you tell us a little bit more about opportunity you've seen with live streaming? You know it's funny that I didn't mention live at all in my opening rant. I think that's an indicator. I like live. I think live is hard. I think for most of the brands and personalities in the world live is an extremely difficult format. I think it's sexy. People are talking about it. But I just wish that people understood how to make Facebook commercials and videos. These one, two, three minute videos around your business whether B2B or B2C that would drive your results. You know it's kind of like you asking me like hey Gary why aren't seven year olds thinking about driving? Because I'm still worried about can they ride a bike? Before people worry about mastering the hardest medium of all which is live video I like them to figure out just video on Facebook. I can't just pictures on Facebook. So I like live. I think it's really personality driven. I think it has to bring a lot of value. I think people have to think in like morning TV show, late night TV show, drive time radio dynamics like what does a brand really do? I think some of the stunt stuff can be fun. But live is a very competitive, very difficult thing. You're asking for somebody to give you their attention on your time not on their time. And so that is a very outside of live sports and the biggest events in the world. Live is a real challenge. You have to really bring value. And truth is I don't think most businesses small or large have even figured out how to provide value in their content let alone their live strategy. And so intuitively I don't even focus on it. I canceled the two things. The next two meetings. I am going back to the meeting. We just have to direct her Denise Soler Cox. Turned out she was a huge fan of yours. She should be. She stood in line for one of your books with her baby who was like not even a year old. And so she like freaked out when I reached out to her and she offered to come and do a director screening for us if she got an hour of your time. And that potentially making the feature length version of this film. So that's who you're meeting. I recognize that the people that dislike me have insecurities of their own. And I actually genuinely have empathy for them. You know how bad I feel for bad people? Like if somebody draws a swatka or pulls off somebody's religious clothes or hates black people I feel bad for them. They lost. They lost in life. Of course I feel bad for the person that's being the crimes being committed on but I feel bad for the other person. They're a loser. Like you've lost. There's nothing you can do to beat me. Good always beats evil. It's how we're still here. That's me being initiated. I love the most by sending in this chair. You can do whatever you want. You can do whatever you want. They can take the time out man. My pleasure man. Happy to be here. Yes. So Dave told me a lot about you. I really didn't know much until recently but Dave was showing me, told me you love the music. I'm impressed. I'm aware. Yeah yeah so when I realized what you guys had going on there was so many similarities between how you guys grew the families. And you guys, well it's one of the reasons I like you know like when I first got, these guys, you guys have been on him for a while. And I kept hearing in the background and then finally had time to listen to some music over the holidays and I was reading. You know it was fun because Spotify did a good job with integrating genius. I really enjoyed that. So I was like reading. Like I'm upset. If I was to meet Rusty the only thing I'd want to talk to him about for 20 minutes would be his grandfather. Like because I'm an entrepreneur. You know like that story and that narrative that he puts out there. Like you know and the whole like all I do is hustle. Like if I was an artist I put out a song a day. Fuckin' forget about a week. Like I want to put it out every day if I could. What we realized was I think the reason why most artists don't realize it is because it happened super recently. Like 2014 yes SoundCloud, Spotify, all those things were available but the user base hadn't arrived at the same time. There's also economics in not putting out free music. Mixed tapes was a love hate thing. The labels have no interest in you putting out free music. They're not monetizing it. Absolutely. So when we started putting out the song like a weekly basically realized like the internet moves so fast that one week is almost not enough time you need another song right away and that's the best marketing for the previous song. It's more at bats. Exactly. More shots to even to get it. Literally the way I taught my one friend who's like terrible at getting girls. I'm like you know what go completely un-matched. Go completely un-emotional and just say hello to every one of them. It's gonna work out eventually. I think we can. Like as crazy as that sounds. It's weird in here. We'll do a root canal right here. We'll pull that shit out. The reason I love to do these meetings is when you're young and you want something you can get clouded on the reality. You are massively highly rated and you're very much on the hot young rookie path. Not the we don't see where this guy fits path. As long as they understand those kind of core four or five things that we all have to have which is like this is the kind of work we want to do. This is where we track people's attention and we care about that and then how we treat each other. I think the world doesn't think that you should email a CEO and have this conversation. Our world does and it's hard to like fight against the whole world. And so I never get disappointed anymore if somebody's been here for seven years and still is like scared or confused or curious. I get it now but I'll never waver. The biggest challenge a leader has is to get the people that work with them to understand that they work for them not the other way around and to build that trust. And so I'm feverish about that. I'm so obsessed with it but it's a very difficult thing to accomplish because it's not how the world works. That's why I'm still alive to keep reflecting, to keep this car and driving. I'm hoping I won't let you go. I left my heart in the city. Yeah, that would make a lot of sense. What excites me is that I want to fucking rule the world. And when you want to rule the world everything's in play, nothing's out of bounds and you've proven a lot to me which creates even more opportunity. So I'm not really crippled by it. I'm giving you the binary like you're in the family and I doubt that we won't be able to figure out shit for the next 50 years let alone five. And in a world where I think it's a real win to the next two or three steps even in this path it doesn't make me feel like oh shit if we don't figure something out in the next six months it's over. And so that makes me to be very frank, very calm in a world where I have that in other places. Yeah man, you're a young man. Obviously we have a young company. Hang with me with 60 and 70 year olds who are on fire the way you and I are. If you start taking your career into a macro at 64 years old double your age today I'm working with those people every day and they want it. That's around the age I plan on buying the jets. You know like you got your whole life literally from the day you're born to today. You know much work that is, you know much learnings that is. This is I don't think people get it brother. Do you know why I don't think people get it? I don't know if I fully got it. To be quite frank, you know I did but more blindly now it's more black and white and it's about to get color. Sure I'm very comfortable with that. I'm comfortable with two or three people being in that position but she's probably the closest to that. Okay, okay cool. Let's get to it. How do we... I don't know. Let's do it. That will be in there but let's keep that thought in our back. I'm in such a great fucking mood. I can just feel it happening. I wish you guys the best life ever. So much fucking opportunity. Go get yours. Please go get yours.
