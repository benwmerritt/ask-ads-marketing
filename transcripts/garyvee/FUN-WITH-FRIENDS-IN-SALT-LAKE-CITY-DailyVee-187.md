Wrapping up a long day. Oh my god! Jesus! Oh my god! Holy shit! Definitely a different kind of daily V. Sabahs, I've been telling you. I'm dirty, I'm dirty, I'm moving furniture to heaven. How are you guys? It's the way to collect a lot of data. So we're keeping the walls, so just be careful. No worries. Not that I expect you to lay the walls. Yeah, I wasn't gonna. Hey guys, first of all, thank you so much for listening to my podcast. It means the world to me. That little buzzing sound you hear in the background is I'm in some sort of weird utility closet right now about to go on a live stream at Salesforce. But I wanted to set up this clip. This is maybe the single most important clip I've ever put out on my podcast. So I hope you enjoy it, pay very close attention. And I love you. Yeah, I love you. Sure, DRock. I'm about to do a live stream, you know, live cast with Salesforce for sales executives and startup and large companies. And I'm excited. I'm also reading the Dante Hightower Resign with the Patriots instead of the Jets, which actually makes me happy. I didn't want to overpay for him and I've enjoyed hating him. It would have been a tough transition to loving him. Good morning, good afternoon. Good whatever you call it, wherever you are. Good to see you. Big ups, Rich. Schneider Mike, my man. Schneider Mike, congrats on Dante Hightower resigning with your Patriots. Who is right, macho man, Randy Savage. Savage, baby. So I'm here at Salesforce and I'm about to do a live cat. I can't figure out what it's called live stream. It's a live stream, but anyway, looking forward to it. DRock's here as always. What do you guys call this? Yeah, like what is it officially called? Like what is it, a live stream? Webcast. I think it is a webcast. So Gary, you've got a really interesting background, I think, obviously moving into the US, the baseball cards, the wine library, perhaps for some of the people that aren't familiar with yourself. Can you give an intro? You know, it's fun. Right now, I'm very much known as a marketing guy, a social media guy, but the truth is at the end of the day, it's why I really wanted to do this today is, I'm a sales guy, right? I mean, from the age of five with lemonade, and I mean five lemonade stand franchise. So, you know, really, what is it again, the daily digital deep dive. Yeah, anyway, I like the logo. So yeah, put the logo up when it is. It should live on GaryVinertruck.com. Phil. My man, I have some fun news. I'm doing everything I wanted when I started off. And now I realize that this ain't what I thought it was. And everything is amazing until you got it like that girl you really wanted, but then you want to just cut her off. I got a problem with finally being satisfied. Everything I got, I just want to see it be multiplied. But every day I think about the shit I take for granted. Too many people want my spot. They trying to make me panic. Nobody coming close to where I really want to be. I'm busy working day and night. I never stop like GaryV. I'm coming for that MVP. Aiming for that hall of fame. I don't mind if you don't like me. Everyone can know my name. The nerd is in that the racket. I just have always liked it. The Nuffin and the Mint. Eighth grade I got really into the NCAA tournament. Oh, actually yeah, there is a reason. My freshman year of high school, I predicted that the Richmond Spiders were going to beat Syracuse. And it was a 15 to two seed game. And it was one of the first times that ever happened. And I went all around my high school the day of and I would get into class early and write, Richmond Spiders. Because we were in Northeast school, Jersey, Syracuse was big. It was a monster upset. And the whole school knew who I was the next day. They were like some short freshman predicted it. And teachers would pull me out of class for betting. It became my signature moment of my freshman year. And so I think that's probably what. And I ran the pool in school. Junior and senior year. Here was a good racket. I had a crazy game. It was a bag with junior year. It was a bag with 32 pieces in it. Which were the first round game. And you'd get both teams. It was 10 bucks to enter. And the winner got 200 bucks. And I got 120. Senior year I upped it up. And I made one team on the card. 64. And the winner got 400. And I got 240. So freshman year, I shocked the school with my prediction. Sophomore year, I can't remember anything. Junior year, I ran the pool. Senior year, I ran the pool. Yeah, the tournament's always been big. Yeah, that's a scheme on your mind. Thursdays, when I... Thursdays of the first Thursday was actually one of the only weird days that I would actually take off. I was talking about missing no days. I would leave at noon and watch the first games. I haven't done that in about seven or eight years though. It's gotten crazy, but I used to do that. Okay, best take your snapchat with you? Of course. Junior year. And tomorrow. How are you? Doing well. How are you? Good. Awesome. Awesome. Real pleasure. Can't wait to see you tomorrow. Thank you. Talk to you soon. This is your sign, but we're late. That's a big ass sign. That's it, brother. Good to see you. You ready to party? I'm ready. Panda, real pleasure, man. How are you? Good. Good man. This is the DRock. DRock's the man. We figure out our situation, changed all our flights, came back. Dude, just hustling. We went to like four different skate parks, sitting in a giant Greyhound bus with my whole space station crew. Got home, dropped everyone off, immediately got my car and then came and picked you up. That's why we're running a bit late. I love it, man. This is that right here. Find some room. Package acquired. DRock, Gary Vee, here. She's a present. Gary, you realize that we're not going to hustle and grind right now. We're going to a giant wave to surf. That's what I heard. You guys know that I've never surfed in my entire life. That's what I've ever been doing. Like anything even remotely. And it's so much different than real surfing. Any time I've ever hung out with you, you're just like getting work done, we're having good conversations. Like I want none of that. I just want you surfing. I want to see myself surfing. Like I've never done anything of balance. Like no skateboarding, no surfing. This is going to be great. This is going to be really interesting. I need some really good clickbait with Gary Vee. I bet if I put him on a surfboard, I get like Gary breaks his leg or something like viral video. I'm really hoping. Yeah, that's what I'm going for. I'm looking for content. It's business right there. Content. His name's also Sean, so it gets weird so we just call him Holiday. I met him in Honduras, so technically Sean Duris as well. Wow. I know, right? Yeah, I didn't know that. You guys made up Holiday or Holiday something? No, that's his last name. Yeah, it's his last name. And then he's like my Alex dude. Like my life would not exist without him. He's like when we got snowed in and stuff, he's like you're going here, now you're going here. I remember. We had to jump out of our Uber on the freeway, change Uber's go to different airport. Straight up an island in the middle of the freeway. I love it. Yeah, it was dude, the past two days have been insane. I can't believe. My buddy's what's inside, in the middle of Utah, we're all hanging out. It's going to be like the ultimate party. And Tater, what about you man? What was your like, what was your story? I know you crush YouTube, but like how did it start? Originally I was a professional scooter rider, so I like went to skate park every day for the past like five years. Just doing that and I traveled like all around for contests and then from there I watched. Scooter you said? Yeah. I want to make sure. Like a razor scooter. Like razor scooters. Yeah, but like more. Yeah, okay, got it. Yeah, I've seen that. Yep, yep. So I did that. That's cool. Yeah, I did that for five years and then. How old are you now? 17. From there I started vlogging and then kind of, I just started for fun, but that was a year and a half ago. Go ahead. So I had a little bit of a following from scootering and then I just kept vlogging for fun and then I had a video that went kind of viral. Yep. So then I got a bunch of subscribers really fast and then from there. What was the video about? Hoverboards. And then from there I like, I made it more about me and then I kind of like slowly transitioned away from scootering and then more just about me so that I can like keep the same fan base. Yep. And then just grew it and kept doing it and now I've been doing it daily for the past like eight months, but before that I did every other day. Understood. Real talking about this though, like I mean skateboarding is rough some and all that stuff. Like this is fun. Like you can do it. It doesn't hurt to fall or anything like that. The body surface is super fun. I like pain. The pain. I like losing man. Like I like that shit. Meaning like I don't like all that stuff because I don't have time. Like same reason I don't golf or I just don't have time for anything because I just love what I do. But like as soon as we get there I'm going to be focused as fuck. I'm not going to be like, oh this is lame or like you know what I mean. T-Rock you need Wi-Fi to post today's episode? Yes. We got good Wi-Fi at the space station. Space Wi-Fi. But we're first going to that other place right? Does that place have Wi-Fi? I could have one of them. Because what it's already 11? I'll do it on my phone. Is it 2? No. It'll be 11. Yeah. Oh. Somebody company just asked me why the draft why the March Madness thing is mandatory. I said it'll be in tomorrow's DailyVee. T-Rock just asked me the same question. I make the whole company fill out a bracket for the tournament. What's the March so I got a couple tweets like Casey Neistat, Gary Vee, March Madness is there an actual thing with influencers or that's just something in the company? Maybe there's something but for me it's I'm not in any of that. It's a VaynerMedia thing that's been like like the winner. Like I sent to Australia. Like I'm going to get a hold of it. Yeah. It's a big deal. I like that I'm tagging late in Utah. This is when you get people like what the fuck? Yeah exactly. They're late in Utah. Okay one sec. What's up brother? Are you in the cars? No. No. I'm super like not cool that way. You know me too and it's so hard because all these people talk about cars. Yeah. I don't give a fuck about cars at all. I know like good cars have naws. You like cars? Yeah. I don't give a fuck about cars. That's like my attitude exactly. It's not where I added it. Like people are like yo. I'm going to crash. It's not cool. It's fucking car can do this. I'm like yeah. Like yeah but I get it. Like that's you know what that's the best part of the world. But I love people that are into shit. Like I love when my friends are like look under the hood or know how fast it is or give a fuck about tires and shit. I think that's awesome because I get it. Like I'm into like those are like I'm into fucking like going to garage sales and like finding like toys from the 80s and being like yo I bought this for 50 cents and I sold it for six bucks and that fucking gives me the greatest like fucking rush ever. It's 757. We got 30 minutes. This is the best place to eat in the entire world. So let's eat it. Right now. I'll be right back. Time to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Jesus. How does that feel? Okay. How about there? How about there? More. That hurts right? Dude. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Dude. Dude. You can drop. No. Seriously. It's crazy right? Best part is I have no idea of anything. Like today I was like what am I doing? Literally like when I got off the plane. Yeah. Off the plane. You're like I don't have a solution. I'm like wait 45 minutes ago. I'm like what am I doing? What are you going to do? Try to front flip. I don't know how to front flip. I'm going to break my fucking neck. Don't jump too high because like you don't know how to do it yet. But just had a jump. It's like the end of me right now. Go ahead. I want to see you do it. Okay. Let me just. One more time you and then I'm ready to go. Holy shit. You got this. One more no hands. I don't. That's literally the first time I've ever done that in my life. Ever in my life. Ever. Ever in my life. I don't even know what happened. Oh shit. Oh my god. Gary just goes off in Utah. I'm pumped. That was good? That was the most extreme thing I've ever done in my life. Not our normal thing. Gary B versus wave. Where we going? I've now learned that the front foot is the back foot. The back foot is the front foot. And I'm making slight progress. I'm making slight progress. I'm making slight progress. I'm an extreme sports superstar. Learning to fall super important. Yeah. I mean I should. You guys should have told me that before. It's not the first though. Literally the first fucking time my elbow exploded all over my fucking body. I feel like I'm a cross between Kelly Slater and Tony Hawk at this point.

I will destroy this kid. This is the next level strategy here. Oh, I just worried he's going to break like I feel it. It's over and over. Where did it come from? Like how old were you when you were doing this? This is mid-80s. Like this was the mid-80s big thing. Ready? Alright, let's go. Oh, we're warming up. Wait, you're going down? Oh my god, that was a huge shot. I'm in trouble. I'm my eraser, I should be finished by now. Wow. I'm going to turn. I'm in trouble. Oh, it's bitchy. I feel the eternal bleeding. You better be ready for a victory lap, D-Roc. I don't know about this. I'm ready. Oh, it's our boys to become men right here. Right here. What you going to do? Yeah, well, like he got it on you, but it was a real... Brent the Hitman heart is considered the excellence of execution. He's one of the all-time great wrestlers. He comes from a big-time wrestling family. I was an 80s baby. In the 80s, he was part of a tag team called the Heart Foundation with Jim the Anvil Night Heart. And then he eventually became a solo wrestler. Right now. And became a big-time solo wrestler. And when he left WWF to go to WCW, he was supposed to gracefully kind of lead, but Vince McMahon screwed him. And he made Shawn Michaels beat him. And it made it seem like Shawn Michaels, the way it was choreographed, Brett the Hitman heart was supposed to kick out of the move, which was a sharpshooter, which was his own move. Shawn Michaels had him in it. But McMahon made the ref call it, making it seem like Brett submitted to his own move. Brett like spit on him. It was a hole to do. But he's one of the great wrestlers of all time. And it's really awesome that he's on this signature. So I'm pretty hardcore about saying that nobody's really my business idol, but when I'm forced into it, I do say that Vince McMahon and Walt Disney are two people I think a lot about because they're storytellers. I mean, if you really think about what's happening here, the cereal, like if you even look at, like even the New Age stars of social media actually are much more grounded in the old storytelling of like you're creating pillars, pencil fighting, cereal. Like you're just creating these genres, these worlds you live in. What Vince did extremely well, WWF as I call it now, WWE, is he owned the naming rights to all these characters. He invented these characters, him and his inner crew. They invented, you know, Mr. Perfect. They invented demolition. They invented the Undertaker. And then they own the IP. So there's a human being who's brutish the barber beefcake, or Hillbilly Jim or Junkyard Dog or Iron Chic. But they don't own the IP, he does. And that IP goes on to be worth a lot of money. And so he's an extremely strong storyteller. And what he did, which I loved, he took a regional business. Wrestling in the early 80s, going all the way back to the 40s and 50s, was regional. There was the Northeast League and the South League. And wrestlers like Andre the Giant would go and travel in different places. What he did was he turned WWF into a national player by being smart and understanding cable television distribution, Saturday morning distribution, MTV distribution, and Saturday Night Live. There used to be something called Saturday Night's main event, which would run once every eight weeks instead of SNL. And he just built a whole world. WrestleMania, his invention, really besides boxing, created the pay-per-view industry. He's a real pioneer. I thought it was just a bunch of dudes going hard in the ring. I had no idea. You know what's so funny? So much of what we do today, even when you're like, hey, Snapchat crew, I'm about to unveil my video on YouTube. I just watched some of your content. Well, that's what Vince literally invented. Before big wrestlers that he would assign would come to WWF, he would do these little monologues like Razor Moans, like I'm coming for you Macho Man, and for weeks, every Saturday, you're like, wait a minute, this guy's coming. And then by the time he finally shows up in week nine, you already thought he was the coolest. And so he would play that build-up better than anybody. And now you see a lot of those behaviors in social media, which is like, tomorrow I'm gonna drop this thing or every 10th of the month, one of your pieces of clothes, right? So one of the greatest matches of all time, if you Google it right now, every top 10 list is Macho Man Randy Savage versus Ricky the Dragon Steamboat Intercontinental Championship WrestleMania 3, I think. And it was like a 40-minute match because they were both so great at improv. They just had a cadence with each other. It's kind of like a dancing partner. Like some- It's not for 40 minutes, just... I like boxing a lot as well, and there's this saying in boxing, like styles make fights, right? So you could have two great fighters, best in the world, and all of us would fall asleep by the eighth round. And you could have two guys that are okay, but they just matched Macho Man and Ricky the Dragon Steamboat. There's styles, just... I mean, look at this, this is real. You see it? Oh my gosh. Like literally, just talking about it, give me... Look at this. Like literally, like literally goose bumps, literally. It's not real goose bumps. I'm telling you, like, I'm sure, like you have to... Like it's almost worth, it's almost worth signing up for WWE Channel. Just have access to watch that match. It's that all time. All right, we have the power team assembled here with the wrestling belt. This is Brett the Hitman Heart, the Undertaker, and Howard Finkel. He's the longest tenured employee of WWE. That's done. This is what we do. This is what we do. It's so funny. We cut stuff open. It's amazing. Okay, guys. Oh, look at this. Oh, look at this. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Yeah! Oh! Oh! Yeah! Oh! It smells awesome. It smells awesome. It smells like that big dude's hair. Yeah, that's just creepy. It smells good too. It's a real rough. It smells like... It's a real rough. It smells good. It's creepy, but he's... I don't even hear you. I like that. I can never cut this hair. It's really good hair. If I had that hair, I'd be dominating. Dude, I got your half. There you go. Oh, you do. Thank you. Thank you very much. Lincoln, your half. Nice. Whoa. Successful cut. Yes! Don't remove the gold I want it forever. Okay, inside of a wrestling belt. Was that fun, Lincoln? What's she gonna do when Lincoln comes one wild on you? Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Are you sure you don't want to go skydiving? Anything? You good? Finish. Nothing you done? Finish. No VR roller coaster? No. This is my creepy room. This is super creepy. Don't worry about it. Hello? Cool, cool. Awesome. Thanks. Such a pleasure. Nice to meet you. Let me get one right here at hometown. Gary, space station, how was it? The best. The best. Check out my boy Gary. I love you guys. Instagram, YouTube, everything. The best. The best. Oh my gosh, it worked. We got it. Using hospitality from this man. Space station, high five guys. High five guys. Dude, anything I can help? Thank you. I appreciate that. Seriously. If you ever need help growing your whatever, I can help. I killed it. Sorry, sorry. I didn't know I was a live. Thanks. I'll see you in the hot car. Real pleasure. Thank you. Take care. All this is the end. Such a pleasure. Of course, brother. Thank you. I love you. I love you. Such a pleasure. Of course, brother. Of course. We appreciate it. Hi. How's it going? How are you? Good. Such a pleasure. What's your name? I'm Christina. Christina. Such a pleasure. We live in Salt Lake City, so we decided that we would drive 35 minutes for like the 70% chance of possibly meeting. Yeah, we should be on my 17. I know we did. I'm so glad. I feel super weird because we were like hiding over there and recording stuff. Yeah. Not at all. Don't worry. Such a pleasure. I want to give you a hug. Please. Thank you very much. I am. That's good. That's awesome. Awesome. You're all like you're going to die thing? Heck yeah. Wait, what the highly known thing is? Do you know about this? You're going to die thing? Somebody asked me like, hello? He's going to die one time. Driving 35 minutes is like what you do, right? It's like you get one shot. I just want to try and we appreciate you for sure. Very sweet. Yeah, I mean listen, I don't know how to play this game without recognizing that we get one shot. You get these one experiences. This is like the one time all of us is dude. What's your name? Alex. Alex. Really nice to meet you. This is it. This is 100%. I'm going to say looking at the mix of people are one time being all together. And we know that. We trust it. I got a problem with finally being satisfied. Everything I got, I just want to see it be multiplied. But they're wrapping up with long day. Definitely a different kind of daily being.
