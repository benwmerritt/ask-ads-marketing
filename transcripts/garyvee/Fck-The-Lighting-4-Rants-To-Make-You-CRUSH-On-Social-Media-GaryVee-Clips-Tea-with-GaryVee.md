## Transcript
The lighting, the script, talk about your fucking life. Yeah, yes. Be like, I'm back, bitches, mother, I'm back. Every minute you step away from this camera, you're going to go in that little head of yours. Hang the fuck up, turn the camera, said, fuck it, Gary Vee made me do this and give him a fucking life update. I love it, yeah, all right, I won't do that. Good, see ya. I post every day, but I'm not getting any views. Is it too saturated? It's not too saturated, you just stink. What's his name? Drew. Drew, you stink. Why are you not popping off? Because your content's not good. Like, what do you want from me? You're just not winning right now, bro. The algorithm, a.k.a. human beings. I love everyone who's like the algorithm. You know what the algorithm is? The customer. The customer thinks your shit is whack. Now the question becomes now what? When you are happy that you suck, you can fix. When you blame the algorithm and your mama, you lose. When I said to Drew, you suck, Drew was happy. Drew's like, yes, that's a winner. The reason most people don't post enough is they still think life is high school and they're insecure and they're worried someone's going to make fun of them or it's not going to do good. It's not going to do good? Who gives a fuck? Now I'm just posting. You know what? I don't even care what people say. The ones who are going to hate, they're always going to hate screw them. I'm just going to focus on just creating value. Bro, the ones that hate, you should not feel bad for yourself. You should feel bad for them. Could you imagine being a human being that goes around the internet and leaves comments of hate? That is the most depressing fucking life on earth. I'm not mad at those fuckers. I feel sad for those fuckers. Sarah asks, when I post the same exact video on different platforms, it does really well on one platform and terrible on another. No shit, Sarah. This is an algorithm problem. No, it's a you fucking problem, Sarah. You're the fucking problem. Have a fucking mute up and listening. We've been talking about this for fucking decades. I used to have black hair when I talked about this shit. No shit, it does different on every platform. Every platform's different. You need to do different shit. That's why I write fucking books about this shit. I wrote Jab, Jab, Jab in 2012. Jesus fucking Christ. No, it's not an algorithm problem. It's a you problem. You're supposed to do slightly different content the first three seconds, the thumbnail, the copy, the edit. You think LinkedIn's like TikTok? Sarah?
