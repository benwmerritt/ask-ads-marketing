Gary and I have known each other. We have respect for each other. We've known each other in passing even though Gary lives in New York The only places we've actually seen each other or gotten together is Austin for South by Southwest San Diego. We share the same stage Mexico City, that's right, and we'll be in Australia in the same stage. Am I going Australia? Is that the hologram? I feel I think it's all right. I got this new hologram racket Cool. All right, so I asked him to come down Well, my people asked his crew without blinking an eye He came here and trust me we're all industry individuals. It wasn't about what's in it for me what I'm gonna get Very very solid eyes, so I respect the fact that he's here and he didn't want anything from me So thank you for being here. Thank you for being with my family I want to get into a couple of things and then we're gonna open up a Q&A and what I want to know first of all This is my rise in grind series and series and I want to talk about low Not low but things that startups need to know because the whole concept of blueprint is told is you already have the blueprint of business You already know the fundamentals you need now to move forward and my last book which is rise and grind was about not my last book Which was excuse me which was the power broke was use the assets was in front of you I know that Gary believes in the same thing But today I want to talk about the methods that successful people have that they do every single day When you were growing up, did you have a rise in grind mentality? When I was growing up there was a lot of interesting things going on with me, which is I was an immigrant and Education was the way out for immigrants probably still today, but extremely Entrepreneurship is new cool. It's an American thing But if you were an entrepreneur in the 80s and 90s if you said that word that means you were a loser with an idea right like I you know and so I Was in a very weird place my whole world outside of my parents were telling me that I was a loser My teachers were telling me I was a loser my friends parents were telling me I was a loser because I was getting Ds and Fs and The only way you were scored as a child at all. There was no, you know I never understood how in eighth grade I'm making three thousand dollars a weekend and And I'm a loser Because I have Ds and science so I think you know when people ask me like struggles or things that nature my narrative for most of my life probably from like eight years old to to 1617 18 was I was positioned as I would not be successful Because I wasn't going to go to Harvard Yeah, I got us back and I never saw anybody the entrepreneur the only entrepreneur I saw that looked like me on TV was Frenchy Santa for the junk man I Mean it wasn't even a conversation like I it's I wish you know, you know first of all I don't truly wish I and be nothing but it would have been really cool to be growing up me during this era Right like it would have been really fun First of all my parents and I always joke that I would never have graduated high school ever if eBay came out a decade early I would have sold my entire family let alone everything in the house So Yeah, I mean look I think we everybody deals with stuff, you know, I I Love competition Right. I love competition. So I think that's really saved me like even when I don't have adversity. I fabricate it That's my friend. I secretly secretly think that I've held back my financial upside Because I love the process so much. I Genuinely know that I could be more wealthy and like sometimes think back to the last ten years of some of the decisions I'm making I prefer the hard way Do you like the process because cuz it's my oxygen? The process is my People cheat you if you go and you give and you hire them for the process and you don't know it No, I always feel like somebody's gonna hold me hostage to my business if I don't know that process Yeah, I don't even think about other people I'm being dead serious like it's unbelievable how much Zero outside influence hits me, right? And so like Instagram is really interesting to me right now because it's an important platform I'm spending a lot of time on it But it's probably the most Motivational version of myself right I only have a minute for video and I can only do quotes and pictures and so I'm fascinated by That's where my growth is right now. Yet. It's such a single sliver of who I actually am It's just one piece of who I actually am But when and the reason I bring that up is it's hard to explain that's why this is fun We can like sit here and really get deep into this stuff in detail And I don't think about outside forces So when I say things in a one-minute video like who gives a shit if it's who the president is one way left right? I don't care. That's one version of me talking about this. I'm not worried about anybody else I So the one consistent in my life, I still have nightmares. That's actually something I've never said I used to have nightmares And it was a very reoccurring nightmare for me It was that my family and I were going back to Belarus on a plane and the plane would crash and Every time Different people from my family usually one or two three people would survive It was very dark and like probably in modern parenting Like my parents would be forced to send me somewhere to like check out what was wrong with me, but it was consistent I would tell you I had that dream 50 times 50 times between second and Seventh grade I dreamt that my family had a Flight crash and one or two of them would survive and we'd walk through snow and it was very you know weird The reason I tell you that's where in the reason you you asked the question in an interesting way 15 and now the only consistent in my life has been Perspective and gratitude It's the only consistent in my life Why I'm saying perspective and gratitude every morning I wake up and I make pretend that's that my mother or children or wife die Every day every day. I did it today. I quickly flash in my mind what it would feel like because I'm very in tune with myself if My son Xander who's four years old got hit by a car like crossing the street I Promise you if you're in touch with your feelings and you can trick yourself to feel it even right now I felt it a little bit and really fucking hurts like Nothing else matters. I'm completely driven by gratitude. I keep things in very simple perspective I Went up with a very lovely lady in the elevator. She goes do you know how many people who inspire though? I sure do I'm thrilled and very in tune with my ego. I'm also very thrilled and in tune with my humility I think I'm the best and I think that if I disappear tomorrow Nobody really gives a shit and so that yin and yang is very important to me And so what I do consistently and have for 30 years now is I keep things in perspective This is this feels real nice admiration fam selfies, but I don't know. I'm just I've got it very calc. I understand what it is everybody in this room They probably were like you and I when we were focused on our career and getting there You know mark humans funny when he said a girlfriend said it was you know the business and he said what's your name again? so You know We all got to that point right now lives at what point Did you get to the point where you said okay now? I have to flip the 80 20 and now I have to go and start Being with my family and I have to make sure I put that time in And I have to because you probably had a healthy paranoia like me like listen. I've done so much to get here I have to stay and before you know what your life can go like that right like And now I know it's extremely important to go home with your family I have a new 11 month old and I know you you have a young baby at home At what point of your life did you say wait a minute? Let me find a healthy balance or did it start from the beginning? I haven't Yeah I'm gonna tell you guys the truth. I haven't meaning I run them in parallel I'm not crippled by the current political correctness of parenting You're looking at a kid who didn't see his dad until he was 14 years old and we have the greatest relationship of all time I'm gonna love him and he slept home every single night, but I never saw him once That doesn't mean my workaholic nature will work for me and my kids. I don't take that for granted I I think that you need to know how to breathe I know what makes me breathe my family makes me breathe, but I've got to do what I want to do Like I have to I'll just break And so I I think of it as an in extremes the reason I answer it I don't is I don't think you find balance in any way other than your own balance And I think that over communication with your partner and the variables in that relationship or the key right now I have that conversation with my wife In coming years. I'll have those conversations with my kids But for me, I'm very concerned about People posturing to work life balance when I know that work life balance is extremely individual Everybody in here has different work life balance. You also have different work life balance at different times in your life I Didn't have as much work life balance as some other people the last five years But it now also allows me to afford to have work life balance with my children and my family in a very different way As my daughter Misha is now seven and she can go on business trips with me The only conversation I had I had was with my wife saying school's bullshit Be okay with me taking Misha out of school for two days She might miss what a science test, but she'll always remember going with daddy to anaheim He gave a talk and then we went to disneyland for the day, right? So I think that um My answer to that is I haven't I work on it every day I communicate it with my wife often. Do you work on it internally because see I internally I want to know what do you do because I have 10 goals. I read this the first time I ever read this and thinking grow rich when I was 16 years old I goal set and every single night five nights of the week I read 10 goals at night before I go to bed because I want to dream about those And I read the same 10 goals in the morning when I wake up Does that work because when I was like in high school I used to try to dream about hooking up with chicks, but then it would switch quickly to some other But my six goals my six goals are about health faith and religion in cases They aspire in six months and then I have three other goals five or ten years 20 years Do you have any kind of method like now as you say you're working on it? I'm the most binary duty. You'll meet I love the journey. I wish health and happiness like health for my family is like Like big I feel I you know you guys have known me And I've known myself through a very lucky period which has been my entire life, which is You know three of my four grandparents died before I was born or one died right after so I never knew them We have a very small family, right? I have three cousins, you know, so I just haven't dealt with a whole lot of death like you know, I think When I have to deal with death in my inner circle I'm curious how I'm going to play it out, but I um, I'm really binary like I love the process more than the riches and the Fames I have that goal to buy the New York Jets that makes it fun That's a big goal They'll take me some time to do that when people ask me when you're going to buy the jets and I always say 25 years from now They're disappointed I'm pumped I've always found that it's amazing to me Like like they're like literally this I'm like I'm like it's three billion dollars. I have work to do Um But yeah, man, dammit. I'll tell you like I uh, I want legacy I think the reason I'm liked is because I'll reply to somebody who says they're on the way here To see me talk on twitter and reply to her like like I I I'm playing a different game. I Oh, tyler's filming today's daily v Yet I met with a former employee and he flat out like broke the wall and he was like dude. I just have to ask you like Why did you take that meeting? It's a former employee One that you fired one that came to tell you that they were sorry for not getting it She pitched you stuff You didn't get anything out of it Like I think the way you put it was you could have used that time to make money or some or do business And and I said he said why'd you do that and I said Because making money isn't the only thing that interests me if you want crappy meetings you gotta come on short I So you're open like that and I'm not talking about the health That's it. That's it. That's it That's it Because everything else I'm in control In business. I'm a beast Like I will always be successful in business I was from six years old and I am now like some people are pretty some people can are athletic Some people are you know, whatever. I'm a fucking ninja at business I Am I know how to make money You emphasize and I know the hard work is by far. Well, it's the most controllable Like you're not, you know, like it feels so controllable to me when somebody complains So people get my message confused or like you're always talking about hustle wears life wears. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no If you're 100 happy like I am then I got no advice for you You figured it out. But you know what who talks to me, you know who cries to me I want my business to be bigger. I want to make more money. Like that's what they're talking to me about So if you know when my rich friends complain to me about not spending enough time with their family They're really easy to give advice to too Spend more time with your family This shit is binary Stuff is so basic. We complicate it. Yeah, so to me There I'm telling you the truth like one thing I've been thinking about a lot lately It's funny that you brought this up literally last night I took me like a little bit longer to fall asleep than normal because I was on a high I took a I flew to San Francisco took a one-hour meeting and then flew back I thought that was funny and interesting and I enjoyed the commuting to San Francisco and it took me An extra 30 minutes to fall asleep and it made me realize. Oh my god. I fall directly to sleep every night every night Which I think speaks to peace Like, you know, like I go to I mean 360 days a year I fall dead asleep within seconds. You can walk into my house rob the shit out of me because I'm sleeping I'm keeping it clean. Yeah, I know You know, we all have these fundamentals in business It got us someplace and I think that I drifted away from it at certain points and many of us do when we get to a certain level Of being comfortable and happy. Is there any fundamentals that you revisited? Because you lost them at certain points where you thought they weren't necessary I lost my hustle and I don't talk about this that often either But I've thrown it out for a few minutes around 29. I got more there was a six to nine month period where it clearly to me I was complacent I just got married, you know, and so that was a new variable Yeah, I just remember my 30th birthday with literally my 30th birthday. I was driving to the store I looked myself in the rear view mirror and I said you're full of shit Your mouth is ahead of your actions You ain't buying the jets. You're not going to buy a jet. You can't buy a jet airplane Like get your shit together and that's literally when I decided to start wine library tv and go into the web 2.0 thing and so I revisited my hustle On my 30th birthday and I've never worked harder since and it's been compounded the moment I I'm working harder Right this second than I ever have in my entire life That's why I started the lev just wanted to put all of you on notice like you're not working as hard as I am And I wanted to do that because people think they're putting in enough work They're just not I was just having hundreds of conversations where people thought they were working hard enough For their ambition That's the key like if your ambition, you know your ambition dictates what you have to do And I'm happy when people have ambitions that allow them to work 40 hours a week and they're thrilled I just want as many people to fall asleep at night the way I do And I and I think the only way you really do that is you have a real conversation because everybody's bullshitting themselves Putting that you're a ceo in your instagram profile doesn't mean that you're a successful entrepreneur It means you're trying to be one Let's talk about some ceo and some innovation, you know many people in this room are public speakers They advise people we go around the world we speak to people I notice I don't know about you, but half the time they want me to talk to their staffs or anything else It's about innovation thinking outside the box. How do you get people within their cooperation to be motivated? You find that the same thing and if so How real are they are? Most of the companies doing something about that or are they just sitting there and they talk rah rah rah? They clap their hands they go back to the same crap they've been doing that one Because the leaders of these companies are full of shit Because they didn't create the framework for innovation in their organization They just want to point fingers and say you need to be innovating better yet the rules and the bonuses And the game is structured for not innovation And the reason you got such a heavy head nod is people know that like they tell you to innovate But then when you do anything outside the box, they put you right back in it. Is there anything that they can do? Companies that have five people companies that have five thousand what can they do? What are the first steps you think they can do to really? Activate it without disrupting their current operation by take the most practical answer I've ever given anybody on this is take 20 percent of your money your energy your organization your people And make it go roguest buck let them play Let it play however you want to define it with no rules And then run your company with the 80 percent that let's left over and build a good enough company that that 80 percent can afford For the 20 percent to be a negative roi experience Are there any companies out there doing it right? What companies can you name their doing it right? I don't know You know the truth is one of the biggest reasons when people ask me who's doing it right or who's doing it right on social media Or or which companies are doing it right? I don't know You know, I don't know because I didn't look under the hood You know a lot of people think certain things are going great and they're not you know Don't forget and you and this is something I want a lot of the youngsters in this room to think about if you're under 30 Let's see eight years if you're under 32 you need to hear what I'm about to say You've lived through a great economy every part of your professional career It's been good now for the last eight or nine years. It just has we've bounced back since 2009 10. We've only been growing There's only been growth like no matter what anybody says that's what's happening. So I'm very concerned about the next bubble burst Let's talk about that. So I am not Getting into politics. That's not what we're here for. We're here to talk about how we empower ourselves But let's talk about this. Yes, whether it whether it is somebody going to make this country great Whoever was going to be whether it is I'm going to stay on welfare whether I'm going to go to a school Let's talk about the fact that the number one job for males in this country is driving trucks But when autonomous vehicles come around you uber drivers and males are going to be out of business Let's talk about the number one job for females are Secretaries and assistants, but virtual assistants are coming and they're going to be out of business No matter who's making america great now 50 years old I'm driving a truck and I'm going to be happy because this is going to be 11% growth in the next five years Then all of a sudden bang ups bang american express poster surface uber automated you're all fired What am I going to do then because I'm sitting here telling you that america's going to be great. I'm going to be good forever Yeah, I mean look that that's going political like anybody anybody that thinks the president of the united states Whether it's barack or donald or bernie or hillary is going to help them. They're a fucking loser Straight up. I promise you you are that means you need somebody I So like whether you're whether your president is for minorities and females or your president is You know for the 26 year old white male that's got no skills. Here's the punchline. The market is the market What is the 54 year old going to do adjust? Or lose right, but how do we how do we get that message out to say you know what you could probably drive a truck to your 55 You can program and tech and do those till you're knighted talking to bmw They said that they can't get enough kids to be to be technician because their theory is the old The old the old mechanic with the big grease on his shirt. I was talking to the head of the Heavy machinery operations meaning crane operators. They said their jobs are empty for 15 months These kids can go to school for one year come out make 150 000 hours, but yet they're going to a school 50% of them will retire with a title of a job that doesn't exist today They're staying in school for four years happens digital classes. They're leaving with 300 000 and they still don't know how to operate anything So how do we get the parents in this room to save that money? How do we get the kids in this room? Well, not kids in this room, but who's going to watch us online to understand what they need to do move ahead and not think A diploma is going to save me the president is going to save me Well, there's going to save me or anything else. How do we what happens then what needs to happen? carnage Carnage needs to happen People are complicit. Here's most people's strategies in life I mean, I I really have no passion for this conversation Like if you are not capable in 2017 to google shit and figure out what's going on in the world, fuck you I'm being dead. By the way, I'm being really serious like what role does the government play or thought leaders or this and that Whatever that cliche statement of like the teacher comes when the student is ready, right? I believe in that thing like like I don't know like I'm not Lots of things happen Like lots of things happen in life, right? I woke up one morning and realized, you know what? This liquor shipping law is never going to get better There's dirty politician money. They're going to keep paying this off and I'm not going to spend the rest of my life Worrying about what the right thing to do is and what's right. No, they're going to keep paying off Politicians state by state and because I'm the biggest I'll always be picked on so I adjusted I started over I started over Like I started over like this whole wine library thing and I got so lucky guess what I own 0% of wine library because it was under my father's name So I had no collateral to even start it started what VaynerMedia by getting somebody to pay me $80,000 to do a marketing campaign And I built it and so that's what's going to happen and everybody has their version Not everybody has my business talent to build billion dollar companies But if you're making 74,000 or 197,000 or whatever you're making and your market gets fucked I don't see truck driver johnny feeling bad for rick the bookstore owner because amazon came along This happened this has happened forever. Isn't that the first time to innovation fucked shit up? Nobody's crying for the farmers in middle america. Nobody's crying for the people in cleveland who own the docks This is what always happens So this is what's up now And so what 55 year old charles has to do when he is out of a job is get another job Whatever that job is So if charles is smart and has skills He's teaching himself something now to be ready for three years from now But charles wants to watch football But charles wants a drink at the bar so he needs to put his 20% into what's going on in the future mister That's right. You're damn right I'm just like I want to stay on this for a second because this is massively important No, it's very important. I told we talked to people every day and maybe just don't get it And and then they will lose Like we have to start getting into meritocracy Like somebody should lose If they're not seeing where the puck is going If you're driving a truck today, you know, it's coming You've heard it somebody told you At a bus stop at a truck stop over dinner somebody brought up this theory So either you take it seriously and you start educating yourself or you don't Like that's the game Nobody's gonna fix that Nobody can help you with that That's life and that's the historic nature of human beings forever So just because we're now living and it's our turn to go through something This has always happened Right it's just happening faster. I think Great adjust So let's let's let's go channel for a minute. So let's talk about social media because I think that um, I recommend you book always Um, jab, jab, jab, right hook, but you know, you and I went out at dinner and I think that you said to me Well, I'm going to you were doing snapchat then you want the insta story this and that and I said, you know Most of us grew up with you know, be them, you know, don't be a jack of all trades be a master of one And I want to kind of do this and I and you reminded me kind of the Joker You know when he said in that badminton movie I'm like a crazy dog chasing a car. I don't know what I would do when I get to it You just move on move on move on I said it before it you have way more influence on social media than I do Obviously, you're doing something right. How do you pick which one to move on? Or you just keep going and the compounds on all platforms till they all come together somewhere just explain your theory Because it's broken my theory of be the master of one and not a jack of all. I think I'm the master of attention I'm just not romantic on a micro where it is So I think I'm speaking the same language as you I think my master isn't Facebook my master craft isn't to tweet well My master craft is to know where all your attention is and to be there and put out quality content that brings you value Contextual to that platform. So my master ship is attention trading and then we're looking at social media Like you guys are going to have a real brain twist if you've got me at the social media guy in 17 years Because I'm going to be onto something else Or not I have no idea but wherever your eyes and ears are I'll be there I'm going to open it up in one second. I want to turn on in one second. Don't turn on the live feed right now I just have to ask you another question man, man, so I I've gotten on the same stage a few times and you You will curse like a sail like really bad I will get on after you and I will say yeah, she was pissed and then they'll pull me aside and say You were pissed like so And I think you know, listen, I don't see and yeah, of course whatever. I have to be your fan. I'm very respected Why do you why do you believe why do you not have to get the belief? Why do people Buy that from you and I understand this is keeping it real But I mean there's keeping it wrong, right? Why do people accept that from you and have you lost money? Because you just beat me to it plenty of people don't accept it. I wish cAA was here right now. Zach you hear No, like we've I've lost tons of money. I just don't give a fuck Here's what happened if you think here's here's the truth. I've never really clarified this I wasn't a public speaker. I owned a liquor store in New Jersey. I was a businessman I'm 32 years old before I ever took a stage like I didn't know like I wasn't a personality This was not in the blueprint Okay What happened was I got invited to an internet conference. I'm like, okay, I'll do it and who the heck knows what happened They gave me the mic I got up there and the best way I can explain it is In my formative years of growing up. I listened to an obnoxious amount Of richard pryor chris rock and eddie murphy and when I watch the way I give keynotes I do think it's got a comedic timing Delivery in the style of those characters. And so I guess that's what happened Because of course most people would say listen. I'm just like I got left back and I never graduated high school You know my my friends they wrote the movie belly about them. So trust me. I first once twice in my life Some people would say it's a limited vocabulary Some people would say that you know what it's it's uh, it's an inability to be articulate You know and we know you're a smart guy already you come with the most important thing which is common sense You don't feel that anytime you should adjust that I already know the answer but I just want to hear No, I think if you're gifted with not worrying about anything else You just roll if you feel that I offended you or that I'm crass or that I'm not good or what have you that's your truth And I apologize I like I want to try one thing wrong with you. Okay Fuck How to feel All right, so we're gonna we're gonna open up um We're gonna open up to some live streaming really quickly We're gonna have a couple of questions from twitter and then a couple from um the people in the audience So who will give me the questions? We're gonna start with the audience first. Awesome start with the audience first. Let's do that The first one I gotta cool people there's like 10 of us here. We would love to take a selfie with you. Hold on The question is everybody's gonna have to learn off tonight. Maybe that's possible Please make sure that everybody in this room learns off your questions. Yes. Amen. Absolutely. The lesson here is to be bold. Yes. Yes done Question number two. My name is Natalia from the Bronx. Hey natalia friend, Brittany Hey, she's from Miami and we have muscles and millions. We are just starting out. We are a lifestyle and cool new brand We're about fitness for our muscles and millions Millions millions. I want to make sure everybody hurt muscles and millions Go ahead. So my question to you Yes So I so I'll try to make this a learning moment for everybody. Thank you. You're welcome. So I think You know, I'm a big fan of Jab jab jab right hook I'm able to duck right hook right hook right hook right hook And so I think the biggest way for me to do things is when I feel like there's value in return When you get to I mean, I couldn't imagine what you're living through I think the biggest way to get somebody who's got more leverage than you do Is to disproportionately bring them value to even the score to make something happen Yeah Right I'll tell you why because everybody did that All right, we gotta go into the next question I think it's about bringing value your t-shirts bring me no value So you need to figure out what brings me value and then you have a shot of executing So we always teach that it's really what's in it for the person you're pitching Um, no matter what you're pitching Whether you're waking up in the morning trying to get into the bathroom before your husband or wife You're trying to get your child on the school bus and you're saying, please I'll take you to chucky cheese. You just get on the school bus right now It's always what you're what's your pitching? We all get pitched that type of stuff But you have to find a way to bring value and honestly You most likely will see him again and again again if you're persistent But the day that he feels you're going to be successful with or without him and you could bring him value Then it's worth the conversation I think tenacity is way more commoditized than people think Exactly There's a lot of people hustling It's a value exchange game. The reason I popped and have this fan base is there's a lot of people saying hustle There's a lot of people putting out content I'm disproportionately try to bring more value in detail and motivation and effort and engagement And I and I do answer a ton of dms, but I answered dms the entire six hour flight yesterday from instagram I didn't even get close because i'm one dude and nobody's replying as me because that's not me Nobody's replying as me. You ever get a wink or a hello or I can't wait to see you. That's me When I and I'll give you one last before we go when I used to have shirts like that I couldn't hear an artist to wear them I look with the artist's crew and their name on it and then I was sent into him and it was a Collab with us and I would tell them take all the proceeds and I'll sell it to them take all the proceeds and give it to your favorite charity And when he did it and when he did it the supply and demand of lifestyle brands was much lower It was more expensive to do it. It was harder. He figured it out the amount of people that have some fucking saying on a t-shirt right now Is unlimited So you've got a real fucking challenge because the supply and demand of your game has gotten much worse Good There's through venture for america And um the one issue is I'm curious how you guys judge when you're working on a new business or you're investing in a new founder How do you know when to tell them to give up or how do you know yourself? Because you want to be consistent you want to keep working and figuring it out. So what's your I want to expand on that with with that question for gary. I want to know exactly that and I also want to know when you're working with them What do you instill in them as well when they're On their path. So when you tell them to give up Now what do you say you need to do this every day? So I think the key is to not be consistent Because you can't give consistent feedback for everybody Like I wanted to give feedback based on what I was feeling there But I might feel something different here the key is I found that somebody is either impatient or too patient And so that's always a key for me like some people are romantic And some people are not romantic at all and so I think I'm usually pushing in the other direction where they're over indexing Because that usually tends to happen in the balance of what they need. Some people are just going to hold on so You know So I just did a show right with apple where we're doing these apps. I mentored people. It was a little bit different We had to like be like the voice we had to coach them this one girl just didn't want to hear it from me I'm like you're not going to win Like it's this is not going to happen Maybe I'm going to be right or wrong but I was pushing her to be she was so romantic and in outer space But she didn't want to let go right on the flip side. There was other people that were kind of rocky I'm like no no you got something and pushed towards it. So the truth is when I look at young entrepreneurs I don't give blanket advice. I give individual advice Of the moment of where they are and what their business is doing every to really give advice Yeah, I mean, I you know, I do a lot of side businesses like I've only really run two core businesses wine library and VaynerMedia. Those are the only ones I've ever really gone all in on But yeah, I mean I've started side projects I did a thing called VaynerToys where this whole ebay flip challenge I tried to do with buddies like cork the wine social network I have jumped off of businesses that I owned a big piece of but I wasn't the operator I haven't done it when I've been the operator. I've seen them through So I haven't had that exact I'm the guy steering the ship and I have to jump off. I haven't had that experience But I also don't build businesses for anything other than forever Biggest problem with a lot of people in here and the reason they will lose the single reason they will lose It's from the day they start their business. They're building it to sell They want the money That's why they lose Thank you Thanks, so what do you think the future is of advertising influencers between influencers coming in what Recommendations would you have for young influencers in their different markets? I think influencer marketing is going to have an incredible golden year of a decade I think we're in the beginning of it and I'm very fond of it. I think it's under priced I think the top is overpriced So the people that moved quickest and have big audiences I think are overpriced Because people think they're more valuable than they are you got to look at engagement the amount of people have a million fans on instagram But they don't really have a community things like that But I'm a very I mean word of mouth always worked So I'm a I'm very bullish My recommendation is don't run around saying that you're an influencer Think about how to bring value to your audience create influence and then monetize it Again, we are living through the greatest era of Again, you just put it on your profile and you think you're it that's like me putting on my profile right now basketball player Cool, but I'm not getting paid by the mix Right and so like just saying you're an inflate the amount of counts that like hit me up on dm Like you know, I'm an influencer. I click and I'm like you have 800 people following you Yeah, but I'm like no no no You're not an influencer by definition of anybody's influence You're an so if you if you have that in your profile put a word in front of it aspiring influencer But it's a I'm a very bullish on it I think it's underpriced right now I also see because it's human beings a scenario where in two or three years it's going to be grossly overpriced You just have to follow the market right now. It's underpriced All right, we'll say one more from the from the in-house audience Ted Thanks, my question is scalability Inversive people yes tough That's my pain point right now. We've gone a great almost nine years now and we've hit a spot. I can't find good people you Invest in people and that's one of your things. Are you the decision maker? Yes. I think that's a lot of agencies as well I think that's your way. Yeah, okay You acquire great people just yep that I work with okay. That's my pain. What do you do? Because none of the sites work. Yeah, I agree. Is network. How many people do you interview for every person that you hire? What's the rough number you think at least 10 to 12? So it sounds like you're just gonna have a funnel problem because that's not that bad. Yeah I so here's my answer I love the hustle I really think I really think that people's Flaw is so one of the reasons I think we've been successful is I'm not crippled by hiring I focus on firing So I think way too many people are fancy and think that they're so good at hiring Everybody's got this dream that they're so good at hiring. I think I have Unbelievable eq skills and people intuition. I think it's actually all I've got and I've Mishired a ton So I think too many people are fancy and they're hiring they have this Bullshit self-esteem within themselves that are good at it So my answer to you is to if your number is one out of 12 and you can't get more in I would just hire three out of 12 Because I think people will surprise you my model is more of Vayner gets the most out of you and thus if you're a b you'll be a b plus with me I'm also not crippled. You know, I think you need b's and c's and like, you know, I love when people my friends are like How do you get your employees to care as much as you? I'm like, I don't The fuck should an employee care as much as I do? It's my business. They need to care about their life Do you bring in the b's and c's and make the maze sometimes and sometimes I think they're my staff start as the interns at one time Or another and from college, of course And I don't I don't look for the perfect person and though I want them to come in fit in a perfect way But they're gonna come in with your flaws. That's what I find but I would say that also everybody's definition of an a is different You know, I would just be more optimistic I mean that it's it's a funny little switch of optimism versus cynicism and pessimism on the hiring front that could really work for you And I think then it puts pressure on you to be better You know, I know that I'm have less of a filter in which puts pressure on us to be better at giving them opportunity to succeed Plus once they're in we spend most of the first three to six months auditing them and then reverse engineering them and putting them In the best position to succeed because not everybody does everything well I genuinely believe that I work for everybody that works for me Not the other way around we're going to take two questions from Live streaming. Yep. So people still have questions. I use the hashtag blueprint Gary v. That's Gary v To be So good at branding I created my username to be too silent fucking ease Eric davis asked Eric davis like the the Cincinnati Reds phenomenal baseball player Again the biggest fear I have right now is that we are in the greatest era of blanket advice Like it's just general advice like I have to move fast Like everybody tells me like vayner was not going to be successful if I moved to fast They were wrong because I'm fast. I like action like when I walk through vayner's office If it's quiet, I freak out. I like tell people I play music like I'm I need the action I need to go fast and I'm a good enough salesperson to Compensate for the overhead and I can stay ahead of it. I think you grow as fast as you're capable Right and I think that that person Eric davis needs to know how good he is To grow as fast as of course there's oh listen everything doesn't work And everything works. Let's play out the scenario. I grew too fast. I couldn't afford my staff I had a cup people then people got scared that we weren't stable. They quit and my shit got fucked up That's scary of going too fast. Let me tell you what happens way more often 90% of this room is going too slow and has left tons of money on the table, but they don't know it because it's hidden People are scared of the hidden and they're safe on the black and white It's obvious if you went too fast and you broke and you had to let people go It's not obvious to anybody if you're doing a million, but you should be doing three million, but you're going too slow people are scared Because they care about what other people think Next question very cool. All right. We have paul wolf. What's the most effective way to market a small business? Doing stuff that doesn't cost money So wine library first year 14 000 marketing budget I printed shit on my computer and went to the shorthills mall and put it on people's Wind like the end of the flyers when you're a fucking windshield like ghetto shit I wish I had fucking social media You like that, right? Like it was just like You do what you could have I mean, I love when everybody's like well, it's easy for you. It wasn't always Power broke, you know like it wasn't always like you weren't with me When I was in my house printing on that slow-ass computer You know 20 off the case of wine and then I grabbed the whole thing and then I fucking woke up at 6 a.m And went to the shorthills mall and just went and put that on the flyer. You weren't with me One last one All right, I'm gonna say one last one. Let me can I can I expand on that? Yeah We're fancy We're fancy because it's been good for eight years. I'm telling you right now Look yourself in the mirror if you have ambitions to win you're fancy You're fancy People think things are below them. I still don't think things are below me Like nothing is below me. I'll do anything People got fancy you want to play the part of entrepreneur You can act all you want the market's coming wait till there's no VC money Wait you actually have to make money Stop comparing Everybody's sizzle reel to your blue for real everybody's going through the same stuff So you have to exercise the power broke no matter if the people I know exercise power broke more than anybody else The people that have money 100% all the all the lines that you know my partners I put out after we were already established instead of going and A normal clothing line they take about 120 days and about 50,000 miles to create the entire product line I'd go to Ralph Lauren rip the label off of here sell some embroidered crap wanted the name Paid somebody 2,500 put in a video and sit there watching the phones going to ring Phone rings. All right make some make some more shirts And I say time I save energy and I save the cost and the hustle never stops when we're talking about that You have to think opm is other people's money. No, it's other people's manufacturing mind power marketing Mentors and making money of other people's mistakes. I want everybody to give it up for the big airy b Yeah And how to be here with us. I appreciate it. Let's get the fuck up out of here Thank you Great, thank you. I still want to talk about fancy. Oh wait, let's talk about fancy Can we stay another minute? Can we stay on the I'm not I'm not fulfilled yet On on this I mean this I don't know Tyler. How am I doing? All right, yana's in the crowd, right? She's somewhere here yana um We're fancy We have to we have to have this conversation in this space Like we've got it every entrepreneur in here has it so much better. It's called the internet at scale So many things are easier than what we came up with Right, you can DM the person and maybe get to them I'm I just I want you guys to win which is why I talk about this Like when the money dries up when the economy gets tighter All of this goes away and the majority of this market right now is on you know on on bubblegum and dreams and like You've got to know how to make money Like you have to have a business your product has to bring value Like the tried and true is the only thing that's going to make you successful People running around here trying to raise money. Oh, I can't get raised money because I didn't go to that kind of school Or they don't I don't get I can't raise money because I didn't come from that kind of neighborhood. Don't raise money make money Doesn't take a hero to give up a piece of their business Make it. So should you so all the balls to the wall concept should you quit your day job or not? I think you have to be practical and hungry Like you should not quit your day job if you've got crazy compounding interest on your student loans Or you've got to pay your mortgage But what you shouldn't do is have that job talk shit that you're going to build some big business one day And then at six o'clock at night not work Like you need to go to sleep at three a.m Like you need to back your fucking mouth up Everybody's talking shit Everybody's talking shit everybody's talking shit Everybody loves to hit me up Gary v hustling. I look at their account and they're like playing ping pong at 430 Like people don't understand what hustle is I took one vacation in my 20s But I have crazy aspiration you should take 11, but don't come telling me you're going to buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers And so like the first thing is figure out who you are and what you want And then deploy real self-awareness But i'm telling you the thing that i'm fearful of and the reason I didn't step off stage yet is It's been so good for almost a decade. This has been easy. There's so much money out there Everybody's getting money for their dumb ideas that make no money And if you're not then you should really even question that Like if you haven't been able to raise money you really fucking suck Because the market is ridiculously ridiculous like terrible like people getting funded for everything So if you haven't been able to figure out how to get money you're a triple loser So the way to answer that and punch me in the face and tell me that you're not is go make money Instead of dwelling why you haven't raised it. I promise you something about money money is real funny real funny Money doesn't care what you look like You may think it does but that's your fucking excuse Money wants to make money if it's I'll give a patriots fan money. That's how much I want to make money You understand you can say anything you want about you don't look the part White woman black woman not from this country money wants to make money So if you're not getting it you suck So then go make it instead of dwelling that the old white guy in vc lands not giving me any money It's because your shit sucks And so the only way you can prove me wrong is to go execute You
