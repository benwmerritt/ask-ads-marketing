## Transcript
I started as the office manager and then we became business partners. If you get a chance to be close to the sun, work with a CEO, a chairman, somebody in a senior position. What people don't see is you want to be the assistant of the assistant of the assistant. You have to be. Not the junior manager. Hell, I'd rather be his personal trainer. However close you can get. You should do it. You must do it. Like that was a big lesson for me and I just started to study every paper that went in the office, every paper that went out. Just listening, learning, creating a network with everyone coming to see him, learning how to build relationships. Like it was the best training I could have ever asked for. And by the end of my four years with him, we ended up being business partners. I don't think I've ever had such a close intimate relationship with any of my authors as I do today. Maha and I have worked together for almost a decade at this point. Yep. Today, we are going to be talking about her new book. I'm super excited about talking about the seven rules of self-reliance. I'm excited that Maha is here and I think now for the next two to three minutes, like always, I always like to say like comic book number one, the origin story. Like who are you and why did you write this book? Well, first of all, Gary, being here is extraordinarily special to me, not just because of our relationship, but because all the things I've learned from you. So I want to start by saying thank you and there's a big piece of you in that book. And I know listeners will resonate with some of the stuff I write about in the book about Gary. Okay. Born and raised in Minnesota. I'm 100% Egyptian. Yes. I lived in a very small town in Minnesota where I was the poster child for diversity. There was a lot of like blonde hair and blue-eyed people in Minnesota. I lived in Minnesota until I was 27. I worked at General Mills. I worked in sports marketing. I worked in the coolest brands, but my mother was sick. At 14, she had multiple sclerosis and for a long time, my parents who are both Egyptian wanted to go back to Egypt. So at 27, I moved back to Egypt and I wanted to didn't speak the language, didn't have any friends. At 27, you're a professional. So like you are working. You don't, I didn't have a network professionally or personally to lean on, except for my family. And I needed to find a job and I'm like, okay, I'm going to go work at a Pepsi, a Coca-Cola, a PNG, an American company in Cairo. Right. You and I grew up in that era where, you know, for everybody who's listening, now there's being a creator. Now there's startups. Yeah. Now there's sports marketing. Now there's all these things, but in our era, if you were like somewhat creative, like you are like I am, like these consumer packaged good companies. Was the it job. Was an it job. The marketing. Especially when you go international. Yeah. So 1997, just to put everyone in context, it's 1997. I wanted to get a brand marketing job. Couldn't find one, but I got offered to be the office manager for a local billionaire. And I went home and I was devastated. I told my dad, like, I can't believe I'm going to be an office manager. I had this cool job at General Mills. I have my master's degree. I'm over qualified. This is the worst. Is that what women in the Middle East are secretaries? And my dad had a vision that I didn't have. He said, listen girl, you just moved here. You don't know anybody. The office manager in the Middle East is like the chief of staff in the US. You should go in, put your head down, prove to him that you can do more than this job, but you have to listen and learn first. And I didn't have his insight. I took his advice and it changed the trajectory of my life. You know, one of the things I always say is like, get it. It's funny, you know, my content inside out over this decade. You've heard, we've never actually, I know that story. We have never really actually in a backseat of a car or traveling together, talked about this that I recall. I always tell kids, get as close to the sun as possible. You can't. You should, you have to. I believe today, right this nanosecond where kids have, with talent, have real optionality, right? Last night, Jets win. I'm a static. Yeah. It's 1130 at night. Like the game's over. Yet I go, you know, grab a water, a kid comes up to me, Gary Vee. Can I get a selfie? Yes. Gary Vee, can I ask you a question? My brother and I are going to start a real estate company. These kids like 19 to 23. My brother and I are starting a real estate company tomorrow, like ASAP. Like what's your advice? And I looked in the dead and faced and said, get a job for a year. Yep. Because it was just so clear to me in a nanosecond. I'm like, what are these two characters going to do? Yeah, I mean, like a real, like if that kid could go get coffee. For somebody important. For somebody at related real estate. Get coffee for one year. The next day, the likelihood of his business being good is one trillion percent better. I mean, I learned so much, like no job is beneath you. If you get a chance to be close to the sun, work with a CEO, a chairman, somebody in a senior position, you learn about the ins and outs of the business, what matters, how they take, how they operate. Or you love nightlife and somebody just opened up a hot group and you just want to like be a bartender. Just get there. Get in. And by the way, I was about to say, notice what I was about to say. I was about to say bartender and I pulled it back. No, no, the assistant. The assistant to the assistant. Like the closer to the sun. Noah, a tau group, don't get a job at tau at bartending, though I'm sure that's fine. If you have goals to be Noah, what people don't see is you want to be the assistant of the assistant of the assistant. You have to be. Not the junior manager. Like if I could be the junior manager at a company like that, or the assistant of the assistant, if I want to be the Noah, if I want to be the Eugene, if I want to be the Scott, zero bond, if I want to be the private club, and I want to work at zero bond, like one day I want to build a nightlife under like Taman Empire. I don't want to work at zero bond. I want to work for Scott, even if I'm very far away. Hello, I'd rather be his personal trainer. Yeah, that his hitting coach at tennis. However close you can get, you should do it. You must do it. Like that was a big lesson for me. And I just started to study every paper that went in the office, every paper that went out, just listening, learning, creating a network with everyone coming to see him, learning how to build relationships. Like it was the best training I could have ever asked for. And by the end of my four years with him, we ended up being business partners. I ended up working on the largest IPO in the history of Egypt, the largest acquisition, the history of Egypt. I started as the office manager, and then we became business partners. And because I was willing to put my head down, put aside my ego, put in the hard work and let that what speaks for itself. And I didn't have that foresight that I stayed in the Middle East for 23 years. Can I interrupt you real quick? Yes. Team, I have a new acronym. I want to make some content on literally because of this. I just have to do more of this because I need to make new content. I want to come out with something like how I would approach starting your career. The acronym is love. Work close to the sun during your time with the sun. L learn. O observe similar but different. Yeah. V. Bring value. Value. Bring value. So it's value and E execute. I'll explain. I'll break it down in a separate video. That's incredible. I'm excited about it. Good. That's so true. Anyways, I ended up staying in the Middle East. I had opened up Weber Shanwicks as a big PR firm, opened in 18 offices for them in the Middle East, which I brokered that deal with Nagib and somebody else in the region, actually McCann Erickson in the region. Then I went on to be the head of communications and public policy at Google, launched Netflix in the Middle East, worked for them for five years. I worked for the ruler of Dubai. Real quick, somewhere in there, isn't this correct? Somewhere in there, you were thinking about doing your own thing, right? Yes. And then you did the Weber Shanwicks, right? Yes. Like it was that little moment. Yes. So I think that's an important moment for my listeners. Yeah. There was a moment after you were crushing with Nagib that you thought, I'm ready to go do my own thing. Yeah. And then when you were like tasting it, you ended up doing it more, not exactly that. You ended up, right? No, I did. So right after I left Nagib, we built Weber Shanwicks together. And then after building a business for Nagib and building Weber Shanwicks, I said, I should do it for myself. And this was 2004. I had no idea how to run a company. I had managing director. I was doing with Weber Shanwick, but I have a corporate structure supporting me. And I decided I wanted to be an entrepreneur. Can we talk about that for a second? What do you think I want to bring as much value? I mean, look, before I go any further, right this second, please go and type in seven rules of self-reliance into Amazon and pre-order the book. Like, but that's the punchline for me because I'm selfish on this one. I want all of you to buy the book. And in fact, buy many of them and give them to employees, friends, what have you. Now I want to be selfless and give as much value to the audience. You have something very valuable to give. I can't give this. You can. What are the biggest naivetez of a human when they have massive infrastructure around them? And they're a winner like you are and many that have worked for me. But they're young and there's other things to be learned yet. What do you think are the cliche naivetez when someone thinks it's them, but it's the infrastructure and them? Yeah. I mean, I learned the lesson the hard way. Like when I joined, I started my own company. I knew the difference very quickly between having the infrastructure or not. Like you have to learn how to build culture. You have to learn how to foster and lead a team. You can't lead by, I was a very difficult manager back then. I was like, let's get shit done and results, results, results. And then I learned from you actually it's about kindness. It's about people. It's about nurturing your team. It's about putting them first, not the work first. And the results will come out not just better, like even more valuable. Not just for you, but your clients. But I think I thought I knew things and I didn't know things. I knew how to do PR and comms, but I didn't know how to run a business. And I didn't know legal accounting, finance. I didn't know about HR and operations and empowering my teams and how to coach teams and how to get results from teams and how to train them and then trust them to do what you train them to do. I mean, I'm 20 years as an entrepreneur now, so it's much different case now. But it only evolved in the last, I would say six, seven years. It wasn't like that working over there. It was they led with like a stick kind of mentality. Very like you had to be the loud bowist. That was the culture there. And by the way, in America and in other first world, kind of powerhouses, China, Russia, Japan, London, the UK, there's just different versions of leading with fear. Yeah. Right. To your point, some is just loud. That's what we... You better fucking get that. I mean, my father was the extreme of this. I'm going to fucking fire you if you ever do that again. Extreme fear. But then there's also what a lot of people do, which is like clever fear. They make it seem like Kumbaya and be like, we're all in this together. It's all like Kumbaya and then very sly at the end. But we do all know, like, we'll all be at a job. Yeah, we're going to get fired if we don't deliver. And so it's hard. It's just like, unfortunately, and then people are like, yeah, Gary, fuck the companies. I'm like, no, no, no. Now let's talk about your accountability. Do you know why companies do that? I'll tell you why. We're recording this right now on Friday, September 20th. It is 1226. There's 30 people in my office out of the 2000 that could be. On my life, I promise you that 25% of my staff right now is not actually working and I'm actually paying. Yeah. How about that? So like people are like, yeah, Gary, you're awesome. Like you're always talking about kindness in companies. You're the man. I'm like, when I get those roses, I'm like, literally anywhere parking lot of a Jets game, meeting airport. I'm like, no, no. Do you know why companies do that? Because employees are always, it's cat and mouse, subconsciously for so many employees. This is where the employees that don't act like this get triggered. When I'm like, many employees, they think I'm talking. No, there are many employees that treat a business as if it was their own when it's not. But they're the ones that are holding up the 50 to 70% of employees that are looking for every angle. I did that in school. Do you know how many times I went and got a drink and went to the bathroom and went to the nurse in my K through 12 career? Let me give you the answer more than anyone on earth. Why did you do that? Because I was looking for the angles. I didn't want to be in the classroom. So I had a headache. I was thirsty. I had to poop. I would do anything to get out. I would use my charisma. One of the reasons I am me is I used to basically do stand up I would distract the first five minutes of the class because I could charm the teacher and I would try to entertain the class. I mean, I would try to chip away at two minutes. If I could get two minutes out of the 48 minute class that you were winning, you were winning. Where the teacher was distracted by me being like, Mr. Hall, what about the next game last night? If I like literally every class in my entire high school life, I would try to eliminate as many minutes from it as possible, both for the collective. Hey, Mr. Hall, what about the Jets Patriots game last night? Because I knew it was a Jets fan. I would get three minutes that way. Or if that didn't work, because many teachers knew what the fuck I was doing, it would be I have to go to the bathroom. When I found out that he legally couldn't say no. You just used it all the time. Maha, when I found out in eighth grade that a teacher couldn't legally say no, it changed my life. I went to the bathroom every class every day. Every day. Every day. It worked. So what I'm saying is I hated it or I didn't have a relationship with the school education system as it was structured. Many don't have that with their jobs. Thus, all the things that are happening now are happening. And that's why this is a tough game. You know? Yeah. And I even think when I was even running the business with Weber-Shanderberger on my own, like you learn a lot about bringing in a rock star into the team that can disrupt the culture and then just so it gets everyone else upset. So like I learned that the hard way. I hired this great guy. He was really smart, had great credentials, came in, destroyed my business, destroyed it. And I'm like, okay, we're not doing that again. We have to make sure that they are the culture fit, that they can match with the team. Like I learned that the hard way. Another thing, even when I was at Google, I hired, I got into the job. I was very overwhelmed. I was four months into it and I hired somebody. And it was a big mistake because by the time I actually learned what the role is and what the scope of the job was, I realized who I needed to hire as a team member and what skills and talents did they need. And I ended up having to fire her. It wasn't her fault, but I just, it's better to have an empty chair than have the wrong person in the chair. Great quote. You just need to be patient. And when nobody understands is when the wrong person's in a chair and their huge financial impact, nobody ever fires them, but it's secretly killing you. Yeah. And so those are the hard things I learned about managing and leading and hiring and firing and that type of thing. Let's take a massive step back. What are the seven rules? Okay. So let's talk a little about self-reliance first. Let's do that. Like as a general kind of concept. So a lot of people ask me like, why is it called self-reliance? Are you trying to teach people to be independent? And it's actually the opposite, G. It's the opposite. What I'm trying to say is what if you became valuable by knowing things, by having relationships, by having experience, if you relied on yourself to put yourself on the best foot forward, you can bring value to other people and be dispensable. And when I looked back at my 30 years in business, I said, it wasn't about what I did, because I am good at communications and PR and strategies. It's how I do it. How do you create value for people? How do you become a long-term player? How do you build your personal brand? How do you not wait and be a creator? So those are some of the seven rules of self-reliance. Rely on yourself to become a superpower by investing in yourself. I don't want to be left behind in life because I don't know things. So why not invest in learning things? And guess what? It's for free. YouTube is for free. This podcast is for free. You can learn from people. You can learn from anywhere. So try to rely on yourself to invest in knowing things, so you can be valuable for other people. I would argue that on that one, that is the punchline of my career. Like, because I'm obsessed with the end consumer, and there is nothing, not a politician, not a B2B concrete company, not a CPG, there's nothing on earth, not someone running from air. There's not one thing on earth that can point to not caring if they can communicate to humans to make the thing they want to happen happen. Happen, exactly. So I get value for sure, I agree. It's the moat. Yeah, so the first rule of self-reliance is stay low, keep moving, which is a military term when you're on your stomach and you're trying to stay low to keep moving and avoid getting hit. And the reason I say stay low and not low profile is stay low and stay focused on your work and put in the hard work. There's so many distractions in life. People are trying to distract us from what's important for our goals. Stay low, put your head down, put in the effort. I'm not an overnight success, you're not an overnight success, you have to put in the time, you got to put in the reps and keep moving because you are going to have setbacks, you are going to have economic failures, you are going to have a fire from your job. Like, it happens to all of us, including me. So the first rule of being self-reliant is knowing, okay, I'm going to have to put in the effort, and I'm going to have to know that there's going to be a journey that's going to coon some bumps in the road. Love, next? The second rule is be a value creator. So how do I create value for other people and not expect something in return? And so what I like to call making deposits in other people's trust banks, because I may or may not want to make a withdrawal. So for example, let's talk about how we met. I read your book, I was a long story, but I can tell you I read your book and then I met you. And then I was like, Gary has a company, he has people at his disposal, he's got offices around the world. Where can I bring him value? What's the one thing I might be uniquely qualified to share with him and cut it into a shortcut for him? Maybe it's talking about Dubai, maybe it's talking about the Middle East. So I try to listen to your business, where do you have offices, how do I anticipate your needs? Where can I create value for you and then deliver that? So that's a good example of being a value creator, is try to listen and anticipate needs. So that you can become indispensable for people by bringing them value time and again, it's consistency. You cannot be a one hit wonder. And you can be, but you're going to get one hit wonder results. Yes. Right. People that have had a one hit wonder song made some money, hopefully like had a moment, probably enjoyed those years, but like could literally walk down the street right now. Yeah. And you know, not be, I'll give you a great example. And this is, he's not a one hit wonder, he's actually amazing, but I had a funny moment the other day. Sunday, I had to fly somewhere. Yep. Charlotte. And I was walking in Newark and Jerome Bettis was walking. Football player. Yep. Just walking. And it was funny. I would like you, I could, I, because I'm such a big football fan and he has a very unique shape. He was a very specific. Big guy. I kind of like recognize him from his modern silhouette, like from far away. I kind of like nailed it. As some of you know around me, I've lost my vision up front, but man, I could see way far out. So I just like see him and I watch him walking towards me and I see a ton of people walking by and not one person recognize him. And I say to myself, if he was actively playing, that wouldn't be the case. If he was in Pittsburgh or Notre Dame, it would definitely not be the case. And so his value sits in certain pockets. And that's how I think about one time value. Like there's different moments of value. There's different things of that nature. Your approach thing is huge. I tell people all the time, 99% of people lose because when they want to approach someone, first 50% of those people just ask for something. Yeah, they want something in return. Hey, I want something from you. Very busy. Like it's insane. Devastating first step. You'll never get an A player to pay attention to because that's what happens to them all day long. They don't have the bandwidth. Yep. B, the smarter move is I'm going to give you something in return. Like you were talking about. The problem is 95% of people that do things do it the wrong way. Hey, Gary, I'm going to give you something that I can give you, but you have no value in. Right? Hey, Gary, here's a lamp. Like, you know, and that lamp is nice. I'll let me think of a different. Hey, Gary, I'd love to spend an hour with you and tell you how to do social media marketing because they think they have that to give. I'm like, I don't need that. Yeah. You need to find out what do they care about and then deliver that. But also you have to bring value with good intentions. Not that you want something in return. 100%. And I feel like if you do that purely with good intentions and you are actually an expert in that and can actually deliver it, that's priceless. 100%. I mean, most people to your point give with expectation and then they're let down and resentment. That's all over. Okay. Next. Don't be a waiter. Be a creator. So this happened to me. I was in Egypt. It was a long time ago. I was talking to somebody and he's like, maha, we were having tea and just talking about a lot of stuff in my life. And he was like, you're a waiter. And I was pissed. I was like, what? And he's like, you're a waiter. You're waiting for Mr. Right. You're waiting for, and they give you to give you a promotion. You're waiting for a bigger opportunity to come out. You're waiting to see what happens with your parents. My parents are both very sick at that time. You're not actually living your potential. You're not doing what you're probably capable of doing. And I went back and I was really pissed. I got home and I'm like, you know what? I am waiting. I'm not that I'm unhappy. I'm just coasting through life. But I feel like I can do more. I am capable of doing more. So how do you shift your mindset from being in the waiting mode to creating mode? Like what if I want to do something? I actually tell the story in the book of going to the Superbowl with you. I'm like, how can I create? And if I want to go to the Superbowl, how do I create something out of that that's meaningful? There's brands. There's media. There's you. You go to the Superbowl every year. You're in the advertising industry. Where can I bring value and create something new? Okay. Well, let's unlock what this radio row thing is. Let's unlock how we can bring press and bring media coverage. And I'll get to meet people and build relations because everyone's there at the same time. So how do you create those opportunities? And how do you think of them so that you can achieve them without waiting for you to ask me? You never asked me. Mahaa, can you go do some press for me at the Superbowl? You never once asked me. I have no time to ask. You know this about me. Like you know this because you're on the other side of this. I'm the greatest client ever. Ever. No, seriously. You never ask us for anything. I'm not happy about it. Yeah. I'm just not just you. I'm talking about my life. I am so busy. It's in client term. I'm like, you know, hey, right, uh, people, this will, because a lot of you are not clients to many different people. Let me give you the day to day comp. Everybody listening right now can understand what I'm about to say. Do you know many of you right now are signed up to services that are banging you every month and you haven't canceled it, even though you're not using it? You know my favorite one, the streaming services. There's somebody right now listening that literally has Paramount Plus and hasn't gone on in seven months and could actually use that 10 bucks or whatever back. I'm like that on big stuff. I'm so busy to your point. The reason you and I still work together versus all the other people that eventually get around to them like, you know what, I don't want to do it. Hey, Johnny, sorry. This is my favorite call, by the way. Yeah. When you're doing the right thing and you hate firing, there's always my favorite thing, which is peace of mind. Hey, Johnny, I don't want to work together anymore. I apologize, but I'm giving you notice. Whoa, whoa, go, Gary. I'm like, Johnny, I've been paying you for nine months. I haven't even heard from you. What do you mean? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You know what? And the meeting's over. Like literally immediately, Johnny's like, all right, thank you, Gary, for so much for everything. So like people are so silly. They take advantage of good clients. And then when they get caught, they're like, it's just the same old fucking game. But you know the funny thing is, Gary, how it works with us though, because you don't. It causes us to like up the ante. How can we bring value? He's not asking. Let's think for him. Let's be strategic. I see the adjunct. So sometimes we work harder. Yeah, I get it. And it's also, it's actually rewarding for us. Because we're like, okay, we want to do this big thing. Let's code for this. And so that's really kind of why I love working with you. Because I feel like we're not only able to create value, we have unlimited like guardrails to try to do the best work that we can and deliver that. So don't be a waiter is kind of code for your own thing. Treat your reputation as a currency. What's its worth? What's its value? How can you increase it? And how do you protect it? So I feel like a lot of people, and you are the guru of this, talk about building your personal brand. Yes. And a lot of people think personal branding, like I'm not a brand. I'm not a company. I don't need to build my personal brand. But I like to tell them, take out the word personal brand and replace it with the word reputation. My go-to belief of all time. And then once you do, don't you want to care about your reputation? Yep. Don't you need to be intentional about your reputation? Because if you don't do it, I can guarantee you somebody else is doing it for you. And it's not what you want. Always. Right? So building... It's been the great evolution of where media is now. Right? Like the biggest thing about social, and obviously we most see this in politics, but I think it's in business even more than some politics. Like the days of letting what you grew up with in comms dictate the narrative. Are over. Over. It's direct to consumer. People follow people. Why would you even let the Wall Street Journal or Fast Company or CBS or CNN or Fox News or anybody else? Even if you like them. Even... By the way, even if they're doing a good job by you, even if you're the darling of the media right now, it's still the wrong strategy. So true. And people follow people, they don't follow companies. And so a lot of people who might be listening to this podcast who are entrepreneurs, you have to have a strong personal brand. Otherwise, you won't be able to recruit the talent. You won't get the investor money. You won't get those partners or suppliers to work with. And if you work in a company, you need to have a strong personal brand. Otherwise, you won't get that promotion. Are you a collaborator, a problem solver, a good listener? You want to be a part of that. What do people see you at work? 100%. How do people see you at work? And if you are a leader in transition, I'm getting a lot of feedback on social media asking about leaders in transition. You're in the corporate. You want to go to entrepreneurship. You're about to get a lot more, ma'am. Yes. Just a little FYI to everyone listening because I'm trying to bring a lot of value. Shit's going to hit the fan with employment next year. Yes. So leaders are going to have to figure out, oh, I don't know how to network on social media. I don't know how to LinkedIn, DM, master that art, the DM. I don't know how to build my personal brand. I've been working at Amy, 35 years at General Mills. What is she going to do? She's young. She's had a long career ahead of her. Everyone needs to learn these skills. So anyways, that's- Amy is my sister. It's my sister. Just giving context. Just giving context. I know we're just saying that. We're just saying that. I forget that this is a live show. That's rule number four, thank your father. Yes, no worries. Keep going. Be a long-term player. Right? So this chapter has to do with how to build networks and relationships. You don't get anywhere in life on your own. I only am valuable because of my relationships, my friendships, the people I serve in business. And my network is not there to serve me. Gary, I am there to serve my network. Yeah. And the funniest part about this, Mohan, you've heard me talk a lot about this. We've had a lot of interesting convos through the years. Like, I just want everybody to hear this, just to jump on what Mohan's saying. By being selfless, it actually, it will give you everything you want selfishly. Like if you're genuinely doing right, especially by important and good people, if you can find important and good people, and important is subjective and good is subjective. But it just, it's unbelievable to me how people don't understand this. Giving value is inherently the most selfish thing you can do. It always works out. It always works. And when people are like, Gary, you're wrong. I get this all the time. I'll inevitably get 10 DMs about this. I want to understand. Like I want to actually, I always sometimes I double click with something. Tell me your example. Well, my older brother was my, okay, I'm like, now we're having new dynamics. Let's keep talking. And you find out that the father started the business and the older brother this, that the problem, there's always a story or like they went in. Like, you know how many people go into bad relationships from the beginning? Like what literally the other day, somebody argued me on this. I'm like, tell me the story. There's this guy, I'm like, tell me everything about the guy. Literally two seconds into the conversation where he's debating me like being a nice guy is a bad idea. He tells me that the person he was trying to be nice for, to, who, oh, by the way, he was trying to get money from actually. But even before I get into what I always say, which is you're trying to manipulate, not be nice. The guy was doing it with, was like a three time felon. Yeah. I'm like, what part of the story is confusing? I mean, I was laughing at this person, like being not nice by my standards. I'm like, first of all, you're full of shit. You really were only doing this because you thought he was going to make a quick buck and you wanted me 20% of it. Yeah. That's the actual really part. Two, the guy was a piece of shit. You're surprised that they were a piece of shit a fourth time. So like, you know what I mean? Yeah. It's like relationships. Like I had girlfriends, like friends that were girls for years, I'll be like, I suck at love. I'm like, you fucking only go after fuck boys. What do you fucking think is going to happen? The results. Like what's confusing about that part? Yeah. And I think learning how to build relationships with people is really important. And then how do you do it through one to many? Is it, you know, sharing their work on social media, commenting on their posts? That's a low lifting you can do to keep your networks warm and to talk to them and find out what they care about and maybe send them an article or something interesting. Introduce them to somebody being a super connector. That's huge. That one, I'll be honest with you. That is a real revelation to me. And you know this. And even then I know you well enough to know that you really know this, especially for the era before us, the fucking LA crowd that would want to charge you for an intro. Yeah. The super connector thing's real. And I want everyone to hear this. If you think your values based on who you know and you're scared, like for example, I can tell you right now from the perspective of me being me, through my life, many people have been scared to introduce me to people because they knew the second that person met me, that they would like me more than that person. And they, that person was trying to like keep me in their orbit. And they knew that like that would never, never pays off. So if you get a chance to introduce A to B and are worried that you're going to be left out, don't. Because if you have good intentions and you really generally want them to make serendipity, as Gary says, one plus one equals 11, that's a deposit in both of those people trust bank that you can withdraw a week from now, a year from now, 10 years from now, do the right thing. Yeah. Do not make all your money by being a connector. Because then by nature, you're scared to lose your money. You have bills to pay. Yeah. You have to take your family away. You can't give away the house for free. Correct. And so like try to make that a part of your world, not the only thing, because to, to the way I think about this, you'll get caught. Yeah. And I think it's just a muscle. You need to build it and you need to know who to do it for, who will take advantage of you, who will genuinely appreciate it. And by the way, and you'll learn that. That's right. And that's your point. Take advantage of like, if you get into the place where you're fully karmaed out on this, there is no taking advantage to your point, Maha. It's good for you to know like, I'm going to connect. Like it's been a weird week. I'm glad you brought this. I'm glad we're talking about this. I heard from three people this week. This is something that has not been on my radar at all because of the way my brain works. But this week, three different, very high profile kind of characters all reach out to me, all with just very specific asks. Really? Direct asks. And some kind of mundane, like nothing crazy. One was crazy. And I don't know why, like for the first time in my mind, I'm like, oh, this person, like just like, I'm in their orbit just to like, give them stuff, to give them stuff. And like, and in all three categories, it was just obvious to me, like our relationship has evolved into a place where like, I'm in the place where they're just asking for stuff infrequently. But that is the full relationship. Yeah. Well, that's not the right. That's not a good feeling. No, no, what's really interesting is like where I went with it. And again, you know me inside out. So like, it wasn't always like, fuck it. It was like, oh, this is just where I'm at with it. And you just know where they are. And that's okay. Yeah. And that's okay. And you're just accepting. I would say that that's something people should think about. And I will still do things for those people for many reasons. I like them. Yeah. Or they're important. Yeah. Or I may need something from like real stuff. In the future. Yeah. But it's good for everyone to know like everything's okay. That's where I'm going. That's actually what I'm trying to say to you. Everybody. I love that. Yeah. I love that. Do not put some sort of ideology. It's so everything. Don't overthink it. Yeah. Just like come from like just a very good place. And you'll be able to manage all these hard things. Relationships are hard. Everyone's like marriage is hard. And it is. It really genuinely is. And somebody was talking about the grasses greener in personal relationships. And that's how I think about with business too. Like business is hard because it's actually about relationships. Yeah. But if you're in a good place where you're not expecting and you're just giving and if you can get to the ultimate place where you're willing to give even when you don't feel great about it. Yeah. That's the interesting one. Are you strong enough to give when you're not even fully pumped about it? And don't put yourself in a vulnerable position either. Well, that is a good point. Build on that. Well, I'm just saying like you can give but don't put it into a detrimental position where you're going to hurt yourself or your employees or your team or your livelihood. Can I give you a good one on that one? Yeah. That the common mistake that a lot of people make is they make a promise on behalf of another person's action. That's the worst. Never ever do that. Right. So you were saying like, hey, don't give away everything for free. You need to make money a little bit with that, which makes sense. I'm going to a slightly different place of the thing that I see people getting killed on. Yeah. You know this maybe more than anyone. You know that I would say, I know how you say, I know you do. I know exactly what you're going to say. Tell me the real thing on this. You think I should meet this person? Or great. Tell me why. Is that good for your world? Because you know that's what makes me very unique. I'm like, I want to do that for you. Is it good for another reason? Yeah. Like I want to know the why. Yeah. The backstory. That's key. It's huge for me when people come to me all the time like, Gary, I need you to like, I'd love for you to meet this person. And I'm like, why? It's a great person. But then when I meet that person, it's very clear to me. Like literally some people are so not smart. Yeah. They're like, Gary, thank you so much for, you know, taking this meeting with me. Greg set it up. As you know, me and Greg are about to do this huge deal. Like, I sure don't. Yeah. Because Greg's a fucking idiot. Yeah. And he didn't tell me. And did tell me. Like, you know what I mean? Yeah. And it comes out. And by the way, because so many people do the wrong thing, and now I'm so busy, it's harder for me to say, yes, you know this about me as well. I say no much more now. I can't help it. Yep. And I know that some people on the other side, when I'll say no, there's many people that come to me desperate. They're like, Gary, like the nine time Gary, I want to be up front with you. I kind of promised this person that I could get them 15 with you. Because they're really like, and like, I'm like, why would you do that? Why would you do that? You do it. I do it. Yeah. Like a fucking asshole. But for the people that are on the other side that are the Greg in this scenario, like do not promise something that is required by someone else's action. Because it will often backfire on one, if not both people that are involved in you being the middleman. When you said you said yes, you don't feel like you're enabling bad behavior. I do. But you know me. I'm incredibly good at enabling bad behavior. Because Gary likes to do the right thing and like help that person out and then do what the consequence is. Where I am finally growing up is I used to think that was always coming out of me. And now I realize it's coming out of my top 20. No. Yes. But I knew I was losing money or time or emotion. And I knew they were fucking themselves because we would never be ultimately that close. Because they were transacting on me, not relationship building on me. And I still would do it. Because I knew I could really help them maybe if they knew what to do with it after. Now what I know is happening, especially as my organization, because before it was just me. Yeah. Now that I have a huge organization, now bad behavior in any shape or form. There's no time for that. Is because it's coming out of the top 20% around me. Yeah. Every bad decision I make hurts you, hurts Dustin, it's Andy, hurts Sid, hurts Yodkin, hurts Marcus. Because I've been able to make this shift that there's another. It's incredible. Yeah. And it was it took me a long time. I would say this. Even I've been with you for a long time. You've changed remarkably. A lot. You know, look my personal. So have I. I've learned. Yes, you have. A lot has gotten into that. But I can tell you professionally. Yeah. The last 20 even kind of what I'm setting up 2025 to do. It has a lot more to do with my inability to financially and emotionally reward the 20% of people that I think are doing right by me. Yep. And that's different than the fact that I've had to that I lose. I've lived my whole life leaving extraordinary emotion and money on the table. That's always been comfortable to me. It's not how I live my life. Because you're a long term player. And I'm kind of just like. You're a long term player. Yes. I'm the most long term player. And even if my long term strategy doesn't work out. I feel comfortable in how I live my life. Yep. But now that I understand there's collateral damage to that. Yeah. And just joy. It's not just you. Because of the top 20% that I like are not joyous. So like it's you know, it's interesting times in my world as well. Yeah. Anyway. Going back to the book long term player about networking. There's a whole playbook in there about how to network in today's world on Zoom. If you're in a remote environment in person at events play books for that. But one of the things I talked about in the book is to master the art of the DM. And the reason I'm sitting here in this office today. Is because I sent a DM. That's how I met Gary. I Gary had interviewed an author called Cy Wakeman. I DMed her. I invited her to Egypt. She had a videographer that actually worked for Gary. That is the videographer that got me into this office. And the rest is history. So. And full circle. Both of us have quotes in your book on the back here. Yes. So cool. Yeah. So I feel like it's really important to know how to network and build those relationships and also know that the art of the DM it works even for business it works. Five minutes to go into podcast. Two things to say. One, please everybody get the book. Seven rules of self reliance. My whole mind me when are we posting this podcast versus the date. It'll be out. It'll be we're doing. We'll be out. It's already out. It's already out. It's already out. Right now. You can literally. Literally one more time Google or go to Amazon or wherever you want to go. Seven rules of self reliance. Five minutes to go. And again, I think why I kind of like did this interview this way. I'm sure for a lot of you you've already probably thought of like oh wow my Hungarian have a lot of overlap and obviously we must have been around. Most of us. Like I was going to say most of what I've learned. It's really I'll be very honest. Yeah. I'm getting a little emotional listening to you because I also like like I'm not looking to pat myself in the back but I'd be lying if I didn't say. This feels nice to me because I know the level of impact I've had on a lot of things you've brought up here. Extraordinary amount Gary. It's it's it's the first thing I I thought of when I came in the door today. I'm like I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be writing this book. And I remember when I sat in this office December 20th. To 2015 2016 and I said I have a dream. I want to write a book and you're like stay with me. I'm going to teach you things. I'm going to teach you about business. I'm going to teach you about a lot of things. And I've learned about empathetic leadership about kindness and business. About not big timing people about putting your team and your culture first before results. And all good things happen when you are patient. 100%. And the last chapter of the book is called No Regrets. It's the story of my parents. I was 14 when my mom got MS. And then several years later, seven years later, my dad got ALS. And all the cards were against me. I was living in a foreign country. Each of us was foreign to me. Both of my parents were 100% handicapped. I was a full-time caretaker. I was working for this billionaire who was working me like a dog. I had everything going against me. And I said I'm going to rely on myself to build a future for myself and build the career for myself and do the right decisions for my parents and let them live with dignity. And I'm going to be something someday. I'm just going to have to put in the work. And I spent 23 years overseas. I moved back to the US in 2020. I've been here now for four years. I built a company. I have a remote team. And I'm just really full of gratitude, not only for your time and for me being here. But so many stories in this book, you guys, if you want to know how I met Gary, how I worked for a year and a half for Gary, for free before I got a contract, how I learned to create value for other people, how I learned to be a long-term player, how I learned to network through DM, how I learned to be a lifelong learner and be culturally relevant and always learn. You guys need to get this book. And I'm really, really... Good news. They're going to get the book. Like, honestly, I know this podcast. I know this community. I think everyone can tell literally besides my own book. And Matt Higgins, don't be Matt. But like, this is the book that I most want people to buy that's ever been with me, that's been around me. Do I have a big plug for Burn the Boats. Go get that too. It's two books. It's not going to cost you that much. Maha, vulnerable moment. Because I think that's something I continue to lean in more. And I think I... This might even be selfish because I'm just curious. But I think this can help people, which is why I'm asking here, not in a private setting. Of the things that you write about in this book, and or of the thing that you didn't feel like you were strong enough to add an eighth rule because you didn't want to be full of shit because you're not there yet. As you sit here right now as a human on and off the field, personal life, professional life. If I could snap and you would be better at it. Like, what do you think is sitting... Like, I continue to talk about even this new, profound new version of myself, and you and Dustin being in the room. I know you guys know I'm evolving a lot and it's going in a better direction. I still say often, I'm like, the firing is still not there and like candor. It's getting better, but it's still fucking hard. Whether it's one of these seven things or something altogether off the reservation, as I think more vulnerability of people that are in the room. People that people admire and I'm sure you've picked up a lot of admiration from listeners during this podcast. What do you think you'd like to be like? Truly like, fuck, this is still a weakness in my game. It's easy. Building and scaling a business. Like, I have an operation and I have a trained team. Do you fear that clients will be upset with you even though... Because I've watched you build a much better team. But is there still a part of you that's just so ingrained that you're like, fuck, we still might lose that client if I'm not close to it. Is it like that kind of touching micromanaging? Understanding how to scale. Like in your service industry, right? Which is hard. That's the thing. I'm like, what's happening with AI? How is that going to affect communications? How is that going to affect media? Do people even want classic PR anymore? Do people... Yeah, so like that's kind of like scaling my business, giving what's happening in the market. You just always have to be ahead. Because that becomes the absurd interrupt. That becomes like at the end of the day, you know, and this goes back to the whole, this goes back to the whole fucking thing you said. At the end of the day, you have nobody who's going to pay. Right? You have that constant pressure. Yeah, and you have to be payroll. That's why you always have to think. Did you... Do you... I'm sort of interrupted. Did you send people that parents were healthy or were wealthy? Like you go into this billionaire environment. Obviously, Nagib had friends. Private jets. Like we were in a whole world I never even was a part of. Like this is 1997. I'm 27 years old. But did you see... Like not even Nagib, because obviously that became such a remarkably warm relationship. You would meet with people and they would sometimes bring their son and daughter. This is a very specific question that I want for a very specific reason, because I'm trying to help listeners. When you were going through all this, were you like these fucking spoiled kids, they don't know how lucky they have... Like was there a part of you that you woke up one day and you realized, oh fuck, I have to take care of everything. Not only do I have to take care... Not only are my parents not going to pay for me, fuck, my parents themselves are sick and there's dollars. I have to pay for everything. Correct. And make the medical decisions. So like what... Did you find yourself doing that? No, but I always felt like everyone had it easy. Like everybody was not either entitled or every very prevalent in the Middle East is the family offices, family businesses. You just look at your dad's company, you have multiple cars and you have access to cash all the time. Yeah. And so I was like... And then even people that didn't have that, just not being grateful for what they did have, right? Like friends that would complain about something and you'd be like, go have two sick parents. Yeah. It puts things into perspective. That's for sure. Did it create resentment? Honestly, I mean, obviously my sister didn't have to have the burden of taking care of my parents and that could have been a big one, but we were so close. Like I... It's funny, I have a very similar relationship. My two siblings had it way easier than I did. It's not even fucking close. It's now become a big topic in our family as we've all gotten older. I don't think any of us, definitely me included, none of the five of us, my two parents and three siblings, when it was happening, we didn't know. But now we kind of like... I get very... Like I like when the whole family is together and having a dinner. It's very hard for a three hour family dinner to go by, for at least at some point being like, hey, let's talk about how fucked up it was for Gary. Like... We don't talk about like that, but I honestly feel like it's... It was very difficult chapter in my life, but I think it's really what made me who I am. I love you. I apologize. I just realized what my next meeting is. Everybody, I think it's been accomplished, but first we'll reach out to Mahaa. Please give everybody your Instagram so they can DM you. Spell it out. M-A-H-A-G-A-B-E-R. Got that one more time because I think my intuition is that everyone's going to buy the book. That's listening and multiple, but I also think business development, relationship development. I think people have the sense of the energy of this room. I have a feeling you're going to get a bunch of DMs and that will lead to things. One more time slowly. How do they DM you on Instagram? At Mahaa Geber, M-A-H-A-G-A-B-E-R. All right, everybody, I couldn't recommend it more. Mahaa, thank you so much. Thank you, Gary.
