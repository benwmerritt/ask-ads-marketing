## Transcript
Almost everybody right now has an uncomfortably high percentage likelihood of going viral if they post every day But there is a second part the monetization Yes One percent of the people listening now are gonna get to be a big enough creator that brand deals actually come in 99% can build a tech stack that can make them between seven and seventy thefts in a year Yeah, it's all about just finding your people. That's just what it is, right? Every human being on earth should use them Everybody should use social for this reason and everyone should have the tech stack to be prepared because The viral moment right now does not monetize. The guest I have today is a young gentleman I don't know how much of a gentleman we'll figure that out for you. A young man for sure at least that I've gotten to know over the last half a year and Has built a really interesting company in a place that I have a lot of passion for this is an unusual one because AJ and I have spent a lot of time with John over the last several months and Have really gotten involved in this business and When we first met You know John said, you know, I really want to help you buy the jets which is really interesting because I Don't know if I've heard that more than people saying hello to me in real life So like that part never really registers for me It sets up people's ambition a lot of times people use it as a lever to try to capture my attention, but That wasn't what was interesting what was interesting is what transpired over the course of the combo is And I said this to him at the time I said, huh, this could happen and and it's really interesting and I want to really set this up It's also catching me at a time where I really don't want to over promise and under deliver But at the same token I want to get involved in more businesses in a way that I can impact them because the scale of The 15 years of trying to build out VaynerX and my brand is in a place where those opportunities exist Here's where it gets really exciting for me and why I'm setting it up this way a stunning percentage of my audience should use this service and as you can imagine for all of you if that's true That wasn't like oh, that's why I want to get involved because I can get so much of my audience there a Stunning percentage of my audience here needs to wear underwear Right like doesn't mean like all let me go be a get very deeply involved in a startup and own a meaningful percentage and and Go and sell all that underwear What excited me is that a meaningful percentage of my audience needs to use Stan Like that it has been built this stack and I'm gonna let John get a lot of the floor over this podcast at a cost structure That feels incredibly obvious to me and as we kept digging and then more importantly You know when I look behind myself if you're listening And especially if you're a follower, you know, I always point to my stock certificates about Facebook Twitter tumblr I try to make this very clear to people All three of those companies were not a deck and an idea I did not angel invest in those companies. They were further along and they were obvious And I think there's an element to stand in that category as well This is not John meeting me and being like hey Gary I grew up on your content. I'm this well educated kid and I had this very good idea And I've like and I would meet and now that I got to know him I would have met him and I would have been like all this kids fucking got that thing in the stomach But you know to be frank over the course of 15 years That kid has lost plenty of times too as much as the kids I make fun of their Ivy League. He's both but you know like Anyway The company's far along which allows me to understand how many people are already getting benefit from it And this is like the most fun part the Gary V brand the Vayner X machine Where me and AJ are in our careers the infrastructure victory like all the things that are happening in my world are culminating And I guess it's a big opening rant to say Even though I started this podcast with making it Potentially obvious that Stan is an anomaly. I actually think Stan in a lot of ways for my next 20 years could be the preview You know, this is very important to me And I want to put a lot of effort and oomph behind trying to help John and some of the other Great people that are getting involved in this business to build a meaningful business because if I can prove it to myself Then I can learn from this next 36 to 48 months on what impact I and the Vayner X machine and the broader Gary V Ecosystem can do to this business. It'll give me the confidence to do it again and Again, I'm making this podcast for my entire audience There's a lot of you that are in different parts of your career where you feel like you can create Opportunity for yourself because of what you've already built. I thoughtfully at some point not day one I don't want to rewrite history, but somewhere pretty early on I realized Vayner X can be the operating system to everything I do for the rest of my life Gary V can be the operating system the personal brand for everything This is the most meaningful attempt I'm gonna take at that and so I'm really excited I want to be very like that was really fun for me to do. I don't do a lot of content like this That was really fun I think that sets up the rest of this conversation And I'm sure all of you are like very tired of me ranting on one breath right now And are probably curious to get to know John a little bit and understand why I feel this way What's going on? What is stand and that's where my friend Lovely well Gary what I'd summarize for your audience is the mission of stands really simple is to empower anyone to work for themselves and Literally what that is because you're saying a significant portion of your audience could benefit from saying I wholeheartedly believe that is San is everything you need to start a business. It's the simplest and easiest way So whether you need a website you need to horse a course you need to host a community charge a subscription Charge for a service build your online business San does all that for just $29 per month and the reason why we exist is because I started out on this journey Inspired by you way back in the day just a kid posting on tiktok really cringy dance videos and realize that I loved it Are you good at dancing? I'm awful at dancing Okay, but it doesn't matter because it's about trying and getting past your emotional Did you do the dance videos because you thought that would get you viral because we were in that era exactly it was like peak Covid where we're all locked in doomscrolling tiktok, but I was dancing specifically with an intention Which was once again, it's a Gary Vee match. I've give give give I was watching all these folks create content I was like what's some sort of value I could add in this world and for me that was my stories emery and kids single mom grew up in the south Waiter, I don't remember that North Carolina North Carolina what town Charlotte just north of Charlotte, right? So not Charlotte the greater Charlotte Charlotte suburbs What's the name of that I want to give this cornice North Carolina? I want to give it a big show I mean somebody right now just yelled really yeah, cuz somebody's right from there. They're walking their dog like yo What's that? You know like yeah, let's make sure we try yeah, seven oh, but wait can we make can this also be an important moment in Human society can we no longer talk about the big city like when people are like I'm from Buffalo I'm like no you're not cuz first of all fuck Buffalo I hate the bills But you're like from 12 minutes outside of Buffalo and some random name town and we need to start giving these little tiny towns More love so that was a good moment for me. I'm glad we had that moment keep going shout out Cornelius North Carolina Cornelius Cornelius 704 But but I grew up in a place where like we didn't have much and very can't by the way. I apologize I don't want to do this. I want to give you a room, but I'm definitely clipping that and running it against the town Heck yeah, I like back to like targeted ads. Yeah running that so I love that Well, I mean I grew up in a place like if you know anything about Cornelius or Southern North Carolina at the time and the early 2000s like no one looked like me, right? And so the reason that matters in the story is just because we're all in society told to fit in in some way Yeah, and so for me as an Asian American kid in the South Everything in my life whether it was my mom culturally and the pressures we had there to perform or just broader society like to fit in and quote-unquote Be accepted you had to do a certain path, right? So I went to undergrad I took on student loans I then thought I was the biggest shot ever I was here in New York because I cold call my way to job at Goldman Sachs in investment banking Like from nothing but being is I thought I had made it right I'd done the path and admittedly hopefully not too many people here are in finance and you know a 12 to 12 job in Finance right now, but you get there you think you're hot shit and you realize that's actually Goldman Yes, you're like on the fucking Yankees you're on like, you know, like, you know, that's like big big stuff especially and by the way when I just heard that I'm like makes sense because The Goldman kids that really become the ones that run the whole shit are not the ones that are like the excel like the math They're always the kid that Cole called their way in and probably didn't belong there And that's why they that's why kudos to Goldman and other places They know that they need five percent of the people that are just like burning down the place to get in and they kiss a lot of frogs I did the same thing like for all the people that have worked out for me They're for every D rocker and they're like all the huckster kids that walked in or random tweet or whatever 80% are actually disasters. I Always make fun of my team because when I'm like, hey, I met this kid outside. You have to interview I'm like literally outside. They're always like what the fuck and then I'm like I'm like fuck you motherfucker. I met you outside, too. Like they forget where they came from anyway Keep going. I love that. Well, I was that kid, right? And I thought I'd made it because you're you know, you're brash and you're young you're like, oh I'm a hot shot at Goldman you get there and you realize like a lot of people that you work for and look like are above you You don't really want their life, right? They're working 24-7. They're not close to their family In fact, they're yelling at their spouse on the phone right next to you. You're like, well, I'm just trying to get edits on a deck All that to be said is I've done the conventional path and that's the context in which I started consuming your content It was the depths of COVID and I was doomscrolling and I was like, I don't want to go back to corporate So this career kind of thing is really interesting. So in COVID real quick just for context you were still at Goldman I was at Stanford Business School at the time Got it. So I had gone off because I'd done the golden path I was like, oh at Goldman like I'm not I'm so miserable. I just need a better job So you want to do even better job at a top VC firm in SF. Yeah, that was like the dream It's a great right and then I went for Stanford that is like the like my mom's American immigrant Jane manifest 100% being I done all like I did all the same sort of approval Like did she have a Stanford sticker on our car? I mean truly she's still so upset of me to this day for not graduating Yeah, of course, I'm like mom I got in that's the thing that matters like mom stands like a real company I do but she's like I want you to get that grad school degree But it was in that moment I was like what kind of value could I add to this world? And so I started making cheesy dance videos But in the context of career coaching specifically how do you as your as an underrepresented kid get your first dream job? Because that was just my story and so it was real to you Yes, and you knew that there was a lot of kids that looked like you or in cultures similar Indian Eastern European whatever it would be that we're feeling that same pressure and that fucking on a bad day 50% of them were dying inside. Yes. I always say like for the doctor lawyer, you know Engineer crew India Asia Eastern Europe like that where it's written. I do that real culture. Yeah on a good day Can only be 50% that are actually like oh, I love this. I love being a doctor I love being a lawyer, which is amazing, but on a good day It's 50% which means literally 50% of the people that are being pressured in that Immigrant culture that puts that on a pedestal because there's different immigrant cultures that are more entrepreneurial or more You know into music and the arts, but the cultures that really pushed the lawyer doctor engineer thing You know Ivy League school that whole thing 50% of those fucking kids are dying inside Yeah, and we're seeing them now take an alternative path because of Stan Right because we're all realizing and this is what you've been preaching like almost 15 years too early You've just been on the trend since 2010 and even earlier is like we're all realizing there's a different path because there's optionality Yes, what I understood in 2000 when I wrote crush it what I understood was like this internet thing creates actual optionality Yes, no internet forget about AI and social media. No internet no options It created unlimited in mentor in a real-estate term It created unlimited real estate to build yes Unlimited yes, and that changed everything. Yes, and so that's the context in which I found myself Which was like I was making content about how to get your first dream job Which was just like I got thousands of comments basically saying dude This is so helpful got my first like networking out of this I like got over my fear of cold email whatever it was and so I sat there I was like, okay, how do I turn this into a full-time income so I could do this for a living because like I got to work for myself I got to be creative which was crazy for me as a immigrant kid Did you think about going full-pledge? Personal brand or did you realize that that had limited? Value in a medium term maybe long long term if you play my kind of game But like did you understand no no I have to build a sass bit something that has more intrinsic value I was a techie at heart and so I knew I wanted to build something more scalable than myself I also knew that I wanted to build more impact rather than just my personal brand Recognize at the time that the distribution mechanism Yeah, the best way to get out there and get your brain out there is to build your own personal brand first Yeah, I would say real quick because it's an important point and I want to it's not a counter to your point But it's an and I just want everyone to know that like I'm on the record that I believe Gandhi and Martin Luther King had a lot of impact And so I think yeah, right right, I think it's really and I think this goes to like us and obviously we like our circles crossover But knowing that like what absolutely I bought You know and it's like fun to like because I haven't said this to you yet Like the whole I'm gonna help you buy the jets and my brother jets are like 20 billion and like I don't have that much of Stand so like if you're if you're gonna build a 13 trillion dollar business like Mazel toff and we might be able to get there What absolutely I did believe though Was that you understood what the thank you economy and crush it? You know, it's really funny you look at anything in your life I always you know, it's kind of like a music artist like usually the first albums the punchline Like if you really look at right sequels and like if you really look at a creative person You have your I had my whole life to write crush it I had 24 months to write the thank you economy after that right? It's like I think that what was very clear to me was when I think about crush it plus thank you economy And what that means to people I did believe what why? You and I are sitting here right now, and I met a lot of people obviously in my career I did believe it was in your stomach the combination of crush it and thank you economy Yeah, I think you're very articulate and like even when you communicate to me. I'm like I don't think you're doing it on Purpose I can feel when we're subcont... where you're subconsciously talking to me on things you think I will like and That doesn't bother me because I actually think it comes from a very good place But I get much more excited about The reason we're here, which is I think you I You know I always say this humans are animals and we forget that just like animals you can smell your own For anybody who has a dog. I've ever seen a dog walk by another dog. It's like a different game It's like their own we have that too, and we don't talk about that enough in my time with you the cop the your inherent DNA Forget about you being affected by consuming my content or anyone else in you is the combination of crush it and the thank you economy And that's why I'm here cool straight up. I love that I wouldn't advise that investing thesis to most people, but Combined with the data. I I'm like wow that's cool Yeah, I guess so I guess where I'm going is like self-awareness everyone this goes to like who he is But that's why I wanted to just jump in building something scalable and impact comes absolutely in the form of Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg or whoever and it also comes in the form of you know Gandhi and and MLK and I think the biggest game for all of you Especially if you all go down this stand journey It was funny when he rattled off I was listening when he rattled off all those things I was like I wonder what someone's listening right now is like fuck I need website and email or I need certainly you know like that Swiss army knife that stand creates that you've done Especially at the cost structure That's what excites me because it's actually we're getting to the punchline here everybody who's listening Needs something none of them are the same and the combos are not the same Right the entrepreneur is listening right now is like winning on their website or doesn't even believe in website And that's very easy to not believe in it I was laughing like Gary you don't believe in website like I've ever seen my website, but I very much believe in website and by the way with with SEO going to You know chatbots like it's shits about to get very interesting in that world But nonetheless, I think that people being self-aware Are they a John or a Gary right now if they're listening right like it's okay to go all in on personal brands Okay to go all in on technology and I think to the opening rant I think people gonna get blended all the way in right so keep going yeah I mean in that you just alluded to why stand has been so successful so far It's like in my immigrant roots manifest as a price point Which is I grew up going to Costco with my mom and like man I fucking love like a bulk deal and lots of toilet paper But point being is you know I studied as computer science back in the day as a kid I was like a very mediocre programmer But I started trying to MacGyver together like a website that was like $30 a month and then a course hosting platform That would charge you like $200 for like courses and then community for my community and subscription and then I needed to send Invoices and I was spending like $400 a month just to get started which is just completely inaccessible for anyone And so I was like fuck it I know how to like I can just build all of this and then like a couple months And so I did that was the first version of Stan was I built it for my own account And I was like why are we charging for bits in a cloud? Did you when you said you were building for yourself? Did you know that this when you started building it? You knew this was the thing you wanted to build? Yes, okay? Got it. I knew it. Did you name it right away? I was I thought about the name for a couple weeks and I just I immediately thought Stan right because why I love the name Stan is because it stands for superfan right? It's the original Eminem song now Gen Z is co-opted the term and so Stan is like how we want to show up for all of our entrepreneurs and creators It's like we want to be your superfan and support you through the journey Oh, by the way through 16 and you've never listened to the song Which is like actually much more real than a lot of us in this room would like to admit that a lot of kids have not Listened to this yet. You really need to listen to it. It is one of the most creative songs of all time Hmm. I really believe that wow I really that song really this was long before I even had an audience Rebutter it was just like the voice change over has always been my favorite when hip-hop has done that and the way he does it in That song I think it's just like legendary. Yeah Then you get the term and the legacy of it But yeah, I essentially I knew so deeply in my heart that this was a pain point I had and therefore would be helpful for everyone else because I knew that on a like a macro basis Everyone was just gonna the feelings that I was having doing that job the creativity the like Inspiration I was feeling I just knew that like this was the manifestation of like Mazos hierarchy of needs, right? And if I could figure out how to pay my bills, I was already generating community I was already joining belonging I was already joining meaning and I was gonna generate financial freedom through this as well And so I just knew in my heart of hearts that like number one I desperately need this service because I wasn't gonna pay $500 a month and more importantly It was how we're trying to figure out all these different clunky softwares when I knew I could build something way simpler for way cheaper And I knew that millions of other people one day would want to use this And so that's how Stan got started and you know now we're helping 75,000 creators make over 300 million dollars Which is crazy to think about like we'll be at a billion soon just with how things are going exponentially And it's just been really really cool to see like all the stories of people Let's actually go into that chapter of this podcast. Let's go into for instance sure I think the best way a lot of people learn is in this format. So we're setting this up For instance sure give me success stories that you're seeing on the platform either specifically or Knowing that there's six Pharmacists doing X tell me the story of like so you're a far so let's play let's play a rapid fire for instance For instance if you're listening right now and you are for instance I can prove to you whatever your background is and whatever you look like where you come from I can guarantee you have a success story on Stan. So just rattle off a bunch I talked to this kid once 18 years old if you're a young kid same stone Fredrickson He emailed me before at 17 because he couldn't set up a stand account because he wasn't legally allowed to set up a Stripe bank account and as soon as he turned 18 in two months off of tiktok He made a hundred thousand dollars has not had to go to college decided to fall on pursue entrepreneurship Another one that I absolutely love is you do you obviously, you know that in the macro Do you know what he actually sells? He was specifically teaching boomers how to do social media smart, right? So he would be timing because I think one thing I kept saying a VaynerMedia in Post-covid by the way, I have to say it now. This is sad This is a big big shout-out to how fucked up fortune 500 marketing companies are the biggest brands in the world Like the biggest ones like the ones you know like Toyota like, you know, Coca-Cola Literally if you're the head of marketing for those companies You don't realize that there are 50 and 60 year olds dominating tiktok Consumption and then you come to Vayner and we have a meeting and we're like hey tiktok They're like our target audience is really 55 and let's say it's this person is the cliche 42 to 60 year old marketer I'm like, are you on it? Yes. I'm like, and this is where I always kill them I'm like are your parents on it and they're like, yeah, my dad's addicted to it. I'm like your dad's 82 And so that kid really crushed it because there's so many boomers on tiktok. Yeah, a lot of people don't see it Yep. Yeah, you get it and so then in that sense, I'll give you a completely different side of the spectrum Selena Camarillo, I think she's in her mid 30s. She's also North Carolina native, you know what she does She makes content online about homesteading specifically. She started a digital product on how do you bake sourdough bread? Make sense If you want to guess how much money she's made Well knowing Mona my wife's obsession with sourdough bread and now I'm gonna have to ask you like which wheat and yeast and all that stuff But oh an absolute ton because it's crushing up This topic is crushing. I'm gonna go with 800,000 very very very close. She's in the mid six six figures Her username is at milkmaid farm for anyone who wants to look her up on Instagram That is a completely random niche out there, right? I think of like we have bread baking We have someone who does crochet Crocheting specifically who just started to stand this past month and we were speaking to her and she's made almost 10k already AJ It's so funny. Like you must be laughing, right? Like the reason I'm going to AJ right now literally when I wrote I wrote crush in a no eight It came out no nine You cannot you could actually do this right now You can go back and go click the one-star reviews on crush it on Amazon and Sort by oldest when this book came out and I said people are gonna make money Good My thesis then was Everyone is gonna make a hundred thousand dollars a year talking about you know Smurf it up. I mean my talk that changed my career. I'm like if you love Smurfs smurf it up I believe someone right now listening and this is why I'm so addicted to your tool It is not lost on anyone anymore that whether it's YouTube or TikTok or something else like you literally can get millions of views about Smurfs What is lost is this is probably the money shot at this entire podcast so almost everybody right now Has a uncomfortably high percentage likelihood of going viral if they post every day This is a profound we're gonna get into something very important of why the interest graph not the social graph is Impacting why we're having this conversation about Stan almost. I'm gonna go nice and slow almost everyone who's listening if you post something random every day I'm talking about Very random like you have something stuck in your teeth. You grab a toothpick You're now on this I'm gonna post something random actually I might create a challenge right now called the 365 day a year random post challenge where you have to post something random every day every day on TikTok and Instagram I'll just stay there, but YouTube shorts, please Facebook, please But just knowing how those two algos work, especially TikTok That if you post something random Similar to and this is gonna hit with my audience when I just decided to post that I fuck with blueberries and nobody can eat them Like me and it became my most viewed post Almost all of you actually know what I'm saying you may not do it You're scared to do it But you kind of know it's true because all of us have consumed so much content and complete randomness I'm aware that most of you are not creative enough yet to wake up every day and just do something random But I'm telling you I'm talking about like which shampoo you've used for 14 days years in a row Why you stubbed your toe today like like just random I believe that if if you do that And I get this DM a thousand times a month Gary. I just had my first viral post. What do I do? How do I make money? Right Gary. I just got a post. I normally get 50 views. I just got a post. I got 2 million. How do I make money now? I believe the answer is Being in front with a stand-like situation where you're prepared for the moment Correct. So like if let's play it out. I'm gonna this is why I'm excited that we've allocated a lot of time for this podcast I'm gonna go like I don't feel rushed which is what fucks me up on podcasts You're a person and You take this challenge that we're making up on the spot right now We by the way John I've been thinking about a hundred different things to do and like literally this is improv cliche like This is like really smart and I'm getting excited in real time You were gonna post something random every day now you have to have a stand store because you have to act quick Let me explain what happens in real life. You post about pumpkin picking it hits it gets three million views You're gonna see it You're gonna know something's happening if you're already set up with infrastructure when people land on your account and you have a URL in Your profile to send them somewhere and you're gonna have to help me here John because I'm far along on your product But not far. I'm gonna paint a picture Tell me how right I am or what they would have to do play tennis with me here has Wimbledon's going on I'm Gary I'm I'm inspired by Gary right now just like the flip challenge of 2017 I'm taking the 365 day random post challenge. I Post about pumpkin picking. I've got a stand store. I've got the pieces in places where I need you in a little bit So that I can do what Gary's about to say which is it goes viral and Then I can run quickly to my stand stack. Yep and have prepared like Let me tell you how my brain would work a nine dollar a month newsletter or or offering or course on how to do a monthly activity with your children Right because my brain would go to okay. Everyone's obsessed with this pumpkin picking thing. I did That's cool when they if I go now and spend two hours while this is going viral in real time to get my shit together And I can capture subscriptions I Can do this now you have to be back to self-awareness you have to realize like do you actually have 12 ideas? To actually sell people because you can maybe get them to sign up during this virality I'll be right and you'll be very happy with me But you won't retain them if the November and December ideas shit They're gonna unsubscribe and not pay you anymore, but there's something that I see where Everybody's going viral now All of them have no idea what to do with it. Yep, they start going into how do I get brand deals? How do I get this what I saw in your product and what I think is real is this tech infrastructure? These tools can allow them to monetize even that viral post that they move in real time Thoughts correct the caveats. I would give you if you're like worried about If you're worried about random post like what should I post really randomly the first thing I tell you is find your icky guy Which is that? Vin diagram that the center between what you're really passionate about what you could talk about for free for the rest of your life And then also what you're really good at because in this context the pumpkin picking you picked out the larger theme So for example, we actually literally have probably a couple dozen different parents Cross-over 10k just teaching other parents about how to like for example live a phone for your life with your kids I like 10k total 10k a month. I want to get your at least 10k total perfect I could be this is where I'm jumping in because the other thesis I had with pressure was like, okay Like you can laugh at me and make fun of me. This is what I was talking about with the one-star, but hey It asking you American by the way, you got to remember what time it was in 2008 the economy had collapsed 2009 economy collapsed They didn't really was built on all of AJ smart kids that lost job offerings during that spring. Yeah from jobs They got no longer job available And so we just were able to have like a lot of his smart friends start with us and Jim Marcus With the guy who runs Vayner Media International who's been AJ's friends since first grade 100,000 million percent of the economy did not collapse in 2009 would have never worked here He lost his finance job. He's like all interned for the fuck. They were just fucking kids Like I'm lying out and post social bind, you know The the thing that I said a lot and that's why I want to double click on this because again a lot of you were listening And you're like yeah, I can't right. I cannot stop being a lawyer. I I'm gonna keep listening to Gary and John I've I know what Gary's core thesis is it sounds like there's a tool now here that might be can extend Gary's story and make This even more real than Gary talks about which is why I'm here But I can't because I make 380 and here's the big punchline I make 380 in salary and I'm living a 420 life Everybody has a house too big everybody has stuff. They don't need Here's what I want everybody here and I'll like you jump back in For a lot of people listening the 10k the reason I just jumped in and I'm ranting. I Just want to ask everybody how many people here who are listening right now if you made an extra 10k in The year I'm not even talking a month that that can be deployed against either debt or For a nicer vacation with the family this December then you would have More Ritz Carlton less holiday and no no diss on holiday in It's a good place. I grew up doing a super 8. I grew up days in bro the old by the way Holiday Inn was the first place I stayed when we went to Disney with me my mom and sister I'm Passion about that bro and everyone's posting anyway, so why not make 17,000 more? That's why I'm so excited about what you've got yeah because I know what I'm telling people But there is a second part the monetization. Yes 99.99999999% of people are not gonna become mr. Beast where the monetization comes from the pennies on the views on the big platforms One percent of the people listening now are gonna get to be a big enough creator that brand deals actually come in yes 99% can build a tech stack They need to build their own $29 that can make them between seven and seventy thefts and in a year yeah, and the caveat I'd actually give you that's the punch line of the company the caveat I give you as well on the lawyer account in pieces I would actually argue many the lawyers and accountants and dentists who use our platform to drive leads for Via let's say LinkedIn for example are probably clearing In many in many cases more with the client revenue. They're booking through their stand store I got it so you're saying you're taking a little bit of different tweak We're now talking about a completely different audience So actually both audiences are right don't leave your job and become the head of pumpkin picking You're saying use the tech stack that we've done to take what you're already doing and accelerate it That's correct. You can take both angles So either you some people think of entrepreneurship Especially online that you have to go zero to one you have to fully quit your job What have you no like you can either see this as a side hustle and like like out Let's say your mom or a parent what have you and you're busy You can do this a couple hours a week and start to teach other parents how you stay sane or the fun activities You take your kids out and make 10k in a year Or you can be a lawyer who's full-time focus on running your own law firm or being a partner in a different law firm You should still be no matter what you should still be building your personal brand Because you just talked about all the companies in 08 that went down like everyone here knows that like the macro environment right now And all the institutions are toppling like do you want to be be holding to a 9-5 and someone else like deciding your fate? Or do you want to also be co-investing in yourself in a way where what I know to be true is that people are building their own personal Brand right on their own personal platform are gonna be more resilient over time Of course, and so that's insurance. Exactly. And so that's the whole point of saying is like we're gonna meet you wherever you are Whether you're a dentist or an accountant trying to drive leads for your business Stan has so many of those people generate hundreds or thousands of leads a year Just like posting about accounting or tax law like on TikTok you'd be surprised They're whole niches because you're gonna find your business owners there or it's someone who once again is a parent or Someone who's doing crochet or someone who's doing fitness and teaching specifically the niche of people over 60 Like we've someone named Eddie Abbey who's made over a million and a half teaching six-year-olds how to stay fit like it's insane So I mean, it's like it's the biggest thesis I have In fact a lot of your examples are so in pocket to what I think people know the reason I'm bringing a pumpkin patch picking and a toothpick Like I really want people to understand this like like What's what's going to absolutely happen so again back to crush it because this is where the tie-in is The fitness person the teaching finance like boomers learning social media like that's all live the thesis I think there's an I'm telling you I believe this. I think there's another gear coming which is like just complete outer space like like Here's one that's got me fascinated. Do you mean people love mowing their lawn? Oh It's like a total like turn off your brain activity. It's great. It's like like it's like I live so I love garage-sailing I think it's pretty well documented While I'm in doing the thing that I love the most that's super weird Because I garage sale on early Saturday mornings Every time I drive by somebody who I can tell is really enjoying mowing their lawn You have to understand if you told me that I had to mow my lawn right now like this Saturday or choose death By like poisonous hornets slowly. I'm definitely choosing the poisonous hornets like I could not want to do something less Which is what all this comes from which is like knowing somebody who's listening right now And this is why I want to really milk this who's obsessed with mowing their lawn It's impossible for me to believe that most people See $50,000 a year of income on that Truth I love mowing my lawn with a beer so much and listening to fucking Van Halen. Oh My god that truth back to passion Right literally it's called cash in on your passion Yeah, the thesis is the cross-section of what you look you will never work hard enough if you don't like it to actually compete with the whole world The reason I believe you have to love it is you just can't work hard enough if you're doing it for the money The reason people quit crypto trading and then cannabis selling and then real estate is they keep chasing the thing the money's in But they don't like it and You're competing against people that love the living shit out of it and they're working 19 hours a day and you're working 19 minutes. I Do not believe anyone right now John who's obsessed with mowing their lawn on Saturdays for three hours Checking out from their nine to five. They hate that checking out from their family You know and want to hear from them even the Saturday morning. This is their place. I don't believe that dude cliche and plenty ladies I'm sure live that life as well. I don't think that person is like this is a $50,000 a year revenue business for me and my family I do believe the combination of where social media is where random posts from people who have no followers They can get 8 million views with a tech stack that allows them to have a URL in that tick tock or Instagram when it goes viral That allows them to capture revenue Don't believe anyone knows that to be true. Yeah, not enough people Forget about not enough people. I think fitness look, you know this web 1.0 had fucking people selling courses before social media Yes, I believe that people know Probably most people listening right now have a friend acquaintance relative who is a fitness trainer virtually and selling courses or virtually They know that to be true Yes, I do not believe that anybody who's listening right now Realizes that their obsession With making puzzles, you know puzzle pieces that that this Friday night They're gonna get a glass of wine with their high school friend who's gonna come over This is the ritual and they were gonna literally open a fresh box and they were gonna work on this fucking puzzle of a fucking forest And they're and they're more excited than ever to get the little corner piece because right here we go I don't believe those two ladies at 37 years old Who have you know two kids each who this Friday night is their life where they pop that bottle of wine Shit on their husbands and kids with each other and do that fucking puzzle because they met at camp When they were nine and they did puzzles together I don't believe those two ladies are sitting there and saying you know what as They talk about being concerned about finances or as your point earlier They one of them says I think my husband's about to lose his job because of AI I don't believe those two ladies sit there and say you know what if we just take out our phone right now and Film whatever the fuck, you know like random. This is where I'm going not per crush. It was purposeful I'm going into the random economy, but passion. Yes, I don't think they think that one video They put film that they post on a tick tock that then gets 13 million views for some unknown reason And they listen to this podcast and put in the work and this is why I love this This was my obsession the $29 a month to me You can most people almost every person Listening can take the risk of paying for it for even four months without it up being ROI positive For it to be there if they're posting every day for this moment So that when they hit and they have a puzzle guide or how you start a puzzle club And it's eight bucks a month or whatever you're gonna have to teach me a little bit here. I don't think that's real yet People yeah, I used to I'm going like when I was saying fitness people good news You don't need to go to pee to the gym and only have nine clients make content and post in 2008 on your email newsletter and use Google AdWords That was that version where I'm going in this talk is I think we're in the pre-dawn of something very different Yeah, actually maybe the manifestation of when I said smurf it up or if you love Alf like I feel like I was Early-ish because it was you had to be so remarkable and really AJ you remember this You know my point back then was it was AdSense John, I don't know if you know this Actually, I'm backtracking here a little bit the reason I believed in what I was saying was back in 2008 Pre-social media being scaled people had websites and you would throw Google AdSense on it Yeah AJ had a beep, you know, beep the clothing. Yeah, AJ had a beep website. He would post beep content You would put the code from Google AdWords AdSense So it means ads showed up on your site and you were making what? A thousand bucks a month back then pro rated with inflation plus there wasn't all the ad revenue and digital marketing at there's that Yeah I love a side of the side I just really believe that people would love to spend and back to AJ's point of he spent ten minutes a month on it to make a Thousand like again 90% of people need to make another thousand dollars a month Yeah, I think we get very confused of what's happening in real life and socials confuse people even more You just consume the 1% of 1% stuff and you forget that 99% of the people listening right now to this podcast Really need forget about want I want a thousand dollars a month more. Why not? Why wouldn't I I don't need it? Yeah, a stunning percentage need it This goes to the point and I'm gonna finish this round and we'll move I think the random To the adjustment. I think the way even you and I even walking into this room is like, okay Passion and and and knowledge right or skill and and then there's a debt then diagram, right? Like you're 90% passionate about dentistry. You're just okay But if you understand this to or the other way, right? You you actually don't love it back to what a lot of people are living You don't love it, but you're actually good at it Right. I think we understood that for stand. I'm saying something very different. Hmm. I'm saying if You go with all the things of your life like this is almost like 3.0 version of this first it was like what is what are you gonna do for a job? Then this whole thesis was what's your passion news alert? You might be able to turn your passion into profit. That was like what? 15 years ago starting to get more real I'm now saying something even further and it's probably touches a little bit on reality TV DNA Let me explain where I'm about to go. I'm saying if you post something every day That is just happening in your every day Like you guys leave right now and you just think that the hot dog stand is funny Like I don't think people are triggered or framed up to think like I'm gonna make a piece of content today That is just my life But not the life I want to project Everyone thinks that now. I'm a fashionista. I'm a bit right. No, no just like very random If I have a tech infrastructure I can decide if I want to take advantage of all that attention because we're fully in the tension economy While I'm getting these four million views about hot dog stands again I'm just gonna use you to if you happen to be a person that is interested in travel And you know, you're getting the hot dog stand views from New York right now You can decide if you're this is why I'm trying to teach right now. Huh? I'm gonna do a city guide For three bucks a month subscription the fact that you go from posting like this is why I'm getting so hyped because I love speed I Post the hot dog stand because I just left Gary's office and I'm buying into this ridiculous concept. So I'm just gonna try It gets views. I already did the stand part and I can go into my stand and now Refigure it. Yes, put the overlay like just a couple minutes. Yeah, and and how about an hour? You got three hours actually to like really set it up nicely that I have a four dollar a month city guide and that 13 million views literally leads to To nine hundred dollars a month recurring revenue for you and it'll decline if you're not good nine hundred from the viral 750 people drop off. I don't know. There's something there there. Yeah Well, I think the best pre point I can give anyone in their heads right now if they're still incredulous is One thing I realized about all this is we all out there have one niche form of content. We love consuming So for someone out there, it's mowing lawns for me It's like this one really specific nerdy game called RuneScape from back in the day that I was like watch I still to this day. It's like me and 300,000 other kids from like the 2000s But we all have that one random thing that for some reason just lights us the fuck up and we're super passionate about and Most people have many like as you were talking I can see AJ over your shoulder and I was like what's AJ's? Oh deep cut wrestling trivia like his feed is got like We know a lot about wrestling. Yeah, but this is like he's been he's like I I was older So I knew more but now I think he's out flanking me because he's watching all this shit He's like hey repo man who was his first manager in Cal gram like I don't know You know like like you know like but AJ also has golf and AJ also has the Jets and nicks and AJ like like you know The reality is is we don't have one and I think that actually leads a little bit to what I'm saying right now Right, so you're saying Rune and that's a little bit more crush you like ultimate online I know was for you and it was since you so like let's say AJ was listening lived an alternative life super buying in I'm saying hey AJ yes ultimate online But if you were listening to Gary be in 2009 and 10 it's ultimate online because you had to build a website You know make content ad sets what I'm saying here right now improv by the way This is like I've literally not thought of any of this in all the time We've been thinking but it's just coming to me in the moment is hey AJ ultimate online and golf and wrestling and the Jets and the nicks and Crypto and AI and then AJ because you're signing up for the 365 day challenge when Ali makes because she's a great cook some like something you never had before like fucking chicken pot pie and The video is like literally because you're now you know being this by the way everyone This is all about discipline either you're signing up for doing 365 posts or you're not either you set up three hours of stand store To do this 365 before you even start or you're not by the way respect But when AJ posts the chicken pot pie is yummy because he's run out of you know He did the wrestling play like he's right when he says this is yummy And that's the one that decides to get 13 million views and he's laying in bed that evening and he's like Ali Should we fucking like again? This is the the family talk that people would have hey You're pretty good like and especially with AI. It's like hey Do you just want to do wrestling should we sell a recipe guide easily sell a chicken pot pie recipe guide on that? No shit? Yeah We have some examples of that brother you can this is where I'm going the long tail of it You can tell you can sell spicy only chicken pot pie recipe guides for four dollars a month. Yeah It's fucking profound is where I'm going I think how I'm interpreting what you're saying is you go with this idea is I think you're bringing all of into this example all of AJ's humanity We all have different facets of us and the beauty of these algorithms today is y'all you have to realize when you post a piece of Content the algorithm is literally incentivized and designed to connect you with other human beings in the world who care about that interest graph and the right the interest graph and the beauty of our Humanity and also these algorithms is like at some point one of these will hit Because it's like the right chemistry of how you talked about it and your passion plus like you as a person and then hitting with all People and then you and for everybody I'm sort of threw up because there's that much demand on the other side There's that much global consumption on the other side that the reason you eventually hit is There's just that much attention. Yes, and and you can be super agile with something like stand store It's like you don't know exactly what it is You probably have a strong gut instinct to be clear of like what the top one to two things are that you should start with But then let's say you finally figure out what that thing is with stands for it's super modular You can just like literally oh shit like chicken pot pies hitting Let me just like we have an internal AI system that will literally make a digital product for you Like that's part of stands or like okay. Hey, it's called Stanley. Hey Stanley Make me a digital product on how do I make a chicken pot pie recipe? It'll make that for you in your voice and your style and everything it knows from you because also scraping your content too Yep, so it's all like very easy to just quickly pivot and then like you know next year You're no longer chicken pot by guy you the traveler most people Monetizing against Specifically the top two skews the top two products people should be thinking about is either a digital products Something like course or an e-book or a guide or a recurring community subscription Oh, that part because I think for the first 20 minutes for the last 20 minutes I've been pushing everyone towards a very specific place that first one Educate me on the second place. So this is really important to think about recurring revenue, right? So what you're gonna find is like let's say you're super passionate about chicken pot pie Like I'm like wow I grew up on Marie calendar chicken pot pies There's at least maybe a couple thousand other people in the world Like you remember the days like niche Facebook groups like people like really into hand drivers was one that I was on AJ which one was that we had a bunch on this too. This is like a reason this is so native to me of what you're doing is This is what we were doing in 2009 in a different version and a different scale Like this is just a rebirth of where me and AJ weren't 1979 way bigger Flight of the Concords Remember that show it was millions of people in these things. What was the funny one? There was one ridiculous one You're trying to remember I know it oh 1.2 million people in a Facebook group When a group of people walk side by side together on a sidewalk on a punch in the back of the head That was the name of the group say it again when people walk side by side Like when a group of people walk side by side one another on a sidewalk I want to punch in the back of that 1.2 million That's for $500 I DM the admin and just bought it for 500 bucks and then I just started running affiliate ads. Yeah That's an incident that's insanely smart. That's insanely smart. That's so smart And so what daily one to ten of course that's what that's the VaynerMedia was almost Buzzfeed Yeah, we had a site called daily one to ten that we were building on the leverage of all these Facebook fan pages And then one of our or all of our Facebook fan pages got Yeah, we got fucking fucked fucking sucks But you guys get it and so what stands for is I'm realizing yes So our community feature for example is literally the New Age Facebook group So you just create your own Facebook group that you own by the way not Facebook So you own the data you own the community all that kind of stuff You can make it free up front just like that and then like run affiliates to that or have an up like a tier over time That's that's priced higher or what have you or you can charge up front, but you're just connecting the world of People who want to punch each other punch people on the sidewalk or people who love chicken pot pie Like there's enough people the scale people don't realize the scale like the hundreds of millions of people And to remind everybody who's I know what you are all doing right now. So okay, wait a minute Let me get this straight John I'm gonna do a thing called like mowing my lawn on Saturday is the greatest three hours of my life group Right because that's the content I'm making and I'm John You're telling me people are gonna come to this URL after and Gary You're telling me I'm gonna get one viral post because now I'm going a different route I'm going a different route everyone just so follow with me. I've decided that it's I'm not gonna do the random Gary challenge I'm gonna do the lawnmower thing That's what resonated with me because I can actually post that every day or I can film on my Saturdays enough to post seven days a Week that's what I'm gonna do and what I'm gonna do is on my stand store. I'm gonna have a community That's gonna charge people two bucks a month to be a part of yeah To be in here and what you're gonna say everyone on the other line is like why the fuck would I do that when I can go around? Social and find that and do it for free and I'm gonna tell you that people whether consciously or subconsciously know that the friction Associated with paying two bucks a month to be part of something will make the quality of the community way better Yes, they'll actually be bought in and opted in correct So what people don't understand is like yes There are free versions on social and forums and discords, but this is coming from a discord reality There are unlimited discords that charge and what you know that happens when you charge is it's a different person all of a sudden Those random people that piss you off in forums discords and Twitter that are just trolling and hateful They're not as inclined to pay six bucks to just fuck with you That's correct and Having 8,000 people that pay six bucks Those fuckers really give a fuck and I'm not joking when I say this all of a sudden if you're this person You're gonna wake up in 2031 and you're gonna have Saturday lawnmower con Where you're literally gonna have John Deere paying you $500,000 sponsorship For literally 4,000 people around the world coming to a fucking field in the middle of nowhere, Ohio to fucking mo lawns I Believe that I love it. You're literally gonna make 800 bucks a month 8,000 bucks a month For people that are paying eight bucks a month To just talk with each other about lawnmowers and you're gonna learn your entrepreneurial thing and eventually you can be like fuck What can I do on top of this and you're gonna create a real life event? Because comic con had nobody show up to the first one Hmm, do you know that comic cons first comic con was like in a hotel ballroom and had like 13 weird ass nerds I had no idea. Yeah, that might be a hyperbole of it, but it was incredibly small And oh by the way, of course everything that starts is incredibly small Like that's do you know that Super Bowl one did not sell out. No way Super Bowl one Didn't sell every ticket in the stadium That was only in 1967. Huh in 1967 The NFL was so unpopular that they couldn't sell it was actually the NFL versus a if it was two different leagues Joe name it from New York Jets won Super Bowl three in a stunner and it merged the leagues We'll get into that in a different time, but Everything starts small and so when I sit here and say Moe or con literally Moe and by the way, let me go a different way You know how like some people like Moe without like like like old school like like, you know Like, you know what I'm talking about like a wooden and fucking like no electric like you can get that niche I'm gonna start a group of people that mother lawn with not Something that's powered by electricity all by hand The reason I'm going there is that would be really good as a con Like if you get like 8,000 people that are like fucking we got to be men of the pen This is actually so weird now Like this is so on trend like real men and grounding and like we fucking don't even wear shoes because we got to be Grounding with the earth and we use a fucking wooden and metal fucking lawn mower and we do our whole thing those motherfuckers Those 8,000 guys that would pay eight bucks a month to be in your group We'll all show up with their fucking wooden mower and Moe and you'll have a 250k sponsor This is real shit brother Liver King, I know it's very controversial and all that but it was felt liver Like eat fucking liver like like every niche in perpetuity cut hair backwards fucking eat dog food as a human Only watch sports between 1 a.m. And 2 a.m. And tweet about it Wearing shirts inside out in perpetuity that I am going to wear my shirt inside out for the rest of my life And we all should do that that leads to 5000 people paying five bucks a month to talk about living different you got a little up right yeah We like first it starts with the funny part that leads to the viral posts But then it leaves to like not living by people's standards and then that leads to you doing big shout out to untuck it because I knew that kid Because he did some wine stuff so they're like what about that fucking like you you start a show I'm like really cooking right now with gas H&A knows me We've got a hundred million dollars. I'm literally everybody you're watching me create a hundred million dollar brand I am gonna start wearing my shirts inside out I'm gonna charge you five bucks a month to be part of my community on stand for people that wear shirts inside out and Then once that builds up I'm gonna launch my inside out brand of t-shirts, and it's I literally am telling you I'm not gonna do it because I have a lot of things going on. I just told you a Hundred million dollar business. That's how weird this is man. It's all about just finding your people That's just what it is, right? But my argument is that every human being on earth should you stand? Yeah? I think that's really what I'm saying like everybody should have you social for this reason and everyone should have the tech stack To be prepared because because the viral moment right now does not monetize Millions of people have gone viral this year already six months in and haven't made a penny from it and it fucked with them Yeah, cuz I'm on the receiving end of this John I get different modes like I'm the guy that literally gets emailed by Strangers at scale that says I just got two million views on this. What do I do Gary? Mmm, and the reason I think I've been freaking out for 40 minutes. I'm like fuck. I didn't see this This is right like if they're preempting What stand or something like stand I don't even like fuck stand even for a second This is like important shit like if you're ready for the moment And I think you've built the best mode for this and the cost structure has me going crazy Like I feel comfortable saying fucking do this and pay 29 net bucks a month Even if you go the whole year and nothing fucking happened 360 bucks to be prepared for your life changing is a fucking good investment. I Think we have to actually I'm like now talking to you like almost breaking the fifth wall I think we need to like actually build this out and show people what to do when the moment happens Because I'm like improving right now But I think we need a guide that when something goes viral. This is what have stand ready Yep, have all this set up this what you see where I'm going and this is what your hour looks like in the moment You go viral to actually capture this bridge. You'll have to we'll have to do a bunch of work on this This is this speaks to this I think takes it to a whole different planet because there's no cost of entry Yeah, people that are listening right now that like Mike right Mike is not an entrepreneur He you know and this is a joke off of yesterday's tea with Gary Vee where I got him the social cell and he did great And he could use the extra bucks and this was like four weeks ago. I was like Mike How's it been going? He's like hasn't sold since I'm like you're a fucking loser, but he's not a loser He's just not a salesman, right? But so Mike who I adore and that's why I'm using him. It's important to me This is this whole rant for an hour has been about Mike Mike Isn't gonna be the person that read crush it and went But Mike listening right now. I'm sure he's been listening Mike Absolutely represents the rest of the 7.9 billion dot people on earth There's like, huh what and like again Mike, what are you into like what give me some other your interest? Great. Oh great. Nice. So Mike Mike's thinking right now. He's like, huh? Okay, Gary like what else Mike Jersey Shore life Great. Let's just I apologize those two things because I knew that one to be true. I just want to show everybody I know my place Mike's now okay, so wait what's Gary said so I go to stand and obviously we got work All of us have worked to figure out like this guide for people to understand so you set it up You're in and 29 bucks is risk. I don't I don't say that lightly But again, I think we just talked about the value of 360 bucks in a year to like change your whole life So wait Gary I'm gonna post on Tuesday about a piano thing and on Saturday when I go see the fam I'm gonna talk about like Sand when it gets hot Right like or like or the Jersey Shore what have you Huh, did I hear that right? I can create either a five dollar a month guide to the Jersey Shore or a $5 kind of community pay five bucks to talk about the Jersey Shore 365 days a year because the Jersey Shore's a 365 day a year thing and you got a prep in the spring to make sure you match like and then he realizes like huh and then one post in a year gets three million and then everyone's hitting my URL on my profile and now I've got 39 people paying me five bucks a month and wait a minute Huh, does that mean I'm getting paid 200 bucks a month to basically be talking in my stand Instead of talking somewhere else randomly on the internet. I think that's going to resonate. Yeah You see where I'm going. That's a very different twist. I think then what like I think it's the evolution It's funny. I have one more book I have to write and I wrote crush it and then I wrote crushing it and I Literally literally this last week was like should I write crushed it as like the third book in this of like what or Crushing it in an AI era is like crush it Actually my how-to book series was that like what's that series that was that's so big um What are the what's that book series? That's like super humongous and it's for everything dummy. Thank you AJ AJ this is why he's the best like is crush it my for dummy series like do I write crush it crushing it in the AI era because I have very big thoughts about live shopping this you know I Actually think I'm laying out the thesis of crushing it in this new era right now in real time. I love it Well, I think just to give everyone a really tactical guide by the way on how to take over I'm talking a lot in terms of stand store. It's actually as simple as you have we'll come up We'll give you guys a full what to do when you go viral This just you guys all knows this is how literally simple it is So you sign up for your stand store free trial by the way before you even convert into having to pay $29 a month That's huge. All you have to do should have mentioned that earlier. We probably lost half of listeners who might fucking 30 minute rant All you have to do Let's say you go to the Jersey Shore Mike and you you go viral just talking about like actually the Jersey Shore isn't like that show It's actually well some of it is but it's also really fucking nice and here's all my favorite restaurants Here's my favorite hotels and this is like my like itinerary which by the way There's multiple people who like monetize something like that for like nine bucks All you literally have to do is you go to your stand store and they're basically You see stand that store and someone's Lincoln by that's when you know they're real entrepreneur But all you have to do is just you have these little blocks like on your little Lincoln bio website You just add a little block that says like I want to create a little like Jersey Shore guy I want to create a digital product then you go in you ask Stanley to be like hey like write me a Jersey Shore guide based off of this Video I just posted it'll just do that you like I could PDF it you could turn it into a camo guide Whatever you want to do what's your stop you just click upload you press publish you set a price and then you're literally done Like that was like that was literally it no shit the reason I use Mike is like I'm being serious This is not me razzing Mike. I'm also not a million things like I don't put being an entrepreneur salesman on a pedestal Obviously, I'm aware it's societally has gotten bigger by the way I'm the old band in this room when I was growing up being an entrepreneur salesman was looked down on You have that was the era of the new thing and like Stanford Harvard Goldman Sachs in 1990 was 10 times more important than it was when you guys were coming up and it's still massively important but you know so when I when I when I joke with Mike right now It's what I learned in my life is that I'm in a very small group of people There are very few people on earth that are purebred entrepreneurs. That's why they are so that's why the good ones are so Compensated it's just merit. It's just the reality of the game What I think I'm getting completely excited about right now is Literally when I walked into this room Five minutes ago aka an hour or so ago I thought that this is so cool because the people that listen to me are Built for this product, but I knew that Only really really because I have so many people listening to me for parenting and entertainment There's like I know my audience that really 67.3% of the people that were listening right now should 100% do this in the middle of this I Genuinely comfortably believe that I stumbled on the fact that 100% Like I view this podcast right now in my brain the same way I did when I told a kid document don't create and I knew it Yeah, it became such a big part of my career Like I did the Javits Center talk where I said smurf it up and it changed my career If I keep and I may or may not back to the inside-out shirt thing like I don't know how far I'm gonna go down this path of Me believing in the 365 day random challenge the standard for structure But if I keep going this is like four years of my content Yes, and this will be the piece of content that I keep editing from because it's the long form like this is a very important combo jump again entrepreneurs, yes Entrepreneur tendencies. Yes, that's how I got to 67% I'm actually now saying everyone that's correct Everyone really everyone. Yeah, truly everyone has something to give I believe a lot of people are really not interesting to the market on both their passion and their skill set This is what's an important thing. I've thought about this a lot because I wrote that book You and I agree on the passion and skill set overlay sure I believe there's too much competition and there's a lot of people even though It's their biggest passion and their biggest skill set that is not a product market fit for real monetization Like real monetization sure I believe this random thing. I'm talking about back to what you said earlier This is where I'm going and this was the thesis, but I'm watching it evolve. I There's a there's a piece of content I make my dad if you remember this I Made a piece of content that said your niche is you yes, you remember that sure Because that's really it. It's that snowflake thing right like the only thing we really all the way have is every piece of us Yes, I think the combo we're having of the combination of social and Stan Actually allows everyone actually a fighting chance to actually monetize that truth Can I give you an honest pushback in caveat and maybe I'm cynical and I have all the data It's Stan. We have all the best creators most successful entrepreneurs using stands. We have all the data on like what works The pushback I'd give you to really help people think about this more I would argue you have the upper you have the middle class and upper middle class Which is which is the right? Right, so Jimmy mr. B should go do this brand deals But like the most successful entrepreneurs who like own their own brand that yeah people like I got me I got me that grow Upper middle like you know became upper middle class This is the caveat I give you and so I'm curious how you think through this so It's very very hard to monetize anything people don't realize like you have to post consistently I'd say you have the viral lawnmower video I'm skeptical that you'd have recurring when I think of real business you have recurring revenue every single month your business Makes revenue around this unless you consistently I'd say you see the lawnmower pattern and then you've doubled down on it Yeah, and I would say that's absolute first of all That's a hundred percent right and this is getting to the essence of this conversation That if you're the motherfucker that really like if you're if your daily random content is you and your life to your point And I'm gonna actually agree with you if it's like the way I'm thinking about it right now at least because that's what's so weird About this podcast usually when I'm doing a podcast whether it's mine or I'm a guest I'm only talking about things that are already formed sure what's happening now is like what I do with AJ at like 11 o'clock at night on a Family vacation. We're like we're like we're like bantering right now, so let me let me so I'm gonna just I apologize I'm gonna agree with you like if I'm just gonna use myself because it's always easiest thing if I'm like eating my own dog food I'm doing the challenge and today because I do use a toothpick Like I like using a toothpick. I think it's funny and like I think it's interesting So I use it right if today that was it and like I put it on the ground I'm like I just use this toothpick and like honestly like big shout out toothpicks like fucking they're underrated Take away the fact that I'm an entrepreneur and probably could build a 50 million dollar toothpick business on the back of this to your point And you're right that goes viral I decided to do a guy like I'm smart enough to let layer it up And I decided to do a guide to like mouth hygiene or like I'm not just in toothpick Your points right. I'm not gonna be able to sustain it where it says now That's what's super weird where you really won me over though. Believe it or not your product is gonna counter you It goes an offer anything. No because it goes back to AJ earlier AJ I don't think was inherently passionate about people walking side by side. I know AJ very well I don't think he wanted to punch people that walk side by side My point here is when I Gary or anybody who's listening does the toothpick thing if the product I'm selling on my stand store is the community and hang out with people that care about toothpicks at three bucks a month It let me just really play it out. So now a thousand people sign up for that. Sure. I'm shitting my pants Like I'm literally shitting my pants like I love John and Gary more than life because I've now I decided to do it for two bucks And I'm making two thousand dollars a month. I'm sure you have fees. So it's not purely two thousand But whatever it's it's literally just 29. Okay, so I'm making two thousand dollars a fucking month I'm like I cannot believe this fucking podcast I listened to four months ago has just let I'm making two thousand dollars a month next month. It goes to 1300 because to your point like I didn't do that much. I didn't know what the fuck to do with it I didn't feed the farm, right? but If you made two thousand in that most people are gonna watch what's happening in that community Like if let's just keep playing because we got time I just did this two thousand thousand people are being two bucks a month and they're literally talking about toothpicks And I'm like what the fuck is going on here, but I'm making two thousand I have a funny feeling from 7 p.m. At night to midnight I'm just reading every post and I'm probably jumping in once in a while and be like yo, it's me like thanks for being here I want everyone to hear this because you're gonna love where I'm about to go if you have a half a brain And I'm gonna fill out your other half brain right now for you if you're watching that what will happen is Three people will emerge Anyone that's ever had a community in their life on discord on forums in the 90s like I did about wine knows that your community becomes the mods right So if you're a toothpick guy you see this you have no way to continue it going To your point you're right the digital product selling the guide no way on the tooth bike the community product you fucking built Even though I'm not part of it because it was random if I just give it 60 days Watch how they all talk to each other and message the 13 alphas in there get on zoom with them Get a good feeling for a cup of them offer them maybe 20% of the fucking action or a thousand bucks a hundred bucks a month Those mods can drive it That's it and so but let's play out this thesis please let's Every I think I'm just so tired of yet rich quick stuff like Everything that I realized in purple if you want to build something long-term. Let's say for that community You you still are you saying that you can just show up really randomly and and share everything And then you'll figure out your product and then you should double down are you saying broadly? You'll have like a I'll say a lot of things I mean to your point like everything that has worked for me has been predicated on the concept that everyone's looking for get rich quick This isn't get rich quick. This is respond to a truth quickly The truth is yes, three million people found this 13-second toothpick video interesting. Yeah, I Was smart enough to listen to the Gary Vee audio experience listen to the episode with Stan Decided fuck it the 360 year is worth it. Is there a yearly membership discount? Yeah, it's like 20% off Yeah, even better. Yeah works for my thesis. I decided under 300 bucks is a good deal for me to take the fucking risk I'm gonna fuck with this the Gary 2017 flip challenge work for me Gary's fucking tick-tock thing work for me fucking Let me try this new fucking thing he's got that When you're in that place Yes, there's gonna be people like back to AJ because it's fun Golf Wrestling the passion you and I are fully aligned on the crush at thesis what I'm trying to figure out in real time right now Bear with me by the way AJ will tell you this at the end of this podcast I might completely get off this entire thesis cuz I'm play all cuz what we're doing is playing the chest Yeah, that's so I just give me the warning like this may end with me That was a stupid shit and I'm happy that you guys to hear it through But there's something that I'm trying to think through to your point. I think that There's unlimited people that would do this right now And this is why I'm so glad we're having this combo that would have the moment and It's not get rich quick They would actually monetize but it would dwindle and die in an eight month period right they didn't continue investing Correct and to our point both of our points and the reason I'm agreeing with you is For me Gary Vaynerchuk it would be hard to continue to invest in the toothpick thing my counter to that was the the Content product is dead on arrival to your point right? I'm like, that's right The thing that got me going was the community product doesn't actually need me to be the most passionate about it I just have to be the operator of the first hundred days to find the four people in the community You you're basically fine. This is like no bullshit. What I'm saying is you're gonna find your future business partner Because you made something random that you're kind of not even that crazy about it goes into the community product They're the most passionate and capable and they are loving life for making 25% of the subscription revenue To keep it going and you started it So you were the idea guy or gal, but the operators you're talking about operations There is nothing besides execution. Yeah Ideas do not beat execution ideas with execution and the best idea about it that But execution always gets some sort of result ideas every fucking person listening right now shoots their fucking ideas with each other over Dinner and do nothing in their whole life. Yeah What I'm saying is this is why I'm obsessed with what you're building You have You know when I think of like slogans like Stan has a product for that. Yes, you have a product for this problem I just said the toothpick thing and spent 30 minutes on the written product or the informational product You if I didn't know thank God in the middle of my ranting you brought up the community product Because I still have a lot to like know every T&I and said if I didn't know that I would have stopped this conversation Be like you're right because the toothpick thing as me being the content producer would not work The community thing though if I get a thousand people in there at a buck a month And I spend the first 60 days to figure out who the alphas and most passionate are DM them and set up zoom interview them and pick two of them Potentially some people just do it for free because they fucking love anime so much potentially. I'm smart enough to know like fucking Let me financially incentivize this person. Hey, let's just play make pretend me and you as kids Hey, John, you're into this game more than I am I'm you know, would you I'll give you 30 cents of every dollar we make on this Can you you know can you just continue running this as the main dog to keep this fucking Feeding and going I'll make some more content a little bit. Do you like fuck? There's scenarios where somebody's listening who say hey, John, do you want 80% as I'll just take 20% because I realize I'm leaving after this Yeah, like this is very interesting to think about. Yeah, so that's what I'm saying I'm saying there's a viable path for an entrepreneurial tendency even for a mic Who I mean this I keep using Mike I'm not rassing him who maybe is not a businessman if he listens to this does it gets to Jersey's short thing I think for Mike knowing Mike he can watch that community for the first three months pick Rudy who lives in fucking seaside heights Give him 50 cents on the dollar. It's very interesting to debate So these are my thoughts help you really submit this and finalize this and formulate it What I what I agree with you on is bring your whole self very randomly I think there's value in that allowing someone to figure out what is the thing that they should monitor read Where I am more skeptical is I see your vision on how this could work with the community piece at scale Why I'm skeptical of that is number one if you for example if someone Posts about the Jersey short and builds that community and is passionate about this can continue to operate Correct but and so I think most people should go down that path and you're you're thinking about like how do I actually In this state of randomness start to just pick out ideas that people resonate with and then I'll find people who to operate those Well, I'll tell you why I say that and you're smart enough to know this. There are a lot of people on earth Who started something and then handed it off to someone yes in whatever form family business random employee Like there there are people who've made real money in the internet era of being kind of a co-founder from an idea standpoint The ones that are not selfish sure and real let's again Let's say me you and AJ were all good students not just you too and we were college roommates, right? And I'm like and I like and in the dorm room one day and I'm like guys I have an idea and let's say that idea ends up being uber fucking actually AJ. Let's take it to the extreme Garrett camp Do you know that is yeah, of course okay everybody Garrett camp is the human be I this is I don't know how often I tell this story It's documented in a business inside article I Gary Vaynerchuk was in a hotel room in Paris when Garrett camp told Travis Who is known as the face of uber and eleven other of us? Hey guys, I have an idea What do you think about the idea of an iPhone app where you can press a button and a limousine will pick you up? It's one of the most profound moments in my life There's grab that grab it grab it. I want you to grab it John I want you to grab it take it to your desk and I want you to read to the podcast what that framed thing Start with a date start with the date alright Friday April 8th 2011 11 in the morning from James at uber.com to AJ Vaynerchuk Something something something at gmail.com Hey AJ, I wanted to say thanks for being our first. This is fucking insane dude Hey, I wanted to say thanks for being our first ever uber writer in New York. How is your experience? All right There's more to that email But I just why I just had you do that for effect is how early we were in uber right AJ my brother Forever I literally goosebumps like when he's an old man is like by the way now with self-driving car Like well who the foot uber is gonna seem like a fucking horse with a buggy by then But AJ is literally the first human being like this I was literally in the room when uber was first now Garrett had probably been thinking about it But it was the first time that Garrett had articulated the idea in fact the company was called uber cab in fact Garrett came up with the idea Travis got brought into it and they hired a third person to run it Ryan Graves Ryan Graves and Ryan Graves got that job by me retweeting Travis's job description because he had 424 Twitter followers and I had a lot more Ryan made Billions Garrett made the most Garrett never ran anything but the idea so then like like just real quick on that that is uber right He's idea and put a couple things in place and went I am talking about Mike I Don't think Mike with his Jersey shore thing that I'm saying out is going to make billions of dollars But do I believe that Mike on one tick tock with a stand infrastructure around the Jersey shore if he decides to be a Smart as Garrett and realize let me give equity to other people who are doing things whether he keeps 10% Of the community that makes five thousand a month Yeah, or he keeps 90 because his sister's willing to do it or whatever the circumstances of real life are Do and I can give you many more stories than the uber one and I know you know this to be true People hand-off businesses at very different stages Some people run a pet shop for 30 years and they give the business to the manager and they let the manager have 51% and they go to 49 and they fucking sit in Florida and get a check and the managers thrilled Because the manager was a fucking kid that dropped out of high school in an era where that was the death sentence not like today and is happy To send 49 cents of the dollar to the original boss because he was grateful for the opportunity Eventually he'll have resentment because the at first you're happy and then six years later You're like wait a minute he hasn't been around six years. Why am I still sending him a check? But do I believe that what we just talked about which is super interesting could lead to people who have ideas and are creative To find sustaining revenue if they're good enough to hand it off To the mods that think about how many mods and discord and forums were the actual reasons reddit dig I was there they were the actual reasons shit happened. They made no money They made a happy always make fun of like, you know, Facebook and Twitter like they're making all the money But creators made money mods made no fucking money if mods now become business partners Yeah, to what I'm talking about now because you can go viral and you can have this stand tech stack And then you can put in the work the first year to find your partners Because what's happening in my story is I'm just replacing the human that's passionate about the Jersey Shore And I think that's really right. How about that? So then the skill set to teach people is how to identify those operators and set the opposite that's a different thing That's right. And you know what's so funny if somebody's ultra smart listening They're gonna literally what you just said triggered me because if I was a kid Listening to this podcast because I looked up to Gary Vee and I'm interested in John like I would be like Oh, I'm gonna start courses on how to teach to identify the operators So everybody who's about to do this with Gary Vee is gonna need me like and I'm gonna use it's like a real meta move You know, that's super smart. That's super smart. I see it I still as you've continued formalized at this thesis I still I fundamentally believe that if someone posts for 365 days for if they if for everyone listening this We have all the data on who makes it. There is a singular pattern There's just one pattern that we can correlate between everyone It's the actual life that's just literally never give up But the tactical manifestation of this is the people who post every single day Even if you're starting from zero are the ones who actually make it correct It's just your consistent commitment to driving traffic to building lines learning how to market yourself and then your stands for I promise You will make money as a downstream of that so I Fundamentally believe in this challenge from that perspective and I like the random idea because you're just gonna figure out from your own organic passions What that is and I believe you will find something that you want to commit A lot of time to I'm more skeptical and maybe it's because I'm not why this way the I Do believe you can be the ID generator and spin stuff out with operators But that by the way that is the end of the entire debate sure to your point. I Mean notice how this whole last 20 minutes started with me saying how many people couldn't do crush it Sure All I've done is have an aha moment here between where the algorithms are in social and what you've built That literally everyone can if they fought like what I just did was not saying by the way the first part that you said like back To crush it. That's the better one Yeah, like if you're a savant about wrestling and you love it so much like you can make a million dollars a year or Or a hundred thousand a year like being in the wrestling content But like for damn sure community content for damn sure I'm just saying that there's a lot of people that aren't and the fact that I just literally thought process the jam session into how I can get the least entrepreneurial Most creative people like you're many fucking artists there are John I Think every human is an artist there, but you know where I'm going right? Let's go the cliche thing the starving artists The amount of people living in Brooklyn right now Yeah, that are fucking unbelievably interesting Super creative think different, but do not have an entrepreneurial Bone in their body, you know when we get into these political times where everyone's like yeah, let's fuck with communism You know like that kind of stuff. I love looking at that. You know I was born in communism, so I love looking at it I'm very empathetic. I do believe separation of wealth is a real issue like I think about these things But obviously I'm fucking entrepreneur like I I also believe like the government like like I believe in merit and you know the human race But when you look So many people fit this is why I'm so excited about this the people that are like yeah, fuck it Like let's shoot every billionaire in the face and let's let the government fucking take care of us are the people I'm most excited for For what I'm talking about right now because they actually are way more creative than a lot of business people and The tech is starting to catch like right now. I'm like holy fuck That cliche person in Brooklyn who's like let's move to the USSR is Oftentimes the person that fucking knows the most about pickling in the world sure tattoos leave doubt pickling fucking genius Who literally post about pickling and now has $9 a month people at scale and they aren't Entrepreneurial they don't know how to do that part. They know the art and The fact because you know this on the passion part if they still lack complete business savvy It's still gonna be like a slog Like from the creative it's gonna be a slog for them to sell a $9 a month book Even if they're like fucking savante about I always say this the thousand best books ever written Nobody knows cuz they didn't sell. Yeah right The fact that you have a community product That can get 10,000 picklers in there for a buck and if she's or he is listening to me right now And is really picking up what I'm putting down that when this moment happens They just need to pick two or three minority or majority partners from the community that are driving the community That is viable in a way that I've never seen before an hour ago I Think you're you're coming upon the thesis that I saw I've always believed is like everyone has something to monetize It's just about whether or not they have the tools and also the educational path to do so And so that's what we give through Stan is all the tools you need for the most affordable price out there And on top of that then now we have Gary V teaching you how to actually and I would tell you that Everybody has something that's monetizable. Not everybody has monetizable capabilities even with education Hmm, that's the part that I'm like freaking out on you see where I'm going brother Yeah, that's the mmm. That's the part that I'm like wait a minute this gara camp thing is crazy I'm dead right about this. I lived it. I literally watched gara camp idea it and get the fuck out He was very lightly involved Ryan came and then Travis really came and Travis did the whole fucking thing and Garrett I'm sure I don't know this detail, but I'm sure Travis and Garrett at dinners and they would debate I'd Travis fucking built it. Yeah Travis fucking built it Travis fucking built government and fighting and everything else and like hitting up me about like should we do petty cabs and like he Not only you know this I was given predators. I don't fight City Hall I don't have that stomach so I could have never been the CEO of uber Travis with like he did everything Travis is uber Garrett made the most money the pickle lady that I just talked about in Brooklyn She could be the gara camp of her community on Stan. I love that blows my mind That's why I've been talking for an hour straight on this. This is like crazy to me all the other parts were obvious this is where It could change everyone's life. That's a big deal to me Because because I think I can teach and I think you could make a great tool I really mean this like I think you could make the best sword and I could be the best fencing teacher in the world And I still don't believe everyone will then get decent at fencing So then we'll help other we'll help those people find a fencer Correct that's what's freaking me out about the community product through the lens of the content product. No No, cuz I can't write about fencing through the lens of like I made a viral piece of content about fencing now There's 84 people in my Stan $3 a month fencing community. I watch it I see Sally is like fucking posting 13 times a day. I DM her I get on zoom with her We talk I'm like Sally. Do you want 50 cents of every dollar here of what I created Sally's gonna say yes Cuz she's the hell fuck community person Sally then takes it from 84 to 800 people and it's a nice little fucking side fun for everyone That is replicable for literally every human on earth. I believe that that's crazy to me. I love it That's fucking crazy to me straight up all right, I completely derailed everything on this random idea what Have we not touched on Given that I've been in an hour 30 minute haze of like excitement about this What have we not touched on John so far that you would like to touch on a little more for instances to help people think We've talked about your two most popular products Can you talk about number three and four in the tech stack because everybody for listening to me? This is the ultimate $29 Swiss Army knife Like we just talked about the scissors and the screwdriver, but if you know a Swiss Army knife, there's other things I want to touch everyone in this podcast. What what's number three and four? So I think I can I think I can end it with this which is number three and number four are booking some sort of call on your calendar And then the number four is specifically doing a webinar, which is an at-scale version of that Point being is every Single medium through which you think you can convert a customer whether it's getting on the phone with you and paying for a live Coaching call or doing a discovery call or it's selling them and they're giving out a freebie or selling them a low-ticket digital product Or a big course that's a thousand dollars or doing a community everything you need you have as a Swiss Army knife tool with Stan What I think is more important to show people is The forensics as we gave whether it's you know Jena Saharis moving across the country from Hawaii to to the East Coast escaping abusive relationship by building her online coaching business through Stan and getting to move her child with her or it's you know The example of stone I gave who's 18 years old or it's it made 100 K in his first month or it's Eddie Abby at 65 She's got people how to stay fit Whatever your story is and whatever your passion is my promise to you is that nowadays? There's at least one to ten to probably a couple hundred people in your specific passion that are making real full-time incomes on stand and So with that context being said I Fundamentally believe especially now with you involve Gary that like this is the new wave I also do believe there's an Arbitrage in an alpha moment, which is like at some point. It's the attention economy There's a certain amount of zero some attention I believe that one needs to move sooner as in right now rather than later to actually grab that attention because there's first Move her advantage to things and so now is the time if you've been questioning at all whether or not to do it like this Hopefully can be your sign to do that thing you've seen Gary do it for a decade plus This is what stands all about and we make it as affordable as possible as easy as possible and we're here to support you Where do people go stand up store? That's it sign up for your free trial Gary's gonna be doing a lot of stuff with us so Everybody please you can tell so just to give clarity on the book end So AJ and I got involved as investors and and advisors and like and again deeper than that This is kind of like the first foray into this so I'm really excited about it So if you have any questions hit me up about it You can I'm gonna figure out a way to like siphon all my inbounds to this proper people on the stand team It's another thing. We just made up on the spot. So John tell me who to send things to and Yeah, we're gonna hang up here now and start having a working session To figure out more things and more challenges and more stuff for the for the holiday season and new year new you I mean, I think for a lot of you a lot of you are gonna actually stumble on this podcast in November December I always think those last seven or eight days of the year people are like thinking about like 2026 Like am I happy about it or am I devastated about it? And so a lot of stuff to come but John, thank you so much Thank you, Gary. Let's build
