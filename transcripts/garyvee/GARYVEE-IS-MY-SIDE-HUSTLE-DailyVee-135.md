## Transcript
Two workouts, six hours. Yeah, somebody's gotta do it. Also just tied my shoes, which is unheard of. 🎵 Cause we're gonna be legends 🎵 🎵 We're gonna be legends 🎵 🎵 Gonna get their attention 🎵 🎵 We're gonna be legends 🎵 🎵 What we're doing here ain't just scary 🎵 🎵 It's about to be legendary 🎵 🎵 Here we're gonna be legends 🎵 🎵 We're gonna be legends 🎵 🎵 Gonna teach them all I can say 🎵 🎵 Got this feeling in our souls 🎵 What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? 🎵 And I got a couple of the flows 🎵 🎵 You let me spit it, I'm giving you all of my heart 🎵 🎵 Every thing that I've been inside 🎵 🎵 Don't look, I'm fighting the records 🎵 🎵 Repugnant punnets that push agendas and pass judgment 🎵 🎵 My confidence, consequence and squandered 🎵 🎵 I'm being honest, these moments never lapse 🎵 🎵 I sit and watch them pass me 🎵 🎵 But still five times for the craft 🎵 🎵 Throughout the midst of madness 🎵 🎵 This mind numbing tactic is now been a major factor 🎵 🎵 Well you see as monotonous because my daily practice 🎵 🎵 Stuttered around before I front the back 🎵 🎵 Till I know it all 🎵 🎵 It's every adjective, it's every consonant 🎵 🎵 It's every similar verb now and it's for the fight 🎵 🎵 It's for the soul but it's all composed 🎵 🎵 Like a fragile mind 🎵 I would argue, everybody, in theory there's nobody you can't have as a customer. So the reason for 700 bucks that I would go to a meme account that has 3 million followers on Instagram to do a post is just a sheer volume of attention for that 700 dollars is gonna create distribution. Got it? 🎵 In my family work, they hold lives 🎵 🎵 I've seen them struggling and survive 🎵 🎵 That's why I learned the meaning of sacrifice 🎵 🎵 To love someone so much that you put your dreams on the shelf 🎵 🎵 To provide a life for them that you never asked 🎵 🎵 I'm gonna call an emergency, D1 🎵 🎵 All your mess over no funds 🎵 🎵 Roaches inside the dresser 🎵 🎵 But never settled for less of these rabbits 🎵 🎵 Speak of progression, there's no direction 🎵 🎵 To see this mind boggling and selfish 🎵 🎵 This is no materialistic chicken 🎵 🎵 Fix all of your problems and situations 🎵 🎵 And if this is a single Monday, death of the soul 🎵 🎵 And Monday's, if there's no moral compass 🎵 🎵 But you've been masked and I'm out of wealth 🎵 🎵 And invest in the crucifix 🎵 🎵 And the tempest 🎵 Because I'm winning that whole like business spam personality thing and all the other guys and girls that are trying to win they're doing it full time. And so like a lot of times I'll make fun of them because they're my friends you know I'm like you know that Gary Vee's my side hustle right? Yeah like V.O. You know you know so so they're always like holy shit that's true. Big fan. Thank you. You're awesome man, just keep doing it. Thank you. Did we like the second reception? Yeah, we did. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry about that. Thank you. Hey, about that. Thank you. She's like super good at what? I was not surprised. Yes we did. How was it? How was it? Thank you. Thank you. It was good. It was really good. I wanted to ask one other question that's kind of like did we already miss the door uninfluences? 🎵 Yes, love, now let's click a button 🎵 🎵 No more tearing, no special just for you 🎵 🎵 What now 🎵 🎵 I'm just real good at it 🎵 More stuff to the back. 🎵 I'm just real good at it 🎵 Yeah and not just like the cases but just the infrastructure. Well we're going to be able to do more of it because I'm going to hire a lot more against it and so it's like just going to keep giving them more assets. Right. 🎵 To provide a life for them that you've never had for yourself 🎵 🎵 I recall all their nights in D1 🎵 🎵 Longing minutes over no funds 🎵 🎵 Won't change this out the dresser 🎵 🎵 But never said no for the rest 🎵 When did you get in? I got in yesterday. Yeah, latte's great. I got in yesterday. Are you guys doing any marketing to wreck to consumer on behalf of the tenants because you want to become the... That's what we're starting to do. Well that's where we get... Well whenever you're mature enough to have that conversation here's my punchline. Depending on how much you do or don't know about me we'll factor in how much you believe what I'm about to say. My basic goal with this company is very simple. If a human who represents a company gives me a penny that whatever the fuck they want to happen I'll do a better job with that penny than anybody in the world. And that's why we don't theme ourselves a social media shop. We think we're a attention shop. So we have every capability, media, production, creative, strategy and it all comes down to one thing. Tell me what you want to happen and then we try to go backwards in spending the lowest amount of money to make it happen. Another successful trip to London. I think 30 hours this time. So pretty good. A bunch of client meetings. All client meetings. All current clients and a couple of prospective clients. And so I'm really excited about it. My man here coming through again doing his thing. And yeah nothing super... I didn't give you a whole lot of crazy footage this time. A lot of meetings you couldn't be a part of. Just classic running a business. Like when I think about the LEV 365 episodes or the ambition of maybe 330 because of family vacations or things of that nature. Some days are just not going to have anything too exciting. As a matter of fact most days shouldn't. 85% of one of the challenges DRock and another Tyler and Homies that way hanging out like Ralph here. Like one of the challenges really figuring out how to at least show the context of all the meetings I'm actually having. One thing I was telling DRock the other day is like look 80% of the time I'm spending is on VaynerMedia meetings but the LEV is not showing that because we can't show so much. And so you know right? I mean think about what happened on this trip. I'm running a business here. I'm busy. I'm running a business. And I'm in meetings that affect other human beings and so it's hard for me to show them. But you know I think that's a good opportunity to let you guys know. Like there's a lot of hard core day in and day out business making that is not being shown. And I'm going to try to do a better job of figuring out how to interject it even if we just show the still of the meeting starting or the meeting ending. And we start putting times and start putting VaynerMedia, VaynerMedia, VaynerMedia. Because the scary V-shit is my side hustle. I'm the CEO of the fastest growing hottest 800 person, 700 person digital social agency in the world. Okay. Just pounded through 600 emails. Intense. So many teams. So many entrepreneurs. Thank you for the motivation. Welcome. So many people asking how to start. He just started. So many people asking. So this is where marketing works. Yes. This is where. People looking for permission. So I have to figure out. People looking for permission. I'll figure it out. And I'll keep giving it to you. But you've got to figure out how to give it to yourself. Rainy day here in New York. I didn't know that. Because I never checked the weather. Okay. If you never checked the weather. Counterpity. It rains. Or yeah. Dave. Dave Moran's got that one intro to that female entrepreneur sports media site. I can do that. How much time do I have in between June? Why don't I why don't I why don't I leave San Francisco early and get to LA Wednesday night? And how am I getting to Miami? Red Eye. No shot to do anything out. No no shot to catch the earlier one right? Yeah. But it's not too not too bad in my opinion I think. Like not the worst. 6.30 to 8 and get it done. You know what I mean? Unless we get a good thing in you know. Then I think James then Chicago the 24th is fine. Is ready to see us? It's it's it works pretty good. Okay. It's amazing that I'm at that point in my career where my assistant is like it's like a it's an organ it's like so attached. Tyler's doing an incredible job. It's not been feeling well. So it's amazing how the pieces just going back and forth strategizing. It's hand-to-hand combat. It's a partnership. It's amazing. I think one of the things a lot of people are missing out on as an entrepreneur. Got a little bit of success. I know a lot of you are just starting out but a lot of you are watching and you have some traction. I'm highly recommending assistance. I'm highly recommending teams around your content to D-Rocks and the Andes of the world. I'm highly recommending the office of the CEO types. This chief of staff. It may seem like a luxury and something that you can't afford. But inevitably there's always a young buck. You know there's a there's a there's a connection to be made here in the comment section. 44 year old successful entrepreneur who doesn't think she or he has the luxury of paying somebody 70,000 a year to be their chief of staff and and really help them scale. Above and beyond their right hand CFO type or controller or or bookkeeper their COO type their right hand man or woman. Meanwhile there's 50 to 100 people watching this right now. There are 22, 23, 24 that don't want to do it the normal way. That don't want to you know wait seven or eight or nine years to do interesting work. And so yeah I see it's dark. And so are willing to play that chief of staff office of the CEO office of the founder role part assistant part content producer part COO part psychologist. And I don't need that by the way. I just need compliments. And so thank you. DRock and so and so I think that we need more creativity in the way we structure our businesses. I wish I did a chief of staff and admin type that character when I was building Wine Library. I had Brandon but he was really director of operations. He was really my right hand. It's too senior to do to do the 43 things which were 22 little things like book schedule this and 18 things of like follow-up with this. It's just a big deal. I need to figure this out. I've gotten an enormous amount of value from my content team, my admin and my office as CEO. And it's the best investment I've made in my career so far. And I'm looking to expand it. I'm looking to make the office a CEO bigger over time. The creative team is getting enormously big. We try to admins, try to figure it out if we'll do that again. But doubling up, doubling up, doubling up.
