And I had a bunch of different guys that would cut my hair. But Manny cut it one time. I liked it extra short. It was just perfect. So that's what I've been going with. So Manny shoot the shit. Last couple times I've been quiet at the haircut. I've just been so focused. But in the ever never ending quest to pump out seven days a week. Get a hack. So I think you know barbershop talk. So last, that was pretty good how we did the Sunday week ahead look right? Yeah. So let's do that. Another thing I want to talk about. I want to edit the Ask Gary Vee show where I told the guy who was building small business websites how to go into search. How to search the hashtags. How to go to DM. I mean it is you know a lot of people like to talk about how it's going down in the DM on Instagram. And I know that's for you know hooking up and Netflix and chill and all that. But it's also going down for business development. And so I'm going to talk about thank you so much. It's my new email. It's your new email. To me it's where people could be doing so much business damage. And I'll talk about that in one second. So while I give you the quick review of the week ahead. So tomorrow big MLK day. I'm taking I'm going to the next game taking one of the kids. And then I've got a meeting with Kelly Kelly McCarthy who was my right hand along with AJ and building being an early days now killing it at Nike.

Little FaceTime with Amara Russ's manager. Well Amara will be coming in and then Russ is going to be on. Oh yeah. That's awesome. If you haven't heard of Russ's music you've been missing out. Then then my dad and Brandon coming by that's huge. Another client another client. Main or sports internal internal internal internal client internal client former employee. And then then in studio with 21 Savage. You heard of him first. It's a huge Atlanta hip hop day 21 Savage and Russ. Then I go and I got a speaking engagement on Wednesday morning first thing in the morning. Then I've got a client meeting then an all day thing at Pepsi then couple of internal things. Randy Zuckerberg when my dear friend stop and buy football player stop and buy. Internal internal and skip of the flip. You don't know man it's so hip hop that lately client client then I'm flying to London at night. London Thursday morning London workout and some internal client stuff client and made in head. UK client client client client and then wake up Friday morning in London fly back to New York land. Work on the book and then dinner with Ryan Harwood and his lovely wife to celebrate the Pure Wild Deal. Week ahead 80% clients 20% hip hop. All right now let's bring you some value here. I'm obsessed with this. Do you want to sell websites to plumbers 136,000 and then you go and see you click and you see who this is. So this is a custom design firm B2B commercial in Toronto 148,000 followers. This is what they post. Let's say you want to build business websites for small businesses or you want to do social media for small businesses. You go right up here you hit send message you get in a Stee Rock. Feel good. Send message and then here's the key. The key here is to jab jab jab right hook. Love what you're doing would love to be able to bring you some value. Are you doing anything around marketing? Let me know. Have a great day. XLXL heart send. Here's the key. What I just did. Go ahead man. What I just did is something that I've been doing for years back in 2006 and 7 Twitter. I would do that except I would reply publicly because it was a different platform different cadences different acceptable social norms. The thing that blows me away is how many of you are so hungry. How many of you are asking for how do you do things and the reality is it's very simple. It's hand to hand combat. It's business development. It's handing out virtual business cards. But the reality is so many of you don't want to do it because it's hard. What I just did if you're hungry if you want to win you have to do for five six seven eight nine hours a day. Let's show another one. Do you rock? Okay. The fitness hashtag you know only 168 million breaks into top posts and most recent. So you go to a top post. And then he's paying attention. He wants to want to get some good some barbecues. All right. So here's that right. I click him. He's got five hundred forty six thousand people. Right. I see he's a musician and he's a band. But let's say and he's in Cairo. Let's just say for whatever reason I want to do product placement and I have a new shake or energy drink or hoodies or for example this is what everybody should be doing with me. If they want me to wear their sneakers or their beanies right. I wear beanies. I wear hoodies. I wear sneakers. I would hit this person up. I would hit them up and say. Zap love what you do. Would love to connect. Right. Or would love to send you my favorite wines if I was in the wine business or would love to make three to four videos for your Instagram account. On me or would love to send your friends some beef jerky or. And that's the key. It's or and I would love to give you what I get all day is Gary can give me a shout out on my account. Gary can you make me famous. Gary can you do this Gary can you do that. I've got the leverage not you if you're asking you don't have the leverage so anytime I'm hitting somebody up regardless of how bigger or smaller than them. I'm asking so I'm trying to give them love right. That's the key people don't give love when we're hitting up becoming artists both hip hop or have you. We're trying to give them love. Hey we love to give you exposure. Would you like to give us the opportunity. Everybody's trying it like last night. I hit up a couple of people that follow me that are really really big and they both replied to me check this out the rock we're not going to show this. This is more just because I want your crazy reaction. Look at this. I'll show you in a second. This is insane. Look at this. That's crazy. Got another one too. Is that the craziest thing. Where is it. I hope I didn't delete this one. I might have. No I did it. The key is providing other people more value. I just don't see people doing it. It blows me away and it is absolutely I want the full. And it is absolutely going down on Instagram DM. The key is do you know how to jab jab jab right hook on Instagram DM search hashtags click them look at the account. Then see how you can bring them value DM them. Go in soft bring value rinse and repeat 2 3 4 5,000 times one of the great accomplishments in the last 3 4 months in my community is a 2017 flip challenge right. People are making actual money on eBay they couldn't believe that they could sell stuff laying around their house. They're now using Craigslist and let's go and Etsy's and they're learning and I'm watching people learn. Oh I didn't make money here and I'm watching you guys learn you're getting better people making real flips business development. It's one of the pillars of my success. The reason I'm good at business development is I try to bring more value to the other person first. Always going to be the same thing 50 years of content is going to say the same thing provide the other person more value right more value than they give you. If somebody has a million followers and you want them to give a shout out to your work your stuff you need to overwhelm them with value first for example more example time. I want this to be a heavy example time here we go. So let's say you do let's say you like hip hop and let's say and let's say you love Chance the rapper right. So you go to chance a rapper guys got 2.9 million followers he's getting hit up a million times a day when you send him a thing chance. I make videos I'll make you the best Instagram videos for free for an entire year. Your account will go to 7 million let alone 2.9 I won't bother you. I'll just work. I'll need access. At times. But you control that. Let me know. Look at my work on my Insta. Watch you love. Over and over and over got to make sure your Instagram account is on point if you got that if him or one of his boys actually look at it or somebody who's controlling the account. They need to see those videos and think they're fire that's the key but you go over and over man he should do this 15 times a day 20 times day let me show you how many should do it. So the thing many should do is go up or east side right so he's going by location and so he sees top posts right so he sees this. Well this looks like an account. I guess this is a blogger. I'm trying to see looks like she's just visiting and keep looking right and keep looking at most recently keep looking good this guy looks like you took picture. Good took a selfie in the brief side comes here he's got 41,000 followers he looks like a model so many should go here send message. Hey G. Thrilled to give you. 5 free haircuts over the next. 6 months. Let me know if you're interested. This is what many should do here many sit here on Tuesday from 230 to 330 while he's waiting for a client and he sits on his fucking ass. And instead what he should be doing is should be going into Instagram searching the upper east side and DMing people 20 30 40 times a day offering free haircuts because he just started his business. He needs exposure. He shouldn't even ask that model as 46,000 followers to make up he shouldn't even say in the first in first contact. Hey I'll give you a free care cut you give me a shout out because then that's person knows that he's just doing for that it's jab jab jab without the right hook. He should just say hey and like your Instagram account I just opened my barbershop I'd love to give you 6 free haircuts or 2 or whatever you know I don't know how busy me is right now over the next few months guy comes even if you never ask. I work with me for 2 years and asked me then I took the picture and snapchat that you build a relationship when doing the right thing you always do the right thing but to me it's I think about it like sawdust. If you've got downtime why not business develop the fact you can business develop through this thing now is insane and if you offer something in return 3 out of 30 people will take you up on it he may not but the next person might and then you business develop and business develop and things start happening hustling 24 7 on the Instagram DM it is the 2017 opportunity. My new theme song. My new theme song when I post daily they. You'll see. I love this. I love this. While we're here since you know since these episodes are short big shout out I'm looking for 5 to 7 video interns people that can edit. What would we really need people that really know my stuff what are they called predators. Filmers. Filmers. Producers. Predators. I'm looking for 5 up and coming predators who want to be interns who want to put in their years do for a year. Siphon off my attention. As we give you shout outs and tagging you in the work that you do and then either do with the majority of the crews doing which is triple down and want to run with me for a while or use the exposure to do your own thing. Looking for high quality peeps the rocks can be the judge in a jury you gotta be really strong but I'm looking for 5 ASAP. Boy girl black white red green orange Pakistan Sri Lanka New Jersey I don't give a shit if you've got it everything but Patriot fans other than that if you've got it we want to see the work 24 7 hustle minimum a year. No going back to school you this is what you gotta do but we're looking for you and here's DRock or here's the email they came up with for DRock Tyler maybe a couple others will look at I don't know what you guys are going to do but here it is. It's flashing and can't wait for you to join the team and if you can't do that one of the things we're trying to do now is fan V hashtag fan V E E people creating compilation videos around my content the kind of stuff that we put out so that I can put it out on Instagram YouTube Facebook Twitter videos under a minute especially great because I'm looking for more Instagram video content. And also stuff that we haven't talked about so people going back in the archives and finding quotes or things using the ask Gary V search engine I think would be really smart around your concept or strategy and I would even make an original one or two second video for you if you need to add to it and you can just email me on that that you're working on that project and what you need so fan V get on board. Yes sir done. Did we do I breath you did we're finished it's all over we're done all right thank you all my friend great to see you. Love you. You're going to use you're going to use you're going to use the Instagram DM. So what is she can literally search the upper east side. You can literally see everybody who's posting in the area. Right. So again let's just you know this person to eight here so you click this person and you can literally go up here send them a message say I like your Instagram account if you like a free haircut come by. What's great about that is these are individuals who already like to share their lives so if they come they'll give a shout out and it creates I mean you know you live on word of mouth. Yeah. What's your business word of mouth. This is word of mouth on steroids. Learned. You need it especially right now as you're building a new business like every every minute counts you know. You know. I think so. I think your doubt motivated me. We can tie in the content to what we did a year ago because the year ago recalls I think are insane. Like once we start building the library or like searching this date on Ask Gary Vee two years ago. There's never been a day that I've had to activate it's always on and I don't mean always on buzzword marketing. It's that I love what I do so much that there is no friction to turn it on even when I am landing at two o'clock in the morning from a flight that's delayed like the other night and then going directly into it at 6 30 in the morning because the fire is so deep inside. Love it so much. You know you don't need that jump stuff. Guys have a great weekend. See you tomorrow. Happy Martin Luther King's Day. I went to Martin Luther King elementary school in Edison New Jersey. Little fun fact. I was the president. So every day I wake I know. No.
