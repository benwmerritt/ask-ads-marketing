## Transcript
I really actually believe your take on the business of music, the B to C and B to B take. What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? Hey dad, just calling you to tell you I love you. Hope you're having a good day. Hit me back. Morning guys, going up to North Jersey. Heading to see a client. It's been a hectic week. Ending these at like 12, 1 o'clock. Glad this week's over. Get a little rest this weekend. My nephew Max's seventh birthday laser tag should be fun. I'm about to go on Instagram live to promote this 50 seconds to every 50 year old. I am on a mission for every 50 year old in the world to see this. So if you've got a 50 year old aunt, uncle, brother, sister, child, please, please send it on. Let me get up here, baby. Give me a little edit here. Give me something. A little clip of it. I mean, crap, you can play the whole damn thing. It's only 50 seconds. I need you to understand something. You have so much time. I am flabbergasted by how many people think that at 50 it's over. Abbey, how old are you? 44. 44. Like, remember how old you thought 44 was 20 years ago? Yes. Like finished, right? Correct. And doesn't it feel crazy how young you feel right now? I feel like I still do. Yeah, I feel like, well, especially now with this new job, the energy is just bolting in your fucking face 24 seven. There's a fuckload of 50 year olds that think their life is over. That think it's over because they've been playing for 30 years professionally. They're tired. They've been an accountant for 30 years. They hate it, but they don't see any way out because they don't realize that there's Instagram live because they don't realize that there's Facebook groups because they don't realize that they can do a blog because they don't realize they're a great writer and if they did 14 medium posts, they can blow up. And so I'm on a mission to get them to understand that there's still 30, 40 years of amazing things, modern health. These people are going to be healthy for another 30 years. 30. You know what shit you can get done in 30 years, Abbey? You were 14 30 years ago, Ab. That's correct. How old are you? 23. You were fucking negative seven, motherfucker. This motherfucker was negative seven. I just, I want this one. You know? Yeah. How old are your parents? 45. So what the fuck? Did you send it to your parents yet? I will. No, no. Give me the camera. Let's do it right now. Bam. You like that, Abbey? That's the gangster shit I do. You did it? I love it. Mom's got it. Can't wait to see you. Indie, I love you back. You think mom's going to be mad at you that you said, hey, mom, watch this, but it's for 50 year olds and she's 45? Yeah, you might have gotten me in trouble. Yeah. I love it. You know this 50 for 50 video I made? Yeah. Five seconds ago? Yeah. The head of the fucking wants me to give a keynote now. How fucking cool is that? It's amazing how like that works, right? Yeah. Thanks, man. Take care. Hey, guys. Meeting on the 31st. That's cool. James, Alex, Sophie, Linda, Dan, content in theory with STEM from like the direction we get out of this meeting. All good stuff. Right then and there. That they were completely lost in the reality of the world. I think the funniest part of that statement is actually take the word music out and put in any other word and it's the same thing. People are just completely not quantifying the communication shifts of our society. Can I give you a great piece of advice? Are you off the label now? Put out as much music as possible as often as possible and mix it between covers and original. The end. And if you're good enough, you will win. Andy, how many video interns do you want? What do you say video? 500. No, seriously, but like chopping, like editing? Chopping, editing, formatting to Facebook. Okay. Interns. Interns. I'm going to have them DM you. Okay. I speak with them because I don't want... I want full-time interns. I want Babins. Like if you're coming to intern, you're not going back anywhere for at least a year. Okay. Like why? We lose all our like value. And the other thing is like no matter what, I'm talking to you because you're so recent, no matter what the person comes in with, if you're good, if you're good, if you're good, I mean, if you're good, you come in, if you're like, oh, I'm going to do this for a year, I'm going to fucking blow up my brand. I mean, what did you... Actually, let's go right to it. What did you think was going to happen? I mean, all I had to do was like work for you for a year and then I was going to do my own thing. Right. And now? Same? I'm going to be here for a while. Yeah. So like because what happens is... No. Well, I mean like that's amazing because that's exactly... Were you just filming that? Yeah. That is in the episode because that's the punchline. Don't be filled. Like he's an intern too. Like once... We are... We all understand what's about to happen, right? And we've been watching too much westerns, now we pistol-pile. So I'm going to burn this rubber, I'm going to burn this gasoline, and set it on fire, fire, fire, fire, fire. Oh, so much. Yeah. How do you divide your time if you want me to ask you how much is running this and or other business enterprises separately your inspirational, motivational... I would say it is 90% VaynerMedia. Why the inspirational, motivational Gary Vee thing works is because there's 11 people right there doing it. And... It's a little time to magnify it like that. He's recording everything. Yeah. And so like when there's a quote card, when there's an inspirational quote on Instagram that's getting viral, it was just something I said in a meeting with like, especially when I hang out with a character like you or we take it to such a macro, you might have a fucking week's worth of like quote cards, right? You know, so you have some of that stuff. What do you mean? Those... Now what I do as an entrepreneur because I don't have to do it in a corporate environment is I actually see every one of those things through. Here's a good example. Tyler, yesterday when I was like, hey, I've got an idea. I make a video, 50 seconds for a 50-year-old. I make it. I put money behind it. It's got completely batshit today. They're limiting the space between idea, inspiration, and creation and action. And then I do tons of things that are bombs, but it's easy. And as long as the net score is always positive and it's from a yes attitude. If you have a no attitude, you do none of them. You know? Like anyway, so yeah, so this is all this. Where am I going? Hey, this is actually perfect. Me, my friend Matthew. I'm Matthew. Ben, it's Oliver. Hi Ben. Nice to meet you. I'm Mike. Hey Mike, nice to meet you. We're going to have a conversation. Every brand has what you have. Everybody's got somebody who's big, who believes, and then you can, if you can find the right combo or connective tissue, and I appreciate the chance thing because I haven't been saying it that way, that maybe the person not only does the sponsor thing but is the executive producer of something. We're really hacking for success, but they have their say creatively. You can have some. Yeah. Yeah. Third and fourth fifth space? Sir. Malouc. Essentially, the... What's it called? Just for time whatever. No, no phone. No phone, just doing personal... Tell him though, I want to... Tell him, I tried to push Gary to it. He said, this is too important. Got it. And I hate, even like... Yeah, like... Yeah, I get it. And then like call him real quick and be like, yo, this is good. Like when he really likes something, when it's super important, he doesn't even want to call his phone. Yeah. So, you know, just like that, it's 3.41 PM. Literally feels like it's 9.30. Just, I don't know man. Being busy is amazing because you get so much shit done, especially the way I do it. Fives and 10s and 15s. Maybe here's a good chance, you know, we should be doing some new kind of editing. So here's a good chance for maybe all the B-roll you caught up like one second of it. Like it's like... Out Out is doing better than a TV commercial. So, I would actually really like to talk to you about possibly joining the board and straight up, like if you just want to like really fuck with the system. Which, which six months ago, I was more protective. It'd be amazing if we can actually show that. I'm trying to think of how I can edit it together. You can't. You can't. Like you probably learned more about business in the last hour than you've learned in your whole life. And that's the game. Like, like if you want to be anomaly, if you want to be great, you got to do different things. You'll waste time all the time. Schedule all the time. Like just waste time. Make decisions. Do it fast. Get a lot done. I get, I get, I genuinely, and this is what people tell me when they get context from my world, I'm getting weeks worth of work in, in a day. Which is why I'm getting so much done. And I think it's because I understand that most things don't matter. And that if you move fast, of course certain plates will hit the ground. But a lot of plates won't. And it's a hell of a lot better than thinking about how you're going to keep four plates up in the air and never doing it. The way you beat everybody, I think, is you only get data if somehow gut was put into the atmosphere, right? So then people can make a decision on that. That song, that artist. So but someone has to make a decision. The artist, gut. How many? The executive, the talent manager, the, the, the platform, someone has to put something out there for there to be data. So, so the part of gut for data to me is absolutely the most interesting. That's why I would say the next biggest talent is already out there playing somewhere. Talk to a girl today. Talk to a girl today. It's the process of finding, finding that talent and also making a bet on what you see and what you feel. What people have been doing that look like you and I is they curtail themselves. Drake would have two albums right now if it was 1984. Maybe three. You're right. I know. I don't know anything about the music business, but that part I know. And you know, fucking Russ in Atlanta is only famous because he puts out a song every week. More is more. And that person's right. More is more. More is more. Ready? If you're good enough, I'm good enough. How about this? We put out an album. It gets older a week. Isn't that interesting? If you put an album out of 10 or 12 songs, what the streaming guys are telling us is the album comes over very quick. What does that mean? Feed the Beast. More is more. More is more. You made a hit yesterday, right? Yes. Today. How many times do you put hits out and how many times do you get signals from doubles? Correct. Right? From a competitor's point of view, you want to always put, I always say, good is the evil of greats. If Drake put out 365 days of songs for the rest of his life, he would win. If he's capable. Is good the evil of great? No. Good is the gateway to great. You guys are going to follow me. You guys are going to follow me. I want you to look at my shit. My shit's not what it is. I don't care. You remember me from L.A., right? Yeah, man. I'm trying. What's up, brother? Hi, Charlie. Oh, nice to meet you. Gary Vee. I got to get a picture. Let's do it, man. There's no way. I got Gary Vee. I'm here. The president of the Free Free Republic right here. My brother. Big day. What kind of day is this? Wow. What's your name? Julian Bublin. I'm a huge fan. I got all three of your books. Thank you so much, brother. Absolutely. Thank you. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. What's your name? Julian Bublin. Julian Bublin. I'm a huge fan. I got all three of your books. Thank you so much, brother. Absolutely. Nice to meet you, man. My name is Gary. I've been on the Jets one day. That's true. That's true. My name is Justin. There you go. Remember when hip hop artists wanted to be athletes and athletes wanted to be hip hop artists? They say rock stars want to be jiu-jitsu, but it's not rock stars, yeah. They both want to be entrepreneurs. Now they want to be entrepreneurs. And there's only one entrepreneur for them. And that's why you just saw what you just saw. If you were confused. Just about to go down. I'm feeling really good about what's going on. You see it, right? You see the chirping, right? Doing the right thing is always the right thing, Tyler. Just those, man. I'm so pumped you were in that meeting, Wins. I know. You know, because I love you so much. And I know, like, you know, I know a lot about you. And I know a lot about, like, you know, I just know a lot about you. And I love that that meeting, you're there just because that's the action in the game and the heights that you want to be playing at. And so it makes the meeting palpable in the clouds and dirt world. We have to have those meetings to, like, make all the other shit palpable in the short term. Yeah. So what we did was we have a ritual in the office started seven years back when we started this company. 9.30 in the morning we have a 15 minute ritual. 2.30 in the afternoon we have a 15 minute ritual, which is we start with some kind of chanting and praying and everybody prays the energy that was to, you know, so. Very much. Yeah. You know, they don't think of the negative stuff as much. Then there's a motivational video from Gary Vee. And then the afternoon is Gary Vee. So I'm always thinking that I'm, you know, when I'm watching the video and I'm saying, does Gary even know that I think he's counting it at one view? We have 120 of us watching two videos every single day for the last, you know, many years that you've been putting out on every single day. It cannot be missed by one person who's in the office. Say this team outside is different. So these are the, you know, these are the three trajectories that happen. I'm motivated. Your wall papers were a new brand, your quotations. I keep it in my cell phone. Put up internet moguls. It's me, Gary Vee. You may know that. I think you see me a whole bunch because of this dude had a great meeting. I just want to send my love. Thank you so much for the love that you gave me first. And I can't wait to actually meet you guys. Thanks, guys. We've been watching too much Westerns now we pistol. So I'm gonna burn this rubber. I'm gonna burn this gasoline. Oh, well. Hey, how you doing, buddy? Real pleasure to meet you. How are you? Smells good, man. I appreciate it. How are you, sir? How are you? Good. It's so funny, right? When people meet people, like everybody thinks you are that one, like America loves to put you in one part. Yeah, like being a rapper is one part of me and I went to college for marketing. I totally get it. You know, like I totally get same thing with my crossover. Like when I started like dropping references like, oh, you love hip hop. I'm like, why wouldn't why wouldn't I? You know, like every, you know, people, like that's just America. America's obsessed with like, you're like, you're a basketball player, you're a painter, you're a entrepreneur. This is music for my, yeah. This is let me know everything I'm thinking is right. It's more right than you think. It's more right than you think. It's don't hedge anymore. Forget everything you grew up with and you think is real and turn it from color to black and white, start over and go with that gut. What's going on in your head right now? Are you who you wanted to be in your head already? I always knew I was going to be the biggest. But I'm saying so you are who you wanted to be in your head. That's crazy. Cause I didn't think it was stopped. So good. It's a point where you get to stop. No, no, no, no, no, stop working. But I'm saying no, no, no, no, you're already there too. No, no, you are. Let me explain what I mean. Right. It is and it isn't. I'm the best and I don't mean shit. I did it and I haven't even started. Once you learn how to pull from both sides, you're set. Let's get to know each other. Yeah, can't wait. No, no, wasn't lady. Shit, wasn't. Go. No, no, no, no, no. It's very close. It's very close. It's very close. I've been right with you. That's a pretty small bitch. That's right. I fucking, I'll fit it easy. From the same guy. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. From the same guy. Fools it. Holy shit. I'm fucking wearing this shit all the time. Holy shit. I'm a change. Holy, I'm a hundred percent. This guy sent you like an amazing package. We got to make a bit. You know what? When you decide somebody did it real proper, come in with your phone, tell me who it is, I'll make a video and give him real love and we got to send it back. Yeah. Holy shit. Holy shit. I told you to hide it. I brought it all to us. This is so swagged out. It's the compound of the momentum. It's when I say, by the way, what about when I have my one video or one moment off the big famous, I was zero and made videos that would get a lot of things. When you've got base like this, like what I know that I'm gonna do is not change. It's gonna be like, you evolve, but I'm pumping out content. I don't give a fuck what's going on and I'm gonna say something and that video is gonna get 47 million views. So you know how you just react to the market and wait and your counterpuncher? Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm going on the offense in 2017 because this is what's happening this month. We're doing it and then doing it. So yeah, I'm making progress. I think I'm gonna do the call and share. Right now? Yeah. I think I am. Hey everybody, this is Gary Vaynerchuk and this is episode 239 of the Ask Gary Vee Show. See, we haven't even started yet. Like bringing these people on. I've talked to a couple of hip hop dudes and they all just DM me yesterday. They're like, yo, what's going on with Sabah? Why are they meeting with Gary? Did you listen to my music? Let's get out of here.
