## Transcript
Hey everybody, it's Gary Vaynerchuk. So everybody who listens to the podcast, I've been wanting to do this concept for a long time. I did a version of it not too long ago, a couple episodes of the brown paper bags where we drink wine, but these three wonderful people are not gonna get sort of free alcohol. Bye. I know, sorry, you're out. You're promising something totally different, right? You're out. But I've always been fascinated by what happens when you bring different people together that are doing interesting things, and just shoot the shit about what's going on in culture in the game. And I think a lot of people are, this group specifically, I think, from what I know about them from afar, have crossovers and see certain things the same way, and then obviously have their unique journeys and points of view. And so I've been wanting to do, there's this thing that I used to do when I was first coming up in the game in Silicon Valley, where I met all the hardcore Facebooks and Twitter founders and Uber founders, and they were called Jam Sessions, where we would get together at these conferences at midnight in a hotel room, and for three, four hours just talk about the game. If we would have one tonight, we would talk about cryptocurrency for sure. We did four years ago, that's why I bought Bitcoin four years ago. So you just get different ideas and thoughts about, we would argue about who's gonna be big, who's not. And so I've been wanting to do this thing called pod sessions, podcast versions of the Jam Sessions, and I'm very excited. I have three phenomenal guests, and probably one of the biggest things that I wanna get out of pod sessions is also an opportunity for me, as my career changes, to use my platform of the attention that I'm amassing to put other people on that also sometimes have bigger audiences than me, different audiences than me, or are emerging and are doing interesting things that have caught my eye normally through some digital connection or the eye of somebody on my team's digital connection. So that's what we're doing. I'm super excited about it. You guys are the three that are helping me pop the cherry of pod sessions. Popping. Popping, you've been here. And so why don't we introduce ourselves? Let's start with the ladies. So we go ahead. Hey, I'm Sweetie. I'm from LA, originally from the Bay Area, and I'm an artist, and recently just released my single Icy Girl Nist one really well. And so what's really fun for me on this is that you literally DM me and you're like, yo, you're always in the room with all these dude rappers. For real. Why don't you bring a girl rapper? I'm like, you're right. I've been trying to tell people like it all happens in the DM. She's just like, yo, fuck you, Gary Vee. Like let's get the ladies in here. I'm like, she's right. Yeah, she's right. And now she's sitting right here. Love it. Let's keep it going. Claudia Oshry, girl with no job. Yes. Husband, I mean not husband, wife of a boy with no job who works for you. Yes. Real name's Claudia Oshry from New York, live in New York, once school in New York, love New York, never want to leave. Everyone keeps telling me I should move to LA, but I would rather die. Are you just really about to fight? No, we have the conversation pizza-lay before we go. I'm with you, by the way. I like can seduce me when I'm there, like on the second day, because the sun is like fuck, right? And the trees. But it's too slow for me. Even when you work starting to get weirdly slow, I might have to move to China. It's just the traffic. So a lot of people listening here between your amazing husband, who I know very well, because he works at Vayner on the influencer world, the girl with no job and the boy with no job. So first of all, which accounts started first? Oh, mine. Yeah. Very important. Everyone should know. Yes, so girl with no job is a monster. Now everybody does know. So girl with no job is a monster Instagram account. We'll get into the origins of that, but going well, you're super happy all going good. Oh, very pleased. Good. And you love New York. And I love New York. Yeah, Cypher Sounds, I also love New York. I don't want to leave. DJ, comedian, and everything in between. And I don't have as many followers as girl with no job that I just noticed. Most humans don't. Nobody just shrunk my ego just so dearly when I followed her. I'm gonna get there. Yeah, I get it. You gotta achieve to something, right? Gotta have a more start. All right, let's go back around and create the two minute origin story. Like tell me about your early days, what got you going, how you became an artist. I played your single on repeat all the way down on my winter vacation. For real. And so, I especially like when any time people are talking about pasta and seafood dishes, I get excited. Okay, favorite. That was my favorite. If I was back to the old days that I used to listen to music with a tape and rewound, I would just keep getting rewind there. It's a lot easier now to just slide the finger back. So born and raised in LA? No, born and raised in the Bay Area. Got it. Yeah, so what took me to LA is, so I was writing since I was like 14 years old. Writing. Writing, like that. So I've been wanting to do this. However, I didn't have the resources. I didn't have the plan. So I went to college. San Diego, but I was like, okay, this is a B market city. I need to go to a market. Big shout out to San Diego. That's a B market is, I think that's a compliment. I think San Diego, I think San Diego's a C market. Keep going. Okay, well, when I was talking to people in the industry, they were like, you need to go to LA. Of course. So I wanted to go to the best college, applied to USC, got in, graduated. Still didn't have the resources. So I was like, you know what? I'm gonna do car wraps. That's what I was known for. And I was like, someone's gonna see these car wraps. Was doing it, couple of them went viral. Ended up meeting my manager. And ever since then we've been rocking, he was like, you need to record. And how long ago was that? About nine months ago. Yeah, so for all of you not in the know, car wraps is like a genre that's super interesting. Like it just makes so much sense. Now that we have cameras and the ability to record anywhere. Like I actually think my vlog is a car wrap. Like the amount of content daily V is that's at the back of my car is the majority because we're so busy. Like I've loved following that whole scene. And there's been multiple people that have popped off from car wrapping. Did you see somebody popping and decide I'll do that too? Or was it just kind of? No, so I had recorded a couple in my car. And I was like, you know, consistency and familiarity is like super important with your viewers and your audience. So I was like, I'm just gonna stay in the car. And are you cozy in that zone? Does it feel like a booth? Yes, my boo. I think so, right? His name is Bruce. You named your car? Bruce. Respect. Yeah. Girl with no job. How the hell did that happen? It happened because you had no job. Well, actually it happened because I had a job. I went to NYU. I was like so bored. Everyone at NYU is very career oriented. By the way, this whole New York narrative, the NYU part made it so much better. Yeah, I love it. But you will never leave, never leave, right? Like literally never. You will die in this city. 100%. Do you even travel outside of it? Well, I was just in Mexico and it was beautiful and everything, but I couldn't wait to get home. I get it. Yeah, it's just, I'm not a big traveler. I don't wonder. So out of 365 days a year, you spent 352 in New York City? 363, honestly. No. You went to Mexico for two days? No, I went to Mexico for four days. But like literally, literally no joke. You're spending three. Like nine-tenths. You're spending 350 days in this city. Yeah. And do you consider Queens and Brooklyn the city? Yeah. Okay. The five boroughs. I don't. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. But you consider all those. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't consider Jersey the city. I mean, that would be wrong. Be careful now, I'm a Jersey boy. No, not to anything good, but that would be wrong. Respect. Respect, I love it. It's a different, that would be correct. That would be correct. It is a borough, but it's very near the city. I'm not saying I spend huge amounts of time there, but I would definitely consider it. Do you secretly hate Queens? Doesn't everyone? So anyway, so what happens? So yeah, I started this blog. I got an internship in fashion PR and this was like pre-Condé Nass getting sued and now having, do you pay your interns there? You should, it's the right thing to do. I don't think people should pay anybody, but that's a whole different story. If you're giving them actual opportunity, I'll explain that later. I know it's an unpopular statement, but Tyler, I'm not paying you anymore. All right, let's do it. So I got this internship, it was six years ago, it was unpaid, it was like ungodly hours, it was just horrible. Everyone was like super bitchy and like mean and skinny and like fashion, you know? Yes. And I was just like, I'm the opposite of that. I'm so cool, everyone loves me. And like it was just, I was being so put down there, you know? Right. So I started this blog called Girl with a Job, it was like on Tumblr, it was like the only way I knew how to make a website back then was on Tumblr. Girl with a job. With a job and I basically, it was more like a diary. I used it as a platform to talk shit about literally every. Tumblr was a beast. Beast. You need to look right up there. That is me investing in Tumblr. Great investment. Huge, I mean like that was like, that Twitter and Tumblr were a year before Facebook. Like that's what put me on. Like Tumblr is forever in my heart. No, if you have Tumblr followers, you got followers everywhere. I agree. They're so loyal. They're so loyal. Like as 18 year olds who knew nothing about computers, like I can make a website without having to like, I don't know, have a host or like things that I know now. It was just great. As young people, like most of you are all young, but like, doesn't it feel weird that there's like 17 and 18 year olds that don't know what Tumblr is? Yeah, it's real. Like the lack of Tumblr's like existence, does that fuck with you? Well, no. Okay. Are you excited about Vine too? Yes. Me too. Okay, keep going. Very excited. So I started this blog, it was really like a diary. Absolutely nobody read it, even like Ben, like no one read it. You were dating Ben at the time. No, actually we weren't dating yet. So I forgive him for not reading it. Right, so what the fuck are you mad at, Ben? I'm just a kid living his life. No, it's just like an analogy for like people because to me we're not reading it. I get it. And I eventually got fired because I was terrible. They hated me, I hated them. And I was like so nervous that someone was gonna find my blog. So I got fired, I changed it for accuracy purposes to girl with no job, took to Instagram a long time ago where like the only person maybe, I was a freshman in college. So like five or six years ago. The only person I knew on Instagram was like Perez Hilton. Like he was like the first person I knew. That's an old human there. Yeah, Perez in peace. Oh, he's alive. No, I mean his breath. Here's the good news, Perez can flip it up. This is what's great about the recall. It's all about executing properly. If you look at who's winning, like it's really funny to look at Will Smith's doing. Will Smith is about to take over because he's logging. He got tired of not being as relevant anymore. Make it 25 million, 30 million a film is exciting. But like once you've got money, you want relevance again. And you know what it takes? Humility, that's why he's a beast. He's humble enough to do it. I think Perez, I'm making a prediction. It was put in ethos. Vine too is gonna be the platform that Perez rises like a fucking phoenix. I really hope not. I've had enough. Respect. Like since high school I'm done. Well of course, cause you read his blog every day. Every day in high school. He dominated 2009 to 2020. He dominated and how you can have such success and just like end up where you are is just like something. Where is he? Well, he just released a video on YouTube saying that he was an addict and he didn't say to what. Really? He said not to drugs or alcohol but he just has an addictive personality and I was just waiting for him to say what he's addicted to and he didn't say. If he gets a face tattoo, I'm gonna lose my shit. All right, let's keep it going. Yeah, got fired, girl with no job, built a brand on social. Really the point of getting on social was like to drive traffic to this website that I had. Understood. Whereas I kind of just fell into like entertainment culture on social and never even really picked back up with the blog. I just fell into like a building. What was your first pop off moment? Like when did like what happened? What did you post? I posted a, it was like a picture. It was a Snapchat actually of a girl. Like, you know, girls put their thighs like up on the beach and like they look like hot dogs. Yes. Hot dogs. Yeah, and so it was like actual, like what you think you see and then it was actually a girl's fingers like pretending to be her thighs and it was not a beach. It was like her computer and she was at work, you know? Like Instagramverse reality. Yes, and that just went. Yeah. And away you went. Yes, away I went. I got like 6,000 followers in one day. And were you, did you know Ben at this point? Yes, I did now. Dating. Dating. And did you text him and be like, what the fuck? Yeah, no, we were dying. We were just like on my phone scrolling and like refreshing. And what was he doing with his life at this point? This is just me pride. We were still in college, right? Ben? I think I was working. Okay, I don't remember. You're a senior. All right, that's too much of you, Ben. Next. So tell us your story, my man. All right, from the Bronx originally moved to Long Island in high school. That's where I learned how to speak white. And then. How quickly did you pick it up? Very quickly. Very quickly. It's easy to pick up. Well, here's what white people love. This is today. The wire. Yes. The air horn. Yep. And white people love the R. Kelly ignition remix. Okay. I love that song. I know. I love that song. I know, but I do a white wedding. That is the most accurate thing. That song, I once played on repeat. The entire drive from Wine Library, the liquor store to Atlantic City and back. Do you love that song? Yeah, I like it. You like it. It's a universal song. It's universal. No, but I'm saying the hood, it's okay. It's a good R. Kelly song. No, it's well respected in the white community. Love it. What's the hood's favorite R. Kelly song? Oh, there's too many. Give me one. I'm putting you on the spot. There's one called Real Talk. Everybody loves Real Talk. You know Real Talk? Of course. R. Kelly? Of course. Everybody doesn't know that. Why? You must have grown up around white people. Yeah, I went to Mount Ida College, 97% black. Yeah, Real Talk is like a deep, deep cut. No hook. That the Annie yells out, Melvin, pull up the car. All right. So yeah, so I learned to DJ. I learned to DJ. Did you get good at tennis? No, no, no, no. You never went, you never went deep. Not that way. You didn't go deep long on it. No sport. I don't do any sports. Got it. Period? None. You're not athletic. You now hate me. No, I don't. Do you like sports? No, I don't like sports. Now I hate you. Keep going. Not being athletic, no problem. Eating sports, probably. My dad died when I was young. And I was talking to this other comedian that whose dad also died when he was young. I think that has a big part of it. Like, you're probably like, follow it up. You know what's funny? My dad worked every minute, influenced nothing of mine, because we were immigrants, I never saw him. It just, we're kids in my neighborhood, we're thrown in our football. Like, there's a million, you could add a cousin that was, you know how it works. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's when music came from him. Yeah, exactly. Of course. So I got into super heavy into music. I started DJing with this guy, DJ Riz. He introduced me to Funkmaster Flex. Of course. I started interning at the radio station in 97. Worked for years. In 1997, huh? 97? Yeah. That was still amazing. Yeah, it's perfect. Yeah, super meta. So years and years and years worked for no money and just kept climbing, climbing, climbing. Eventually got The Morning Show, which lasted seven years. Which is a huge run for you. Yeah, I was at the radio station for 17 years. In between, I'm doing a DJ for Little Kim, A&R at Star Trek, which is Pharrell's label, A&R, that Rockefeller. Like I've done a lot of things in between. It's funny you bring up Little Kim this morning. Literally this morning, I sometimes think about my day when I'm like brushing my teeth, showering, just thinking about it. Like I was like, you know, I was thinking about you. Like talking about like the female rapper thing. And I was like, man, there was a point where I think Foxy Brown was literally my favorite artist in the world. For like that little 48 seconds of that summer when Pock and Biggie were dead. And I was like fucked up and like, fuck it. Foxy's my number one. Sorry. Anyway, just ran. Just ran. When he said Kim, cause that was the battle at the time. Those two was kind of like fun. So nonetheless. So yeah, in between there, I DJ on the Chappelle show. I mean Dave Chappelle. Then I'm funny on the radio. So people start saying, you're funny. You're funny. So I was like, all right, people keep saying funny. Let me try to conquer this comedy world. But on the radio, and I've listened to your stuff through the years, like, was more like of an improv funny. Like you were funny off the hip. Not like I'm gonna do a set. Right. Yeah. But people kept saying, you're like, should I do a set? I just started doing comedy as to make money. Like I'm gonna produce a comedy show. I didn't think I was gonna do comedy. I was just like, people keep thinking I'm funny. Associate my name with funny. Oh, you think I'm funny? I'll show you how funny I am. Give me your money. Yeah. So I did this night called Don't Get Gas. It was one of the hottest comedy nights for like five, six years. And from that, I started like doing stand up. And then at one point I was just like, okay, am I gonna do this for real? And I left the radio station and at, you know, 39, 38, with a pregnant wife, decided to start a whole new career. Good for you, man. And here I am. And how long has that been going on now? I mean, I've been doing stand up, let's say eight years, 10, eight years, but like for real, like where's my bread and butter like four or five years. All right, let's go back around the table. This is a segment that I just made up five seconds ago. What am I obsessed with? Like what is happening right now in culture or end or your life that you were obsessed with, sweetie? I am absolutely obsessed with social media. Like the whole fucking thing. Okay, let's rank them in order of your obsession. Number one, every other app has to die. You can only live there. It is. Instagram. Okay. Okay, I was gonna say, okay. Look, she's hesitant for a second. This is what happens. I love like, I love Instagram, but I'm starting to love Twitter because I'm figuring out what works there. It's all about figuring out what works for different social media. I found this new room. It's like you found the den. You've always been in the kitchen, but you're like, wait, the den's kind of fucking cool. Like what can I do in here? So Twitter is emerging. Twitter, yeah, Twitter is emerging. What else? That's about it. So those two. So you're obsessed with Twitter and Face, excuse me, Instagram and Twitter. Definitely. Okay, good. No job, girl? Yeah, I'm obsessed with everything I could talk about literally anything for, but, till the end of time. But, the number one thing that you were obsessed with right now. Stories and live streaming, like in real time content, you know? Like I use stories more than I actually post on Instagram these days. Just because it feels supernatural for me because I started on Snapchat a while ago. So just like letting people know what I'm up to at all hours of the day. Yes. And then seeing how many people look at it and what's going on. And like obsessing over like the verified accounts that watch my stories. Respect. Verified makes it better. Of course. That blue check is fucking status. Money. The amount of money hooking up and other random shit that has been happening because of that blue check is fucking bat shit crazy. People are starting to abuse it though. Yeah. Like getting themselves verified when I just don't feel like they deserved it. What's 90% shouldn't be verified. What are you feeling absolutely obsessed with? I'm obsessed with all the dope TV shows that are out right now. And I want to make, make, make TV shows. You want to make TV shows? Yeah. So what's your number one dopest, freshest TV show? I mean, I can't break it down. I break it down in categories. No, I'm saying like. I got it. You can, I'll give you the airtime to say every one of them, but then you're going to have to have final fucking four and pick one. Right now, like handmade, handmade tail. Yep. It's sick. You know what I'm saying? But then I also love stand up specials. You know what I'm saying? Like Time Segura. Yep. Netflix is, right? You know what's so funny? It's just pattern recognition. It's exactly what HBO did in its early days. Like comedy is always a pillar. Yeah. Just like sports, just like music, fashion, comedy is such a pillar of our society. And what I love right now about Instagram, and you've got to give a shout out to Vine because comedy absolutely played out there. And definitely obviously now Netflix and podcasts, for that matter. I think for a lot of people, comedy has reemerged as an obvious pillar. Whereas if like, for example, you guys talking in your age group like seven, 10 years ago, like six, seven, five, five, six, seven, eight years ago, it wasn't like comedy was that in our face. No. Like you go back to my space with Dane Cook and the tail end of Adam Sandler CDs and like the jerky boys on, you know, I'm old as shit. So like bring that up. But like there's these moments where, whether it's comedy or sports or music, they pop up in reminding us how important, I think comedy is having a moment. Yeah. Comedy used to be a super slow burn. You had to be on the road for 15 years. Like so traditional. To get recognized, yeah. And now there's so many different ways to see it and so many different ways to do it, is definitely popping off. Do you feel like, do you feel native to doing comedy on Instagram? Does that come natural to you? No. Do you want it to? I love, I struggle with that because I really love live stand up in a club and I feel that's getting overshadowed by people doing it on social media. Do you feel like, do you feel like, so it's funny for me when I hear that, I feel like that everything is tried and true. Like it will, like to me, I think it's addition too. Yes. Like I think we're having way too many conversations of, or instead of and. Right? Yeah, I agree. Like, I think one of my favorite things about young people is that everything's in play now. So I love hip hop. It's crazy to me that there was only one move in hip hop when I grew up in the early to mid 90s, which was if you're not hard, you're out. Right. And now I literally think like, like Lil Yachty would have got his face beat in in four seconds. Like you can't dress like, you can't do that. Now you can do everything. Anything. Anything. And I think as long as you've got skills, which I think is important. All right, fine, good. Girl with no job, what is your ambition going forward? I think you're in a very unique spot from my perspective. You have a lot of leverage because you have a big audience. You are, we've mentioned Tumblr, we've mentioned Snapchat. I think you're, you know, I'm giving you smart cred off your husband being smart. And I'm sure he learned everything from you. So you're clearly smart. So where do you sit on the, hmm, paranoia of, is Instagram gonna be the most important thing for the next 12 months? 24 months, 48 months, 72 months. How else am I spreading this out? What am I doing with this? You know, how are you thinking about this unique moment where 99% of the people listening are trying to get to a place where they could live on the back of these platforms. You are in that, I don't know anything even through Ben, I don't know. But I know what your account is, which means to me that you easily could live your life with that as a media property, but you're also smart enough to know there's a vulnerability and so many people have been burned on being one dimensional, just YouTube, one dimensional, just Twitter, my space we mentioned earlier. Like Tila Tequila should still be relevant if she was able to be relevant in every sea change. People get emotional and say, well, this is the thing. I don't like this new thing, but that new thing's gonna kill you unless you embrace it. Yeah, and I literally wake up every day and I'm afraid of the fact that I don't know what the cool new app is and anytime I meet a 12 year old who knows who I am, I'm like, what do you do on your phone when you're laying in bed? What apps do you like, what don't you like? And for a while, I lived in fear that Instagram was on its way down and that Snapchat was where it was at. So I put so much time and resources into building a successful Snapchat, which now just bit me in the ass because I had a successful Snapchat and nobody cares anymore. So are your numbers showing you that nobody cares anymore? Actually, my numbers are so really strong just from a cultural perspective. I just don't think that people are thinking that Snapchat is cool anymore. And as a user, I'm so loyal to Snapchat. I think it put a face to my brand and my brand wouldn't be the same if it weren't for Snapchat. So anytime I feel like if I see something I wanna capture, my hand literally just goes to Snapchat and that's starting to change because I'm recording more on Instagram stories now that I am on Snapchat because there's a bigger audience. For me, it's like a built-in audience, it already exists. And it's just they're doing such a better job. Like for me, I use it as a broadcasting opportunity. Snapchat does not help creators whatsoever find new audiences. Instagram is like putting my stories on the suggested page, like it's helping me find users who would have no idea who I am. I'm sorry. Who would have no idea who I am. Just for everybody, you know this is a podcast so you didn't see that. She looked at her phone, something clearly was on the phone, either notification or note. And you know, just distracted. I'm not good with that. Yeah, no, so. If I could snap my fingers right now and say with all the leverage you have now, what would be the number one next move that's outside of your norm of being a content creator in? Okay, there's two. It requires S1A and then step two. Because I need to just build out my digital portfolio a little bit more before I wanna move to like traditional media. So I wanna have like a bigger and better YouTube, bigger and better everything. So I'm more well-rounded so that by the time I get to like, where like a dream scenario is like a young edition of The View and where we talk about things that young people care about, not that like, Rosie O'Donnell cares about. I need to have like a full portfolio of where people know me. Do you think Rosie is old? I love Rosie. I think she's so smart. I just, I have, I don't know why The View is always my example for what's wrong in modern media, but like I'm a 23 year old woman and I don't feel like I'm represented by The View. No, that's not for you though. It's not for, but I don't think I'm represented in daytime. What about the real? It's close, it's better. But I don't feel like I'm represented in modern media, especially daytime media, where there are people my age or close to my age talking about things that I give a shit about. The overt respect for linear television in this room is disgusting. Next, sweetie. Like what do we want? Do we, are you in the mindset, that you're just eventually you and the team are gonna put out the song that changes the narrative of your career? Is that where your mind's at? And like, what do you mean by that? Are you in the mindset of like, I gotta keep working on the work, putting out good projects and that inevitably one of those, like to me, it's amazing to me how interesting the music game is to me. Like I struggle with finding a way that people pop outside of either the album or the single song being, it's a very straightforward game, which is that is the moment that changes so many things. It's either that hook, that song, or that cameo or that album. Are you just thinking hardcore, let me be about my craft, let me keep being better at my craft, let me keep putting out great songs and I'll take it from there? I would say that's one of the factors. However, what's constantly on my mind is marketing. Cause that song or that hook or that whatever it is, I need to make sure that I'm always capitalizing on my audiences to wanna show that when I do a release set, it touches a wide range of people so that it can pop off. Because without that, without marketing, like without thinking about that every day, you're missing the opportunity of expanding your audience. And you're at the mercy of other people. Exactly. So if I'm always thinking about widening my range of whoever's viewing my work, that's the number one thing on my brain. Because if you're not doing that, then you might. How much music can we expect from you in the next 12 months, gut feel? You may not have the answer for that, but intuitively, how much music can we expect from you? What do you think? I would say maybe two or three projects. And are projects like six, seven, eight, nine songs or three songs? I would say 10 to 12 songs. Got it. Three projects in the next year. Two to three. Wow. Okay. Nowadays, that's not even a lot. You know what I'm saying? That's a good amount. Back in the day where you put an album out every year and a half, two years, now music is flying out. Well, we have the microwave generation. No, I know, but that's why you also pay some- No, you don't know the fucking friction. You should. I mean, my big thing is, as many songs as you have in you, you need to get out because you're not at the mercy of somebody at the radio station or MTV or to label, this is phenomenal. Throw that shit out. This is the most democratized music has ever been. There's some kid right now listening in Ottawa, Canada, who's gonna put something on SoundCloud that's 40 seconds away from popping. Yeah. I know. When I see girl went viral on my song, someone in Dubai sent me the picture of them on the beach with my song. And I'm just like, what the hell? Once you press that button and the music, you press send, the music goes across the world instantly. Exactly. I remember back in the day, and I don't wanna sound old, but I'm old like you. I used to go to Japan and I'd play a lot of 90s hip hop because they were so far behind. And then as I'm watching the technology grow, they're up on the song that came out today. Yeah, it's crazy. The whole world, music has changed. Everything has changed. Information is moving at a totally different level. But that's why you're saying you're so into marketing because you know the music is only half of the battle. Exactly. So many people put out music. You have to be on top of that other half. We're like back in the day, artists were just artists. They just made, you know, there was some who were more entrepreneurial, but they just made good music. And then they had, hopefully it would go. Now you're still on top of it. No, because audiences and fans aren't interested in the artist who is a typical celebrity. They're interested in the artist who is like your everyday person and who is accessible. Who do you want to most work with? Give me two or three names just for fun. Like work with as business or musically or... Whatever you want. I don't want to say, I don't want to work with Dr. Dre only because I worked. I saw his documentary with Jimmy Iving and their mad scientist. I like Drake. I like what he's done with OVO and his branding. He's constantly marketing. And... Real quick, I apologize. I think what Drake is really smart with and I thought it was, I think one of the best moves of the year was the humility he decided to show in the commercial with his dad. Right? You have to understand, like people, like this is all high school. This will always be high school. Exactly. Like the second you figure out somewhere for most people between sophomore and junior year of high school, where you're like, oh shit, right. If I make fun of myself and I laugh at myself with my friends, they'll stop picking on me. Like understanding the moves. I think Drake's understanding of anthropology and psychology of like, if I put a national commercial for my beverage on where I get clowned and my dad gets the girl, like that is smart. There's not a lot of people who have the humility and the confidence. Especially in hip hop. Correct. Because you were saying like everyone wants to be, especially if they want to be hard. Correct. That's why Drake wins. Because he sure is like that. 100%. And he's hot though. And he helps. Hello. When Drake's with his hardcore beard, do you think he's soup is hot? Or like what Drake is hot? Because I feel like Drake has a hot drink. Drake is the American dream. Like he was on Degrassi. And I was like number one. That's the comedian dream. Okay. There's not a fucking American that knows what Degrassi is. Everyone knows what Degrassi is. Because of him. But no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why do you know what Degrassi is? Everyone watched it. It was like the dark show. Yeah. Where you learned what like bad things were. Yeah. What were you watching it on? Like Nick at night or something? Yeah, literally. All right, keep going. What were you saying? He's the dream. He's American dream. Like he just went from that. Do you know any of the other kids on Degrassi? No. And now Drake is like, Drake. I met some of the other kids. One name wonder. I always remember the girl with the thong. Yeah. Would you know her name? No. My point. What's the big North Star for you in the short term? What's the next thing you'd want to have? So what I did, I kind of left music to start doing this comedy thing. But what I realized and what I discovered is that combining them, I'm creating my own lane. So I combine my hip hop friends and all my history with comedy. So I do an improv show at UCB where I get hip hop artists to come tell real life stories and then me and a bunch of improvisers make up a whole show on the spot. I love that. You know what I'm saying? And then when I do it, Dave Chappelle, I DJ, like when we did Radio City, we did almost a whole month. I DJ, but I'm cracking jokes while I'm DJ. So my job, my goal now, because no one else can DJ and do stand up. If they're out there, I'm gonna slice your neck. You know what I'm saying? But like, no, like, I'm not the greatest comedian. I'm a very good DJ. Combining it, no one's in my lane. I love it. And make my own path. I love it. What can I do for you? Let's go back around the other way. You first. I would say help me get to as many followers as she has, but you already do that because I watch all your videos and learning every day. How'd you come across it? Do you remember? Your stuff? Just on Instagram. Just people posting all your stuff. And what kills me about you, what I love, is when someone catches you in a hallway or after you speak or something and they ask you the question and you give them the straightforward answer and they like blank look. And like, they want like this trick. And you're like, no, get in the trenches and work your ass off. Four years? No, 10 years. You know what I'm saying? And just keep going. And they're like, yeah, but how do you, no, no, no, I answered you already. I really do need a yeah, but T-shirt. Yeah. Because that's usually the answer to almost everything I say, yeah, but. Yeah. And it's like, dude, he told you the answer. Like, I love that straightforwardness. I appreciate it. Girl with no job. What can I do for you? Well, I have, do you know Andy Cohen? Yes, I know Andy Cohen. I would love to also know Andy Cohen. Okay. Just like a personal favor. And I would also just love to- Tyler text Eric Wattenberg. Let's set it up. Yes, copy or drinks. Which would you prefer? Drinks, obviously. I flourish with a drink. What would you order? Oh, it depends where we go. I would want to come off as like a lady, but also like a cool, so probably like a vodka soda. You know? Got it. What do you think Andy would order? Oh, for sure, like an old fashioned or like a whiskey. Oh, he drinks whiskey, yes. And who's Andy's favorite music artist? John Mayer. Very good. Keep going. Now we will actually introduce you. Yes, we need, I would love to sit with you for 30 minutes. And just like discuss the social landscape. Like I'm fairly certain I know what's going on. In the digital space, but maybe I'm wrong. Okay. You want to just triple check. Yeah, like I just want to double check that I'm doing everything right. What about triple check? Just like Ben's gonna be there. All right. Sweetie, what can I help you with? Two things. Go ahead. So I've seen the interview you did with A-Bugging. Yes. And I saw you mention Captain Crunch. Yes. I want to do something with them. You love Captain Crunch? I love Captain Crunch. Every black kid loves Captain Crunch. Oh, I almost killed you. Wait, is this true? Every black girl loves Captain Crunch? Are you black kid? Kid. Everybody loves Captain Crunch, period. Yeah, no, us too. Yeah, I agree. The Long Island whites love Captain Crunch. You know, okay. You understood. Mike Boyd, let's put that on the docket. Yeah, I love to do that. You have a second thing? A second thing. I want to learn how you built your team. I love the interview you did with A-Bugging. I feel like you shed so many gems. And I feel like building the correct team around you is really important. We're like expanding, like just by the azure daggers. So let me, you know, while I'm wrapping up and I apologize, everybody's gonna feel it. That I'm like wrapping up, because I got the entire company in four minutes that I have to address. And so I'm gonna bounce out of here. But this is a good thing to end with because I think everybody listening will get value out of this. So I appreciate the last thing you said. There's several things that matter in building a team. Number one, the biggest mistake people make is they think people work for them instead of them working for that team member. I think the biggest reason I've had success is I genuinely think I work for Tyler and Jake and Tyler and DRock. It's my responsibility as the North Star, the last line of defense to create the framework for them to flourish, not for them to like be at my begging call and I'm the leader. And so it's a really interesting mindset. But I think you start building actual teams when everything that's fucked up is your fault as the A, the number one, and that everything that's working is shared with them. So for everything that's broken with us, I take on with me. It's not Andy or DRock or Tyler's fault. It's my fault. And everything that's working is a lot me. I believe that. But I also think a lot of them picking up on those nuances. That's number one. Number two, all three of you have the following amazing opportunity. I mentioned it early and it's really ironic but the girl in no job story. I believe we're living in an incredible time. I believe that if you're a young, let me use you as the example. If you were a 14 year old, if you're an 18 year old young woman that has enormous aspirations to be in the music business, that interning for you and the team for six months and not getting paid. And I know we talked about it earlier. But if it's for somebody who's got something going on and obviously anybody who's bigger than you and whether that's more albums sold, more songs downloaded, more experience, what have you. But back to the Dubai thing, all three of you have on a terrible day, 100 psychotic fans and not psychotic, weird, bad. I mean all in, fuck with you heavy. They're all about you. Of those 100 people, I'm gonna say it for me too. It's not a big number. I mean people that are like in Portland, Oregon right now that if you DM them and said, I want you to follow me around, they would be in the room right now and photography me and video me and post that in me and make more, they would rip their arm off, get on a plane and fly and be part of your team. The fact that in the same way anybody can pop now, anybody can make music, that you can build a team before you have the finances to afford the team because it's an even trade. It's an even trade. Like, do you know how many- Does the government see it that way though? Does the government see it that way? Well listen, you have to abide by laws and if there's a state law, I would want that but I think there's a minute because it's under the Vayner world. As a human, I don't know and consult your lawyer. But the reality is that here's my thing. The amount of women that aspire to be you right now, like I know a lot of them, right? They would, I don't know what else to tell you. I genuinely believe that Lisa Schwartzman, right? She's totally Jewish, 100%. In Milburn, fucking New Jersey right now will get way more fucking value for working for free for you for six months. Well she's welcome. Then 99.9% of the shit she could be doing. I totally agree and if she wants to email me- That has to play out. Do you have that or say guys, in 1947, going to college wasn't the right thing to do. It was getting a vocational skill. Shit changes. You wanna hear something crazy? Not only do I think in 20 years, the version of you is not gonna pay, I think the person's gonna pay you for the right to even be in your circle. Well she should. I think so. But I'm telling you right now, do you know how many fucking people who want to be exactly what you can teach them are gonna pay $4,000 for some bullshit fucking course? From now or some, like, so, building a team. First, you work for them. Period end of story, from now to the end, till you put that fucking star in Hollywood, on the ground in the cement, you work for them. It's a big mind shift and most people don't get it and that's why most people don't fucking win. Number two, take advantage of the moment. There's a lot of fucking kids trying to build up their comedy. I've built interns who are now stars. Stars. Who came from my camp. I get it. They're out there, they're doing it. That's the other thing. And literally, it's like an Instagram story or Instagram post or a tweet of looking for five hustlers. I don't have much to pay right now but I'll show you the world, I'll show you the insight. It's real. It's very, very, very real. And for everybody listening, some of you don't have the money and you think you can't compensate and you think you're doing the wrong thing. If your intent is right. So the reason I'm never scared of paying minimum wage or having a resident or an intern is I know that I'm always capable of settling the score. If they're so fucking remarkable, if they do so much greater than what they got paid, I can always do something down the line. And if you know you're up to something and you've got something going on, you can always settle the score in the fourth quarter. So if you have the right intent, I'm not trying to steal from them. I'm trying to get my value. Good relationships are when both people get value. The end. All right, one last thing you can leave them with and I gotta go. One last thing for everybody listening. What should they know? What do you want? Do you want to have a father? What do you want? Me personally, I don't know how anyone else did it. I know how I did it. I get in the room, I work for free. I show my value. Then people don't want me to leave. That's always how I do it. Where can people find you? At Cypher Sounds, C-I-P-H-A in the word sounds, please. Oh, on TruTV. I got a new show on TruTV. Yeah, I forgot. I'm sorry. I gotta do with the comedy show on TruTV. I go with No Job, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, all that stuff, Claude with No Job, you know, building my personal brand. Respect. Doing a live show for my podcast, doing a live show at Caroline's. Just look me up, you know? I'm everywhere. Sweetie, S-A-W-E-E-T-I-E, Instagram and Twitter, and you know, Car Raps to doing my first show in Turkey, Insta-Bool next week. So whatever you can do out there, kids, social media, take advantage of it. I love it. Guys, thanks for being on the show. Thank you. I love your podcast. Please leave some social comments for me. Feedback to what you think about the format. I'm excited as fuck as this. I got lucky. All three of them did their thing. This was good. This flowed. We might have to take this on tour. Like Anderson and Andy have their little thing. I know, EC2. I mean, the four of us in Carnegie, like. Oh no, murder. Murder, murder, murder. Murder, see ya.
