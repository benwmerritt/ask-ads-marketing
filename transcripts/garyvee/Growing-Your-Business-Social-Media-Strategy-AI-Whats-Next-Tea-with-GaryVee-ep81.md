Looking to kind of see what I should do next to continue building is brand. You know what my answer is going to be if you're not on all seven platforms I'm upset. There's also going live right? Twitch and Kik, YouTube and Snapchat and TikTok and it's just more. I keep telling people building a brand on social media is like going to the gym. It's fucking more reps. It's like getting better at basketball. It's like getting better at chess. Most people are not disciplined or consistent or tenacious enough to get through the hard days and then they lose momentum. I've been posting consistently for probably the last six years honestly on Lenny's Facebook page which is Lenny the Boston and he was actually the first hotels.com official dog so also known as the Canine Critic and we're kind of in a niche spot where we review pet friendly hotels and I review them from Lenny's perspective. So we've grown it from 60 followers to 114,000 followers which is cool. We're reaching 4.5 million views per month now we're in the content monetization program which is great so Lenny's really helping out the family which is awesome. So Lenny's becoming the breadwinner. Lenny's paying the mortgage. Yeah looking to kind of see what I should do next to continue building his brand. It's doubling down on what you know. It's just more like I keep telling people building a brand on social media is like going to the gym. The answer is more like how do I get. Just came from. Nice work. You know like you know like people it's fucking more reps it's like getting better at basketball it's like getting better at you know chess it's like what people don't understand is that most people are not disciplined or consistent or tenacious enough to get through the hard days and then they lose momentum. Every one of us every one of us watching right now has tried to get better at something right and every one of us has failed. Like literally every fucking person watching has tried and failed at something especially in a world of like health and fitness like so many people failed that and then there's other skills. I think you know the answer if you're not posting on every platform and then there's other thing you could start writing on substack right. Where's the attention. What's the content you need to do there. How do you over index on awareness on the platforms that have the attention. That is the game. There's the seven social networks there's substack. There's the live streaming platforms like Twitch and kick Joe. That's it brother. Yeah more reps more reps like how much content is being put in more platforms more output more different ways written word audio video live recorded doing you doing podcasts with Lenny right. You showing up want to do well by the way then you then you need to go take a shower since you just worked out and sit there for three hours and DM every podcaster that talks about dogs or travel in the world the end. That's what I do. I'm fucking tenacious. Yeah like a turkey or a termite depends on which befriend you like more like you know that's it bro. Got it. Right. I love it. Yes. All right man. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Love you bro. Question from Joe. How do you maintain focus on one project when you're so excited about six others. I tend to squirrel way too much and my attention is divided between several projects and nothing gets done. Discipline. Like I don't know like like you know but also not demonizing yourself. I get pretty creative too. I can deviate myself. I like I like spinning seven plates. I just don't cry when five of them break. If you're going to 80 D it out. You can't beat yourself up for living your true life. So I'm giving the answer but I don't live that answer all the time. Sometimes I don't see things all the way through because I want to fucking spin six other plates. I got that off. I got that feeling off. I scratched that itch. I got that nut off. I did that but I'm OK with five of the plates breaking because I realized that's what I'm doing it for the excitement of the creativity of nine other things. I don't believe that I'm super human and can make seven things work at the same time and I'm 25 years into my career now 30 years into my career now and I have trusted partners my brother AJ you know Brandon Warnacky Eric Wattenberg not to mention all of you on the thing like I have infrastructure around me now which allows me to do more things but I used to have none of that. I didn't have an admin for the first 15 10 years of my career you know not even an admin I had to do my own calendar I had to like so like you just build up but if you're going to jump to a bunch of different things and not be disciplined don't be disappointed something failed because if you're going to need something to succeed you got to put in time and effort nothing on earth has ever happened without time or effort nothing not being a good parent not being good at a sport not creating a company not getting views consistently as a creator or influencer there's not one fucking thing that has ever happened that has been meaningfully successful for a period of time that has happened without consistency and effort and work and do you know Aaron do you want to hear something crazy these motherfuckers don't want that to be the case but there's no fucking ozempic in real life in real life building shit in business in fucking building there's no ozempic sorry there's no fucking ozempic in building a career or a business or something meaningful sorry I'm sorry I get it I wish I could get A's in school I wanted to get A's I didn't want to get F's it's not fun to get grounded every three months it's not fun for grown-ups to shit on you 24 seven from the ages of eight to 18 it wasn't fun for me I wish I could get A's there was a problem I never opened up a book I did no studying

I fucking failed and sucked you saw the report card 243 out of 5th I was 243rd best out of 254 kids in my class earned because I was fucking lazy in that thing because I kind of was smart and realized it meant nothing and that's how real life is you can't just sit there and lay in bed and scroll and the money just shows up there's no get rich quick scheme you motherfuckers there's no secret it's

understand what I'm saying like I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure let's stop right there all right it sounds like passion and what you think you can make money in are two different things okay got it got it I'm talking about Robert the dude not the guy who's trying to figure out where he can make his money talk to me about you like at night on the weekend storing holidays like what do you want to do do you want to drink beer do you want to watch nascar do you want to fucking surf do you fucking want to play video like you as a human what fucking do you get excited about because you know I'll give you like v friends what I'm doing right now with v friends is me living my biggest truth I love collectibles and like flipping stuff and like building universe and creativity and like like I'm living it I love marketing I learned when I was building my daddy's store that it wasn't the liquor selling that I liked it was figuring out ways to get people to buy it so then I did VaynerMedia got it like I need to know what what is fun for you it is fun for me to come up with ideas for business and slogans and strategies but if I had if I knew that guard if landscaping was where all the money was in the world and I was like oh I'm gonna do landscaping I wouldn't like it because I don't fucking like mowing lawns and by the way a lot of my fucking buddies do right they live for fucking Saturday they're like Gary you fucking see my grass I'm like I don't give a fuck about your grass they're like but my shit's so green look at my neighbor it's like brown and they can't wait to fucking pop a fucking Budweiser and drink the fuck out of it and put on some fucking ear pods and listen to Bonfuckin Jovey and Bruce Springsteen and fucking mow that lawn like nobody's fucking there I buddies literally I mean this I grew up in these kids I talked to them that are literally can't wait for fucking this Saturday to fucking drink four and a half Bud lights while listening to rascal threats while they mow the fuck out of their lawn and I'm telling you right now if you told me that's what I had to do for life I would take a knife and stab it through my throat I got you I got you so I want to know what you give a fuck about so so that's that's the thing bro like what I what I care about is is the profit like I'm always trying to figure out the next way like that is what I enjoy that's what I'm talking about to my friends is trying to figure out what can we do next well let me tell you what you should do next you should download lovable and you should make apps okay that's it I've literally changed your life Robert stay disciplined never waiver if you fuck with me like that give me one year of fucking becoming obsessed with how to use lovable to make apps and put out apps that charge a dollar a month and try to get one to fucking work okay all right all right I'm in there bro I appreciate caring about what's next but once you understand what's bro here's what's next AI blockchain and live live streaming on the internet whether brand building or selling I just gave you the answer of what's next that is the next four years right so now do something within it yeah yeah bro like I it's lovable.dev right right I just want to get oh yeah I want to get a pin for everyone okay so bro I just told you what the fuck is next I appreciate that

it I respect it I respect it and it's been hustle hustle city since then and it's always been like about to make in the dollar and now it's just got I gotta figure out what that passion is I gotta figure out what about what about hobbies real quick just real quick what are your favorite hot well like what do you watch movies sports like what do you listen like help me no like like that that's the crazy thing like that's the thing that's driving me crazy is I don't like my hobby is learning like I love to learn different things like I'm out here on chat gbt trying to figure out like what what's going on man so so why don't why don't why don't you fucking start a twitch channel and talk about fucking your like call it Alabama fucking learnings and just fucking sit there and talk about shit for an hour and share your screen why don't you go live sharing your screen while you're learning like come learn with me that's what I'm thinking about doing one of the things I'm contemplating in 26 is going live in the evenings I told Sid this yesterday I'm going to call it winding down get it winding down little wine you like that I like tea with I want to bookend everybody's day I want to be tea with Gary be in the morning and wine ding down with Gary be at night I'm just gonna fucking and my slogan's gonna be like and you fucking have to figure out the middle that's gonna be me I

tea with Gary be and winding down with Gary be and you gotta figure out the fucking middle I love it bro I'll be your first subscriber I'm in there bro I'm gonna listen to me you've got to do the same thing you've got to learn how to like you got to use chat gpt to learn how to get a proper little it by the way Courtney's putting out content about how to set up your live or a Courtney's fucking out here hustling trying to build her brand on let me teach you beginners how to set up a live stream sitch once you get that right bro your night should be put on some music or not candles whatever the fucking insets whatever the fuck gets you going put on your fucking get your fucking screen live and here's what it's gonna look like you're gonna have six three two and a half viewers at first and you're gonna build Aiden Ross and Kai Sedet had two viewers at first me too that's how it is and you're gonna fucking I'm teaching I'm teaching and people are attracted to people that are like them there's a bunch of country boys they're gonna fuck with you way more than somebody else because you're them and and they're you and they're gonna fucking like hanging with you like when I make my wrestling and sports references root beer garage sales people that are into that stuff are into it people that are a little more quiet more reserved maybe high class life maybe literature they may not connect with me as much the interest don't align but everybody has an audience everybody has an audience question from you mar what would you say to your 33 year old self I'm just curious because my tiktok has gone ridiculously ridiculously viral in the last 48 hours if this was my one shot at opportunity between how I live and how I want to live what would you say jump go all in fear is destroying everybody's soul on this show fear of what though is what the question like like falling on your face is good especially if you're lucky if you're family some people don't have family but if you family on earth like falling your face is good because the booby prize of falling on your face is you go get to hang out with your family now some people hate their appearance so that might not work but sometimes you know friends are sometimes family you know like sometimes you're you know as we always say friends are the family you choose right so there's friends like sleeping on the couch of a loved one or friend I actually genuinely know bullshit believe is a badge of honor if you went and took a risk and failed if you're sleeping on a couch because you fucking want to do coke all night and play video games losing play if you just want to sit around and fucking you know like smoke weed all day and gamble on crypto and that's why you're sleeping on your buddy's couch you're fucking loser but if you went and risked you quit your job you had eight thousand dollars in savings maybe even eight thousand dollars in debt but you had this moment on tiktok when something's happening and you realize had a monetize that's the other part a lot of people can go viral but they don't know how to make money this is why i'm obsessed with this platform i actually think live so mike v can't sell he's not a fucking sales dude but now he's becoming one yeah yeah for sure you didn't you didn't you didn't like obsess your whole life about selling shit it's true i'm not making fun of you i'm saying the truth like i have basically spent i'm 49 years old six i've spent 43 straight years every day thinking about selling something like i don't know what to tell you rips you get over here rips this rips when you were like nine and ten and eleven like you thought about selling shit yes right all right thanks like rips wanted the mic me rips could sell on any platform ebay a card show flea market this platform but mike here not a salesperson but went and did the show and enjoyed it yeah have you sold anything since mike no but new but uh see another another show coming up i gotta go back to lbis where i got all the stuff like it's a small brooklyn apart mike i don't give a fuck i'm gonna go pick trash like when people do this to like what have you been doing for the last two weeks in detail what have you been doing like this started last monday at nine a.m i woke up um it's i want to know what your seven p.m to midnight has looked like for the last two weeks my sw- mmm you know i'd yeah i could promise you what it looks like it means you could have went back to lbi and got more stuff and this is what i mean and like no burn on mike what i'm saying is what i'm saying is like just because you go viral doesn't mean anything like one like there's eight billion people that had a clip get a million views on tiktok that have done nothing with it it's all fucking discipline execution knowing how to monetize are you selling something are you trying to get brand dollars uh mike mike mikey the designer on v friends he's doing his whole thing i'm on a fucking phone call with him three weeks ago as i'm driving to a meeting with kelox the cereal company and i because he emailed me twice to ask for hey i want to like figure out how to get brand deals more brand deals like it's either you're doing it or you're not everybody like enough with the blame like either you're doing it or not so that's what would i say jump go for it but have a plan you know alissa how are you i'm doing well how are you good where you from i'm from virginia beach and i am a 25 year old who's been doing business for years so this part really resonated with me i'm happy what's cooking all right so i write your book i've got my decisive duck squishy and i actually went in got a booth at podcast summit because i've read your kissing booth style at the end of your book yes now i wanted to know if you have any suggestions for of course now i have the vending booth i'll actually be launching um my software called plug machine at the time which is really white label of go high level but um i wanted to know if you had any advice because we did decide to get that based on your book i love it so what are you trying to accomplish there the goal is more of a launch for the program that we're having plug machine because everybody in that community has a podcast will need some type of landing page our full business is funnel building so we're going to have the templates already built out and so they'll be able to buy so the first piece of advice by far is to film the entire execution got it so i see i see the glasses but if you can get someone where where is this event it'll be in atlanta okay great anybody who's watching who's in atlanta what's your instagram curlissa c u r l y s s a um so like your last name but with a c a correct first name with a c all right can somebody put that mods can you hit that it's her first name a little but with a c um that's your instagram c alissa c u r l y oh c u r yes like curl lissa mm-hmm c u r l y s s a beautiful um everybody somebody who's in atlanta who's willing to either if they have a camera or with an iphone just film the entire booth the entire day you're a straight grinder you're a straight fucking grinder you're just excited to fucking go and stand there and film every interaction hit up curlissa or alissa and uh see if you guys can connect that's what i would definitely do that'd be the first thing for sure because you need those clips and because you know you're being filmed when you get the first people coming in and explain it explain it to them but also know to get your entire thesis out because you're going to post those things on linkedin and on youtube shorts um because those are going to be platforms that will lead to opportunity that makes sense the biggest thing when you're in a live event especially a b2b event like you're going to be at the two core things you're trying to accomplish is number one you're trying to film everything so it's a production day for your content every live event whether your b2b or b2c is now a production day for your social media content got it yes number two you're trying to make very deep relationships one-on-one relationships with five ten fifteen people that can change the course of your game because of it you know yes so that's it that's what i would recommend thank you so much you're welcome have the best day okay this question is from jackson in vancouver canada i'm seventeen years old and my dream is to be a screenwriter my question for you is should i pursue a more viable career that would make more money and try to do writing on the side or just go all in on writing go all in on writing seventeen again we talk about this constantly high and this is where the world had it wrong for a long time high risk needs to happen early you know erin you and i both even though i'm a good generation above you but we both grew up when like oh you're 22 now go be a grown-up i really believe in this ai live social shopping social media world the viability of making an income at a level similar to what you would make in a job by living in this digital world and by being in that age group of let's call it seventeen since that's the person asking to 28 29 30 i really believe those are the golden years i really do believe 20 to 30 is the new golden years not just for fun but to actually be practical financially by being high risk and by going after your dream right and like doing that court you played basketball did you ever when you when you realized you weren't going to go to the wmba i don't know if that was like in high school or in college did you contemplate like i should go overseas and play basketball or were you not at that level either i don't know i'm asking i was i was contemplating it but i knew honestly going into college that i didn't even want to go division one because right want it to be a full-time job right so i wanted to adapt here understood where i was going with that with court is i i talked to a lot of former athletes who weren't good enough to get to the nfl or the or the mba or the major league baseball but took professional routes differently they played overseas in greece or turkey or israel they played in the canadian football league or even like a pro league that nobody really watches and it is stunningly obvious to me how many of those people do not regret it whereas so many people i've met regret not chasing their athletic career a little further that's how i feel about entrepreneurship script writing the arts anything that isn't like i am a cog in a machine and i'm good with that with and by the way big shout out and i mean this huge shout out to people who are fortunate and that is the word i'm going to use i want everybody to listen nice and slow because this is where we have confusion huge shout out to people who are genuinely genuinely happy to be a cog in a machine to not have to emotionally worry about the business they work for i have thousands of cogs in the machine in my companies there's a lot of people that really enjoy life with a very simplistic i don't want to stress about my career that way i'm going to work nine to five i'm going to work 40 hours a week i'm going to have time at home i'm going to be able to go to my kid stuff i'm going to enjoy my weekends i can't wait for fourth of july and labor day and memorial day weekend as you guys know i've been off the grid the last couple weeks i'm not fully relaxed every morning i woke up i had to look at my phone to make sure something catastrophic didn't happen like that's just like you don't have a vacation when you own a business and so big shout out to those people obviously those come with limited financial upside compared to an entrepreneur or somebody doing something remarkable in the arts or sports but if those individuals know how to manage their money and live within their means bless you rips like you know i say this all the time bless you rips a lot of people need to live move from san francisco to chattanooga tennessee a lot of people need to move from connecticut to you know new hampshire a lot of people need to move to places especially as we go into this virtual world so anyway long-winded answer 17 to 29 high risk all the way if something's burning in your tummy go all in you could always get a job you'll once you get a job you don't have the hours to be creative like that the thing that everyone's full of shit about erin and i mean really full of shit about is they don't want to sacrifice all the other things while they chase their dream so if this kid's gonna chase his writing dream from 17 to 27 he's going to live very very humbly no Mercedes no trips to the amalfi coast no Prada bags and i think that's great and that's that so anyway and then there's the whole mental part the judgment when you're gonna get a real job your mom and dad your friends your buddy that was a equal to you in high schools now making 100k and has like a little something and all the things that fuck with people mentally anyway that's the answer let's keep it moving oh with the hard hat this made us working bronx and you were fucking working bro can you hear me i can hear you bro okay i'll jump right into it so can you think of a moment in recent history that was really impactful for you that you haven't shared yet on social and put us there in the moment with you that's a really good question brother um i i think it you're catching me at an interesting time i would say i had a lot of time to think the last couple of weeks and i'm really really you know i'm trying to think of something super impactful that i haven't shared yet let me give you something that's current and i'll try to think of something big but let me give you what's on my mind right now what's on my mind right now is starting this fall definitely going into 2026 i've realized i've really missed interacting live like this right this is why i'm doing tea with gary v more this is why i'm gonna start doing irl screaming on twitch and kick like i feel very much that i'm gravitating towards being more creative the comic books that i'm navigating i feel like as i head into my 50th birthday in november bronzen i want to be more creative and more community i want to double down on the two c's and i feel like i'm really contemplating changing a lot of aspects of how i operate i also want to wake up earlier like i've been a very much like a 7 38 o'clock then work out then go in but another thing that's on my mind is getting up at like five or six to give myself some time before today so that's on my mind i was up at five today so that's on my mind a little bit but i haven't had anything like god forbid somebody passed away in a reset by framework or or at a health scare or something major unless something major with health happens nothing else is major to me those are the major moments in life you know what i mean yeah i guess uh i guess really impactful maybe a little bit too big maybe just something that sticks out in your mind where you're like oh that's interesting okay well i'll give you a good one a j called me when i was at the a football game with andy k a couple years ago and he's like bro you've got to see this and it was the first time i saw chat gpt and i was walking out of the stadium it was the rams raiders game i think it was the game that baker mayfield came back and like played well and like it rejuvenated his career and uh i was playing with chat gpt as i was walking out of the stadium in la and it completely changed the course of how i thought about everything right and like we are very deep in ai land right now um same with this platform right here live shopping i i'm excited i mean we're in the era where search is getting destroyed like ai is exploding by the nanosecond and i would say that realizing collectibles on the blockchain nft 2021 ai 2022 or whatever that was 23 i'm for finder member of that was and live shopping last year like these three themes the blockchain ai and live social shopping and very honestly irl overall live streaming these are the themes that have me very like oh fuck i'm paying attention and i'm excited yeah i had a single uh kind of screenings with chat gpt and stuff like that and i've been taking your advice on using it like an hour a day love you for that and uh it's just such a great research partner and creative partner it was like writing stuff like that brainstorming it's huge it's huge the other thing that's sorry it's a superpower i mean look the other thing that's really exciting is it's free we it's yeah it's very low cost and and the other thing that's brewing is people are gonna be building websites and apps in a day or two all of us normies that don't know how to code that's a big deal somebody here watching right now is going to launch an app that's two bucks a month on the app store in a year and it's gonna change their life by just prompt engineering an idea like all of us have ideas right and like but like me included because i don't code you don't wake up with an app idea and think it's gonna happen you think you need a hundred thousand dollars to get a developer and marketing and all this stuff so like lovable is very much on my radar and i'm paying attention to that and so i just think it's an incredible time to be alive i think everyone's obviously like actually that's probably another thing very much on my mind the polarization of like the world right now forget about even the politics the wars all that forget even that the separation of wealth the changing tides i think we have two groups of people this is why i'm so motivated to bring back tea with gary v every day i need everybody here watching to start their day mindset right we are in such an extremely interesting time in history and honestly i genuinely believe this from the bottom of my heart either one decides it's terrible or one decides it's remarkable and both can be true but you were fundamentally in charge not elon not donald trump not flatter me putin not fucking sam altman like you and the way you've decided to look at the opportunity in front of you is like a hundred percent real like there's ways right now to like get golden visas in portugal and dubai that are pretty darn easy in the scheme of things and so if you're upset with canada or the uk or the us you could stop being a cry fucking baby and just fucking move to portugal you could now someone's going to be like no no no but like you could hate your job and you could learn how to use ai and live streaming and the blockchain like like it's just fucking binary you could be a fucking cry baby or you could be an action oriented accountable fucking awesome ninja so you could be a fucking cry baby or you could be accountable and action oriented and nobody stops and it's never been easier and it's but brother that's why i'm saying it's never been easier when people like oh it used to be so awesome in the 90s mother fucker they didn't have anything like it wasn't more awesome in the 90s there was no tiktok there was no Shopify there was no google there was no chat like we didn't have shit like i was a fucking hustler making like and i was working my dick off and i was making like 83 dollars a weekend because i had to go to a flea market and then wait for another show to happen two weeks later there was no fucking internet let alone ai you have one what's what's happening actually is technology in this moment is exposing people it's creating the extreme haves and extreme have nots either you're let either this weekend you laid in your bed and you were in your feed and you were upset or you weren't like that's it i'm not a great reader either so i can't read for shit library and i said ronston i can't read for shit either yeah chat tpt is such a big help with like learning anything i want to learn 100% bro and gemini and stuff like that gemini pucks all of it fucking man all of it all right love you guys see ya bronson all right all right thank you
