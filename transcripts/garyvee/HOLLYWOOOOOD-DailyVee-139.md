I bite my nails like a ninja. What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? Same page here. Okay. The kids around the corner, once they're set and ready to go, we're just going to pick up with you in your office again. And we'll walk over. Having a job. This video guys made for me, which is really good. Yeah. You know, one of the biggest business debates, one of the biggest debates in business answered in 90 seconds. But Instagram videos are only 60 seconds. Cool. I posted it anyway. I wanted to see what people were going to say. We're just talking about translations in China. Well then we could just go with a pure content strategy, which is like post the shit. I do think it's worth the upside. 100%. So I'm just going to get rolling with them. Okay. Should I take Mandarin night classes? I have so much time. How's the episode going to be from yesterday? Some good stuff? You got stuff? So, as planned, Clark's at the desk over here. Okay. You're going to pop over and do as much as we can with him there. They do want to share with you the deck itself. Good. Let's do that. Which we can then do that in here. Okay. It's super simple. Walk in. We're like, we're the three fuckers that are going to get it to a. And like, why don't we make America like give a fuck about getting it to a precious? Why don't we like, so one of the things that I think has always worked for me is like maybe because TV is doing it right now. I love breaking the third wall. Like that's when it gets real. Honestly, I've got another idea. Idea number two. And this is fucking big. I'm telling you big least. Guys, honestly, it's really big though. I, yeah, you know this. Honestly, this is the one I want to do. Oh fuck. I'm so into this. You ready? I think you should come out a campaign that says fuck. We're now straight up. That's the campaign. You see by the way there's an email in your box. Give me the office to see ya. It's an interesting time. We need to be conscious. I'm here for you guys on this. One thing that we that historically we did not do that I'm fully on board with is I want to fight. Let them say now. Let them let them change their mind. I want to make these calls of like I really want to be involved in this year. I want to get my hand. This is my dirt year. Like I want to be involved real quick. I'm very comfortable with you guys discussing this whoever wants to take it. I think I want to play the John Madden role. I want to do color commentary. I think it's important for somebody that's so bought into me to realize how special this organization is above and beyond me. Here's my punchline. If we believe in something enough, we'll build the internal capability. Yep. Yep. Cool. I was in a meeting with the team getting prepared for this opportunity and Eric was updating me on the conversation he had with you. And I just wanted clarity for myself and for you so that we can get to the best place. When we're talking about breakthrough work and things of that nature, obviously I communicated this when we were together. But I wanted to make just hear it from you on this one. Obviously my full belief is that the breakthrough work comes from the cadence and the strategy of Facebook video against those segmentations. More so than the creative. Of course the creative is the variable. But I want to walk in there with five to six different videos per market. So the net cost of one video for Europe, UK, Germany, things of that nature. It's my belief and the way to actually change your business from a negative slide, I believe is to take the money that is normally allocated to a TVC and to do that in a Facebook video environment and then having contextual creative per those markets. You are 100% right and even worse. I always believe that what I didn't know until maybe three years ago was oh shit. The agency partners aren't incentivized in figuring these problems out. They're just trying to maximize profit. That's to me. I think every company should not have agencies and do marketing internally so that interests are aligned because I genuinely agree with what you just said. It's down to the people. And if the people that are sitting on the other side of you are also publicly held companies and aren't incentivized in putting in the hours or the work to gas, to spec, to innovate, but they just want to keep selling you the model that makes their margin, you're never going to get to the work. Can I pee? You can pee. The camera's already. This is what my life has come to. I have to ask Tyler if I'm allowed to fucking pee. Time to edit. Daily Vee. Do you watch films? Tyler edits. I'm a star. So this is one of my least favorite things to do in my life right now which is review Daily Vee. I never historically over the last decade watched any of my own content but there's so much. I already had to edit two or three things out that would have been out of context that could have exposed the client issue. I hate this. But I love it because I see other Tyler. So you know what, I think we should cut that. Really? Yeah, I do. 100% of my day is based on romance. Ends with Ryan right here. Ends at 1825, okay? Guys, I'm a master at Premiere Pro. Um, title? What do I say with dunk? What's the funny thing I do with dunk? Quick reactions? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, quick. Oh and then you say like I'm the strongest ever or something like that. I like the quick reactions or something like that. These are pretty good. See, they care about shit like the chair. We're like divulging secrets. These guys are like, look, the chair, that one hair on your forehead. Listen, you guys are coming for the right place. Of course you can. You know, like 100th of a fucking inch, right? There we go. Magic. That's how we do it. Hollywood.
