## Transcript
So this is the beginnings of the business offices. We'll come back and tour this. This got redone a couple years ago. Yeah, it looks nice. I'm about June 11th. I'll be 20 years in this piece. That's amazing. So I really know Fulcflex is digital as well as producer's radio show. I love it. We're doing some really good things in this space. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. So man, see you. Greetings, Textures. Welcome to Hot and Tech, the number one tech show and hip hop brought to you by the birthplace of hip hop, Hot 97. Facts. I'm Jesse Kay. This is my co-host, Tat Wizzah, aka the hip hop tech wizard. What's good, B? Today we've got the ultimate hustler in digital, period. He's got his hands in everything behind the scenes, but is quickly becoming the face of business tech. Mr. Gary Vaynerchuk. Gary, that's good, my dude. I'm good, guys. Thank you so much for having me. No, thank you for coming. What a year, 2016. The best. Gary, you first. I love how everybody's like, this is the worst year. I can't wait for this year to be over. I love this year. Yeah, it's been a great year for you. I'm talking about, it's always a great year. If you're alive, it's a great year. You could decide it's a bad year, but as a matter of fact, this is not the best business year I've ever had, but it's the best year because what's the alternative? Facts. I love your energy. I appreciate it. I love it. So many times I'm out here telling people like, yo, get up, pull your bootstraps, get up here, get out and do something with yourself because there's no limit. It's you that's stopping yourself and I see that in your messages all the time. To me, I always get an extra bolt when I'm around hip hop and urban demo because they understand it better. Like, it's unbelievable how much I in my brain, and there's a forewarning, all of you are about to say, pfft. You know, it's unbelievable how much in my brain I think that my son, white kid, Upper East Side Rich, is at disadvantage over minority from Harlem. If that kid, if she or he understood what eating dirt, how much of an advantage that actually is, I lived it. I came from nothing. So, yeah, I wish they knew. And so every time I'm in a setting like this versus a, you know, I'm in a suit, which is, as you guys know, everybody's making jokes today, twice a year, funeral, and I had to be at the New York Stock Exchange today. Like, it's unbelievable to me how much people don't get it and realize how much opportunity there is. And when you come from zero, you have an advantage in 2017, not a disadvantage. And I'm trying to get people through sheer will and putting out content to understand that. You first got on my radar when you were one of your company's Wine Library TV was popping on YouTube. And you came out with this rant talking about the entrepreneurial spirit of tech being very like the early days in hip hop. And I remember that this guy is one of us. He's, you know, he's, he's talking hip hop and tech at the same time. But that was like eight years ago. 2008, I made a video, 2009, I made a video that said tech is about to be what hip hop 85 was. You know, I grew up in Jersey and Edison. So, you know, I'm cliche white kid that was affected by yo MTV raps part of that first generation, Adidas, no, you know, time, you know, that's what I grew up in a lot of diversity back then. And so, you know, I remember when I thought the fat boys or beastie boys or Keras one were famous, but I knew that the world did it. And now the biggest rappers in the world are the most famous, right? And so that's what I saw in tech when Kevin Rose and Zucks and and Saka and Eve Williams are like, OK, I know they're going to be big and they're cool, but the world doesn't yet. I remember telling Kevin Rose, who was the founder of dig.com, which was the big site back in the day, I said, you need to understand that we're going to be like the base group. We're going to be like the baseball players from the 50s and 60s where they made less money in their whole. Willie Mays made less money in his whole career than an average baseball player makes in a year now. But one of the legends in the game. And so I said to Kevin, I said, you're going to be a legend in the game because he was a Web 2.0 legend. I said, but you need to understand one thing. The next you in seven years is going to be dating supermodels. And we were making that joke and sure enough, you know, Evan Spiegel marrying a supermodel. So I think it's you're right. That was the video where I first kind of like put that out there. And I'm impressed that you sniffed out the what I was up to. That's how you got on my radar. You've been steady grinding ever since now and prior. It feels like this year, though, with maybe the rise of Snapchat and maybe your content engine heating up that you've really kind of become a household name in this space. Yeah, this was the very big year for me. Like if you look even at basic vanity numbers of growth of like my social numbers between DRock and I getting serious, you know, yesterday or the day before was the one year anniversary of DailyVee, the documented thing that I do. You know, we got we got serious. I got to a place where VaynerMedia for a lot of you that don't know, I have a company that does social media advertising and digital advertising for the biggest brands in the world. It got big enough where I could afford me being the face of it to put some dollars into people against my brand. And yeah, this year, everything changed in a pretty significant way. So I first saw you and forgive me for just catching up. But back to this point, most people are just catching up a little less than a year ago. Right after CES, my first episode DailyVee 003, a friend of mine from Silicon Valley said, Hey, you remind me of somebody. I want you to check out Gary Vee. So I watched this episode while driving in my car and you said something that just took me out. I was like, this is the guy. It's about to get crazy. Honestly, in a different way, DJ Khaled is the Ashton Quickshare moment for Twitter. You said DJ Khaled was the Ashton Kushner for Snapchat. Meaning what Ashton Kushner was to Twitter. Yes. Introducing it to people and getting it out there. Khaled was to Snapchat. Khaled was to Snapchat. And I knew like Khaled is a really good friend of mine. I'll even say, and I'll put this out there, right before Khaled exploded on Snapchat. He was in New York and we were Snapchatting in the studio. He was here. He had just popped the term major key with Flex on Hot 97. And we were using Snapchat and he went back and figured out how to use Snapchat for him and became the king. 100%. So when I saw you say that, I was like, this guy, man. You knew that I knew, right? Because it was still early. That was January 5th. Yes. Khaled really popped. I mean, I'm really in my shit. Can I curse on this? Of course. Okay, good. November 13, 16. That's when his stuff really started getting going. So he was six weeks in, but because I was there with Ashton and I was there. I was like, okay, this is the guy and this is the platform. And by the way, I've been pressuring back to music, back to all your homies. Somebody's going to be there for musically. There still isn't a mainstream celebrity that just decided to own. And it's so crazy, musically such a thing to win for a musician because you could win the entire 11 to 16 year old girl ecosystem. And I'm just like yelling at some of my famous music friends like, do this, do this. So Khaled was the guy that figured out how to story tell on a platform that was about to become mainstream. Ashton did that on Twitter and somebody's going to do that musically and then House Party or something else or something that's going to be invented next year. There's always going to be a Christopher Columbus. And I know you're tight with him. The economics are crazy. The amount of money Khaled's making, knowing how hard he's worked. I'm also, I pay attention of the grind, the spinning night after night, the grind and he doesn't fly the grind, the grind to think about the endorsement deals and the biz dev deals and the money that's being pumped into his world. It's a lesson for everybody listening. And this isn't just for people that have Khaled's fame, all the aspiring hip hop artists like pop where everybody actually is and then you got a shot. So we're going to talk about 2017. This episode is going to be futurist. It's going to talk what's coming next. Starting with CES where Tat just first learned about you last year. What do you see for 2017 CES? How does that set the table? You know what's funny, especially because I know a lot of people would just be learning about me right now. I'm not Nostradamus. I love people that think I am, but I'm not. And so the answer is I'm not sure. I'll tell you what I'm paying attention to right now. After school, you know, for high school kids, house party, I already mentioned it, Marco Polo. There's things that are popping but anchor and peach and yick-yack. There's always been these things. There's nothing yet that is like 100%. I mean, I was paying attention to and talking about Snapchat for two and a half years before I got loud. You saw the fat me in 2012 talking about the video. So there's nothing at least right this second that I would put my name on saying 2017 is the year of. I didn't know that Instagram was going to follow and copy features from Snapchat. You never know. What I think I'm good at and what you've probably seen the last decade is when I taste it, I'm like a shark with blood. You know, sharks are crazy. Like a little, like a... A mile out. Like a little speck of blood and they're like, that's what I'm good at. When I feel that, when I taste that blood in the water, I'm so fucking on it. It's 24. I shut down in December on my family vacation and spent every minute dissecting Snapchat because I knew Khaled had popped and I'm like, wait a minute, Khaled's popping. This is really double good for me because the way he rolls, that's kind of similar to like the way we got our differences. But like the thing that the kids are attaching to that motivation, like I'm like, I'm living that. Like for real. I only do that. I don't end DJ. That is me. That is what I do. And so I think that that's what I'm paying attention to. I don't know what's next, but I'm always circling those waters and don't let somebody drop a little ounce of blood because I'm going 24 seven at it once I taste it. So that was leading into the next question, right? I was going to ask you Snapchat and Instagram. What do you do? Both. And we kind of figured you'd say that. So what do you do first? Both. At the same time, you're not going Snapchat then taking that video and putting it on Instagram. Honestly, that's just a cadence. That's a moment in time. Like that's a however you feel like which one you like. But anybody who's listening right now that wants to make something happen, you're going to build the next biggest clothing line. Both. Right. You want to get some new customers for your bakery shop. Both. You want to get a job interview at a social media shop. Both. Like if you have ambition, your actions have to match that. And too many people are just like not putting in the work. Their mouth is way ahead of their fucking, you know, actions. Like really? You're going to be the greatest NBA player of all time? Why? Because you think you got a little handle on the weekends? You need to shoot 15,000 free throws before school every day. Oh, the facts. And so, you know, to me, to me, the answer is both. And it's not even a fun, like when people in business, like if you're a normal person, if my brother-in-law, Alex Klein is like, what should I do for my life? I don't care one or the other. But if you're a business person or you have ambitions or you want to run for office or whatever you want to do, both always end. Use every avenue. And Twitter. And Facebook. Use every avenue. And YouTube. And SoundCloud. And, and, and, and. Do you think the spectacles will help Snapchat? I do. I think here's my big macro POV on this. Snapchat is the first social network that has a chance to be a brand. People think about Snapchat the way they think about Yeezys, the way they think about SoulCycle, the way they think about Starbucks. It's a brand. And that's what these glasses, these spectacles have a chance of doing. If they pop and they hold. Wall Street, business people, the people that roll with me are not just going to think and compare it to Instagram and Facebook. They're going to compare it to Instagram and Facebook and Under Armour. And that's a place where they want to be because then all of a sudden money goes up. Then all of a sudden the company's worth more money. And so to me as a company that has IPO ambitions and wants to be on the stock market next year, that's a big deal. So, saw that with the lines. They were crazy for the spectacles. And they work really well. We love them. I'm super big into consumer gadgetry. So I think that they are what Google Glass should have been to consumers. But the reason they were is Google, and this is for everybody who's listening. This is a great segue and I'll take it to a macro level. This is about knowing your DNA. This is where you have to know yourself. Let me explain. Google was started by two nerds. So when they made a consumer product, it was nerdy. You ever see the picture? Like if you're listening right now, Google, Google Glass. Like you don't want to hang with that kid. SnapChat, Snap, made spec. That's made by Evan Spiegel. He's dating a supermodel. He was a cool LA kid. He went, you know, like he's 25. Like the way they rolled it out, the vending machines. Like it was a PR play. It was like marketing. It's branding. It had a hell of a lot more Nike in it than it had Apple, right? And even Apple's crossed over and has that. But like SnapChat's on a whole different level. And so, I mean, straight up, if SnapChat is successful with this at scale, and every 16 to 26 year old is wearing them and is into them. And the real play is definitely going to be Summer Jam and Coachella. And like when the summer comes around, if East Coast kids are wearing those glasses to their vacation, then they've got it. And now all of a sudden you've got to debate are in the same way that nobody thought that Nike would get knocked off by Yeezys, like our Snap sneakers, the hottest thing in 24 months. That's why this matters so much. Because they're going into brand, not just tech platform. And especially in the context of the people that would listen to something like this, people that listen to something like this, they understand flavor. They understand swag. And that's not just about how good a product is. And that matters. Can we talk a little about Amazon and the Amazon ecosystem? We can talk about anything you want, my man. The Echo has been huge for the holidays. I love it. It's selling everywhere. How does it end the drone culture that Amazon's building? Amazon's a beast. Changing things. Do you think that the Echo changes the game into content? Yep. Easy. When you're brushing your teeth and you're down to the last piece of your toothpaste and you say, Alexa, reorder my toothpaste. Whoever Amazon made the deal with on the other side is going to sell you that toothpaste. And that is worth good trillions. That's more than billions. That's more than trillions. That's good trillions. And so for me, it's huge AI voice activation. Like here's the thing that a lot of youngsters, if you're listening to your under 25, that you can't know because this has always been your life, but old cats like me, 40, need to understand. Right? We just started. Like, does everybody understand what's going on here? We've just started. Technology's not going backwards. Like all these parents that don't want their kids on iPads, I want my kid on iPad 24, 7, 365. They learn faster. Not only do they learn faster, what world do you think they're going to live in? Yeah. You're giving them a disadvantage by not teaching them this early. 100. Like what do you think your kids are going to be doing? So I think voice, AI, AR, VR, all that stuff is coming. I don't think it's at scale. I think Alexa is the first consumer product that has scale. So I think a lot, you know, it's fun now. It's fun to walk in and be like, yo, put on that Chance album and they do. That's cool. That's funny. That's like, we haven't had that before, but it's going to get way more serious than that. I'm going to fill up my car with gas. Now, all of a sudden, who's going to invent the Uber for gas where you don't have to go to a station, but gas comes to you. And the reason you did that was because of Alexa. See how I'm thinking? I didn't even think of that. Of course not. That's why I'm the bet. No, I'm just kidding. Honestly, on a very, but this is how my brain thinks. I think two chess moves. Like I know what's in front of us, right? But what's that? I met my wife on JD. In 2003, if you went on internet dating, you were the biggest, weirdest nerd living in your mom's basement. I wasn't scared because I already played the chess games and said, everybody's going to do this. Got it? Yeah. And so that's it. That's what everybody listening has to do. If you want to make money, you pay attention. If you want to be rich, you pay attention to what's going on now. If you want to be wealthy, like all time wealthy, you need to understand what's going to happen next after this. And so we need to understand what happens with these norms. And so I think Alexa is a big deal. I think anybody who's lucky enough to be able to afford that because that's a luxury in their home and uses it, will see how their behavior changes. And then what's going to happen is the same reason my four and a half year old comes to a TV screen and swipes it and is blown away by why it's not doing something. Everybody listening right now in six years is not going to accept things not being voice activated. You're going to text that way. You're going to talk that way. You're going to order. I mean, the headphones, listen, the headphones are out now. Like I don't have them yet. Like they're out and about, right? Like it's going to be voice activated because all we care about is speed. If I could say it faster than I text it, then I'm good. Yeah. Yeah. It's comfortable. By the way, that's why texting exploded. It's faster than talking. Yeah. But if you're just walking or if you're driving and you need to pick up your kid or do the laundry, if you've got your earpieces in and say, you know, Siri, order my laundry or, you know, everybody's going to have basically an assistant at their fingertips. You're never going to forget anything anymore. You're going to get everything done. It's going to be unstoppable. With Google Home coming into this space too, you can even ask questions. Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, these four, five, six, seven biggest tech companies, they're all going to be playing. They're all competing, gets each other. You know, they'll be a Facebook home and a Google home and an Apple home. They're all going to fight for it. Yeah. Google just got into the game with devices and their whole different ecosystem together and I just think it's amazing. It's great. But I've also been preaching caution like, okay, yes, you have to do this, but you have to do it. You have to learn it the best way and how it works for you. So you're not just out here giving away your information or you're just not out here doing it the wrong way and looking like a fool or whatever the case. That's everything, right? I'm glad you're giving that advice. But when people ask me about that stuff, I'm like, well, let's talk about alcohol. Let me give you advice. Don't drink 80 fucking forties, you know, like in one night. You know what I mean? Like everything in moderation. But how long did it take people to learn that though? You know, you had prohibition where everybody's part to, you know, in anywhere. That was religion. But I think you're right. And that's exactly right. But the other thing that you learn is people are good. In the last 15 years, all of us giving away our data, doing all this, there wasn't as much bad. There's no shit that everything's like this is back to the opening line of this interview. Things are good. You want to talk about and mainstream media wants to talk about and people want to talk about the small percentage of bad. I'm thrilled. And by the way, there's plenty of bad. There's always going to be sexism and racism and religion persecution. There's always going to be that. That's how humans roll. Nature. But anybody that wants to level this conversation up with me at a macro level, it's better. Yes. 1945 was not as good as today. Yeah. If you were alive 10 years ago in cognizant, then you know the difference. 100%. Yeah. This is also a great year for the music business. It's please trending up. I love that. It's great to see that vinyl, every aspect of music is growing. A lot of it has to do with streaming wars, Spotify, title, Apple. Apple music. Yep. Which one are you leaning towards? Which one do you got? Music is a place where I don't like to talk a lot about because I think one of the great things that have happened to me in the last four years is I don't talk about shit I don't know. And it's maybe real popular. People pay attention because you know what? I talk. No wasting of time. When I'm talking about, you want to talk about Alexa? You want to talk about Facebook? You want to talk about Instagram? I will bring up, bring anybody here. Put zucks in here. Bring them all. You want to talk about music? There's a lot of people that understand it better than I do. I've always historically stayed away from music because of all the legalities and things of that nature and it made it scary for me. Look, it's tough to bet against Apple because when you have all the money in the world sitting in your bank account, you could buy Spotify and title 44 times over. So that's one thing that I think about to actually give you an answer and not stay away from it. You know what's funny? I never thought music was in trouble. I thought the music business that was built where people that were taking too much of the cut was in trouble and that's good. I like that. I want the artists to have more leverage. Artists have more leverage today than ever because distribution has been commoditized. The game's changed. So you go through a 10, 20 year period where it's scary. People cry. But on the other side of it, it's better. And so, of course music, to me, music is always great. You know why? It's one of the four or five cultural pillars of society. It will always be here. People will always care about music. People always care about sports. People always care about religion. People always care about sex. There are only a couple of things that people always care about. Music's one of them. Music crosses over even all of those boundaries. Some people might not like sports. Some people might not be religion segregated. It's your passion. It's what you're into. It's one of the things that's what he's saying. If you're passionate about music, then you're diving all in. But you may be passionate about sports or religion or whatever the case is. We're passionate about tech. Yeah. And you've always been a music fan, obviously. But I'm a funny fan. I'm not as educated. You know, it's funny to have Boyd here. When Boyd became AJ's friend in college, I was like, okay, cool. Some kid that really knows hip hop and I'll really be on top of it early. I love music for escapism. The reason I like hip hop as a person is far more because I like storytelling. I'll give you a good one. I don't really give a shit about beats all that much. The melodies, the heart. I like the story. Biggie won me because he told a story. I need storytelling. When I listen to Kendrick Lamar, I don't love the music. I don't need to listen to it 50 times. You don't want to know who produced it. You want to know what he's talking about. By the way, I'm very aware of how important and how other people only go with producing and only the music. I need the story. I need the lyrics and the words. What does it mean and where is she or he going? What music does for me is when I go on a flight, like Saba, right? I'm all about Saba right now. I'll listen to the same two Saba from his last thing that he just dropped. I'll listen to the same two songs the whole six hours to LA tomorrow. That's what's going to happen. I know a lot of people listening especially because it's hot. You said love music. All my friends at Mount Ida College who was a real hip hop fan, put me onto Scarface, was super into the Houston scene two to three years before Master P and everybody started learning the South. He would only listen to a song once and then cherish it. He would cherish it for four weeks. I heard first of the month by Bone Thugs and played it 47,000 times in a row. I know that I listen to music in a way that hardcore music people don't respect as much and I know that. I get that and I love that. I watch football. I'll watch football tonight. I just have a Monday night game when we're taping this. I'm going to watch Offensive Lyman's Block technique. I know people don't watch football that way. Music much like the other ones, obviously you, some people go extremely deep and really kind of know it. Even me who's not deep needs it. It's a part of his life and that's what I love about it. We have a guy here named Ibro. Ibro in the morning. He's also on beats one. A really big guy. He recently said something that Snapchat was in trouble. Now I kind of was wondering that as well with Instagram doing what they did and we asked about the spectacles. I do think that is going to bring it back. He said it because his views are down on Snapchat because everybody's views are down. My real question is everybody's really talking about how Twitter's in trouble. Could Twitter become my space? Yes. Ooh, that's scary. For Twitter? Well, it's scary for me too. I've gotten used to getting my news from Twitter. Great. People used to get their news from the radio. Facts. Facts. Right? I was used to getting my music from MTV. So we just got to realign and get our news from Snapchat or Instagram. Yep. Okay. Twitter's in trouble. Shit. I'm even sitting here. As you know, Twitter was the first time I really popped back in the day. I was doing my wine show. I jumped on Twitter. I thought it was going to be big. It was going to be way bigger. And I really popped and transitioned into business content instead of wine content. And so I love Twitter. Twitter's like the first girl I ever hooked up with. You know what I mean? There's always that peace in my soul. And so it's hard for me to say that. By the way, I sit on a lot of Twitter stock. I sold a lot of it, but I still have a lot and I have a lot of economics. What can they do? They got to change. You got to evolve. Hannah did it right. She reinvented herself 14 times. That's why she had a long career. You've got to reinvent yourself. Twitter didn't make product changes for six years in its prime. So let's talk about sports. When you're the best athlete and you're the guy and you're one of the top 15 players, basketball. I'm looking at Dunk, at Dunk on Instagram. I'll give you some love. He's got one of the big basketball accounts. So I'm thinking about that. I think about basketball players. Trey Monk, he's my buddy. Trey Monk really worked on his game every off season. Ricky Rubio, the flashy point guard from Minnesota. If he developed his outside shot, he would have been a much bigger player. He had all the passing skills, the quickness. He's got everything. If instead of going to a visa and a fucking chicks in the off season, he worked on his 18 foot jumper. He'd be in the game. Twitter was banging chicks in the summer. Got it? But just like that analogy. They love it. That's what happened. And guess what? And then you deserve to lose because some other kid isn't. Some other kid is sitting in the rain on July 16th, taking 55,000 shots. And that's what Snapchat and Instagram did. And that's what happened. I'm not going to lie. That's why I respect Mark Zuckerberg so much because he's a gangster. He's the best. You think he's letting something happen. And then even before they make changes, months back, he buys masquerade. The people that made the snapchat filters. And you're like, oh, they got some shit coming. And then they drop all this other stuff. He hasn't even dropped that yet. He's a long term player. He's a beast. He's the you know, it's the same way I thought about Hillary Clinton. Like whenever it's like, oh, I would always say about Hillary Clinton. I was like, yeah, but Hillary will go to Russia, go to a meeting with Putin, slice his throat, walk out. Putin's dead. And Hillary and Hillary's like, I don't know. And I'm like, shit, I want that on my team. And that's how Zucks is. Zucks doesn't look the part like nobody who's listening or watching right now scared of Zucks. Currently here, Jew kid walking in. You will be dead. He will kill you. Yeah. Like when it comes to business, what he does, he will kill you. You. Oh, you copied my shit. And now do something about it. You want to talk about real like you want to convey it into hip hop? He rolled up on you in the street, punked you, took your fucking wallet, looked in your face and said, do something. Yeah, he pulled up. That's what Instagram just did. Now it's Evan's call. Now Evan either doesn't do something. And then that's how it ends. We all know that or he does. We're about to find out. Snapchat before Instagram did this, they answered everything so fast and they haven't answered Instagram yet. So I know they got something. Because it's a three because it's different. Snapchat was innovating. Yeah. Now Instagram copied. Now they have to counter, but they did like the glasses, the real thing. So like it's a real battle. Zucks have, you know, Kevin's sister, you're talking about real winners. This is a real fight. Yeah, this is a real fight. Like, you know, this isn't like, oh, you hear like a rap battle. You're like, this guy versus this guy. You're like, you know, like, no, this is a good one. Yeah. Not everybody's sure what's going to happen. And the truth is both are big enough to win. So that's a whole nother thing. Like everybody loves, you know, when two artists get into a battle, who wins both. Yeah. Unless you get completely punked. Hova dressed us in a song. He tried to kill 50 cent. Yeah. But he was good enough. Like that's what's so great about business. It's so similar to hip hop. If you're good enough, you will stay. Yeah. And if you're not, you won't. Like that's it. So if Meeks good enough, he'll he'll stay. Maybe he didn't respond fast enough. Maybe people that aren't as deep into it as you are think it's still over because that's the real issue with some speed thing. But but I think that's right. And that's and that's how I think about it. And so like when I talked about three, four years ago, liking Bezos and Zucks more than Steve Jobs, people got mad at me because he was such a pedestal. But to me, like they're the next generation of entrepreneurs. And both of them have had monster three, four years. And I don't and that's not going to go away because if you're good, you're good. You touched on something right? A.I.s and a show just finished Westworld. Did you see Westworld? No, but I know everybody's watching, but I don't watch TV. OK, well, Westworld pretty much at the end of the day is about A.I.s becoming self aware and then take over and kill us. Pretty much that's going to happen. So Skynet is real. Yep, we're going to die. Like, don't be scared of the crazy guy in the corner of your street. Be scared of some robot that's going to slice your throat in the middle night that used to pick up your laundry. So do some survival packing now. I mean, it's far away. Yeah. What I don't know is when it flips. But this is just. Yeah, 10 years out. Do you know what virtual reality porn looks like? Let me save you guys time. No dudes leaving the house in 15 years ever again. We will be a world with no dudes. They're all just going to be home. Point up and boing, boing. They already got the 360 channels ready for you. Like it's way beyond that. When you really play it out, when you actually think it's happening. Yeah, it's over. It's over. Yeah. They have the the the Bluetooth accessories to go with it now. So you do it. No, no, that's exactly right. Like it's over. And so like people will be like, that's so weird. That's so bad. True. Go dig up somebody who died in 1854. Show them the way we live our lives. And they would think it's the craziest shit they've ever seen. Yeah. The craziest like I have no like these are people without electric. Like what do you think they think? Like forget about cable TV or Internet. No, no, they didn't have electricity. Like they didn't even know what a phone was. Like they wanted to do something. They like walk 13 miles or like jumped on a fucking horse. Like like, you know, like so, yes, that's what happens. But we need to figure out as businessmen, as entrepreneurs, as human beings, what are we actually going to see? And what aren't we? I do think that happens. What I don't know, because I'm not educated enough is is that 50 years away? Is that 200 years away? Is that but but all the trends point to a very, very, very different world. IBM Watson is smarter than you. Like it's these are real things. Watson just helped write lyrics to a song and it became a pop hit. It's nuts. Of course, because Watson has all the data to know exactly what we actually react to. So here are the last 8000 hot songs and Watson says, got it, got it, got it. OK, here's a song. Yeah. A.J. the WizKid or something like that. There was something that somebody I always talk about, EQ, like my big advantage is emotional intelligence, this and the other thing. And somebody sent me a tweet or DM somewhere that showed that computers now have more EQ than than humans. And I'm like, crap, there goes my advantage. Like technology is going to keep taking people's advantages away. And so we need to understand that. Yeah, it's fun when you're benefiting. It's fun when you use the Internet to build the biggest wine store. But then when wine grapes are being like turned into molecules and people just like a stamp and it's like drinking wine, then I'm like, you know, like it's always fun when you're on the right side of this. It's not fun when you're on the other side. My big point of view to everybody who's listening and watching is figure out how to be on the right side of it. Stay woke. That's such how we say it. Stay woke. That's it. So 2017, what are you focused on? What's Gary Vee personally focused on? We talked a lot about trends listening to people. This is going to air. You're going to tell me and I'm going to watch everybody's reaction. What part did they like? Oh, they thought it was cool. And I said Twitter was fucking chicks in the summer. Good. I mean, use that again. Oh, they thought like, why did I wear a suit that looks shit? Oh, shit, I'll never wear a suit. Like, like I'm a counterpuncher. What am I going to do in 2017? The same thing I did in 2007, 1997 and 1987. I'm going to watch people's reactions. You know why I sold a lot of baseball cards? I see your handsome partner, Ryan, here in the back, right? Because I would go and watch how people reacted to other people's tables. And I would it would take me three hours to set up my baseball card table because I figured out the UI and the UX of my table and what people were selling and buying stuff for. I didn't even open up shop. I walked the floor of the convention for four or five hours and I tasted. Oh, everybody's pumped about the Bo Jackson black and white scorecard. Cool. I'll raise the price. Oh, everybody's selling the McGuire, you know, USA. I'm going to do that. Oh, the 86, 87, FLIR basketball cards keep going up. Let me not sell them this weekend. I react. I always react. And so what I'll do in 2017 is I'll pay attention if Snapchats really in trouble. They're really in trouble if 15 and 19 and 23 year olds get off. They're not really in trouble if the views that you lost were from 45 year olds that were coming on. They need to figure that out. But they're not in trouble. Got it? So what I'm going to do is one of the reasons to your point, just earlier, is that I'm putting out a lot of content. I've even gone daily. He's now daily, right? You know, and that's a reaction. Casey, the best video blogger in the game, good friend of mine. I invested in this company. He stops. I start the next day doing daily because I knew his audience had to find people. I knew a lot of those 15 year old girls weren't going to love me that way because they didn't care about the business. That's fine. But if I took a percentage of that, that was me reacting. I didn't know Casey was going to retire from vlogging this year. So that's a reaction to an opportunity. And that's the way to do it. What you're doing is just staying woke and you're doing your due diligence. I'm woke for the rest of my life, 24 seven, three, sixty five. Facts. That's the truth. That's what you want to talk. Techno terms, you know, there's programs that run in the back of your computer at all times. That's what I do. I'm running in the back of culture, 24 seven. And what's really cool for me is I'll be dangerous enough to come here and make some references that make everybody know that I know what's going on. I could do the same thing in 800 different little subcultures. This one's a little more fun for me because it's true, you know, but that's what I do. That's fire. I love it. I love you for having me. Listen, we're going to bring you back next year around this time. We're going to talk about the same thing. We're going to see what happened and we're going to try to work on my Nostradamus skills to give you something for 2018. Big summer jam. Yeah. We were talking before we started filming this. Let's come up with something. We're going to do something really dope. All right.
