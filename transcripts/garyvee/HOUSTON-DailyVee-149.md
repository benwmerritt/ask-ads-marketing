That's real. That's not real. Yeah, that's real. Yeah. You can't probably be scared. You can't really feel that. It'll take you 16 years to catch up to my age. You got time. I mean, like, I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. And that's the real biggest problem. You're just like, you push your patience on everybody. Because everybody wants something to be done. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. What? Yeah. You can do everything wrong for the next seven years. Everything, start figuring it out at 32, it'll be the youngest spot. Yeah. It's the rest of the big, so I freaking out a little bit. That's something. Yeah.
