Yeah, but I'm not even sure like people like, like I'm not doing this for people that are already in the game. I'm doing this for everybody who hasn't started yet. Got it? Macro. I'm from Mom & Casual. Got it like ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro. Macro. Like a vision boy, I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Garry V. Sob, I've been telling you. Accounts was talking about equity. I'm trippin' like giving a pedigree. That meanin' I'm special, my specialty. I puttin' the work, tellin' I'm dirtin' the earth, I'm movin' furniture to bev it. Better be the main focus. It's me and you. It's do or die. I'll never lie. I'll never lie. It's my profit. I had a drive. And all the time, that ain't dirty. Now I got the way. Put some food on my plane. So I see where we're at this day. You didn't let me get comfortable. We're feelin' like a hunkstable. Got your n*** where I wanted you. Hope you know that I'm comin' for you. Listen to the same exact song for five hours. You know that right there? Real quick, you'll see the image here I just posted in my Instagram story. By the way, if not following my Instagram story, it's a huge mistake. I feel like that's become an incredibly important place. Though I've upped my Snapchat game too. Been upping it. Like, everybody askin' me like Instagram story, Snapchat stories? Both. Both. Like what happens if tomorrow's Snapchat drops? Some sort of feature? It changes everything. I'm basically scrambling back. Stay consistent. Stay consistent as long as something, if something gets big enough, stay consistent until it's dead or explodes. Twitter. Gonna definitely do a retweet club. Gonna come up with something. Join, getting a little momentum, believe it or not, on Twitter. Listening a lot there. Engaging. Comes so natural. Though I'm gettin' more serious about my Instagram comments too. But oh, anyway, that exchanged, you rock. So, I have a photo. That exchange. That's what sparked it. Like people like, it's the way, you know, I said that to you, right? You know, like how to get people started. How does one get started? See? What's she saying? So basically, I'm gonna make a video that's gonna go bonkers, I think, of how to start. How to start. I think it's gonna be predicated on getting people to state their manifesto, whether that's your mission or where you're at right now. Your truth. Manifesto. The kind of the what, right? I frame it up into like the what. The how is, there's only certain few ways to communicate in the world, right? Written word, video or audio. So that's the next thing. So you gotta talk about your truth or your mission. Then you've gotta figure out how you're gonna create that communication. Only three true pillars. That's it. Written word, audio or video. That's it guys. That's how you communicate. And then number three, where the distribution. How you gonna get it out? How to start. Got it? Manifesto or your state of the union. Your truth. Maybe in a little clip for me sitting in the, actually definitely a clip for me sitting in the on the airplane in London where I look like Darth, like a Star Wars character. Same shit I hear from everybody who wins. You know, I think the fear of losing trumps the excitement of victory for so many people. This my last year being broke. It's very good. This my last year being broke. This my last year being broke. This my last year being broke. To put me in a position to be a real partner or player, I'm very empathetic to the real life business you're dealing with. Well, I'm aware. That's why I reached out to you. I didn't know what that was. You know, they emailed us and we pushed a meeting that we were supposed to have because of that and I figured I'd come to you and like really have this combo, you know? I'm telling you right now, you need to take a step back and give a real thought. You don't really know me but I think your intuition on me is right. I think I can be a big plus here instead of a minus. I'm very interested in risk, especially if I believe in somebody. I mean, this is a long game, right? I can lose the entire year and win with you in four years. I'm very open. I on the other hand, I'm sitting with a lot of extra people so I have an asset that I can deploy. So, I don't know what that means but you should definitely keep it in the back of your mind. You know, again, I think we're talking about skill sets and politics so they don't blend all the time. I'm very empathetic but there might be a way, I mean look, there might be a way for the scope to be directly with you, right? Like and small. I just, I think a lot of things are going well in my direction and I could see this really being a huge win for me if I played this right and the downside is, my only downside is that you know that I'm even smarter and better than you think and you feel like I did the right thing. That's not a very big downside. How much do, how much in fee are we getting? Fall in. Right, we can use it. I totally do. Getting started is always the hardest thing. It's just, it's so difficult for so many people crippled. You know, just the starting point seems to be the thing that most people can't figure out and through these different exchanges I'm starting to figure out a cadence here. I haven't made a detailed post kind of a step one, step two, step three. It's really not my style and it's a little bit more from the hip, from the heart but I think I got something. I think I really have this kind of step one, step two, step three. Starts with the manifesto. You have to produce a piece of content and remember this is not for people who've already started. It's for people who are sitting and have not started putting their name or their business into the world. They're crippled by how do I start? How do I get into this social media game? How do I put out my stuff? Very simply, step one, the manifesto. Either why you want to start putting out content or what you're going to start doing or where you going or what are you about. The why or the what. What are you about? Who are you about to become or what you want to happen. For me, legacy of being an entrepreneur or giving advice or you're starting this journey to talk about your barber shop. Many how old is this barber shop now? Four months? Five months. Five months. Manny's first video should have been five months ago like here, we're starting. We want to change the game. This is why we did it. This is why we left our shop. This is what we think we can do. This is the beginning. Either what you're trying to accomplish or why you're trying to do this. Number two is there. Where do you put out the content? There's only really three core ways in the current internet to really communicate to the world. The written word, so you blog, you post on LinkedIn, you guest blog on different sites, you write. By the way, you can even do this on Instagram. You can take a photo and write seven paragraphs. I actually think it's a good strategy. Same with Facebook. Take a stinking photo. Then write 13 sentences, 19 sentences or video. What I'm doing right now. YouTube, Facebook video, Instagram, one minute versions. Video is the other way we communicate. Number three, audio. The boom of podcasts. So many people. Am I talking? It's screwing you up. I love it. Podcast boom, right? All the people that kind of popped, whether Jordan from Artichoke or Pat Flynn or Lewis House, it was audio that became their kind of like save and grace and their platform. So first you got to figure out what or why you want to talk about it. And then number two, you've got to figure out where you're going to deploy your first piece of manifesto content. This rant, this mission statement, this manifesto. And then finally, like where is this stuff going to show up? Distribution. Such a big part of the strategy. Like cool, you figured out what you're going to talk about. I want to save the world from babysitting mistakes. I'm going to be the babysitting expert. Cool. You figured out how to say it. You recorded it into your voice memo on your phone and you just kept going, right? You figured it out. You ended up being good in a radio voice. But now where does it go? So this gets very detailed. Obviously, if it's written word, you look at the mediums, the LinkedIn, the WordPresses, you start a blog, right? Or you do it on your Facebook or you do it on your Instagram. If it's video, you've got YouTube. You've got Facebook. You've got Instagram. You've got all these different platforms. And then if it's audio, you've got SoundCloud and podcasting platform, SketchR, Google Voice, iTunes. You create a podcast. And just Google, how do I set up my podcast? How do I get it to distribute my content? But then you've got to figure out how do people discover it, the where, right? This is where you go into, ironically, we're here again. This is where we showed you how to go into the DM, right? Or you've got to figure out how to use some money and use Facebook ads and target the people that you're trying to reach. Or grinding hustle, just literally emailing 700 to 1500 different blogs or media sites and saying, do you want to distribute my content, right? E-mailing entrepreneur magazine, ink magazine, babysitting weekly, whatever it may be, you've got to get distribution. The way you do that is either through time or money. Money's easy. Facebook ads, Google ads. Time is hard, but if you have no money, it's your only option. Nobody's going to cry for you. If you want people to know about your stuff, you need to find other places that have eyeballs or ears and get it out there. So you need to ask to be a guest on other people's blogs or other people's blogs, influencer marketing. These are the things that you need to figure out. So that's how you start. Have a nice new haircut. The attention, not like I need attention, trading attention. That's the game. People don't get it. Attention is the only thing that matters. And then the next thing that matters is what do you say with that attention? That's it. One-two punch, baby. So, saved you all.
