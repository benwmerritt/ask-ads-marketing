Stop drinking to say shit. We don't curse on Wine Text TV. I told you you could, I was wrong. Right. On this one platform, I never cursed once on Wine Text TV, 1000. We'll beep it, we'll beep it, never once. Hello everybody and welcome to Wine Text TV, brought to you by WineText.com, America's new obsession when buying wine. We decided for episode two to bring the most popular guest in Wine Library TV history, my father, Sasha Vaynerchuk. Hello everybody. Thank you. Thank you. How excited are you to be on episode two? Because it is Sauvignon Blanc with Sasha. Not exactly my favorite. Yeah, you don't even like Sauvignon Blanc. First wine, zoom in. Oyster Bay 2023 Sauvignon Blanc, 87 points wine enthusiast, 90 points James Suckling, found around the country between 10 and $15 a bottle. Again, on this show, we wanna focus on wines that we think you can find and a couple small producers. Let's give it a snippy sniff. So on the nose, I get a little bit of a grassiness which is normal. Now one thing for all of you to note, we are tasting all four of these wines at room temperature which will allow us to actually taste the essence of the wine. Too many people in America and around the world drink their white wines and their rosés too cold. I call it the high school beer rule. You drink such crappy beer in high school. So you get it ice cold so you can't even taste it. You don't go buy a $30 bottle of white wine and get it ice cold so you can't get the flavor. So let's chill a little bit with that. Now, most of you will not taste these wines at room temperature but let's get it a slight chill instead of ice cold. Let's get, you're done? Okay, done. Any thoughts? Mm-hmm. I do like it. Yeah, I find this wine to be incredibly thin, really not interesting, extremely basic. Even at $10 to $15, I would say this is a major pass. 87 wine enthusiasts I think is way too high as well. I realized when I looked back that I was too nice to the Josh cab on the last episode, mainly because I think I was a little rusty and I was just so happy to be doing the show again. I think Josh got very lucky that it was an episode one not episode two. Episode two, Oyster Bay. I'm gonna give this wine 80 points. Big shout out to Wayne Corbett, who wore number 80 as a New York jet. And I think it might even be a 79 but I just wanted to give Wayne Corbett a shout out. A really underwhelming effort. And I know this is a popular wine for a lot of people and I just believe it's because they haven't had other versions. And again, to remind you why WineTexTV exists, you must go try new and different wines. And this for example could be that. Let's see if this one does any better. Anna, 2022, Sauvignon Blanc, 93 points from Sam Kim, $15 wine, similar kind of little rinse. Notice the difference in smell right off the bat. Like these wines are basically in the same price point. Aromatically it's so much stronger. Gooseberry, kiwi again, but very grassy. Almost like fresh grass. Much better. This is dramatically heavier. It's got more viscose, great bright fruit, much stronger acidity. And this is just a much better wine. 93 points Sam Kim, for me maybe 91, 92. This is very good. This is quintessential under $20 New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc that you can pair with fish and clams and oysters and that's pretty good. One thing I want to add to what Gary just said, three years he was telling me. Stop drinking to say shit. We don't curse on WineTexTV. I told you you could, I was wrong. Right. On this one platform, I never cursed once on WineTexTV, 1000. We'll beep it, we'll beep it. Never once. Duckhorn, 2022 Sauvignon Blanc from the North Coast. So it's the North Coast now. They're making that profit. 87 points Wine Spectator, 91 points James Suckling. Now this one's a suggested retail 32 bucks. It's about 20 to 25 bucks. Add good wine stores around the country. This has more pear, a little more apple to it on the nose. Nice fruit. Yeah, solid nose. I like it as well. Creamy. All right, let's give it a whirl. So I think that this wine is interesting. It'd be like, it would be, you like the balance? I think it's very balanced. I'm a little bit different with you on this. I think this is like a bad date. I think this wine starts off great. The nose is great. We both agree. The body is okay. It's silky. I think that's why you like it. But the finish is off balanced. I think it declines in its complexity from the beginning to the end. And I'll say it again, a bad date. You had hope for it. You thought it could be good. It starts off good and it ends horribly. And that's what the Ducorne Sauvignon Blanc feels like to me. I'm gonna go 84 points. Fred Baxter, rare tight end for the New York Jets for all the Jet Vans, war number 84. I'm at 84. Okay, Pauline Sancere 2022, Sancere 90 points. Wine enthusiast. This wine is a $32 suggested retail. Let's give it a sniffy sniff. Little burnt rubber on the nose. A hint of pear again. Asian pear, if I'm gonna be exact and be on my game. Let's give it a whirl. This was a tough show. I don't love this wine either. I don't know. It's like medium bodied. It's fine. Like everyone's so hyped on Sancere. And I think like people just think like every Sancere is great. I think that's more, yeah. I would never pay $25 to $40 that this wine is. The Anna is a much better wine in my opinion. To me, this is an 85 point wine. You know, I'm sorry to say like three of the four civilian blunks kind of let me just order the way I see it. Like all three of these are non buys for me. The Anna is probably the buy for you. You were on the other hand is a little bit more like this. I like that. What happened? We didn't pay our bills. We're not paying our bills. So I wish everybody health, happiness and love you all and drink good stuff and try different things. And what would you like to do? And join the wine tax.com please. I love you.
