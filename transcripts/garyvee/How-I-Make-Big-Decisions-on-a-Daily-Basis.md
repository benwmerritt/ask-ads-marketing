## Transcript
Here are the things that run through my mind. I would say the primary thing I probably asked myself is, is this action gonna lead to somebody showing up at my funeral? If you really ask me what the fuck I do for a living, it's that I'm trying to create a legacy because I'm either A, so egotistical that I want that, or B, love human beings so much, because I do and it's why I think I popped on social. So I think a lot of what I think about is, what's the legacy of this maneuver? Like right now, this is fucking stupid for me. Doing an interview with you for 15 minutes is fucking ridiculous. It makes no goddamn sense, but I'm feeling pretty good about the odds of maybe this leading to you showing up to my funeral. Like, that's how I think about stuff. So I'm very big on how, what does it impact? How does it impact me and more importantly, the other person in the narrative that I care about, which is I think I was gifted with some real crazy shit, enough talent to be able to do my thing for me and still have so much left over to give so much. I mean, that to me is crazy. ["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]
