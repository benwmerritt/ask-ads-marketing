You know, and this was actually the moment where the light bulb went off for me as the as the brand guy of like, We have such reach and we're we're we're essential service before the term essential was kind of becoming more talked about like, You know, people rely on us for basic transportation and work every single day and you know, 10 000 cities around the world. So we have an ultimate responsibility to show up in a way that assures people that we're there for them and they need us, assures them they can help them move safely, but also partners with governments to make sure we're getting the right information out. Ehh! You got your perspective. Just want to be happy. Don't you want to be happy? We're super fired up to have you. Awesome. Nice to be here and that's a hard act to follow. You're gonna follow it though, brother. I have a lot of admiration for you. We haven't had too much interacting through our years, but I'm really excited to have you here and I really do admire a lot of your work. Same. Thank you. Great to be here. Why don't you why don't we set the foundation for context? Just a little personal stuff, share a little about yourself. Sure, sure. Um, yeah, I think Andrea, who I've known for many years, I think summarize it well. I've had a pretty pretty unconventional past. I often wonder how how did I get into marketing? What am I doing here? I've done lots of different things in my career from wanting to be an aspiring actor as a kid to um, to spending a long time actually in policy and government. I've worked at every level of government city, state and federal, including a stint in the Clinton administration. Um, and also worked for Elliott Spitzer when I was the first CMO for the state of New York. Didn't know that the I Love New York brand was a state campaign and a state asset. As a kid who grew up in Brooklyn, that was actually the eye-opening thing when I sat down with the administration to hear, wow, the state owns the brand. Like what can we do with that? It's pretty exciting. Um, you know, I've I went to the dark side. I've worked at McKinsey and in banking. And then um, and then you know, I really What's the biggest thing you what's the biggest thing you learned from those kind of hardcore institutions? Oh, you know that um, you can do anything if you break a problem down into its pieces. I think the McKinsey training was actually some of the most painful years of my life with some of the most incredible learnings. Um, and there's sort of a an arrogance if you want to call it that a McKinsey of like we can solve any problem because if you apply the Rigor and break things down to its pieces and then figure out how to tackle them, you actually could solve almost anything. Do you feel that it breaks down on the humanity side because that's always been my observation in looking at McKinsey, which I admire so much. The process is right, but so is the process of playing basketball perfectly. The problem is not everybody's LeBron James. Yeah. Well, I think the challenge you have and like one of my learnings from having been both in the public and private sectors is in some ways the private sector is a whole lot easier because the what you're optimizing for is pretty clear and measurable. Usually it's some sort of business result. Whereas in the in the public sector, they're just you know, there's so many stakeholders and confounding interests and it's really not clear what success looks like or how you measure it. I mean, I mean By the way, you just can somebody clip that for me because that just sums up my life everything I try to talk about from I mean, that's that's what an entrepreneur's life that has always run family businesses that the health of your well-being is based on the health of the business working with Fortune 5000 companies, which is the antithesis of that to your to the way that you just recapped it. But I have to say that training as well being in government is incredible for being in business, particularly in these days because like it's about managing stakeholders, frankly the bottom line is getting redefined and the role of brands and businesses in the community and society and policy I think has evolved a ton and and it's you know, it's true brands and businesses can play a strong role in positive change like so I think this whole conversation is actually coming around which is why actually now that I look back at my career I'm like I feel really fortunate to have done some really interesting things and it followed my heart and Glad I didn't take that linear path because I've got a lot more interesting experiences to draw on for the work that I'm doing today Which is great. So yes, so I spent a decade at Google was really attracted to to the leadership of the company and the mission And the power of Google I joined when it was a whole lot smaller than it was today. It was 20,000 people And it felt so like it had that startup energy and changed the world and did some really interesting things I was the first head of strategy. I was the first I was the founder of the brand studio I was the first person to run marketing for hardware before we even had a hardware business That's some really exciting adventures there and then You know, I jumped ship to join uber about 10 months ago, which feels like 10 years ago having lived through the pandemic I'm living through it now. I mean, what timing right? But I'd say, you know, it's it's not it's not was it a natural decision for me to join uber I'll say, you know when they called me. I said, I'm not sure you want me to lead marketing I was one of the folks who joined the lead uber in the heyday Um, but I really came to respect Dara and the fact that the company is not the company that it was And it could be a really powerful force for good and talk about bringing public and private interests together imagine the the infrastructure that uber has in place and lift and and just the general infrastructure is extraordinary And and to your point things evolved tremendously over time. Yeah, we have new leadership I think we have the right leadership. I think it's a company that has had it's had has learned many lessons from its past Let's just say that and if you could imagine the like leveraging the reach and the power and frankly the brashness and the boldness of what you think of uber Imagine leveraging that to redefine work leveraging that to get city to be more sustainable Leveraging that to fight the pandemic like that's kind of the company in the brand You want to be taking on these world problems? And so how do we harness that energy and that intent which I do believe is is in the company Have you uh, have you interacted with travis freeman yet? All right, uh former executive uh, abhain or who who's there so my travis. Sorry. I'm sorry I was thinking I was thinking into miss travis and I just went I'm sorry. Not travis calitonic My travis your travis. Yes. Yes. I love travis I was like, man, how the hell did they not interact yet? I guess this coba thing is crazy interact. I am like I am like Every day, right? I think No problem. No worries at all. I hate the travis who I'm sure is listening or He's like one of the best tires I've ever made. He's the best dude of all time I'm sure even if he was if he's watching me. He's not busy. He was like, what the hell No travis talk to me talk to me about talk to me about 10 months in a lot of people can relate to this 10 months into a new gig You're just getting your feet underneath you boom They probably the biggest Single event that any of us have gone through in uh in our careers and for some people our lives How difficult was that? Obviously uber itself in its core business was you know, some businesses have flourished during this time This is a real challenge for uber's core business. Obviously we see the uh, the postmates news and different things like what? Give us a little 411 on the chaos and and maybe some insights that might be able to help other people that are going through chaos Or one day will yeah, good question. Well in some ways uber has been well trained at crises Right. So it's a company that actually goes into its it's like into its best mode when a crisis hits I have to say it's an incredibly rigorous operational company um, and so we actually organized and scenario planned well in february Before things kind of really were clear where they were heading. I mean, I was still keeping travel on the books till the end of march They're gonna go to india in april. I'm still going. Oh, I had this I had this so wrong I was like, okay if everything goes atrocious And this was like in march atrocious will all definitely be back by fourth of july if it goes atrocious. That was my like catastrophic timing So I can resonate with that go ahead. Yeah, we had a leadership uh company-wide leadership summit planned in person in february and dara called it off but said, you know Those who are still willing to travel should and a small group of us came together over three full days Every function of the company represented in about a group of 40 people To really think through what does this mean? What are the different ways this could play out? And frankly, what's our role like what how should we show up in this? You know and this was actually the moment where the light bulb went off for me as the as the brand guy of like We have such reach and we're we're we're essential service before the term essential was kind of becoming more talked about like You know people rely on us for basic transportation and work every single day and you know 10 000 cities around the world So we have an ultimate responsibility to show up in a way that assures people that we're there for them and they need us assures them they can help them move safely But also partners with governments to make sure we're getting the right information out And in many ways we are you could say like, you know, we're a basic service And so I coined the term early that this is an opportunity for us and a need for us to show up like a citizen leader You know we need to be a leader as a brand and as a company of our size But we also need to be a citizen and really be part of the communities and cities that we're working in and the countries And really figure out how to help address the virus And so, you know some principles like let's stay close to government authorities and make sure that we're communicating what the health authorities are Communicating make sure we're keeping the business open where we're essential But also really frankly urging people not to ride if that's what's clear to clearly going to stop the virus Um, and so it became kind of a moment to articulate those values and to do what dara has urged the company to do since you joined Just do the right thing and really not not just think about the business But think about the people in the community speaking of which there's a good transition. Thank you for not riding with uber That very much caught my attention Please explain that and maybe that maybe you can connect those two dots. Sure. Yeah, so taking everything I just said I mean we actually very early Put a lot of um health authority information into our app because you know people were going to our app On a regular basis and so communicating what the authorities were telling The the cities and the and the countries that we're in in terms of what's safe and how they should operate How should they move so we were very early to do that In fact, we put some messaging pretty early in our app that said flatten the curve You know only ride if you need to so encouraging people to just think twice And so then we came up with this idea to communicate that message more broadly because it was obvious that what we needed to do to address the virus is just stop movement and What better company and brand to tell people to stop move than the movement brand the company that's always stood for movement So you might argue it could have been a career limiting move to have the first campaign I go to dar to ask for is like can we run an ad that says don't write our product? And we did um, you know, and he definitely paused. He's like, are you sure we really want to say that on television? Um, but it was the right thing to say and it felt like the responsible thing to do and frankly had that kind of response That I think you had which is it stopped people to realize actually it must be a really important message to come from uber Because it's not in our interest to actually be saying that big shout out to jim davis for the kind words of this show Giving you some love thomas and the others hashtag marketing for the now if you've got insights quotes things of that nature We love watching you all on twitter Thomas, what about what about the speed in which we all have to navigate now? You come from a background that I think especially in google times like speed was a variable To hence to your point, even it was 20 000. It was still a very fast company Do you feel that the zooms Google hangouts slacks email text like do you think the infrastructure from remote working is actually leading to more speed? I do I mean i've been calling the work that we've been doing and i've tried us and i talked about this is real-time marketing I mean there's never been more real-time marketing than the last you know four or so months Um, I mean, you know the spot that we just referred to thank you. Thank you riders. We created in three days We're running a spot now and no mask no ride Also, I think a really important message and so while we're open business We want people to realize a mask actually not just keeps you safe It keeps everyone around you safe and frankly we need to keep our drivers safe Um, and so and we created that spot in three days as well So like and so for the first few months we were doing focus groups three days a week every week In every country because we just needed to stay close to kind of how things were changing How people were perceiving things and we're still trying to stay keep our pulse on things because this is evolving in ways that are just Unprecedented and so doing work being responsive. We've pivoted I mean we were ready to run the no mask spot the week of the Black Lives Matter protests that occurred and so we quickly pivoted and said that's not the right message right now Put that on the show or you don't know when we'll run that and then we pivoted back as the debate is kind of raged up around Yeah, so like I mean it's like we're looking out a few months, but I don't I don't feel like I can look out more than eight weeks Without any real sense of like what we should be doing Tapping into your uncomfortable likeability that you're possessing here on this I'm just genuinely curious about you the dude, uh Any behavior shifts from you that you're most intrigued by new shows new apps Buying something new direct to consumer that you never thought you would and now you can never go back Anything hit your radar if you're self evaluating. I like that. You're looking out to yonder. So you're thinking You know any anything that really stands out to you about maybe a new consumer trend from you Maybe a new ott platform. Maybe uh the way you consume news. Any anything stand out It's so funny if anything my my mind quickly goes to to the human things that i'm doing and doing more regularly like Like going to walk the dog in the park every morning despite the stress of the day that's about to come Has that been just has that been a wonderful addition to your life? Having dinner at the dinner the dinner table not the kitchen counter with my partner every day with proper table Like not tablecloths But just like a proper setting Not using our hands to eat or you know like so like actually those moments have been the more memorable My partner is shopping online more than I'd like so like we've got too much cardboard in the recycling I keep on fighting about that. So he's leaned into that behavior Um, but I have to say it's been more trying to embrace the human connections in this and reaching out to friends and family That I haven't talked to in in a long time. Actually, that's been sort of more memorable to me Um than some of the technology that maybe I've always used or just I'm a slow adopter too Well the the affirmation to your incredible likability has been confirmed on twitter I knew it. I was feeling it And uh, I will be texting travis right now to make sure we get to chop up and spend some time together I really appreciate you and your insights and I wish you nothing but help. Thanks for having me. Good luck. Bye Hey, everybody on youtube first of all, thank you so much so humbled for your time I don't want to watch but time is the biggest asset.
