I'm Gary Vee and I day trade attention. I think I'm a positive entrepreneur. Some may think of me as a creator, many people just only know me as Gary Vee, but Gary Vaynerchuk is the active chairman and CEO of VaynerX and of VFriends. But I think the greatest title that I hold is Nice Guy. Like I love being an entrepreneur, I'm a Jets fan, and I like being a New York Times bestselling author. I love being a nice guy. And that is the greatest title I hold. I actually think being kind and compassionate and empathetic actually contribute to lasting significant success. Yes, I want to accomplish big things and be a winner and dominate and crush and all that stuff, but not at the expense of anybody else. I believe that it is my job to eliminate fear amongst my employees, thus giving them a higher chance to actually solve what I'm worried about in a more healthy, productive way. That's how I see leadership. Balancing Gary Vaynerchuk, the entrepreneur and CEO versus being Gary Vee, the public figure, has not been challenging at all actually. I think they're very integrated. I'm still the person that I was in 1998. The takeaway for anybody that ever meets me is that they see that I'm a passionate human that generally wants good for everyone, including myself. I continue to enjoy the process. I continue to enjoy the grind. I'm in my game, I'm in the dirt, I'm operating. My calendar looks heavier today than it did the first time you saw me. That's exactly how I like it. You just saw the State of the Union of Me. I'm excited to update this video once every year because I think this is something needed for everybody going forward. I hope this encourages you to make your version of this video and pin it to your top left corner. Your State of the Union of Me video, do it now.
