I can't help it. I don't know what to do. I'm just the bug is real, Nick. But on the flip side, they're gonna make more money than they've ever seen in their life. I'm literally gonna make more money in sports gardens this year that I made in VaynerMedia the last 10 years. It's like absurd. You got your perspective. I just want to be happy. Don't you want to be happy? Welcome, Nick. Hi. Nick, this is gonna be awfully difficult because you and I have been completely addicted to sports cards together. I've been sprinkling it in. I'm so addicted. I'm sure Andrea's like, why is Gary doing it? He's usually pretty weird, but this is like, take next level. I literally want to take all 20 minutes and just talk to you about vintage basketball, prism, and zions. But let's first talk about, you joined TikTok when again? April 20th. Right. So like, how is it transitioning for everybody, right? A lot of people are about to get new jobs. People are starting to get new jobs right now. Being respectful of the audience and trying to bring the most value. What was the biggest challenge and what's been the biggest gift of joining a new org in the middle of the pandemic? Yeah, I'll start with the biggest gift. All that awkwardness where you get to the office and you're like, where do I sit? Who do I have lunch with? What do I do? Where's the coffee? Where's the bad thing? You don't have to worry about that at all. So like, getting that out of the way, it's been easy to just work from home and then get to meet people through Zoom and on meetings and just get to know them as people before you're worried about where everything is in the office. I'd say on the flip side, all those casual conversations that you have that are unplanned and spontaneous, we're not having that at this time. So it is a little bit more difficult and you have to plan these encounters a little bit more properly with the team. Even if it's like a five minute check-in here or there, or I have office hours where people can just like, Zoom me during that time, just to make sure that they get some face time to try to recreate those spontaneous moments. The other random thing that I did for my team that I think was fun is when you're in this environment, you're not networking outside of your team. You basically see your team every day, every meeting each week, and you're not getting access to people outside. So I've been inviting special guests into the team meeting so that they can meet either influence leaders or artists or people that they admire outside. And I even asked them to give me requests on who they wanna talk to next. And it's surprising, because it'll range from a celebrity or a music artist to like an actual business leader that runs brand for another company. So bringing people into the mix and getting them to, network outside of the team has been pretty fun. What most surprised you about TikTok? You're obviously, you've had a skyrocketing career. You've been in all sorts of incredible brands. And so for me, you're not coming into this role, not knowing TikTok. You probably come into this role knowing TikTok way better than most people in corporate land. You came, you were at Hulu prior, Taco Bell. Like, you know, I admire you tremendously. So what did surprise you though? When, you know, no matter what you know, when you get under the hood, it becomes different. What stood out? This is gonna sound like a setup, but it's not at all. I came in the midst of the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests. And to see the amount of empathy, the leadership down on not only like, what is happening with the business, because they actually didn't worry about that as much as they cared about, what are we doing to help voices be heard and shared? What are we doing to help COVID relief efforts? How are we deploying funds and charitable countries? Like the thing that we did with you, the live stream, like that was a big initiative for the company, not because of users. I don't know if my team reached out to you, but my team in London is working with UNICEF. And this morning I confirmed that I'm gonna do something I think on Monday. I'm coming back to the platform, not for 12 hours. That was fucking insane, but I'm going on for two hours, I think. Yeah, but that's the stuff that I didn't expect coming in under the hood. Like I thought it was just a platform and that you're marking platform, but coming in, they really wanna just do good in the world and help others in a meaningful way and provide impact. So that's why when we're talking to you and we threw out the idea of like, hey, let's raise money for meals on wheels and no kid hungry. It was like a no brainer and they're like, yes, absolutely. How can we support and how can we contribute and how do we make this a bigger thing that helps support things that are important for us? So I've been able to see that side of TikTok, which I don't think most people get to see, which has been pretty dope. Is it challenging being on a brand, a platform that obviously has the dynamic of being China owned in a highly political kind of environment? Like I, you know, I because, you know, I always advocate where there's underpriced attention and every single person watching here, not because of Nick, because like I said earlier, I'm only buying in one Oreo, I don't care that much. Not because I own zero a bite dance in TikTok, even though that gets thrown around every day. Like, you know, it's just because I think the platform is extremely right. So when people, you know, as soon as I think TikTok's in the news, I get like, I get moral. I basically get two massive alerts right now, either a something's going on with TikTok and I've got to answer for it because like, I'm like the pied piper or two, some sports car just went up four times and people are trying to figure out if I like talked about it, like, you know, both intersect in your world. You know, is that challenging a little bit though? Like when people are just spreading non-truths and it's like, oh, or like, you know, just like, like has that been daunting or not really? Not really, cause honestly, we're a global company. So I don't, I don't really worry about, you know, individual areas or regions. I'd say as a global company, we really try to embody that same empathy and passion that I just mentioned earlier across every region. From a personal standpoint, that's the stuff that fuels me. You know, like I've been to companies where I get dropped in at Taco Bell and a month they have this, you know, crisis and it's like a lawsuit on their beef. And then I get to Samsung and then phone start catching. Phone's are on fire. It's like, for me, it's sort of part of the course. I jokingly- Can we break the news here that maybe you're, even though you might be the hottest prospect in all of marketing, you might also actually be a bad luck charm. Should we firm that up here on marketing for now? Like, like, you are starting to make me think, you know, like I'm always secretly courting you to eventually work with you, but I'm like, wait a minute, something bad might happen a week after we get that deal done. No, it will happen, but it'll be the best thing for you. It'll be the best thing for any company done that. Cause I- Talk to me about the chip on the shoulder. You know, I was actually my number one question, which I've never asked you, is you really have had a skyrocketing career. Like, like, like I had so many people admire you in my circles before I got to really know you. Who the hell is this kid? You know, do you think it is the chip on the shoulder? Like, do you think it's something from childhood? Is it the luck of the draw of DNA? Is there something that you can pinpoint? Cause I do think I have a lot of ambitious, hungry characters watching right now that either may want to do it entrepreneur-wise or may want to crush it, you know, corporate marketing-wise. And they're learning a lot by watching me and then have that leverage. You know, is there, is there some insight to, like, you know, this is a tough question. Why are you so awesome, but like, humbly to the best of your ability? Like, is there an insight that can help somebody who's watching now, like, why this has happened? It's one of those things where you, you know, I've talked about this over dinner before and I've never tried to dissect, like, the path that I've had too closely. But, you know, we, we, we've talked about being, you know, immigrant, having immigrant parents. And like, I noticed that, like, my friend circle, without me realizing it, every single one of my close friends that were like groomsmen at my wedding, they all are first generation, you know, Americans. So I think there, there's a little bit of that, like, you have to hustle and you have to always grind just to like catch up to people who have been here for generations and have things established and all that stuff. And I think, especially in today's time, you're seeing that come to light in a big way, both positive and both negative. And I think the chip on the shoulder is that, like, I don't want to ever be told, like, this is where you fit or this is how you should conform or this is what it takes for you to be successful. It's just to like, you know, act like you belong. Like, I want to actually prove that, like, it's not about acting like belong. Like, we're actually setting the foundation and the framework for what should be the case for the future. Nick, something we haven't talked about even privately is I thought you were hacking culture in a very significant way with Hulu. Even though some of the ways you did it pissed me off, Tom fucking Brady. But, you know, you were really, you were in a very short period of time, like, you know, what, for the, there's a lot of executives who are watching right now who are going to get their next marketing job. What enabled you to do so many, you know, some of the cash stuff, like, the athletes, the Brady thing, which caused a huge, very, there was a lot, what kind of freedom and what kind of actions as an executive, there's one who's watching this right now will have to do to get the breathing room to, what should people look for to be, I mean, that was just a lot of good output in a short period of time. And I was really like, what's the mix? What's the makeup of that? It's a few things. I think coming into a situation where people don't feel like they have everything together is a good thing. Like coming into a company when they're sort of about to take off versus they've already made it has been huge for me. And also having leaders that kind of come into the situation knowing that I'm bringing a certain thing to the table and they're embracing that and they're giving me that runway to do it. Like Kelly at Hulu basically said, you're not just gonna run brand, you're gonna run brand and culture. And the reason why I'm doing that purposefully is because you are someone that I think has a pulse on both and you can actually weave that in in a way that helps us, you know, really cement ourself in culture. So I think I've always come into a place where they didn't feel like they had it together and always worked for a leader that basically said, here are the keys, you know, go run with it and then let us know if you need any help and support. I mean, even at the highest level at Hulu, Randy, former CEO, he was very open and willing to take risks even from the first campaign which we called Better Ruins Everything. Like the tagline was we're about to ruin TV for you. And this is like a streaming company saying that we're gonna ruin TV for you which was sort of like, you know, bold and really like taking the traditional idea TV and flipping down its head. And I think having their support really helped me do what I was able to do in a short amount of time. What about your own behavior? What's really stood out during COVID? My own behavior? Yeah, like what are you watching? I don't watch things anymore, I just watch eBay. Like you just live on eBay and just buy my sports cards. Andre, I know you're like, I see you laughing. Andre, this is real, we have a disease. Something very bad is happening. Andre, if there's a substantial chance that VaynerMedia is gonna turn into a sports card store that literally when we all come back, Amy, I'm sorry about this. Like when you come back into the office, you're gonna be standing behind a glass case trying to sell optic rookie cards of Patrick Mahomes. So I can't help it, I don't know what to do. I'm just, the bug is real, Nick. But on the flip side, they're gonna make more money than they've ever seen in their life. I'm literally gonna make more money in sports cards this year than I made in VaynerMedia the last 10 years. It's like absurd. Yes, it is. Actually, let's talk about that. What? Actually, let's talk about that, fuck it. Obviously I come too early on because I knew you liked sports, culture. We've worked together a little bit, but not as much based on how much we buy. Complex, different things. We've introduced our friends to each other. Let's just break this down. Because you weren't around, and we didn't know each other when I was going everybody in 2005 and 2006 and saying, we need to put all our money into Facebook and Twitter when social media was not a thing. 15 fucking years ago. Please tell the audience here, when I call you the first time and say, Nick, you need to spend all your money on sports cards. What goes through your head? You're a big time innovator, you see shit. I'm just, I actually never fully heard you articulate it. Like what's that initial like processes when you hear something very left field? Yeah, I remember the time, moment of place. What was, yeah, tell me. I don't know. We were at a restaurant having breakfast. It was called Linnetta All Day. It's in Santa Monica. We were having breakfast. We were talking about life and professional life and all that stuff. I remember, you were talking about, yes, I remember. And then you literally said, hey, I have an idea that's gonna melt your face. Those are the words you use. And no one says, I have an idea that's gonna melt your face. So I was like, okay, you have my attention. That's like the hook. You gotta deliver now. Like what is this thing? He's like, it's an investment idea that's gonna literally melt your face. And I was like, okay, okay, I'm ready. And I thought it was gonna be some like new social platform or some new thing that was like in the world that we live in and you're like basketball cards. I was just like, what about basketball cards? You're like, I'm buying basketball cards. And I thought you had some source. I was like, where are you buying basketball cards? eBay. Are you selling these basketball cards? eBay. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on. So you're buying basketball cards on a public marketplace to sell them on that same public marketplace. And you're telling me that's like a good investment. And you're like, absolutely. So like I dipped my toe in the water and everything that you said to buy at the time, like, it's like kind of 15X or something disgusting. And one year- You were that on trial? 15X. Absurd, absurd. And then we got hooked on StockX because at the time, StockX hadn't had trading cards. They just did sneakers and street wear. And then that second that team, Josh and team like brought trading cards into the mix, it was just like floodgates. Do you know that that was an important inflection point? Like you were like, okay, that's interesting. I mean, StockX is basically culture. And I don't mean like the second market for culture. Like they're literally able to drive what's hot to youth. And I feel like by them getting into trading cards- What's the learning in there as somebody who's so tapped in? What's the insight or what can people, like what do you tell people as being somebody who really sees things, when you do something crazy like that? If somebody said, after this scene, somebody hits you up in a company, like what did you learn from that? What can somebody who's watching? Cause obviously it's a funny story and people like, but for you, when you're so young, what happens the next time you hear something like that? How are you gonna play that? Do you judge the judge? Like I'm a big fan of judge the judge. The thing that pissed me off with all my friends that they moved, you remember you've been giving me accolades for 15 years of always being right about stuff? Why was this one so hard to fathom? Like I'm trying to figure out what, and so much is telling a story here for thousands that are watching. What's the thing to learn? Is it do real homework when you hear something? Is it never say no and say yes, try a little? Like what's the, like what's something you think? I think you just gotta think about the source. Kind of what you just said about judging the judge. Like it, no one person has their pulse on culture at all times across all things. It's just not possible, right? So you get a few people that you trust because they have their pulse on new music or they have their pulse on new trends or they have their pulse on whatever. And if you just sort of lean in and you accept the fact that they might see something ahead of the time or they might have awareness of something before you do, you just start to experiment and then lean in. And then once you realize it's the thing, you go in heavy. And that's the exact analogy with the sports cards. Like you said it, I did a bit. I realized I should have done a lot more, but it's all good because now I have time to make up for it. And it's fine. What are you most, I'm blown away by TikTok's innovation of product speed. I'm actually pumped to TikTok's on the scene because it's making another platform I like a lot of competitor yours Instagram. I think there, I can feel it that they're being forced to innovate because how fast you're innovating. Have you, you know, you've been in a lot of places is my observation right? Is the speed of innovation pretty remarkable? The speed at TikTok is incredible. I think it's a two year old company, but we were starting to behave more like a 10 year old brand. We're up leveling our game in terms of the product, the new features, the way that we bring new things to market, what we're testing and innovating, and then ultimately like how we're gonna bring the market to life. It'll, it won't feel like a two year old company, which I think is the most exciting part of what I'm doing. Last 30 seconds, anything people should be thinking about or any value prop? I mean, it's a place to have fun. Like I'd say like most people, you hear all the news and you hear all the press and at the end of the day, like this is truly a community where people wanna express themselves creatively and they wanna bring joy to others. And you're on the platform and you obviously have been advocating for a while. Like all the stuff that you see, you leave the platform after you've looked at it for however long and you feel like good. Or is it, yeah, you're smiling. Whereas like I'm on other platforms sometimes and like no, knock on them. I'm anxious when I go on Twitter now. Exactly, exactly. I'm never anxious. So I'm like, it's heavy in there. It's heavy, but like this is almost like the, the nice happy corner of the internet that people are just starting to find and realizing that it's actually impacting culture at scale. And I think that's, that's what I enjoy about it. Like it's really a fun place to be. I love it. Nick, thank you so much, man. I wish you continued success. Thank you. Thank you. Hey everybody on YouTube. First of all, thank you so much. So humbled for your time. I don't wanna watch, but time is the biggest asset. So thank you for watching that video. If you got some value out of that, there's plenty more where that came from. Feel free to check it out.
