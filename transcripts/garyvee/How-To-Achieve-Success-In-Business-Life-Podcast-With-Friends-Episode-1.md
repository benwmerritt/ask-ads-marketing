## Transcript
Do you know how many times I fucking pound I worked in a fucking liquor store at 34? Cause all these fucking 27 year olds are like why am I not a fucking Trillionaire? I'm like cause you're fucking 27. Right. And they just sick, they get so down. They play this fucking game. Like the amount of people, do the amount of people who come through Barstool, email, come through, call in and they say like, I've got what it takes, I wanna do it. I'm gonna work so hard at it, I wanna be like you. And we're like, cool, do it. Write a blog, start a podcast. I know. Yeah, fuck it. In two days dude. Like two days, I'm like do this for four years straight with no feedback, no money, no nothing. And then we can start talking. People are like, I wanna be famous. They compare that. I wanna live a 1% life. I'm like, eat shit for a decade. Yeah. And they're like what? I'm like, you wanna live a 1% life. Attention is the number one asset. VaynerNation, how are you? I'm really excited. This is pretty important. I have three incredible friends with me. This is actually where I'm thinking about going with my podcast. Obviously a lot of you know that listen, a lot of my podcast is chopped up from the stuff we're filming from talks or me moving because I'm busy and I'm not really allocating time to create. On the flip side, there's a part of me as I head into 2024 that really misses creating. Cause you're of the moment, you're of the second stuff that you do. I mean you're on fucking Instagram in one second after something happens in sports and you got your take. There's a lot going on with my VFriends thing. For the people watching on Twitch right now, big shout out. I'm actually gonna use this to build up Twitch as well and start being live on Twitch when I do my podcast. And we're gonna call it podcast with friends. And what we're gonna do is me and my crew, Tyler, Zach, Dio, a lot of us, Sam, she's always out there. A lot of us are always just watching and cheering for the people that we're gonna have on the show. So we've done this in the past. I've done podcasts with two or three or four people at the same time, mixed from different places. But I've even more clarity on why I like it. I was giving a keynote at Vicon, August 8th to the 11th, 2024. Go to vicon.co to check it out. It's gonna be in LA this year. Everybody needs to come through. But I said something there off the cuff that said, my real passion is that strangers become acquaintances. Acquaintances become friends and then friends become family. And it's kind of what I'm thinking about with this podcast. What we're gonna be doing going forward a lot more often, maybe even once or twice a week, because I'm gonna do an original podcast live, fresh of the topics, like the Jets Lost to the Raiders, they're about to play the bills up in Buffalo. Like this will air before that. Like in that week, fresh and more importantly, I'm hoping that for you, the audience, a lot of these people will go from being a stranger to an acquaintance. For some of you that have seen them, oh, you've seen them, but now you're more into acquaintance to friend. For some of you that are hardcore fans of these people, the way we all chop up in this unique format may lead from friends to family. Like you like them more. And then for the three individuals that join me, I'm just hoping that they connect with their people and something happens. And so we're here, episode one of Podcast with Friends. And we're gonna introduce these friends to you VaynerNation. We're gonna start here. Ladies first, always to the left. Please tell everybody who you are, what you do. Then we're all gonna just chop it up. And then all of you are gonna ask me a question at the end for a Q and A session. Please be very selfish about that because I want it to be good for your career, your life, or whatever the fuck you care about. Let's rock and roll. Okay, well I like the ladies first. My name's Law, since for ladies I always win. So ladies first, and ladies always win. I'm a singer, a songwriter, so I create music. I have a podcast, I am an influencer. I really like to think of myself as a communicator and I kind of just have different platforms and ways that I do communicate. Yeah, my messages. But music is definitely my greatest gift and my loudest communication right now. That's kind of what I do. And where'd you grow up? I grew up in upstate New York, so in Kingston. Love it, born and raised. Born and raised, well I was born like 20 minutes around there but I was there all of first grade through 12. And you always wanted to sing? When I came later. No, I always wanted to be a singer from like, I started playing piano when I was four. And like literally, literally this blonde hair. I saw Hannah Montana. Yes. And like literally the episode where she was like jumping on the bed with the red light guitar which I literally won from Six Flags. And you're like that. I was like, I wanna do that. And then like, yeah, I kind of was just like, I always knew I went to high school and I got into fights with my guidance counselor every week cause she was like, you know, SATs and you gotta go to college. And I was like, I'm gonna be a pop star. And you know, that wasn't. And here we are. But here we are, right? And now I'm sitting, talking to Gary Vee. I love it. Crazy. My man. I'm Kevin Clancy, people call me KFC or KFC Barstool. I started Barstool in New York, the New York branch of everything at Barstool in 09 where we were just blogging at the time. We were just writing all day long, 10 or 15 posts a day. And then I jumped on the podcast wave. I knew that was gonna be the next big thing for Barstool. So I've been doing my podcast there since 2012. And then, you know, video after that, which is my video series on social media called One Minute Man. So we kind of do all of it. You're proud of that One Minute Man? Fuck yeah, man. I love it. I love it. What do you think about that brand positioning? I don't even know what that is. I'm down to it. Well, you know, One Minute Man is in real life, right? No. Someone who lasts one minute, like. It's like, Seshley? Yeah. Oh my god. Why? That was like a, what was like a, first shot, this is like me all the time though. People say things and I'll be like, no, last one, sorry. Task at hand, not your dirty head. Go. Yeah, yeah. There we go. And so now, I mean, I've been there, almost like 15 years, 14 years, whatever. So. And now it's an iconic brand. It's crazy, dude. When you're a grandpa, you're gonna be talking about it and they're gonna know what it is versus, even when we met, you guys were still in the come up. Totally. I mean, and I never, ever thought it was gonna be like this. I was happy. I just wanted to get a job that was not a job. Like I just wanted to talk sports or shoot the shit or something. And I was born in the Bronx, New York guy like through and through. Right. So like Mike and the Mad Dog. Oh yeah. So the dog, yeah. Mike and dog were like my thing. Yeah. You know, Boomer and Carter and all those guys. I went to Fordham and that has, I believe, the best radio and communications program in the country. Syracuse, some people say. I think it's Fordham. I'm happy for my high school went to Fordham. Yeah. And if you're into- Which ones considered more bougie and which ones considered more street? What between what? Fordham and Syracuse. I don't know the answer to that. Are both bougie, comm schools? Probably. I think, I mean, it's a, you know. Yeah, they both considered a good comm school. I feel like everyone's- But I think from Fordham that I, like, I know so many people from Fordham. There's a lot. I mean, if you look at sports media, it's Mike Green, Ian Eagle. A lot of athletes come from Syracuse though. Yeah, yeah, that's for sure. That's not even clips. Right, okay. Sports boys of broadcast. The guys that talk about it. The nerds are over here. The guys who play it. No, Q's got both. Yeah, well, okay. But I would say Fordham being totally. But I think, I mean, when you're at Fordham, you get to cover the men's, the jest, the nut. You are Ian. Would you fight a Fordham sportscaster in a fight to settle this? Like, can I put on a paper? Syracuse, I guess? Yeah, maybe not a few Syracuse. Can I get you at a Q's podcast or sports personality to fight to settle this very challenging thing that we've all been trying to figure out, which is who's got a better broadcast school, Fordham or Syracuse? And you got the distribution. We have the program for that. Come on, Twitch, big shout out to all of you. Get ready. It's coming. I'm gonna use this. This is gonna build up to which this podcast. Thank you for being here. Johnny Vee, what's good? Aquabombs, what's good? Stunt, Tuck NFT, what's good? Studio Steve, what's good? So no, you're not into it. No, but you know what? We have, at Barcel, we have Ruff and Rowdy, which is our amateur boxing federation. By the way, I've said this to Erica. I've said this to Dave. I've said this to you. I think maybe even on the podcast, when I was on with you a couple of years ago, forever, I will say this, Ruff and Rowdy was the seed of what's happening now. 100%. The celebrity boxing. Ruff and Rowdy. Now, one could argue Kimbo Slice, and that was the seed before Ruff and Rowdy. Ruff and Rowdy was a fucking pay-per-view. I have, I give a, I think this is lost in history. I mean this. I think certain things get lost in history. Sometimes we do the first, you're a little too early. But it's something that's going on so fast nowadays. But you know what, sometimes you wanna talk about, like people know I was an early investor on Facebook and Twitter. I don't talk enough about the guy who started a YouTube show eight weeks after YouTube launched. Eight weeks after YouTube launched. Like that's not on my resume that all of you walk around knowing like, yo, Gary Vee was like early actual real YouTuber. I let that get lost in history. I'm trying to recoup it right now. Yeah, hell no. You don't know what you see now. I took it to the top of the resume. Anyway, brother, I'm glad you're on. I'm excited to shop it up for you. Especially, I wanna talk a little bit. Michael Carter got cut, who I love with all my heart, but a lot going on in our Jets lane. All right, my man. Dale Moss, former NFL wide receiver. A lot of people know me from. Did you say Randy Moss? I wish, that was a comparison often. Former NFL wide receiver, transitioned out of sports. Now sports and entertainment host. A lot of people know me from the reality world. But since, my main focus now is filmmaking. I'm currently producing, developing three docu series working with Radical Media Academy Award when production company. And doing a lot of things as a creator. Again, covering NFL games. Sports is near and dear to my heart. But storytelling is a passion of mine. And I think for me. Put the two together, right? Yeah, 100%. I feel like for so long in my life, I was so afraid to share my own story. That I'd grab. So I grew up in South Dakota, small town, Midwest. So you needed to be humble, right? You didn't do that kind of shit, or was it something else? No, it was, I think. So my mom's side disowner, because of biracial marriage. Very isolated community. Sports was my pathway to break through so many barriers. It was your safe place. But my family structure was very strong. My dad suffered pretty heavily from heroin addictions. Was in and out of prison until the time I was 21. But even with all those things that occurred, we were raised right. Our love and support from our family was unconditional. But I know that everything I did as I was growing up, I was so, everyone judged me, right? Or they were just waiting for something to happen, because at that point, if I fucked up. Who was they? Your mom's side of the family? I think just the community I was in. Which was the broader version of your mom's side of the family. Makes sense. Makes sense. I got it, I'm following. Again, South Dakota, I was only black kid in my school until the time I was in high school. But I had this fear of, if I made a mistake, everything everyone ever thought about my family or myself. Would then be true. It would be true. So you wouldn't be following. God damn, that's a big burden to carry. Yeah. You know what, it's funny. This is what's so interesting about life, what I'm excited about to get into these episodes, and I appreciate you going there right off the bat. We all have that. This concept of judgment is something I'm spending a lot of time thinking about. You all know my content. I'm trying to get people to understand what's actually going on. Judgment's a killer. Like, think about, and by the way, listening to his story, we all know, kids go extreme one way or the other on that. Oh, right. You either like, I'm never gonna make a fucking mistake to show y'all, or you go, fuck it, it doesn't matter. No matter what I do, you're always gonna judge me, so fucking I'm just gonna make mistakes. I'm just gonna make mistakes. There's only one answer to that. They're on two sides of the pillow, but they're gonna be fucking extreme. Yeah, they are. But I will say, as time went on, you learned to let go of those things, but I'm grateful for how I grew up, how I was raised, and it's allowed me. Do you think your adversities are your foundation? 100%. Yeah, of course. I remember there, one time, again, I came, a lot of people know me from the reality world. Tell everybody about that, because there's gonna be a lot of people. You mentioned it, just again, there's gonna be so many people that listen to this show over the next year or two. A lot of them won't know who you are from that world, so bring it down, go ahead. Yeah, so I was on The Bachelorette in 2020 during the pandemic. So that's small show. Yeah, so everyone has actually seen it. Most watch reality show in the history of television. Also, I had a very unique experience because on my season, the lead at the time decided to stop the show, and we ended up leaving together early, which I never say. It's like reality TV hall of fame material. Yeah, it had never happened. Like, I even know what you're talking about. And like, not in full detail, but I'm like, yep, I remember that shit. I remember, you know, because I'm like, work every second. I heard about a season of The Bachelorette ending that way. Is that a really, that's just, so this is ironic. But you can see it, look at the face. I was just saying, if I had a chance to stop the show and just take his motherfucker home, I would do it. Motherfucker, I'm stopping this podcast right now, you know, see everyone have a great time. I look like that. But you know, that goes back to like, wanting to do things right, right? I had this naive belief that you could make it work with anybody, and I think sometimes when you have that approach, just because of what my mom and my sisters had to go through, I wanted to be that so badly for someone else and solve the problems. Super hero. Exactly, and a lot of people have that. I know, I should have, I should have that shit in me too. But you can lose yourself in that. But I will say that's the greatest experience I ever had. You know, I grew a lot from it. I went through some shit in the media, but I never compromised my character and integrity. It taught you about yourself for you too. You're still young, how old are you? The world can love you. How old are you? 35. Yeah, you're a young dude. This is a couple years ago, right? You hit the fan? Yeah, I'm 23 now. So you learn a lot about yourself. Yeah, and you can be, the world can love you and something happens, and then it changes overnight. But I think anytime you go through something like that, especially with millions of people kind of watching every move, and you can maintain your integrity and who you are, and not lose yourself to go around. Let's actually go around here a little bit with like, back to what I want to do with this. I mean, there's probably going to be, this is so fun, because I like to improv and innovate in real time on the show. So much of like, you can see what I have on the table with B-Friends, like, I was like, you know what? This will work for me, because I'm on this journey of building my Pokemon Marvel Sesame Street called B-Friends. I got the panda. Thank you. Yeah, I got the bulldog and someone else. I think the cow, the cow. It's common sense. I make the cow common sense, because I believe it's really underrated, and I know that cows are popular. So like, there's, like, I- I love cows, this is why I'm doing this. Every day on my story, I post a cow. It's like my dream to have like a father or some cow. So common sense cow swag, let's do that. So now no one can judge me. Actually, open this cap of cards to see if you pull out common sense cow. If this was a cow, I'm gonna think that this was Max Major, and I'm gonna freak out. I'm gonna literally scream, and all these winners are gonna break, and I'm scared, oh man. Actually, I'm gonna go around the horn right now and ask, actually, let's see what you pulled. Let's see. Okay, we have, is this a bass fish? No, you can read it, it's at the top. I think it's a brilliant barracuda. Barracuda, okay. The woke walrus. I wrote to that. I just, walrus energy. Karma kiwi. I'm big on karma. Oh my gosh, she's cute. Okay, persistent penguin, that's me. That's you right there? Yeah. It's a rookie card too, wasn't in series one. All right, let's do a little nerdy stuff like that. Okay, real quick, around the horn. Now that we're talking about this, I'm gonna do this on every episode team, keep me honest on this. One or two words that you think most describe you, who you are as you sit with me today. Mm. Jesus. Yes, Law. Yeah, I've never been a therapy, so that's a deep bass question. Yeah, honestly, I like this stuff. Yeah, like just like, like honestly, real talk, like, and by the way, like, you know, sometimes people can answer like, you know, right away. And maybe, you know, I'm saving you, I'm doing this right now to give you a little time, but like. They have a little time, not me. I'm right next year. Ladies first. You know, what word or two do you think most describe you right now? I was actually thinking about getting this tattooed. So that's deep. Yeah, right. So this really resonates with you. Yeah. I would say resilient. I've like learned that that's like my superpower, is that like, every time I'm going through something super hard, I'm like kind of just like, oh, I like, I don't give up very easily. I kind of like would just like, yeah, like whatever, like I'm just like good at dealing with bullshit, I guess. But then I realized like, wow, like I just don't stop. And like, that's kind of why I've been able to get where I'm going. I'm not resilient a lot. It's funny with B-Friends, one of the things I'm trying to do is change the narrative on things. So the mascot of my entire IP, the Mickey Mouse, the Pikachu is the very, very, very, very lucky black cat. Yeah. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. And so resilience is something I really admire. And it's funny, I don't like that, like, not that I like the devil. No, don't worry everybody. But like, I'm trying to do some contradiction. So in B-Friends world, the resilient is the resilient red devil. And like, I'm trying to just try to change some conversations, dig a little bit deeper. I love resilience. I love that, my man. Where are you at right now? I'm in the same place I'm always in. I'm always trying to be what's next, you know? Like, I guess. Curious? Yeah, I mean, like we, I was. Adaptive? I was blogging when that was new. I started the podcast first. I know your career well, I'm a fan. Yeah, like. Adaptive, innovative, curious, all? Probably all. I hesitate to use the word trailblazer because I think it's dramatic. But what I have always done. It would also be beautiful if you'd say that right now. Right. Yeah, don't do that. But I do it in a sense of like. Iconic? No. Do I do it today? The best. No, the legend is. The single greatest human to ever work on earth? I think I do it in a literal way though. Like, I have always done it first. And then someone at the company, or someone else has taken it. Fearless. To the next level. And I'm kind of happy with that. Like I'm. Yeah. All right, fucking fearless, I guess. Oh, really? I think all of these things are a little bit dramatic when we're talking about, you know. Social media accounts and content and whatnot. But. Why? Like honestly, like if you think about. I don't think anybody should be afraid. There's no fee, you know, like. Brother, I have good news for you. The entire world's afraid. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's. Bro, the only thing. Yeah. The only thing that's happening right now is fear. Yeah. Like, do you know what this podcast is about? For me personally, building blocks to eliminate fear. Mm-hmm. Friendship is how you eliminate fear. Back to interracial marriages. What's going on in the Middle East right now. Like the only way things happen good is if people become friends. Yeah. Especially when they don't look like each other. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everyone's. Yeah, no, I get that. I get that. I just didn't want to be dramatic about it. But I do think we will always. We're just talking about, to your point, we're just talking about content. But guess what? Like what sports? Do you know this? You're just like a lot of us are, let's use this as a theme. Athletes used to not get paid a lot of money in 1930, 40, 50. Do you know how much more famous a pilot was in America? Outside of Mickey Mantle? Like, 1982 NBA finals was on tape delay. Right, that's crazy. It wasn't aired live, because it was that not popular. Wow, I didn't know that. It was really magical and bird where they really became like elite. So, yeah. So like, I don't know, like content, like, did you hear what Law said? She watched Hannah Montana. She watched her. That ass. She watched Miley if you're watching this. She watched Miley. Being a Nickelodeon show and it changed her life. Like, we may say, like, listen, every time we make a piece of content, this included, I'm hoping one of the four of us says something for not PCX on Twitch or WON Gibberish or Bless Downstairs or the millions that will listen over the next three years of this podcast. I'm hoping we say one thing. Right. And by the way, entertainment, which is what you do, that's escapism. What is movies and music and sports? It's letting us deal with the fucking hardships of the world. Like, everything is, I could be super stressed and I have a lot going on in my life, but it's Sunday at 4.25 PM this Sunday. I don't care about anything, but beat the fucking Buffalo Bills. They've been struggling lately, so. You know what I mean? Yeah, man. I trust you. That's so different though. I've never had such an exception. What do you think? I would say complete and curious. Complete and curious. Complete. Do you feel complete? I feel the most complete in my life that I have. I know that I'm not complete. Let me ask you a different question. Yes, I love that. What about content? Cause I'm curious how you define complete versus content. Cause I see people think content bad and I think content greatest state of humanity. Yeah. When you're content but hungry, like that's how I feel. That's why I jumped on that. Yeah, I mean I'm very. I'm good at all moments. I've been good, cause I also got raised right before I even started, which is why I think everything's happening. I don't need another good thing to happen. You're sad. I'm good, but I want to fucking tear it all down. Yeah, I'm a slave for sure. So I would say like content to me. Is complacent? A little bit. Yeah, this is why I'm fascinated by this word. This is why I'm playing with this right now. Because my baseline is like, I'm grateful. I feel like I can make the best of any situation. But I feel like for so long in my life, I was doing things probably for other people. Now I said, fuck it, I'm doing things for myself, building things, but I'm also curious in trying new things. Like, you know, I'm in the gaming space, I'm doing Twitch, I'm trying. And these are things I never would have done. Liz for short, I'm not trying to change his word. I actually, Liz for short said Gary out here trying to change his word. I'm not actually, I'm like so fascinated by his word. And sometimes in my excitement of fascination, I'll jump in and I get why you felt that. And I understand that. No, it's actually, I'm like so impressed by that word. And I'm also fascinated by content. And then he followed it up with the word that I think we're both foundationally grounded in, which is gratitude. When you're actually grateful, it's a wrap. Like it's a wrap. It's why gratitude, by the way, what I'm setting up here is what I've been trying to figure out, like listening to y'all, my big thing with VFRIENDS when I start doing animation and books and like build this out is it's actually never one thing. It's gratitude and curiosity. Like I think people are trying to solve things with one thing. Yeah. And when I'm looking at it, right? These are ingredients. This is why VFRIENDS, the way they're gonna solve shit is more like I need three of them to save the day. Gratitude, gorilla and curious crane need to go to him and be like, no, you got this. And I don't think anyone in earth is talking about gratitude and curiosity together in an intense way to solve the anxiety and unhappiness and worry that everyone's laying at home with. And I think we're trying to solve with one trait when it's a mix of three. Yeah. I agree. I agree. And just being curious, I feel secure to a point now where I can go and if I make a mistake or something doesn't, you know, it flops. It's like, all right, fuck it. Like I'm dead. Like that. I feel like that. It's worth the try. When you get beyond that point, I feel like that is a very critical point of almost any career. It's that point. Like, because to go back to that fear thing there are so many people afraid to do something and it doesn't blow up and you're not famous right away and you don't get the views. But I hit a moment like a couple of years ago that was very, it was the very corny. Like there's no such thing as failure. It was just like learning a lot. Like one minute, man, we started in 2017 and it worked and it was doing well. And then Facebook changed their algorithm. The views plummeted. It kind of fell off. And I was like, all right, like I failed. That sucks. And then the pandemic hits Instagram's doing some shit with their user generated content. And all of a sudden it comes, you know, back. And it was like our guys email being like, we need short form video that's topical. And I was like, I can do this. I've already done this. And when I thought it was a failure, I like slid it back in and then this time it grows. And I was like, oh wow, that was not, in the moment I thought it was a failure. And then three, four, five years later, I realized, oh no, no, no, it was just, it wasn't the right time. It wasn't the right situation. And now it is. So then I was like, how many other things am I right now failing at that? And I'm like, oh, I gotta wait til I'm, you know, 40, 42, 46, 40, and then those things become. Let's talk about that. This, the world, and I'd love to get all three of your perspective, the world is so absolute. Even think about this conversation, winning, failing, working, not working. Going back to a little bit what you touched on, brother, like for me, and I'm curious, you know, you're so rolling your career, like things are gonna happen for you. Knowing your ambition, if Hannah Montana is that North Star, like you're trying to be as famous as you possibly can. And so I think about a couple things that I'd love to get all three of your reactions to. My big thing is even the frameworks of winning and losing, it's why I love process. My great dream is that the world redefines success. So like to me, the reason that was really interesting for me, KFC, is that to me, if I'm just doing what I want to be doing, of course I want it to do well. But I'm just like secretly, and this is maybe the Jets fandom in me, real talk, secretly, and I'm curious, because now all three of you have had, all three of you have had more wins in the way the world defines it, than the average of eight billion people on earth. So I'm actually really curious where all three can take this. For me, if people fall in love with the process, like actually, and I don't know, I feel like I'm in some weird next level of this video game, where I almost like when it's not working more. Yeah, like a new version of the process. Like the very reason you fucked me up, because now I've gotten to a place that I don't like as much as I did 10 years ago, where people actually do think it's gonna work. Like secretly, I like where V-Friends is right now, because I don't think people really, I can't wait for, I'm enjoying, I want to be underrated at all times, and the more success you pile on, it gets harder. It's harder to be underrated. When I was at my dad's liquor store at 32, at 32, and my friends from high school and college came to buy wine and liquor, and I would bring them up at the register, and bring the case of wine to their BMW, because they worked in Wall Street, and they would drive off, and I was working in my dad's store at, how old are you? 38. Beautiful, like 35, 38 ladies we don't have, but like, I just want you to hear this, at 34 years old, I worked in a liquor store. Yeah, that's crazy. And people walking in, and like, I saw what they looked at, I know what judgment looks like. Yeah, yeah, facts. Well, you also had a big blow up too. It's easy to pick it up. But you know what, when you have the glow up in your head, that you've already been glowing, because you're just in your zone, regardless if you get to the place you got to or not. I wish people knew how happy I was then. In that moment. I feel like people can feel that though. Like if you, you know, like how you carry yourself and what you exude, like that, it shines through for sure. But maybe they were just too blind to see it, or they're focused on so many different things. Well, they also, their definition is different than your definition. That, this is the whole point. Can we, like to me, law one. And I don't believe, I mean it, law. And I don't think- Ladies always win. And I don't- We're getting the, the brand? We're getting the point here. We're getting the point here. I've done a point here. Of course, I learned this. I'm gonna agree. No, listen, this is real talk. Like. But winning's not an event though. I feel like that's kind of why, like that's why I put it in my brand, is that I don't think winning is like, at the end of a day or at the end of like a game, like you won this or you lost this, winning is like a lifestyle, and it's just something that like, you do in your day to day. I feel like it's- But can you live it? Yeah, because it's not- So here's the question, professionally, or like what, what today, actually paint a picture for the audience, because I wanted to get to know, where do you think you are in your career? Like, like, the way we all define it. You know what's ironic? Like, I'm on the come up, I got a coastline from this, I had a flop, I have a song coming out tomorrow that's gonna, like, where are you in your career for all of the audience? I'm gonna be real chuned. Yes, ma'am. I thought I was at a certain point, and I feel like I think I'm at a point right now where people like know who I am, you know, I had a pretty viral moment, right? I held the- Because I'm telling you, this is the big thing, like all of you got things, but like my audience comes from so, like there's a lot of different, and I want them to hear it, and this is for y'all. So what was your viral moment? My first, I had a couple of viral moments. So I first went viral in 2021 for doing a loyalty test, the most random thing on earth. My friend's boyfriend was cheating on her, I made a TikTok and went viral. I became very known for doing this, but obviously I was doing music. So then when I did that, I had a first song that came out, my first song ever that came out, it started doing well. I made a different TikTok account that was strictly for music, and then I posted my song, Why Me, it has like five million streams, everybody's like, you know, whatever, it's having its moment. Yeah, yeah. That's real. Yeah, so I think I kind of like lost where I was going with that. Where you were. So I think people know, they know who I am. I think that I would go live on TikTok and people would be like, oh, you're the girl that made that Why Me song. And I was like, oh, so like there's people who know this song, who don't know of me. But then I was at Shopperate yesterday and then Rich had texted me and was like, hey, like are you mad casual? He was just like, like, hey, are you like free tomorrow? I think that you're gonna be like on the Gary Vee podcast. And I was like, I feel like you're asking me this a little bit too casual for this to happen. And then like once I got the Gris, the whole night I was thinking, you know, I feel as though I'm like, I'm like cool, right? People know me, but I'm not like these people, right? I was like looking at all you guys and I'm like, how did I get here? Like how am I sitting at this table with these people that are like so much more qualified than me and like so much more this. So I don't know where I'm at. I don't, this kind of fucked me up. Cause I'm like, I could maybe a minute of different. I don't know how people view me at this point. I'm just, I'm not, I'm not a police. I want to keep going. I don't even like a world like qualified now. I don't even know what the fuck that means anymore. Like it used like certain industries and jobs, like a lawyer, a doctor, you had to like literally get a qualification. Now it's like- Broadcasting, you don't need to go to fucking Fordham or Syracuse to Prush. Fuck you now man. I got like NBA. What is it? Who the hell the fuck is in the window? You know, like what do you do? Like what's your title? Like now- Everybody's a renaissance man and woman. I love- But also it can be like, I'm 18 years old and I made the right video and then I popped off and that's how I have my fans. Or I'm 50 and I grinded for 25 years and then I had my moment. But it's like, I don't know if you can fill a room selling tickets or get your streams on your music or get people to watch your film, whatever it is. It's like, then that's, I'm qualified. You know what I mean? There's no- Well here's why. The internet decentralized everything. Right. The great equalizer. Qualified used to be systems. Now qualifies the world. Let me give you a little history lesson on my business career. When I started doing public speaking and was cursing and not wearing a suit, everyone told me, you'll never be a big speaker. Right. Right. And I was like, I'm not capable of doing anything- Fuck you. You know what I'm saying? By the way, in real talk, it wasn't like fuck you. It was definitely confidence. I was like, I don't think so. But it was like, if I don't, that's okay. Cause I don't even like talking that way. Like I won't, I won't like, this goes back to process. Redefining success. I wasn't gonna define my success based on my speaking fee or how many people went to my talks. I was gonna define it based on, not not even selling out. I didn't view it as selling out. I didn't view me wearing a suit and not cursing as selling out. It wasn't that cool. It was, I'm not capable of enjoying it. Yeah. Right. This, this is my report card. Right? Okay. I'm not a dummy. Oh, it's your little report card? It's my little. Oh wow. You got an F in German? Twice. Why would I fucking take a German in the first place? I thought it was close to Russian. I fucked up. What is German in? That is real talk. I was in German. I went to high school. They're like, the language. They're like, German's probably close to Russian. I'll crush it. F, freshman year, F, sophomore year. Look, junior year. I had to take Spanish one. I'm a junior in Spanish one. There's like a fourth graders in there. I'm like, yeah, that's good. This was awful. What? Junior year, I fucked up heavy. Oh, how did you pass? They just pushed my ass through. Look at my class. I don't want to see you anymore. Tell them my class rank. 243 out of, out of. It's right there, right next to it. Please don't say 250. 254? Well. Look what I got. Tell them what I got in speech. Back to how school doesn't map real life. Yeah, no. In speech class, giving speeches. Where the hell is speech? I think it was sophomore year, maybe 10th grade. I got an F in reading, I guess. Oh, speech, D. D isn't dull. Bro, I got a D in speech. Everybody got an A in that class. All you had to do was write a speech, go from the class and give the speech and you got an A. I somehow got a D. I somehow got a D. You got an A in June class, baby. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. By the way, that's all four years. Please tell them the only A's I got in high school. Start with ninth grade, KFC. Ninth grade, I got an A in phys-ed. 10th grade? 10th grade, you got an A in phys-ed. There it is. These are the only A's I got. 11th grade? Phys-ed, senior year, phys-ed. You got two, you got two, health class. You got an A in health. Friends, I was what they called a gym class hero. Yeah. I wasn't good enough to. I cropped. All I could choose was music. Guys, if high school gym was actual sports, I'm a first ballot hall of it. What's your favorite gym class game ever? Floor hockey. Floor hockey. Do we use to curve the shit out of those, curve the fuck out of the stick? To the point where it was like a whole. Oh yeah. It was a high light. I was the judge for that. I was the judge for that frustration. Nobody in the history of gym tried harder than me. Did you play map ball? Did you do map ball? Yeah, map ball. Map ball is so fun. Map ball is either like a. Yeah, map ball is the best. It's like a regional thing though. A lot of people don't even know map ball. It just kicked me in the mat. But it was so great. You gotta run around twice. Map ball is great. You're playing dodge ball kind of. We played pickle ball in high school. Pickle ball's happening. It's a big moment now. When I was in high school. I went to my gym place. My gym teachers, we had rankings on the wall. Gym teachers were playing kids. That was more hockey for us. Pickle ball was. What about the mushroom? They were. The mushroom was. Alright, let's get back to track. Let's get back to track. Let's get back to track. Here we go. Ready? To help the audience. You guys are running in circles of people that are trying to achieve in different genres. Let's talk about, we've talked a little bit about ourselves. Let's talk about perspectives. If I asked you, because I want to help a lot of the kids that are listening and really the parents. Everybody is now going to be famous to 15 people. Like the wall changed. Every 15 year old is trying to be on this podcast. You know what I mean? It's over. The cat's out of the bag. Nobody's behind the scenes. My D-Rock was not like, nobody's fucking behind the scenes. Dustin's fucking super cool. Alright, here we go. For everybody who's listening. Freak it, she's shouting. For everybody who's listening. Even Dustin's cool. For everyone who's listening. What is the comment? This is going to really be fun. We'll go in reverse order. I'll give you a little time to think. Thanks, Gary. Reality, TV, sports, Hollywood now land. You've been playing in a bunch of lands in your young life. What's the cliche, very common mistake? You see of your contemporaries, the people you look up to, the people that are on the come up, the people that are in the trenches with you at these parties, at these meetings, at these events. What's the cliche mistake that you think that your contemporary's friends, acquaintances, are making that's leading them to not be as happy as they can be? I feel like they're doing what everyone else is doing. Or just trying to... School, right? Meaning like, because everyone's doing this? Or they're looking for the answers. I was actually thinking about this the other day. Because especially in the last few years, especially since reality television, I really pivoted because I didn't want to be in a box that everyone else in that world is. I kind of went against the grain, but I feel like it's safe to be with a crowd. And I feel like we gravitate towards that because we want to have people around us. But... Is it that we want people around us, or is that we don't want to stand out to be different to deal with the ramifications of not being, or more importantly, the ramifications of being seen? Yeah, I think people are afraid to be seen, judged. And when you're out there, again, I say the greatest thing for me that happened is I was judged my whole life. And once I finally got hired. It was easier for you. You were built for it. Yeah, you were prepped for it. By the time you went into reality TV world, between sports and between being the only black kid in South Dakota at school your whole life, you were used to being judged. Yeah, I'm like, this was an experience, but I was like, I'm not cut from that cloth. That's not my world. But now I'm building everything I've ever wanted to. And I'm doing this without as much guidance as you would think, but I am certain that I'm gonna get there. And I've got amazing people around me who I trust through the moon. And they're leaders in the industry. So I know. Do you feel like back to being complete, back to the conversation we're having, do you feel like even if everything you try to make in film storytelling shows does not have commercial success that you'll deem it a win or you're not completely sure? I, without question, it's a win. Yeah, you're in the process. I love it. I'm gonna skip for a second. I apologize, but I fucking want that for everyone. It makes me so happy for you, you can't imagine. Yeah, this is the exact. Kasey, you're world. You've been in the modern media world at the highest levels. So there's been all the other things that have come up that have looked the part of y'all and different genres. You've been in a lot of events. Like what are you seeing? I think it's almost, there's no correct answer, but I would say. No, there's no correct. But I think there almost is, man, in the sense of comparison, dude. Comparison, yeah. Is that the if a joy is the line, right? Like to me. Very true. I watched it. I did it myself because it was like, I gotta make my blog this good and I did that. And then I added a podcast and I gotta make my podcast that good and then I gotta make my video series that good. And every time I, like if you were to tell me, five years ago, you were gonna have, your podcast was gonna be this successful. I would be like, oh, I would have, I would be putting my feet up being like, I'm done. I did it. I'm chilling. Like I'm that successful. That's all I ever wanted. And it's like that goal, in a good way, it's good to be driven, but also it's like you're just constantly comparing to who's next and what's next. And the amount of people I think, especially, at Barstow, it's like, you're next to Dave Portnoy. Pardon my take, Alex Cooper. People who are like, you can't reach their level if you were to fucking hit the lottery tomorrow. You know what I mean? It's like, so you still- Or you might. You might, but I'm saying- But this is like- But you're just in there comparing yourself to them is not gonna get you anywhere. And why didn't you compare yourself to them long before they were them? See, this is what I'm trying to tell all my friends. They're like, fuck it, you wanna compare? Why don't you compare yourself? Do you know, I mean, I did it already in this show. Do you know how many times I fucking pound I worked in a fucking liquor store at 34? Cause all these fucking 27 year olds are like, why am I not a fucking Trillionaire? I'm like, cause you're fucking 27. Right. And they just sick, they get so down. You have to play this fucking game. Like the amount of people, do the amount of people who come through Barstow, email, come through, call in, and they say like, I've got what it takes. I wanna do it. I'm gonna work so hard at it. I wanna be like you. And we're like, cool, do it. Write a blog, start a podcast. They give up in a fucking two days, dude. Like two days, I'm like, do this for four years straight with no feedback, no money, no nothing. And then we can start talking. And it's like, I wanna be famous. They compare that. I wanna live a 1% life. I'm like, eat shit for a decade. And they're like, what? I'm like, you wanna live a 1% life. You have to like it. Like when I, I'm trying to help people now at Barstow, I'm more like produce. And it's like, if it doesn't make money right away, get followers right away, get views right away. Like when I was starting the podcast, I never looked at, I still don't look at the downloads. I never looked at the page views. I never looked at, it was just cause I liked doing it. Real quick, we're gonna interject for a second. Big shout out to MJS3169 who says that crooked picture frame is making me lose my mind. All the over, what is that? Oh, read that, read it KFC. Read what that frame says. I wanna say thank you. Uber. I'm gonna do the microphone. There you go. This is from James at Uber. Hey AJ, I wanted to say thank you for being our first ever Uber rider in New York. How was your experience? One more time, let's start up from the top. James at Uber to AJ Maryshuk. Hey AJ, I wanted to say thanks for being our first ever Uber driver in New York. How was your experience? Period, let's stop. Crazy. Talk about making tons of mistakes in one, in a career. Travis, CEO of Uber is in my office in New York, early days of Vayner, we're early investors in Uber. He's like, hey, we're about to open to New York. Do you wanna go downstairs and do the first test run? I'm like, I'm busy, I'm in this meeting. I'm like, I said AJ, do me a favor, go take this Uber. So I said my brother. Take the first Uber ride ever. Do you guys understand? How often I would tell this fucking story? My brother AJ took the first Uber in New York City. Do you know the fucking fun fact that is? Do you know what it's like having a meeting or something, people are like, hey, what's a fun fact? You're like, yeah, I took the first Uber in New York. What the fuck outta here, that's so epic. It was a base fare of seven bucks, distance was $6.76. What day was that email sent? April 8th, 2011. Wow. This goes back to the theme of everything. Shit takes a long time. Shit takes a long time. Like I understand, like you know what I mean? Like shit takes a long time. All right, let's all open a pack. Yeah, why did you have me open? Yeah, I had you do open a mini. These are in vending machines. I just wanted to see if you liked it. I don't know these things when you're little, like for 50 cents. It's okay, I got that. It's just, it's so, he's freaking me out a little bit. I'm not gonna lie. Yeah, the comparison thing is so real, brother. Bro, you know, I've been saying like, I used the analogy I've been using is a swimming pool. Feel like people wanna get a swimming pool. Like they want a swimming pool, right? Oh, this is for you. They think it's a. Oh, this is for you. Curious? Yeah. Curious crane. Hell yeah. Like trading cards. And then you get your swimming pool and you never fucking swim in your swimming pool. You know what I mean? Like you think I wanna buy this house. I just, I just, and it's like getting the pool. You wanted the pool and now you got it. You're not swimming in the pool. Everybody wants a big house so they don't use 85% of the rooms. Totally, totally. Thanks. And then, yeah. What's your favorite one of the bunch? Uh, hot shit hornet. Bro, I can't remember. I don't even know. I don't even know. Did you come up with all of these? I just, I drew every one of them. See that Jacko there? Did you come up with the names? Everything. I've printed this whole world. What is this alien one? Adaptable alien. Oh, impeccable. I know. Instranate. Instranate. That's Russian for alien. Got it. I was gonna say this is not a real animal. I know that much. No, it's an alien. I can't believe that. How many, how many like, 280, there's 280 v-friends. So I, Did you come up with all of them? Yep. Yep. I always was, I was super affected by like He-Man Transformers. I'm 48 so I grew up in the 80s when like all that shit, Care Bears, like all that shit that rebooted for all of you, I was there when it actually first popped off. You know, and so, yeah, it's pretty cool. And something I've always really, really, really wanted to do. I wanted to buy an old brand. So like for the last 15 years, I thought I was gonna buy Scooby-Doo or buy the Smurfs, buy the IP and then refurbish it. But then when I saw the blockchain NFT thing, I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna do the shit myself. Why don't you do both? I may. Cause I think there's a smash hit there. If you bring back. Listen, if I, if I over the next 30 years build v-friends the way I hope to, then I become like a Disney, built and then they bought Lucas. They bought Marvel. So look, I'm 48 in 20 years. If I do this proper and I'm 68 and this brand's really established, building an IP holding company and going out and buying, you know, and Nickelodeon IP or Scooby-Doo will be really cool. But right now I've literally so much work to do to build this up, you know? But I really believe in it. Like if you look at like back to like kind of the theme of this and like the theme of my life and then why I built this characters and why this podcast, I think will work is like these themes of these characters or what we're talking about. It's real life. And for me, if I can teach people at five, six, seven, eight like accountable aunt, actually let's talk about this. Let me talk about accountable aunt. Accountable aunt is like a character I'm like really hot on because I think what's fucked up with the world right now is lack of accountability. It's everybody else's fault. It's the government's fault. It's finance fault. It's trust fault. It's your mom's fault. It's your dad's fault. It's this company's fault. It's social media's fault. It's Kanye's fault. It's everyone's fucking fault. By yourself. So right, I'm real curious. What's your relationship with accountability? Be as honest, self aware, humble, but speak your truth. Like where do you think you are on your journey on accountability? I actually find music artists incredibly bad at accountability. It's everyone's fault, but their music is the problem. And what it's always your music's the problem. The answer that I was gonna give to the first question, right, that I see people in music do wrong, is I think that they put too much emphasis and they expect their success to come through someone else. So they expect like a manager. Right, the manager's gonna do it. Yeah, the label's gonna do it. Yeah, they don't actually. TikTok's gonna put me on. Yeah, they don't realize like you have to do. Drake's gonna give me a co-sign. It's his fault for not fucking with me. Literally, yeah. So I would say that I agree with that. I think accountability oddly for me, I think that's like a superpower of mine. Like when I was a kid, I used to tell on myself. So if I did anything wrong. You own shit. Yeah, like if I broke something, my brother was older than me. He'd be devising a plan. Here's a big one for everyone on Twitch. Big shout out to everybody. Then Gents, what's good, Magisticle? Accountability, but not going too far where you beat yourself up. Are you hard on yourself? Or have you found the balance of accountability? Because to me, it's completely not accountable. Everyone's fault. The beauty, the middle, accountability. And then the place that I get scared of when people start shitting on themselves and beating themselves up. And that's not accountability. That's not a good relationship with yourself. Yeah, I think that, I don't know, I always took a lot of accountability when I was growing up. So I look at situations, if I'm upset about something or at somebody else, my kind of framework that I worked through was like, what did I do in this situation? Like what is my participation? So you feel like you're in a good place with it? Yeah, I can really do that. I feel like to throw around a buzzword, I got that imposter syndrome big time. Yeah, where I feel like I'm hyper self-aware to the point that I'm always downplaying. And you know imposter syndrome is the new slang for insecurity, right? Okay, I just want to make sure everyone out there, I realize that's it. Yeah, let's nail that down once and for all. We've cutened up this word. It's insecurity, which is the biggest answer. It's okay, but they're all insecure. There is every level of like, when I'm doing this, some of the very great opportunities, some of the people I've talked to, I'm like, I didn't even really try to do this, plan to do this. I am really just a regular ass dude. And the beauty of the world is like that's, people like me get to do that now. But I still think as a society, that's still a relatively new thing. It is. You used to have to be trained or famous or look a certain way or act a certain way. That first book in the corner there, I wrote in 2009, Crush It. When I wrote that and said this was gonna happen, I got shit on it. Right, no, you gotta be somebody, right? But I knew YouTube and Twitter were gonna be the foundation. We're gonna make the normal people. So yeah, so I feel like I'm one of those first ones where I'm like, but so I'm constantly like, I don't know, man, I don't have the answers. I don't know the plan. I'm just fucking regular. Yeah, but don't do you feel fine. Well listen, first of all, back to me being a fan of yours, you know what you talk about. Like you know your craft of space. I don't ever, yeah, I stay in my zone. Because I'm like then, yeah, I know what I know. Yeah, you know what you know. Like you're likable. And I know what I don't know. You're likable because you have that relationship with yourself. I actually, I don't think people think I'm likable. I think I don't believe that at all. I understand where you're going because you play sports. Like people, Chris Russo is incredibly likable and infuriated. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you've got a little bit of that in you. Right, for sure, for sure. Because that's your, not your shtick, it's your communication style in that format. I love what you said. I'm a communicator, me too. But I'm a different communicator to my best friend and my family. And my name is Gary V. That I'm his Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO. When you're watching a chess game. Even the CEO of Gary Vaynerchuk, for V friends is a different communicator than Gary Vaynerchuk, the CEO of VaynerX. Like there's different versions of it. I think the genre you're in is like, yes, do I think people like that? Polarizing. But sports talk is polarizing. Yes. I think as long as you're genuine and real about it. I think you, the human, is like, yes. Yes, I would agree with that. Accountability is something I don't shy away from. If anything, I look forward to it. Do you think you overextend at times and try to take it on when it's not even yours? I think, I don't beat myself up over it because if my integrity is right then. If you're good with you, then you're good. Yeah, because I know I make the right prudent choice. But I do probably try to cover up for other people's mistakes too many times. Super hero type. If I could just shout out P-P-W-V-H-L-N that said nice things about me. Benz. Regular ass dude who works hard. No, no, no, Benz. But the next one I blow. I'm shouting at Benz 11. KFC not likeable. Fuck you. Benz 1173. KFC not likeable. I like that guy. All right, final part of the show. Question time. This is your time to go selfish. Okay. Like really, I got a lot of love for you all. Obviously I know you all from afar in different ways, a little bit closer to KFC than YouTube. But we're really excited here in my world. I'm in this great place where I'm obsessed with putting people on. I've always been that guy. That's why I've always talked about the people behind my scenes. The first wine show I did. Eric Castner and then Chris Mott. M-O-T-T was my camera guy. It was so basic. No lighting, no audio, no nothing. And they used to be like Mott, link it up. People thought, I was saying ma. People are like, it's so in the comments. You're ma. You're ma. It's so cool, you're ma. You're like no, no, Mott. But like DRock, obviously I don't have to tell that story. A lot of people know it. I love putting people on. And so I really hope VaynerNation, please make sure you dig into all of the, obviously in our social content, we'll link all these three amazing people up, get to know them, get on their journey. But back to wrapping it up in the format I wanna do on this show, any question I can answer about any single thing could be fun, it could be detail, it could be about your career, it could be a funny thing. Like what do you got? What are you thinking about? That might be something I might be able to help with. I would say, so I feel like you or somebody, like in life and in the specter of people on the internet, that I feel like you did a lot of things that have never been done before. Meaning like you didn't have an example, you didn't have a comment about it. This is why I like him, because I think he touched on it. I think he's done similar stuff. I've done a lot of it for a long time. So I understand it and I appreciate that, I do like that, so go ahead. Yeah, so what would you say like the most valuable thing that you did in that journey is and why? Like that got you there, that you think is valuable. Not like the numbers or like- I think the number one word that I'm obsessed with, that none of you fuck with is maybe. I just heard something about that. So that's really funny. Like just maybe? No, no, like the word maybe, like maybe it'll also work out. Maybe, oh, okay. My word in life is maybe and y'all's word is yes or no, predominantly no. Like I saw Casey Neistat and all those early vloggers who would do the camera by themselves. I was like, I wanna do that shit, but I don't know how to do that shit. So like maybe I'll have a guy follow me 24 seven. I wasn't unaware that everyone was gonna immediately think I'm the douchiest person on human earth because unlike a TV production following a reality star, which we finally accepted 10 years in, I was doing it as like a regular dude. Yeah, right. And so like I was like- Why the fuck is this guy having- Yeah, I mean like literally my first meeting at Barstool with Erica, like a man walked in and was filming, she's like, what are you doing? I'm like, I film everything. She's like, what the fuck are you talking about? I'm like, I film everything. This is how I vlog. But now it is like standard. Yeah, that's the norm. Like even David Rock, D Rock, big shout out to D Rock who's now going on to build in his universe was with me for a decade. That became the term that people called people that filmed people. I need a D Rock. D Rock, yeah. Oh wow. Like it became that crazy. So I'm always about maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe I should buy a house on Mars. Maybe I should. Like- So you just go 100% out of maybe. AI right now, it was like, oh, that's just gonna fuck us up the robots, gonna kill us, I fuck that shit, I'm gonna make music. I'm like, no, no, maybe. Because what maybe does back to Curious Crane is maybe makes you work. The reason people say no is if you say no, you don't have to put it in the word. Now I got you, motherfuckers. Now you heard. No's easy. Because no allows you not to do. All of you know, I know this one's gonna land for all of you. All of you heard me in 2017, 18 saying tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. And all of you said girls that dance, nobody gives a fuck. Musically, musically, musically. That's right, that was the same music. And then all, you know, so like, you know, for me, it's maybe and I hope everybody gets inspired. I wish I made a maybe character. I might make, I do think long term, there will be new fee friends. I've got so many, I don't need to do it. But a maybe, maybe magpie. You know what a magpie is? It's a bird, it's fucking fresh. We have a magpie. Anyway, KC questions. These are real animals? Yeah. Open up a pack. Open up a pack. We have a, oh, nobody's, nobody's open a good one. Let's get a rare one. KC ask him, you can do two things at once. Yeah. Oh, I got a shiny one. What do we got here? I got insightful Irish Terrier. You like Irish letters? Oh, a hit, a rare. Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah. Got a 500. I guess I'm at a spot with Barstool. You know, it's a very interesting spot of like, it's been a very tumultuous ride the last year. We're kind of in like a transitional thing. Like, sold back back. Yeah, yeah. And it's like, we were gambling, but I didn't gamble. Now gambling's out of the picture. Yeah. Sometimes I feel like I'm like, it might not, I've been there for 15 years, almost 15 years, right? But I'm like, and part of me, the way this is set up right now is kind of like, we can just do this forever. And you're worried about complacency? Kind of. Yeah, it's really good. Like, should I be like, I'm gonna go do my version of Port Noise thing. Like, thank you. Take the equity. Yeah. Great time. Yeah. Fuck it, I'm out. Why wouldn't you? I don't know. Is it loyalty, is it fear? Yeah, big ball that. Loyalty, fear. It's goes back. It's easy. Like the first 15 years were hard. And it's very strange. Right, it's like, I ate all the shit to get here. Yeah, now I'm gonna do it again. And it's like, and I'm not very like money driven. Like I got this money recently. I was very blessed to have. And like, my life has not changed much one way or the other. So I'm like, it's not really about more money. Can I tell you something really good here? I like this one. The answer is, and this is a weird one. It doesn't matter until the day these feelings hit a tipping point in either direction. Right, and then you know, right? It just happens, yeah. Too many people get caught up in the ideology of the process versus the actuality of the process. Do you know what was bad at school? Cause it wasn't real to life. And at 10 years old, I'm like, this isn't real. Now I have no idea how the fuck that happened. No, really, I mean, I really don't know, but I'm telling you real talk to the U3 and everyone listening, I just know. And I was like, if that's true, and I fully believe it, not on some, I was getting good grades at that point. I was just like, this isn't real. And so like you, in your own mind, it's actually not real until it's so in your stomach that you have to do one or the other. Yeah. So I'll just hit that breaking point or that fork in the road. I think people would rather think about everything versus wait for the tipping point. Yeah, so it's just a waiting game. Yeah, and then watch this. So now instead of stressing it of what you should do or what am I feeling or all these profound fucking games we play with each other, how about you just enjoy the living shit out of it and if you just wake up at six o'clock in the morning one day and be like, I'm done, then you're done. We need to take weight off our shoulders. Bro. Tell me how to do it. How do you do it? The way to do it is to start to take out the noise from the world. The world is making everything complicated. There's a lot of great that's happened. Us jokers can have platforms. We could be live on Twitch and hang out with like all these cool people, Ben's 11, 73. You know, like you could do all this. I like Ben's because he razzed you. But I think we just need to simplify. Right. I got good news for you. Cause it's how it's going to happen regardless. Regardless of how many sleepless nights or debates or talking with mentors you have. One day you're going to wake up and it's there or one day you won't. The reason you're not gone yet is it hasn't happened. So why not instead of that and like stressing it, why not just enjoy it? Swim in the pool. Swim in the pool. And then if you fucking want to sell the house with the pool, sell the fucking house with the pool. You got it? Cool. I think for me the biggest thing right now is kind of patience. I'm working on some big projects that are long builds with the strike with the economy, but three big docu series. And I see them so clearly that like this is my calling. These are going to happen. I know that. Good for you. But that process of just patience, especially when there's so many other things I can't control and I like to execute quick. It's like, you know, I just curious like how you practice patience. Why the question becomes why? In a world where you're so good at managing judgment, I just worry that this is the blinds. In the same way that I didn't see that candor was fucking me up because I always wanted to keep it positive. I wasn't able to tell people shit that was fucked up and that actually led to the fucked up. I didn't see it. For you, you might not see the place where judgment does matter, right? Because for me, like why would you be impatient? Like play it, here, play checkers with me on this. Okay. It might even be chess, cause it's fun. Okay, you got these longer projects, right? Like I get instant gratification, I get speed of the world, but like if you're so pumped that this is the thing you're doing and it sounds like you are. Yeah. Like what's the prob? Well, I guess it's probably more just anxious because I want this to happen and I believe in it, but. And you're not in control of it happening. Somebody has to buy it. It's a control thing. Netflix may not buy it, Hoola may not buy it, right? Yeah, and we're Q1, Q2, we're like pitching these. But you're smart enough to know and educated enough to know that it may not. Exactly. The question that comes for you specifically is do you want it because it becomes something you can point to that starts to move you away from something that you don't want to define you? I think there's, I'm not doing it because I don't want to be defined in that way. Great, beautiful. Then it really just becomes like what? Like there's a million scenarios. I'd love it to be commercially successful so I can get money to do X. Yeah. I'm so damn curious if I'm good at it. I'd actually like it to come out to see if it fails or flops just to win or lose. There's a million things that it could be. Yeah, for me, I believe in the stories and I just, like I think they need to be told. Well, then that gets weird because if you believe in the stories and they need to be told, you wouldn't be doing it this way because you don't have as much control this way than you do in the modern media world. You want to each put out yourself, sorry, not that I'm gonna miss. That's exactly where I'm going. Well, I mean, I have full creative direction and control on these projects. But you're putting that format potentially on a pedestal because if you really care about these stories need to be told then there's a very different way about going about it. What's the best way? Social and long form video. Like you could do it constantly at scale until it finally got told. You could literally tell the same story, 8,700 different ways on YouTube and social until it was finally told. Yeah, yeah. Where nobody controls your distribution. But this distribution has a different level of pedestal. But that's not the purity of wanting the story told. You want the story told in a specific way. Well, what I, like these are projects that are, so ones were tracking special Olympics athletes building up to the world games. I'm a global ambassador for the organization. I'm a global ambassador as ID. I just feel people haven't told the truthful, like the real story. But you don't need to do that in a classic production lens. Unless, right? Unless you're using it as the bank. Which in that case you could have went to any brand at Proctor & Gamble or Comcast. These are like the fun, complicated, tough questions I always love to ask myself. Why, why, why, you know? Yeah, yeah. Because the why has the answer to the impatience. Yeah, and I'm going at it at every single angle. So like all those things, there's no, like that's unturned. Friends. Not me. Thank you. It was an honor. Thank you for being on our first show. Thank you for having us. This is, this is, We've done something similar to this in the past, as you know. But this is the name of it. This is the concept. I hope that you guys, I don't know the three of you, your relationships with each other, but I hope if you were strangers, then at least this starts your acquaintances. And I hope those acquaintances become friendships. And man, when friends become family, there's nothing fucking better on earth. So thanks for listening everybody. Twitch, thank you for being a part of this journey. You are part of this journey. Shout out to it. I've decided to use Twitch exclusively just. Even though I know I could stream this everywhere else. It's been a platform that I haven't leaned fully into. So I want to use it exclusive. So if everybody's listening to this podcast, if you want to catch the podcast while it's happening in the future, that will always be on Twitch. Download us at, might Gary Vee on Twitch as well? Beautiful, I keep it consistent. Don't you get sick of it ever? Never. I fucking love all of it. Like another platform next year, and next year, and next year. I can't wait to fucking crush the man-a-verse. I can't wait to die. Just so I don't have to lie, I can't wait to wake up tomorrow and there's a new app that's gonna be the Nick TikTok. It's called Ding Dong. And I'm like, guys, you gotta get a Ding Dong. If you're not, I'm fucking ding dong. I regret it. I fucking love it. Everybody, thank you for being on. Thank you for being here today. Thank you. Thank you. We'll see you next time.
