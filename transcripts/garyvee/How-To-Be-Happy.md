Happiness is a byproduct, not an actual destination. And so people have this misconception that they're going to find happiness like it's Europe. And then they're never going to move out. Happiness is a byproduct of certain behaviors. And you can set yourself up to win, and you can set yourself up to be happy. The sad thing is happiness is a learned skill, and a lot of our houses don't teach happiness. That was the situation I was in. And so I actually just started studying people that were happy, and I saw what the algorithm was. What did they do that's similar? And for me, I don't focus on happiness as much as harmony. I don't really believe in the word balance, because balance is a binary thing. It's like, ugh, it's a very tedious, like, ugh. Harmony is saying, my life has many components. I'm a woman. I'm a mom. I am sexual. I am spiritual. I am a business person. All of those limbs have to have tone. And that brings about harmony. That brings about satisfaction. If we only have one limb that is very buff, and the rest of us is atrophied, we have disharmony, and we have dissatisfaction. But there's no human school. And so that's what I'm looking at starting. I want to be able to teach people emotional and mindfulness skills so that they can gain tone in every area. From my standpoint, since Jule took it up here, I will take it into one very narrow place that I've been really trying to spend a lot of time on, and that's perspective. It's so interesting to me why I deem myself happy, because I just am so grateful. Things like the thing we got excited about of the data, the data behind being a human being is 400 trillion to one. When you just start there, and you realize, forget about the odds of beating homelessness, or being born in the communist country, just actually becoming a human. I always make a joke of your mom could have had another glass of wine, or your dad could have been late. And because of a trap, the odds are so insane. I'm just so grateful for what I have, versus what I don't have. And I think people just have all these admirations and envy, and all these hard, wiring things. To me, it's perspective. Just like, I just genuinely believe there's always somebody that has it worse, and the problem is, that's where I default in too mentally, and have practiced to put myself there, versus somebody's got it better.
