## Transcript
It's not about your first post. It's not about your third post. It's not about your 19th post. It's about posting every day until the content that works, works, and then you double down on it while still keeping a small percentage for creativity and exploratory and on and on and on and on. Me and Sid and Pablo were fucking on text last night at 11 o'clock at night debating Saudi Arabia this, Qatar this, non-users this, 36 to 64. Like it's a forever fucking game. I don't give a shit what your first post is. Your first post on social media could be this. Hi, I'm Karen. That's it. That's the fucking post. From Mike, my boss is forcing me to do a what not stream on Saturday. He says he'll fire me. Yeah. Any advice from Mike? Yes, Mike, let me give you personal advice. If you were watching yesterday, this is the Mike that's asking this question. I'm doing it this Saturday. Mike, you really made a fucking huge mistake. You will, no, no, you have to understand if you don't do it this Saturday, I'm gonna fire you. I'm doing it. No, because I'll be a hypocrite, all right? We'll do it. No, I understand. Sid, please send me the link Saturday. That's on you now. I will watch you. Good job, Mike. Mike, a couple things. For you, what's going on right now behind the scenes? Obviously something's not exactly the way you want it. You've got me, Sid's hanging over you. What's good is you need to, what I was just watching you while I was doing my show, you're better than you were six months ago where you would have been really stressed. It's very true. Right? You've gotten more comfortable. You've contextualized things. Even though I know you wanted everything on the switchboard to be perfect today, as soon as that one thing broke, you were like, fuck, right? And you did this and that, but you've kept your composure in a better way than you would have six months ago. I'm proud of you. Thank you, G. You're welcome. Now, you take that same growth and you bring it to what not on Saturday. You're right. And I mean this, Mike. I, Gary Vaynerchuk, will 100% fire you on Monday morning if you do not do a what not garage sale from your house on Saturday. I'm excited. That's gonna happen. I'm excited too. Because either I'm going to make an example of you that will help millions of people. I'll feel bad for you and I'll help you get another job, but I'll be able to use you as an example to help millions of people. Yeah. Right? Cause we'll clip it yesterday and then this clip and then I'll make another video and be like, he was fired. We'll show your desk. Right? Yeah. Or you are going to make $913 this Saturday selling shit you do not need. Mm-hmm. Shit that is collecting dust. Mm-hmm. Shit that you forgot about. Shit that you never used. And that's gonna be happy and you're gonna learn stuff through it. So my advice for you is to commit to it all day. My advice is for you to start going on what not tonight, tomorrow, and looking at how people do it differently than how we do it. Mm-hmm. Start finding your inventory tonight, looking around the house, gathering your stuff. What are you gonna talk about? And I'm telling you, you know I said it yesterday, the Andy Anderson to Zachary Zasloff DMing people. And then post it on your social, be like, and use me, be like, guys, fucking Gary's making it. Can you please tune in? So you just get a little bit of action. Yep. You know what I mean? For sure. And there you go. I appreciate you. You got it, bro. I am not a fan of judging people's moral compasses, unless they do something incredibly egregious. This is something where many people would judge. I struggle to judge. Do I think they should? No, I don't think anybody should do anything. Do I think that they're allowed, because they're a human being and trying to get out of debt? They're allowed. If something is legal by the country standards that you work in, that is a data point. Everybody here on this, everybody watching right now, has a different moral compass. I think first, it's hard. I love this idea of like, oh, like, I'll just do only fans or I'll represent only fans. Like, it's hard. Everything's hard. Everything's hard. So I personally think live social shopping, I'm not bullshitting. What Mike's gonna do this Saturday? I think everybody who's watching me on whatnot right now, who needs money, should do a virtual garage sale this Saturday. They should literally go live with four people. Remember, they can have 50 people if they text everybody the URL to their show. If they don't know how to set up a show, they can chat GPT it. How do I set up a show on whatnot to sell stuff around my house? Like, I'm done hearing excuses. Now that you've chat GPT and you have Google, you should never say, I don't know how. And they should work. And so anyway, I want everybody to do their first show on Saturday, three months to whatnot is flooded. Yeah, MJ designs, everything gets flooded. So if it's in three months, start now. And by the way, when it's flooded, whoever's best wins. There are people going viral today on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and they're super flooded. I started working for my family's roofing business six years ago, and we've had massive growth. Although almost all of our growth has been because of social media videos. Trying a new idea is still like pulling teeth with my dad who owns the business. I have a lot of resentment because I'm 37 now and I feel like I'm in too deep to start some immune. Should I cut and move on or just stay the path and hope one day he finally sees the value? Cut and move on. I lived this life. I left at 34. Now my dad let me do everything. The problem was he let me do everything and I built a huge business and he owned the business and I was getting paid nothing. So my resentment was slightly different. And hindsight, it was like, I'm so glad I did it. If he's resenting, he should move on. He's not in too deep. You're never in too deep. You're never in too deep on a job. You're never in too deep on a business partnership. You're never in too deep on a business idea. You're never in too deep on a relationship. I love when people are like, am I too deep? What's his name? James. James, you're 37 years old. If God willing, James dies at 87, which I would argue would be too young for someone who's 37 today, given modern medicine. He's living for another 50 years. I'm very upset about this in too deep thing. Everybody's like, I can't, yesterday that lady I got pissed at. If you notice her question, she's like, I'd be giving up everything I've done. She's only worked there for seven years. James, you're 37, you're not in too deep. I talk to, this is real by the way, I talk to like a family member, family member's friend, an 81 year old woman over the holidays. She divorced her husband of 60 years. This is real. She divorced her husband of 60 years and she was hyped about her life. And she didn't like, I won't go in deeper, but she didn't think she was in too deep to a 60 year old marriage being, she was actually 79, 58 years into a marriage at 69 years old. She didn't think she was so deep. She was now living her life. She was no longer in a suppressed marriage. She was seeing the world. She was seeing her side of the family. She was hanging with her kids. She didn't think she was too deep. The fuck is too deep? So many of you this morning are not jumping to your happiness because you think you're in too deep. I've worked at that company for 10 years. I'd be giving up everything that you've, I've put in. What are you talking about? You're miserable. I've been with, there's a 29 year old woman right now watching who's been dating the same guy for 11 years and she knows he's a fucking idiot. But she's been in it for 11 years. She's like, I'm 29. What am I gonna go fucking on Tinder now? Like, like I'm almost 30. Like, what am I gonna have to date? Like, if you're in too deep with something that's wrong, you need to get the fuck out. What are you doing? This is insanity what people do, Aaron. What are you gonna double down on what you know is fucked up? You know you hate your job. You know your idea is stupid. You know you're not happy in your relationship. And because you've done it wrong for seven years, you're now deciding that you're gonna do it forever. What the fuck are we talking about? So no, he's not in too deep. He's 37 years old. He may not want to be starting over, but do you think it was fun for me after spending 12 years, 100 hours a week, taking a local liquor store to the dot com leader in its industry, building a business from three to $60 million that I had to start this company in another company's conference room because I couldn't afford to pay rent? Do you think that was like fun? I give advice that I live. Yeah, that's fine. That's great. Say hello. It's not about your first post. It's not about your third post. It's not about your 19th post. It's about posting every day until the content that works works. And then you double down on it while still keeping a small percentage for creativity and exploratory and on and on and on and on means sit in Pablo or fucking on text last night at 11 o'clock at night debating Saudi Arabia this, Qatar this, non-users this 36 to 64. Like it's a forever fucking game. I was doing this, Pablo, how old are you? 23. I was fucking doing this when Pablo was three. Now I'm here with Pablo at 11 o'clock at night debating how to do it better. It's a forever fucking game. I don't give a shit what your first post is. Your first post on social media could be this. Hi, I'm Karen. That's it. That's the fucking post. That can be the post. By the way, that post will likely do way better than anything else you would do. I'm gonna say it again. That literally that post. Hi everybody, I'm Karen. I'm an artist and that post will likely get more views than everything else you would do. Hey everybody, I'm Gary Vee an I'm an entrepreneur. Clip that. I have a funny feeling it's gonna cry. In fact, here's why life is life. That might lead to everyone doing it like the all in chat, like the ALS chat, like the bucket, like that clip, which I'm gonna post tomorrow has a chance of creating an entire meme. It probably will. What do you tell people? That's people like me. You know, in my church, my family relationships, they still ask me, do you get off on Columbus Day? They still ask me, are you looking for a job? They still ask me kind of what I do. They'll kind of annoy me a bit. People ask me about this all. Why does it annoy you right? Let's go there actually. I guess A, maybe I feel a bit less than when they have their jobs at McKenzie, at Pfizer. Why are you putting their opinions above yours? I don't have a good answer for that. It just feels, you feel left out maybe? You wanna feel normal? I've watched your journey for 15 years. You and I grew up in that early Twitter. That's right. You're right together. I, you know, it blows my mind that you would feel this way. I hate that for you. It's, what's good about you is like, it's not destroying you. Not at all. You have what I would call micro insecurities. You know, micro insecurities. Got it, my brother? I like that. Gary Vaynerchuk is great to be with you. Ray, you are one of the people that I know of, the way I know, that should at least be feeling this way. You've been a digital pioneer. You're a tremendously good man. You work hard. You have very good intent. You're talented. And I, you know, I would, I'd like to hope that I've earned the ability that my words about you matter, probably not as much as your inner circle, but I hope they carry some weight. And I can tell you that I am thrilled to sit down with all these people at church and your family picnics and debate them to why I think you're better than. Educate the kids here. In 2006, seven, eight Twitter, when I first hit the scene, that whole crew of all the personalities that were out there that were gaining followers, I was so high energy, so over the top, so from a different angle with the wine stuff. The way that people talked about me in those circles, I would, for a lot of those people, they thought I was the most likely to be a flash in the pan because I came in so hot, right? When you come in hot, you fade out hot. Yes, yes, yes, correct. Do you know you're right? It's true. I would argue from that era, I've probably been the one that has most gone on to do the thing. Or definitely in the mix. And I think that what I admire about you is, you like me have been a good guy the whole way. And a lot of those people haven't. They all tried, a lot of those people tried to do the wrong things along the way with their audiences. So, I don't know, man, I think you're great. And I think the reason that you feel that way is you still feel a little insecurity. Just enough to it being an annoyance. Thank God, not a cancer. And I think that hopefully you'll use this exact moment together to put the final nail in the coffin and be like, I appreciate you, church lady, because you love me and I love you back. You were raised and your DNA was to be conservative and safe. Mine was to be creative and entrepreneurial. And that's a beautiful thing, because we can coexist. And Gary, you're right about that. They want the safety. That's, thank you. Of course it is. That is what it is. They want the safety. Of course. Sav toys with the big win on the pay-along. So, Rooki, let's clap it up for Sav Toys. Congratulations, Sav Toys. That's exactly right, right? They want the safety. They are more fear-based than you are, believe it or not. And they are trying to impose their fear on you. How do you build an audience that actually cares by you actually caring? What am I doing right now in the meta? What am I doing right now? Is it lost on all of you that this hour could be used for bigger money making? The amount of people right here right now, they're trying to get to a million followers who have 613, who don't even reply to the people that leave comments on their posts now and do not reply to every DM they get, which is three a week. It blows my mind. Everybody is selfish. Everybody wants it for them. I want followers. I want fame. I want the money. How do you get them to fucking care by you caring first? Why do you think you love your parents so much when it's healthy? They loved you first. They fucking loved you first. Whoever loves first wins. I started my financial services agency three years ago, but growth has been slower than I expected. While I'm committed to pushing forward, frustration is creeping in and I sometimes wonder if I'm missing my window to turn things around. One of my biggest struggles is comparing myself to others who have scaled their businesses much faster. How do I shift my mindset and stay focused on my own journey without getting caught up in external benchmarks? That's a great question. By becoming more disciplined, by becoming the fact that he's self aware realizes this is happening is huge. He's clearly consuming my content. I pray, I plead, I push, I hope, I stress. I do all those things to get everyone here to stop comparing themselves to others. Comparison, envy, jealousy is destroying your fucking life. Please stop doing that. It is destroying you. Now, three years in frustrated, he might not be good enough. Like we have to start having this conversation. Not all of you are destined to be good entrepreneurs. And he's gotta try different shit. He might not be good enough. He needs to do content. I plead to everyone, content daily, content daily. Why? That's how you get new business. Do you think that he's texted everyone in his phone and the Anderson to Zachary Zazeloff and said, hey, do you or anybody you know need someone in financial service? Do you think he did that? I don't. Do you think? I don't. So I've given everybody the tactics. You start a business and you wanna sell shit. You have to text everyone in your phone. Vulnerably and authentically, like I showed the other day, hey, maybe not art for you. I'm not asking for you to buy my art though. I'd be happy if I did. You gotta be honest with them. But if you know someone that loves buying art, can you pass on my link? Like, do people go from A to Z in their phone to sell? And do people make social media content every day to sell? The answer is everybody watching right now, many of them, the thousands that are now watching as I look at all the numbers, many of them have heard this shit for me for a decade, but they haven't executed. It doesn't matter if you listen to me. It matters if you put the fuck I'm telling you to do. How do you approach adapting your marketing strategies in times of personal transition or growth, especially when you feel closely tied to your identity? Like your business is closely tied to your identity? I think a lot of people are about to be like, whoa, in the chat. Do you know that none of my professional success is that I feel that that is my identity? Do you know that I'm completely detached from Gary Vee? I know that most people don't believe me right now. And I think in 20 years they will. Like maybe when I just disappear and become a hermit and just hang with five people, I think people would be flabbergasted. If they, I wish technology and AI could show you my feelings right now in like written form. All of you would shit your pants right now in faint on seeing if there was AI that was a lie detector test that could show you all the truth. And I was attached to it right now. And Aaron asked me or you asked me, Gary, how much of your self-worth, how much of your identity is attached to your professional success since 1994? The answer is almost none. It's my passion. I like the game of it. It's my hobby. It's what I enjoy to do when I wake up up until I fall asleep. But I do not get validation from how many followers I get, how much admiration I get, how much I get validation from how people in my inner circles feel about me as a human being. My parents, my family, my inner family, and then all the way in the last tier is the tier that's right around me. The people that work closely with me, who know, who know. And who get asked all the time, what's he really like? That is where I get my validation from. Who am I as a human being? And so, A, that's just a fun starting point, Savannah, to think about, which is like, before I tell you the second part of the question of like, like you're already attached to it, how do we deal with it? The question becomes, can you start the process to get detached from it? Yeah. And honestly, like I don't struggle so much with that, but my clients do. And so then when I'm, cause I'm a marketing strategist and I help them with their social and business stuff, I'm in healthcare management and I do a lot online for people. But I feel like that's kind of the thing that we run into a lot when I'm working with them is, well, I want followers or I want this or I want that, but then, I try and hone them back down to what it really is. And they're the ones struggling with them, but I don't know how to get them through that. The way you get someone through something is conviction, not convincing. What you're probably doing, which is what most humans do, is you're trying to say things to them, to convince them how to see a different. The reason I think I've been effective and what I see how my mother mothered me, which is what I use and how other things have worked when I've looked at it, is my conviction, my belief in what I believe in, is what actually gets people there. So what do you do for all of them? You don't waver and you remind them, like when I'm at wit's end with someone, I remind them that they are not my child and I actually don't give a fuck. After giving so many fucks, my main strategy is give unlimited fucks. And then when I hit a tipping point where I see that someone's just coddled or entitled or lacks accountability, then I'll try an off-speed pitch. It's like a fucking pitcher. I throw in fastballs, I'm like, okay, the fastballs they're hitting home runs on. In this scenario, it means it's not working. Then I'm gonna throw a 70-mile-hour curve ball. My curve ball, after giving so much love and optimism and push is to say, okay, we're now at a crossroads. Like if this is your client, you're like, hey, I've been talking to you about this for six months. Let me say it this way. I don't care if you don't do this, you will continue to fail. And in fact, there's a scenario where I will resign you as a client because I can see here nothing will get done. The best therapists in the world fire their clients that aren't listening, which is why there's so many bullshit therapists in the world because they don't fire when they should fire. I don't believe that I am the person for everyone, Savannah. I do not believe that Gary Vee is the person that is gonna get everyone there because some people won't accept my energy, my style, who I am. There are people who eliminate me right away because I'm a 49-year-old white male and they're like, no, I'm like, that's fine. That's why I invented V-Friends. My 250 characters are gonna get you there. And if that doesn't work, next. And so, that's it. That's it. So I think conviction over convincing is something you should try. And then some hard love sometimes. Yeah, I definitely give the hard love. So I'll definitely work on transitioning. Maybe it needs to be the other part. Maybe you might be someone who's going to hard love too quickly because I can tell you love and optimism and hope. Get people there more than hard love. People think hard love is the answer. Hard love is what you do when you have done sustained love, hope and optimism for years. So consider maybe you're going to hard love too soon too. That might be something to think about. Okay, thank you. I only go to hard love after it's like fucking seven trillion pieces. Like, you know what I mean? Like hard love is last resort. Right. I think a lot of people start with hard love. Hope. Let this be very clear to everybody. The only thing that gets you out of bad places is not tough love. It is hope. It is optimism. It is positivity. And once you deposit a ton of that into someone, sometimes hard love from the depositor of hope will trigger and activate all that love. But until you put all that love into somebody, hard love isn't going to get it fucking done. It's the size of opportunity I've been praying for, but now that I have it, I don't have the confidence, experience I had in previous roles. One of the most important things I can start doing is to become more confident in my current roles across this opportunity. You should surround yourself with people and content and potentially therapy that is only based on confidence and optimism and positivity. This person is insecure. Imposter syndrome is a word I hate, as you know. It is a modern word that we use to make it feel better to not say the truth. Imposter syndrome is fucking contemporary slang for insecure. Every one of you motherfuckers on here right now who like to throw around imposter syndrome, I need you to get that word out of your fucking mouth and I need you to say, I am deeply insecure. Period. We've become incredibly good in the last five years of coming up with all sorts of new fucking words to make us feel better about our shortcomings. Get imposter syndrome out of your fucking mouth because it is a bandaid to you solving your actual problem, which is you are insecure. And good news, that is okay. You're allowed. We all are insecure in certain things. I am insecure in hanging a picture in my wall. I do not like to be handed. I'm insecure. I'm insecure at surfing and skiing and skateboarding. Any lower waist maneuvers. I'm tremendous above the waist. They have great hand-eye coordination, racket sports, fucking darts, pool. I go below the waist. I'm not athletic enough. I'm not coordinated enough. No soccer, no fucking surfing, no fucking, and I'm going to work on that. That is my big goal from 50 to 60. I want to get better and more athletic and more talented below the waist. Trying to get my mom to stream with me. My dad passed the end of January. She said, what do I have to give? Your dad was my purpose. You kids were my purpose. And now I have nothing. I just want to around me. I believe the 75 to 100 year olds are the most important group of people that should be posting on social media. My biggest plea is that we get a lot more 75 to 100 year olds to understand they have the most to contribute. In fact, I would argue the biggest issue in the world right now is that we have lost the moral compass, the civility, the grace, the sense of community, and definitely the wisdom that 75 to 100 year olds hold. And I believe that we have just lived through the era of 14 to 22 year olds that have become famous and have taken advantage of social. And I believe the next group that is going to take advantage of this is the 75 to 100 year old crew. I think we will have a plethora of 75, 79, 84, 91 year old influencers if we continue to have incredible children like you pushing our parents to do this. Jesus, what do I have to say? People aren't going to want to listen to me. Sorry, my phone's about to die. Well, the good news is, Mama, you know this, the good news is everybody, everybody eight to 88 fuels insecure. What do I have to give? What do I have to give until the end of the ride? I'm almost 50, I'm insecure, right? Yeah. No makeup, and here I am. Hello, Gary Vee, how you doing? Mama, I've got a good one for you. I think the way you get her going is you tell her you're going to interview her every morning with five questions. I think most people struggle to start, but if they are interviewed, they can start. I struggle to start because my ADD is undiagnosed till I was 40. It's been a challenge. And I'm- Mama, I actually think it's your advantage. I actually think we have ADD and ADHD misunderstood right now. Most people that break out to other humans have some level of that because it's magic. It is. It's magic. Because you see people, I see, I know the struggle, right? I know how hard it is. I couldn't even comprehend what I would have been diagnosed with as a child. They would have put me- Oh no, you and I would, we totally would have been. Like totally, we would have been. I was standing on tables. I was selling in the back of the room. I was interrupting teachers. My friend Ken Skelfo, Mike Ken Skelfo's senior year breakfast took the mic and said, this was the, what do you remember about high school? His answer was, I remember the first day of the beginning of the year and in midterms when we would try to figure out, like when we have new classes, that he prayed that I would be in his class because I was good for wasting seven to 13 minutes of every class. You're being me. So, look, I think- I sold gum in school, so I get it. Yeah, listen, mama, you need to tell her you're gonna interview her and let me say something else about moms like your mom. You need to just take full action. If she does not come and move, I think you need to hire kidnappers. I'm not kidding. Oh no, I'm just under a ticket. I think strange men should just grab your mom, throw a paper bag over her head and have her show up to your house. I'm not kidding. I just under a ticket. I really do. I just tell her, I'm like, mama, I got your ticket. You're coming this time to this time. I've got a whole room set up. She get, we're gonna go shopping. We have to go thrifting, right? To buy the right furniture for her space. And we're just going to, I'm just telling her- That's it. Do life with us. Both can work. You're gonna miss out if you don't do. Ideas is not doing. Pondering is not doing. A vision board is not doing. A list is not doing. I don't give a fuck if she does 10 things or one thing, I just need her to do. Got it? If she picks one, good. If she picks two, good. I'm building two businesses. I'm building VaynerX and the Friends hard right now. Hard. Sometimes I do one. Wine library. I'm also building VaynerWat. I'm also building fucking the VCR restaurant group, Flyfish, Little Maven. If you come to New York, go to Flyfish Club actually can't get in there. You have to be a club member. Go to Little Maven. Everybody Google Little Maven NYC. I expect you to eat their ASAP. People don't do because they're scared, Erin. They'd rather say I'm working on five businesses than failing on one. Got it? Everybody's not doing because they're scared to fail. You ever watched little kids? Anybody, does anybody have kids under 10? Say 10 in the chat right now and Adrian put up the cartoon. You're two daughters. I don't know if you've noticed. Does one of them not wanna play certain games and shies away from it? Because this has been very big in my kid's journey, my sibling's journey, and my cousin's, my nephews and nieces and cousin's journey. There are people, watch carefully. They will say they don't wanna play. They're insecure and we need to attack that now. If you have a child who shies away from playing Monopoly, who shies away from playing song, if your child does not want to play a game, it means they're scared to lose. It is one of the most important things to attack. It's something a lot of people right now don't understand. I'm so glad somebody just said my son never wants to play. People don't get it. I'm telling you right now, if it is competition, if there's a winner and a loser, if there's a winner and a loser, pay attention if your kid does not want to play. It means they're scared. You must address it. How do you address it? How do you address it? You force them to play. You fucking force them that they're gonna cry. But once they learn it's not so scary to lose, you address it by suffocating. We must put these kids in tougher positions. When you, you know what most parents are doing now? When they see it, if they even recognize it, they're like, oh, that's okay, Susan, it doesn't matter anyway. What the fuck are you talking about? It matters the most. Winning and losing is life. The fuck these things going on out here? Winning and losing is the only thing. Literally parents have said it doesn't matter. It's the actual reverse. It's the only thing. But here's the key that everybody got mixed up. Losing in something doesn't mean you're a loser. It means you understand merit. It means you understand real life. It means you understand consequences and merit and talent and circumstance. This is why we have so much anxiety, depression and suicide. We have taught people that winning and losing doesn't matter, which creates indifference and becomes entitlement and becomes blame.
