That's what we do. Now let's get on our feet and welcome back to the Decon Vice-Chastain, Gary Vaynerchuk. We get it. Let's do it. Sheep, put your hands in the air, drinks in your cup if you don't give a fuck. I de-trade attention and build businesses. Legacy is greater than currency. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur for real, for real, for real. Like, documented. I'm incredibly inspired this morning. I have a very clear vision of what this weekend can mean for people over the next 2, 3, 4 decades. And it's like fun to be a human that genuinely actually believes in that kind of statement and thinks in those kind of terms. The diversity of conversations that this weekend had, it comes from actually having a diversity of people. I'm really proud of that aspect of this conference and it's something I want to continue to champion. Not because it's the right thing to do, even though it's absolutely the right thing to do. Because it's the right thing to do for the people on the receiving end because they get different thoughts, different ideas. It just actually on merit helps. So many people in this room in so many different contexts mean so much to me and so I just want to thank you. I hope you have a great day. Please do me a favor. Most of you don't know each other and I really hope that as soon as I hang up here, you maybe go and say hello to just one person that you don't know because it really, really genuinely can lead to something remarkable for you and for them. So thank you for being here and thank you so much for being a part of this. Excuse me. What's up, Gary? How are you, brother? Such a pleasure, of course. I got to do this real quick. How are we doing? Can you give me some like warm memories of like maybe a New York wrestling fan? Like what you do in the 80s as like going to shows, everything. Got it. We were too poor to go to shows. But I had this move called the Russian Death Lock that I used to throw on my friends. Sean, can you come here? I'm going to put the Russian Death Lock on you. In the 80s, like kids like wrestled each other for real and everybody had to make up their own move and I think I came up with a good one. It was called the Russian Death Hold. It's nothing crazy. So it was basically like a full Nelson. It wasn't anything bad. But what I realized was there was like this hook within here. So I'd go here, right? And if I would lock. Oh, there we go. I heard that crack. If I would lock, what do you think? Yeah, that's a poke. Does it hurt? It makes 20 red. Yeah. So where's the HR department? No, seriously. Like that's a good move. Oh, yeah, it hurt. It was great. A lot of people would tap on that move. It's a good hold. Right? It's good, right? It worked, yeah. Where does it hurt? Shoulders. Yeah. And ego a little. Thank you for being here. Of course. This is amazing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Pure wow. They want a photo of you. Pure wow. I know. It's I own pure wow.

We talked and I talked about my job. In my job I'm an engineer. So my role as an engineer, where am I? I'm an engineer, I don't want to do it anymore, and you're like, just get the fuck out. Stop! Get the fuck out! Okay, get the fuck out! Did you? I quit my job! I did! I'm proud of you, and now? I got a new job, and I love it. That makes me so fucking happy. It's like baby steps. I don't need to like change overnight, you know? Of course not. You're a kid. Proud of you. That's a huge feel to be able to have the courage to do that. That in itself is something most people aren't able to get to. Cheer for yourself on that. Timbo, what's up, legend? How you doing? Great show, man. Thank you for having me. My guy. Love you. Very thank you. Talk to you soon. This is fucking awesome. It's fucking crazy to see the original, even like the way I'm looking at them this year, versus last year, I feel like in 20 years, it's going to be like super emotional to look at, you know? All right, let's roll one, two, three. Hey, Gary. How's it going? Well... Cheers. If I had Gary years, it would stick perfectly. Oh, is that the way it is this year? He's playing different. Pop's different. Thank you for the invite. It's been dope. Really, really dope. Appreciate you. Thank you. Love you too. Love you too. Yeah. I know you're focused on that. I just want to say, this is the first time I've ever been at a conference where everyone was pleasant. Everyone was happy. Everyone was me willing to interrupt conversations, to engage you, and it was so easy to talk to people. I want to say, I want to say that I want to thank you because I do a song for this other company. Thank you, baby. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome back to the V-Con Vicer stage. Gary Vaynerchuk. What do you do? Love you back, bro. What's up, brother? Come here. Give me. I'll give you! Me, me, me! Out of here! The Russian band Gary! Dang pack. Let's go back, Gary. Let's go, baby! Go, let's go. Be kind! Howoy-yoyes with theไดs and all of y'all! I'm sorry! Veecon! Veecon 2023, how we feeling? Veecon, how did we feel about this year? And so this keynote today is going to be with you involved. I actually don't know the videos. I asked the team to go through all the videos that were submitted. And I'm going to answer Q&A right now based on the questions from y'all. But let me go into the keynote. Let's queue up the first question. You know, people struggle with this fear of how do I express myself? How do I feel good about who I am when I'm in a social situation? What advice do you have for people to get closer to that point so that they can really just feel that confident with themselves? I don't know if you heard, but high school is over. The amount of people that put other people's opinions of them on a pedestal is an issue. I would die if you valued my opinion of you over your opinion of yourself. To answer his question directly, the way you get better at anything in the world is practice. You want to get better at basketball? You practice. You want to get better at singing? You practice. You want to get better at DJing? You practice. You want to cook better? You practice. You want to be a better entrepreneur? You practice. You want to get better at having self-confidence? You practice on not valuing someone else's opinion over your own opinion of yourself. You practice by putting yourself out there more. More. More. The context of this conference is super powerful and will be no question an aggressive theme of mine for 2024 is to push you to say hello to more people. More. More. Because what you're going to get here, as you know, is positive reinforcement. You're going to get reciprocated likely at a high percentage in a good way. By the way, I'm not naive. I'm sure that even though we tried to push this nice movement like all this, that some people weren't receptive and things like that, they sure they might have been dealing with something that they might be introverted themselves. But you get practice. The way you get more confident in yourself is you stop putting other people's opinions of yourself in front of yours. Then they go to me, but Gary, what if it's my opinion of myself that I suck? Then I remind them that that was instilled in you. If you think you suck as you sit here today, that you suck, I want you to understand something. That was somebody else's voice putting that inside of your head. That person felt sucky about themselves too. Oh my gosh. That's uno, Gary, in there. Oh, my God. You're in the final. Where do you think I was? Let's go. Who won? Brother, congratulations. Let's clap it up forever. Last break, man. Let's fucking go. Bro, you shouldn't have me sign this. You should get this graded. My signature was one of ones I wouldn't get signed. Get that graded without me. That's why I got your back. Now give me a fucking bomb. Jesus. Pretty trouble. Midnight, Saturday night, nothing too fancy, a lot of chaos. We appreciate you. We did it. Team did it. We all did it. See you next year.
