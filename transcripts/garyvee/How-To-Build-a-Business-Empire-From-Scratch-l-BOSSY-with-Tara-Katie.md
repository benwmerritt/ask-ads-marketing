I'm very obsessed with popular culture. What rappers on the come up, which streamers on the come up, which actresses on the come up, then things like, you know, the Stanley Cups, I could have told you was gonna happen a month before it hit everybody's radar. Yeah. Why did the mango gummies that are made by NICE, the private label at Walgreens sell out, right? Like I'm paying attention to popular culture. I DMed Bad Bunny in 2017. I'm really in it. Like why, why, why, why do people care about this person? Why was Charlie D'Amelio's first business meeting in my office? Why did we discover Logan Paul on Vine? Attention is the number one asset. Gary, hi, thank you so much for hanging out with us today. You know, one of the things we talk about on this show is business and sort of building out your empire. And you've got a solid, would you call it an empire? I would, I would. And I say that because I think everyone should be thinking that way. Right, and like obviously I am either crazy, you know, good or crazy bad, but I enjoy having a lot of different businesses. Many of my most successful friends, Razby, for being all over the place or Gary, if you just focused, and I'm like, look, I'm not trying to maximize money. I'm trying to maximize happiness. Ooh. You know, and so for me, I get joy out of starting a new business or a venture. And I'm also good at it. It's not like all my companies go out of business. Most of my things work to some degree. So I enjoy it. And yeah, I think it's fun to think of it that way, but that's an insular game. I'm not worried about how it's viewed from the outside. But for myself, I do think I have the ambition to build something meaningful. Yeah. Most of your things work to some degree. Can you talk about some degree? Like how do you define work? Yeah, no, it's a great, you know, like here to core things I've done in my life, right? Like I built my dad's wine business for him. It was a $3 million business when I walked into it. When I left it a decade later, it was a $65 million business, making a lot more profit than it was at three. It was making 10% gross profit at 65. It was making 24% gross profit. So a much better business. I decided that I wanted to be a successful author. I've had five New York Times bestselling books. I wanted to be a successful public speaker. I'm one of the most compensated speakers in the world. I wanted to build a personal brand. I've done that. I started VaynerMedia, an advertising agency. It is now currently one of the two or three largest independent global agencies in the world. I wanted to be an effective investor. I invested in Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr and Snap and Coinbase. I've done very well in that world. VaynerSports is something my brother runs, but I'm very involved in. We wanted to do a sports agency. We're sitting here today filming on the day of the NFL Draft. And it is very likely, though it's an unpredictable thing, that we will have someone go in the first round of the NFL Draft, big shout out Kool-Aid. And so, V-Friends is a real thing. Like, I think, and V-Friends is the most fun because it was in that NFT world. So that's where all the attention is, but quietly, even though it's loud, quietly, right now I'm building a very large intellectual property, a Pokemon Marvel Sesame Straight Lake brand called V-Friends. I have a kid's book coming out in a couple months. I have a cartoon coming out on YouTube, kids by the people that do Coco Melon. If you go to eBay right now and type in V-Friends, you will be stunned by the completed items and sales of the trading cards. I co-founded Rezi. Yeah. And honestly, I could keep going. You could keep going. And so, that's a lot of stuff. You're doing a lot of stuff. And how are you, what is the recruitment process like for you for finding leaders of all these different businesses? What a great follow-up question. I like to grow them. Okay. What does that look like? It looks like patience. Let me explain what it is. Let me explain what it is. Most of the things I mentioned now are more recent. So Wine Library was forever. It was from 1998 to 2011, full-time. VaynerMedia started in nine. I went full, full-time at 11, which is how I'm referencing the Wine Library thing. And then a lot of the stuff I just mentioned really started happening in 2018, 19. And so in that seven, eight years when I was building it, when you look at it, right, A.J. runs VaynerSports. A.J. and I, with our partner Phil Toronto, run the fund. The fund, Phil Toronto started as an intern for us. I didn't mention that I started Empathy Wines, which was a direct-to-consumer wine brand that I sold for a lot of money to consolation brands. My two partners in that business, John Traumann and Nate Trotter, both were interns at VaynerMedia 10 years earlier. Yeah. Wow. V-Friends. They're coming up with homegrown leaders. V-Friends is run by Andy Craniac, who was also an intern. VaynerMedia, global, LA. Who runs LA? Lisa Buckley. She's been with me for seven years. Who's the chief business officer? Kaylin McNamara. She's been with me for 10 years. The Sasha Group, which is a company in the Holden Company of VaynerX, where VaynerMedia is, he's been with me for 15 years, right? You know, like there's, I mean, dozens, chief of staff, Hannah, nine years. Like, but all of the people I just mentioned started as kids, all of them. Yeah. It is very rare for me to bring someone from the outside in a very substantial role because they're not family. Interesting. So for me, it's family business vibes. Okay, because I know a lot of people who listen to this show, they're starting a business or they're thinking of starting a business and they're trying to figure out how to get people to help them and work with them. If I think about myself, I have a couple companies and I own a couple companies and I feel sometimes overwhelmed by having multiple. And I also feel sometimes frustrated by the fact that the person that I find in leadership is not ready immediately. Makes sense. But I'm hearing you say that's maybe not the goal that they need to be immediately ready. They can't, they almost never can be. Yeah. Like hiring from the outside is guessing. Yeah. Right, hiring is guessing, promoting and firing is knowing. Yeah. Ooh, that's a good one. That's hiring is guessing, promoting and firing is knowing. Why is promoting and firing knowing? Because you've made a decision based on the reality of them being with you. Performance. Right. Do you know that I've never called a reference in my entire career? Ever. It's crazy. You're going to give me a piece of paper with the three people you already talked to to say that they're going to co-sign you when I call them. So, okay. So instead, what do you do? You give them a project? That's a great idea. What I do is I go with my intuition. Now, what is fun at scale, remember, let's take a step back. I just rattled off a lot of stuff and I'm really empathetic that most people are not 20 years into their successful career. Yeah. So let's go back to day one. For me, let's start with a couple things. When I was only hiring people that were making $7 an hour minimum wage in New Jersey at the time to do stock in the shelves at Wine Library, I would predominantly either want to hire acquaintances or friends. Yeah. Or once I had a good employee, I wanted their co-sign to who I should hire. Aha. OK. Yeah. So a good thing for smaller business, when you hire your first person, doesn't work out. You hire someone else, doesn't work out. Now you hire a third person, does work out. Sarah's killing it. Now you're ready for another hire. The first thing I do is I go to Sarah and say, Sarah, who have you worked with or who's a friend of yours or a family member that's like you? Because Sarah knows what it takes to do the role well too. And you trust Sarah because she's already doing good work. Now, occasionally Sarah will put on someone who she loves more than the job and you might get caught. But I found less often. I feel like that Sarah in this story is a good egg and you're coming to her from a really empathetic, honest place and she wants to keep growing. And so she wants to make a good recommendation. I love and I mean love creating like in sports, they call it a coaching tree, right? There's a head coach and he has a bunch of assistants and they go on to be good. I love hiring trees. You hire a good employee, especially if you're further along, at Vayner, I can do this all day long now. You hire someone, they come from another advertising agency that they worked out for six years. They come and work for you. They're there for nine months, they're crushing it. I will always go to that person and be like, who else is good? Yeah. Who's like you? And almost have them build their own team, essentially. Even if, and in that scenario back to my company, they may be a creative director, but they're like, oh, you know, it was great a project management. Sandra, who has to work at Droga 5, which is a great agency or, you know, and so I think a lot about that. And so if you're just starting out, you're guessing, you're guessing, but then you have someone rely on them too. Gary, I'm curious, you did just rattle off. I wanted to do this, I did it. I wanted to do this, I did it. And then you said, I've been doing this for 20 years. Like I've had the time to really explore these different paths. Is there anything that sticks out in your mind is something that just flat out didn't work? What's the L? What's the L? Oh, I have many Ls. I mean, there's a lot of Ls, but I think the Ls for me are micro Ls. So like there's been many divisions in Vayner Sampling inside of Vayner Media was something I'm so passionate about. Like I still think most companies don't sample beauty, food, beverage, like sampling, get people to taste your soda, then they may like it. It's much better than doing unlimited advertising. So a lot of divisions have not worked. A lot of executions. I would say like the macro thing most of it has worked. Because I'm actually conservative. I'm very, I'm an immigrant, I'm practical. I'm not like spending money I can't afford to lose. You know, I'm also good at what I do. It's first of all professionally, you know, I'm getting older, it's 26 years that I've been full. But that's not even true. I've been really, really in my dad's liquor store business since I was 14. By the time I was 22 and ran it full time, I was experienced. Like the day I walked in after college, I knew everything. There was like, at least by the, when I say I knew everything, I mean, in how to run the liquor store. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I mean everything. I knew how to stock the shelves. I knew how to make the ice. I knew how to fill the beer cooler. I knew how to ring up the register. I knew how to buy wine. I knew how to sell. Like I knew everything. And so, you know, yeah, I mean, I think only very side vanity projects have completely failed. There was a company I started called Vaynertoys, where I took a couple buddies and I just wanted them to post everything. I was buying a garage sales on eBay. It was just not a very good business model. But it was, that was a hobby. You know, like true, true things. Not really, because I've done a lot of things, but not. Like I know I just rattled off a lot of things, but not a lot. There was a lot of things that failed for me where I wasn't active. So I bought Corked, C-O-R-K-D. This may go back to what you're dealing with. I bought Corked, C-O-R-K-D, back in 2011. No, nine. Nine, which was a wine social network. It was epic. I loved it. I was obsessed with it. And then I bought it. Big shout out Dan Cedarholm, amazing guy. But I hired Lindsay, a Harvard business school grad, who's amazing, I love Lindsay. And ironically, John Trautman, who was my partner in Empathy Wine, who now is a key player at VFriends, was an intern for it. But I was so busy, back to being busy, like I'd never run a lot of things. I only ran a wine library, and now we just started VaynerMedia. And so two things was busy for me. I didn't have the infrastructure at it. I didn't have three full-time admins. I didn't have two chief of staffs. I didn't have 50 people around me that have been with me for 10 years and I can talk sympatica with. You have all these things now. You have three full-time admins. Correct, I didn't have the broad shoulders of being able to, I could juggle two, three balls, but I wasn't me yet. This version, I couldn't do 12. And so cell phones weren't like that, where everyone could be reachable. Like you had to, like, so the world was different for me. And so, corked, I said, Lindsay, you run it. And I was giving it like an hour a week and it failed. And by the way, not only did I do corked, I did another thing called Forest, which was with Kyle Braggar, which was like this social network for developers and designers, kind of like Dribble, right? Failed, because I was not only the 1B, I was like the number four. I was barely involved, but I'll take that L because I was the co-founder, partner, but I've never failed in anything where I've been the one driving. Sometimes when I've been in the passenger seat, definitely when I've been in the back seat, but if I'm the driver, we're fucking winning. This is something I'm trying to figure out for myself. This is something I'm really kind of playing with and I love your thoughts and advice on this because when I have multiple businesses that I'm running, if I'm giving a lot of attention to it, I'm sort of giving my like terra factor to it. It works out very well. And when I'm more pulled back from it, I may be right, it's like an infrastructure thing. I haven't figured out how to like infuse my energy enough into it so that it works. And it maybe sounds a little bit like cocky for me to say like, oh, if I'm part of it, it works. And if I'm not part of it, it doesn't. But that's kind of cocky. That's like saying like when Tom Brady's on the Patriots, they're good and when he's not, they're not. Like I view it like sports. By the way, I hate I used Tom Brady's example. That just pissed me off. I mean, you're just, that's fucking hate him. The player, I hear he's a nice guy. No, that makes all the sense in the world. Well, it reminds me of like, so I run a personal finance media brand and a very common refrain is like, millionaires have seven streams of income. And I think the average person who maybe has a W-2 job, hears that and goes, okay, I gotta get seven jobs. Now. Let me immediately diversify how I'm earning. And that's not really, I don't think how it works. Like you have to go full force at one thing and then you layer on as you go. And that I think some of these things can proliferate and create multiple streams of revenue within one source of focus. I don't know that that's exactly what you're talking about because you- It's really true. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's what I am saying. It's why you said that was, I said it earlier. Like in 2012, I couldn't do seven things. I didn't have the infrastructure. I didn't have the experience yet. I had the talent, but I had to be patient. You know, as you were just talking, as we're talking, I'm like, man, you know what's really fucked up right now is that every 20 year old on earth, thinks that they need to become a millionaire in her 20s and no 20 year old on earth, 40 years ago thought that. They thought it was gonna take time to get there. Hmm, well, I do wanna ask you about content creation because when you walked in, you brought someone with you who's filming you. We're obviously filming you as well. And you said, for the first five years, I had someone filming me every single minute of the day. And I go, oh, well, that makes sense because I followed you on social media and you were everywhere, all the time, all at once. And I thought, how the hell is this guy doing this? How is he constantly producing so much up? And to this day, I go look at Gary V. Audio Experience. Every single day there's a new episode. And I'm like, I'm exhausted just watching this, but I'm curious from your perspective, A, how were you kind of ahead of the curve there? How did you think about it at the time and how has your perspective shifted on the production of media and what you are personally creating, what you're putting out there? Great question. I think that, it's funny you bring this up because it's obviously I'm in pocket right now where day trading attention is about to come out. So this book is very, this is gonna be very interesting for me. I'm very detached from, by the way, another thing that makes everything work for me is I'm genuinely detached from Gary V. Interesting, say more about that. How was that? Yeah. I don't get my satisfaction in life. I don't get my validation in life from my professional success. Okay, so when you say you're detached from Gary V, you mean like the persona of Gary V? No, Gary V is me. Media, aside. That's the fame that comes, the awareness or fame or whatever you wanna call it, the financial success, the admiration because I'm an entrepreneur and it's cool right now. I'm very like, it's almost like I'm watching it from here even though I'm living it. And the reason I bring that up is what I'm about to say, I'm so curious to see what this book does, more from like watching it from the sidelines than actually living it. And what I mean by that is I know I wrote a very important book. It may hit, it may not, meaning it's gonna sell cause I'm good at that and people are gonna, but I mean hit, hit. I mean, do I think the two of you might read it? Yes, I do because of what you do, but do I think this one might be the one that you read and you're like, wait a minute, I need every single person I meet to read this. And cause it's going into what you just asked. What I realized since I was a child was that attention was the only thing that mattered. And I don't mean attention like look at me, I mean if you were to sell something and it started with lemonade, I'm being dead serious about what I'm about to tell you, it took me 25 years, 30 years to remember this. I did on stage improv once. I was like, wait a minute. Like literally I was giving a talk trying to make a point about attention. Like wait a minute, when I was a child, six, seven, eight, child, when I sold lemonade, I made Robbie Turnick or my sister Liz sell the lemonade and I walked up and down the street on Tingley Lane, made signs and would literally, you know how crazy what I'm about to say is, would literally sit on the grass, on the corner, and like watch 30 cars drive by and was trying to like look at the person's face and be like, should I put it on that tree or that pole? Like do they look at the tree or the pole? Where are they putting their attention? Yes, so that I could put my sign there and sell my lemonade. That is like God given. That you knew this as a kid, where's the customer putting their attention? I didn't even think of it that way. I didn't even, it took me 30 years to remember it. But then I was like, wait a minute. And then when I was 14 and doing baseball card shows, I used to walk the whole show and listen to what people were talking about, what did people care about? And then I would go and I would set up my table and then I'd go off around my table, not be behind my table and I would stand behind people and I would watch them walk by my table and try to get a sense of what would stop them. If my best friend, Brandon Warnick, he was listening right now, he'd be laughing about the dollar rack or like the Don Russ 89 box tower. I would do things to stop people. Which is very different than I think how most people approach marketing or think they're supposed to do marketing, which is I make something first and then I wave my hands and like try to get their attention to me as opposed to looking at where their attention's already going. The reason I've always been right about this shit is that. The reason I did a YouTube show in February 2006, the reason I had a website in 1997, the reason I did email marketing in 1998 or about the first Google AdWords for wine or was the person yelling to all of you six years ago, TikTok's gonna win, TikTok's gonna win, that's me. And so, what did I see back then? Which was content on social media platforms was everything and there was no way for me to produce enough to take advantage of it unless I recorded my whole day. I'm curious where you're looking now because I do think that like when I watch you even today, it does not occur to me that on a daily basis, Team Gary V is going, where's the attention today? It's like Gary V is everywhere. Correct, but it's everywhere that the attention is. Okay, okay. I'm not doing a drive time radio show. Yeah, yeah. I'm not writing an opt-in for the Wall Street Journal every day. And I think it's even more nuanced in like where the attention is. I'm hearing you say too, what kinds of things are people paying attention to? What's the tone of things? My framework is PAC, platforms and culture. Okay. Platforms and culture. So which platforms? And then what are the platforms doing? So yes, Instagram, but what kind of content should you be making for Instagram right now? And I'm not talking about the culture part. Culture is popular culture. Who's popping? What's popping? What do people care about? If you two ladies think that I thought I was gonna make content about cliche mistakes that parents make, 10 years ago, I would have laughed you out of the room, wasn't on my mind. But it became a bigger conversation for both kids and parents, because the world's evolving. So if you're looking at where people's attention already is and kind of figuring out how you can put your business, your brand in front of that, there are some- And contribute. You know, it's funny. You contribute. Yeah. The thing I broke out was, you said it right. Like 99.999% will say it. Yeah. It's advertising. It's brand building. Put in front of. I've always thought of contribute too. Okay. So this actually answers what I was getting ready to ask you, because I was gonna say, if you're thinking about as advertising, I think about there's lots of things people are doing on social media that I think are silly and stupid and they're doing a dance and like, that's not what I wanna do to put my attention to, but that's not necessarily the way I wanna contribute. So I think you're saying when you also add the lens of how do you want, where do people's attention and how do you wanna contribute to that? Multiple things to that. One, I personally, for what I do for a living, think nothing is silly. Yeah. Because I think the audience is right. Yeah. I think most people think they're right. And I think I'm always wrong and the audience is always right. So if people find it entertaining to see someone eat 10 pizza pies, then people see it. Like the amount of envy, the amount of delusion that people come to the table with when they strategize around this is astonishing to me. People are like, Gary, this is also stupid. Look at this person. They're ridiculous. I'm like, they're not. Is Jim Carrey ridiculous? Because Jim Carrey's silly as shit. Yeah. But what comedy is is escapism. Yeah. The world is hard. Yeah. And it's nice to put on fucking Netflix and watch a one hour stand up special and laugh. Yeah. Oftentimes about what's complicated in the world. You know, models. What do they contribute? I hear from so many people. This is like, I'm like, they contribute fantasy. They contribute aspiration. They contribute you're sexually attracted to them. That's a human trait. Yeah. It's a, you know, so like- Beauty is a valuable thing. It's a, you know, everything is that. And then there's information. There's education. What was I contributing to wine in 2006? I was very educated and could really speak to it. But I was taking the doucheery out of it. That's what I was contributing. I was a normal Jersey guy. Oh, wait a minute. Like I can like wine and be like into wrestling and UFC and like trading cards and like the Jets. So you have a thesis kind of about how, what you want to do differently, how you want to contribute. How do you want to contribute? Yeah. You know, to me, I think the number one reason people come to me all the time is you can imagine, be like, Gary, I'm not growing. This isn't working. I'm like, cause you're selfish. Every time you post, you're like, what's in it for me? I want likes. On that note. I want followers. I want fame. I want money. I want the attention. What are they getting? I used to think about content, cause as part of Money with Katie, we have content across a lot of different platforms. And I, in the beginning kind of conceptualized of it, like a very linear funnel. Okay, I'm gonna find you. You're gonna find me on Instagram. And then you're gonna go want to listen to my podcast. And then I'm gonna get you to read my newsletter. And then I'm, and I think it was a very like, I want to move you along. And so the Instagram content needs to drive you here. And then this needs to drive you here. And I think what I've been learning over the last year or two is like, no, no, no, you need to optimize the audio experience to be as good as possible for that audio listener without the intention of taking them somewhere else. You want them to become as big of a fan of as possible and give them the best possible experience there. On Instagram, it needs to be a social first video. You need to be thinking platform first and platform specific versus here's something that I'm trying to get you to really go somewhere else. But poke holes in that. Like, cause I think- No, I'm not, not only am I not gonna poke holes in it, let me tell you what you just described, which is why the last 20 years have been fruitful for me and why so many others have not been able to achieve their goal and not just me, many others. You just described two very different things when it comes to business. The first thing you described was sales. The second thing you described was branding. Interesting. Okay, different. The first thing you were thinking about was I need to get them through a sales funnel. A funnel, yep. To get them to do this thing that will make me money. Nothing wrong with that. I like business, but that's sales. The second you started to transition and think about brand, things changed. Yeah. Like, this sneaker, they didn't cookie me and followed me around the internet. And then like I saw a banner everywhere I buy Nike's because of the brand. Interesting. Not because of the sales. Yeah. Right? And so why I think things worked for me and what I want others to do for others is I'm desperate to provide value. I'm happy to sell books. I wanna sell V-Friends collectibles. I want to sell wine. But if I didn't, like I want people to sign up for WineText.com, which by the way, I want you to. You too should as well. I think I've really hacked the best way to buy wine on the internet, but I don't want them to buy WineText.com because I pound them with a funnel. You're just beating them down. I want them to, I want whoever's listening right now to have so much affinity that I've brought them value. And they're like, yeah, I do buy my wine from Wine.com but I like Gary better. So I'm gonna go sign up right now to WineText.com. Do you know what I mean? Brand. Yeah. Brand. It's a little more human. Well, listen, brand's a lot more fun for individual humans too. Oh, I agree. I agree with your point. Like we feel better. Like when we're building brand versus just selling, you feel better. It also works better. Yeah. So you're making a lot of content. I'm curious about how much content you're consuming. Do you have a lean media diet, lean social media diet? Are you scrolling? I consume an obnoxious amount of content at a surface level. Okay, that's interesting. How is it surface? I'm just trying to know what the fuck's going on. And I don't care about, but what everyone cares about, but I don't need to be deep in it. So you're not in the comments debating with everybody on somebody else's post, but you're just saying what they're saying. Well, first of all, I'm never gonna do that because if you're debating in the comments, some shit went down that you're wasting your energy. I may debate a little bit about sports. I may go into a 76ers post right now and talk a little Nick shit, but no, no, no, no, I'm definitely not doing that, but I am trying to pay attention to what's happening in the world. I'm very obsessed with popular culture. So what rappers on the come up, which streamers on the come up, which actresses on the come up, then things like the Stanley Cups, I could have told you was gonna happen a month before it hit everybody's radar. Why did the mango gummies that are made by NICE, the private label at Walgreens sell out? I'm paying attention to popular culture. Four years ago, I'm like, oh, this mad happy brand's gonna hit. Things like that, Seagullman stables. Like why did I, 18 months ago, I'm like, oh, that's gonna hit. So whether it's fashion or food, food trends or music trends, I went back like, I DM'd Bad Bunny in 2017. 2017, shout out to Mike Boyd, who puts me onto that stuff, Tyler Walsh too now, but I'm really in it. And so I'm paying attention to, why did the crown not happen? Why did Kodoroid hats happen? You know, like, why, why, why, why do people care about this person? Why was Charlie D'Amelio's first business meeting in my office? Why did we discover Logan Paul on Vine? Like, I've been doing this forever. So you're looking at everything that's happening on social. You're always filming yourself. You've got a bunch of businesses. Do you feel comfortable not being busy? Yeah, I do, I actually do. But I don't feel comfortable not thinking. So that's where my brain doesn't turn off, but it's not stressed. This goes back to the detachment thing. Yeah. Like, I don't enjoy, like it's actually funny, in vacationing, I enjoy doing nothing. Beach, plop, eat, sleep, see ya. One week later, right? Like, chill. But like on a week, first of all, I try to maximize my family time to the fullest. So as you can imagine, like, if I'm not working, it's gonna be family stuff. Whether it's a family dinner, whether it's the weekend, whether it's a vacation. So like, it's family, right? And then like, if I find time where it's just me, like, you know, or with one family member, what have you, like, yeah, it's not that I have to be doing something. Like, I can lounge. Like, I can like sit on a couch and watch, I watched the entire Wednesday Adams, Wednesday thing on Netflix one afternoon. I'll do stuff, but here's why it's weird. I'll take the other angle on this. Today I'm gonna work all day and it won't feel like it for real, for real. You know, like, I would rather do the 31 meetings I'm gonna have today than if you said, hey, let's go skiing. Or like, let's clear the calendar and cook and listen to music. I don't want to. Like, it's not bad. Is that though, because you have, you're only accepting opportunities that you are excited about? Are you curating it that way? Or is it the whole thing kind of excites you? Yes. And so like, you are just, it's an in a game. It's a great question. Day to day, there's 30% of what I'm doing that I'm eating shit, because I'm operating. Things I don't want to be doing. You know, I don't want to be on the call. I was on the way here apologizing to a client for something I don't want to be doing. I gotta do that. You gotta do it. You know, like, so there's a lot of gotta. But you nailed it. But in the macro, I'm operating. Yeah. You know, I'm an operator. And you like doing it. It's fun. That's the play. When I met you, I almost immediately got a couple things. One, the detachment was really clear in the way that you're kind of like, you're chill. You're chilling. In a real way. Yeah. You're not attached to an outcome of this has to go really well. You're not like, you're pressed. You're not pressed. I'm not pressed. You're not pressed. He's not giving pressed energy. I'm just not. And I also don't think I'm anyone. Right? Not only am I not pressed, I also prefer humility over ego. Yeah. You know, like to me, what's attractive is when people don't think they're better than. Yeah. You know, I'm in a very weird part of my life where the circumstances of what I was passionate about as a kid that wasn't cool, business wasn't cool when I was coming up, has now become the coolest. Yeah. And all of a sudden, people are putting me on a pedestal in the street at an airport at the Knicks game. And I'm so grateful. And it feels so remarkable, but I don't think it means I'm somebody. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like I don't think it means that I'm better than them. It means that they think business is cool and I'm cool to them. The same way that I think Josh Hart is the coolest. Yeah. Cause I think basketball is cool. But just cause Josh Hart's a better basketball player to be doesn't mean that he's a better man than me and vice versa. Just cause I'm a great entrepreneur, doesn't mean I'm a better man than someone. And so that's how I think about it. Yeah. So today we're talking about a lot of like building of empires and really I think you're touching on what your life could look like optimizing for maybe being less pressed or optimizing for joy. I'm hearing you talk about what you want to take on. What that is what it looks like maybe when you start building an empire. We want to play a little game with you before we wrap up. That is sort of centered around what it looks like to think about creating an empire. Go ahead. So do you know that game F Mary kill? Yes. Okay. So we have like a version of that. I don't know how to say fuck on this. I think we can say. Okay, got it. Just wanted to make sure. We can say fuck. Okay. But we have a version of that which is like invest, compete, acquire. Okay. And compete means that I enjoy competing with them because I admire it or I want to compete with them because I think I can beat them. It means I'm going to give you three. We'll give you three companies and you pick one you want to invest in one you want to compete with. Yeah. And one you would acquire. I'll answer real quick. Compete, compete, compete. No you gotta pick one. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm joking. Twitch, social media edition. Okay. Twitch, TikTok, X slash Twitter. Very interesting. Twitch. So I'm going to make this really valuable for the audience. Yes. Let me break down. Yeah, let me break it down. So because I'm taking this way too serious already. The pressed one away. Now he's pressed about the answer. Marry fuck kill. And this is in the way. Invest, compete, acquire. Invest, compete, acquire. Twitch, TikTok, Twitter. Back to being a day trader. I can't take things macro. I have to take them in the way it is right now. Okay, okay. Yeah, today. TikTok's going to be banned in America. And they're not going to sell it to anyone. It just could be gone. So compete. Invest, compete, acquire. Compete with TikTok. Okay. Because I'm going to win by default because they're going to get disqualified. You're paying attention to what's happening in the market conditions. That's the attention. By the way, this first time I'm saying in public, I really think that's what's going to happen now. Yeah. Which is wild ass shit. Talk about someone who's excited. All that attention has to find new homes. People are going to be on Instagram. I'm like, come on back to Instagram, y'all. You know what I think is a dark horse shit to win in heavy. I think Twitter's going to relaunch fine. I love divine. Are you serious? I love divine. If I'm Elon and I'm sitting with that name and that IP, so easy for them to build it. Turn it back on. Everyone's going to be like, oh shit, this is the OG. It's going to work. Anyway, that's my little prediction. Okay, invest, compete, acquire. Compete with TikTok. Twitch versus X. Compete and acquire. Twitch versus X. Invest or acquire because you used your compete. Invest or acquire. I'm going, right, so these are both good, right? I believe in both of them. I would probably acquire X because I think X, but I think Elon's doing what I always thought, which was this could do a lot more. Twitter didn't change for a decade. I think X should be the most important streaming service on earth. Here's why. I think X should be Netflix or Hulu because we go to X to talk about the things that are on Netflix and Hulu. True. It would make natural sense for them to be a major streaming service. I think X could be a major, major streaming service. Where you both watch and talk about in the same place. Because it is the water cooler. That's true. And so I think there's something there, there, and you could really maximize one plus one equals 11 economics and so da, da, da, da. You build a TV into the water cooler. Okay, got it. Because then acquire Twitch. Acquire X, invest in Twitch. Oh, I'm sorry, acquire X, invest. I would acquire X because I'd want to operate all the opportunities I see for it. Yeah. And with Twitch, it's a great company and I love live streaming and streaming's continuing. I think streaming's in the place that social media was 10 years ago. 10 years ago, everybody knew social was big, but they didn't know how big, big it was. Yeah. That's back to what I saw. I think today people know streaming's big. They know Kaisenet, they know Aiden Ross, they know Clix, they know what's happening. But I don't think people understand in 10 years, it's gonna be like Omni present. Yeah, all the time. Well, thank you so much for kind of giving us this framework of your vision and how you think about scaling and growing businesses. This has been awesome. Thank you ladies. Thank you for being here.
