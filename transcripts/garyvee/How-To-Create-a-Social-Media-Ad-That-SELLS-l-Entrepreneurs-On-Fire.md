There's a dog walking business listener right now. She wants, or he wants more clients. If I can get them to start allocating another hour to five per day, per week, to just making content that's organic. But when they make it, they think about the different cohorts, people that have more money than others, gender, race. Some people have parents of kids with athletes, so they'll make a video like, hey, are you a parent of a kid that plays soccer or basketball or some other sport every weekend? I'm the dog walker for you. Now all of a sudden you're posting that. Now that the algorithm's gonna find people more likely like that, then if it does well, now you start running ad dollars on it, not upfront. Attention is the number one asset. Gary, you've always said that attention is just a major focus of yours, but the problem with getting attention is it can be quite, shall we say, expensive. So can you share the ways that we can get underpriced attention in today's landscape? I can. First of all, John, I just wanna give you some flowers. Podcasting is obviously an incredibly important medium in the world today, and I think it's potentially lost in history that you were one of the dozens that was moving first and hard on it, and I just want you to have that because you built on underpriced attention. You went all in on podcasting as it was emerging, and I feel as though you deserve credit on that, so I wanted to say that. And to that point, that's the game. This is why I'm obsessed with social media marketing. The most underpriced attention in the world right now is sitting on social media organic creative, right? The way the algorithms work now, social media is not the one that you, JLD, and I grew up with. That one was based on email marketing. Get as many people to follow you as possible, and then a percentage of those people would see your content when you posted it, right? If I had a million followers on Twitter, I would consistently get more views on my videos than you if you have 50,000, and I would stay within a general pocket. Now, the way it works is the content itself is the variable. And so, I may have 15 million followers on TikTok like I do. How many do you have, JLD? 175,000. The fact that you can make a better piece of content than me tomorrow that has the best practices for second thumbnail copy understands the culture of the slang of TikTok. I love that all your videos can get more views than my videos because the merit of the creative is the game, and that level of underpriced attention where there is no cost for distribution and there are some costs for creative, depending on how you do it, is by far the reason I'm obsessed with social media marketing and for both brand and sales, and I think more businesses, creators, influencers, podcasters, small businesses, SaaS, B2B, B2C, companies need to get, professionals need to get way more serious than being remarkable at day-to-day social because that's the organic thing. For big brands listening, Superbowl's underpriced media. It's underpriced attention. For $7 million, $8 million, $9 million, you could buy 110 million people watching a 30-second video that's impossible anywhere else. There's influencers that you can do deals with that are grossly underpriced. There's overpriced influencers. A Superbowl ad becomes overpriced when the creative 30-second video stinks and nobody acted on it. Now you just wasted all that money. So, you know, there's a lot of ways to get it, but my favorite underpriced attention games right now are event marketing and sponsorship, when done right, Superbowl, influencers and creators, and at the tippy top, perfect organic social media. What I love about this personally is that this gives hope to the listeners who are like, you know what? I have this passion, I have this micro niche I'm willing to go into and dominate and create the number one solution to a real problem in this niche, create remarkable, consistent content around that and I can win as a result. And solving a problem, if I may just jump in because I love the way you frame that, but I want someone to hear this, solving the problem is I might just be the best communicator on Zelda video games. And I'm entertaining and informing. When people hear solving problems, they think about things like what I do. I'll make you better at wine tasting. I'll make you better at marketing tactics. I'll make you better at having a good relationship with yourself and perspective. I'm proud of those three things, but there are many other problems to be solved. Escapism, entertainment, many other things to learn in detail like landscaping and cooking and makeup tutorials. So when JLD says solving a problem, I just want to make sure people understand that Eddie Murphy solved problems in the 1980s. He was entertaining and a comedian. And for three hours, if you went to his standup or went to watch one of his movies or two hours, he was solving the problem of life is hard and he was taking you out of your day to day struggles and putting you in a world where you laughed and smiled and that brings incredible value to you as a human. So solving problems comes in entertainment and education and information and pondering and fantasizing. For, you know, there's a lot of ways to quote unquote solve a problem. And to give flowers to a mutual friend of ours, Pat Flynn was also a major pioneer in the podcasting space. And guess what? Four years ago, he's playing Pokemon with his son who was obsessed with it. And Pat's like, wow, there's something here. I'm into this and I'm a creator. I know how to do certain things video wise, content creation wise that other people can't do in this specific space. And he went on, created this YouTube channel, Big Pocket Monster or Deep Pocket Monster, I think it is. And it blew up. He has almost a million subscribers. He's throwing a huge event in San Diego. He has way more knowledge and information and followers around that space now, even though he's only four or five years in, then he does around Smart Passive Income, which he launched back in 2008. So I mean, this is just an exciting time that we're in right now. And one thing, Gary, that I always talk about on this show is story. I love to say there's a reason why history is his story, her story. We're built around story. So share with us the science of storytelling. That's a great question. Look, I think there's a lot of different ways to build a story, the hero versus the villain. Things are gonna be okay at the end of the day. The shocking surprise ending. What's amazing about stories is all of us can relate with different characters. Like you think about Star Wars. There's people that relate with Han Solo more than Luke Skywalker, with Princess Leia, more than Darth Vader, with Darth Vader, more than Obi-Wan or Yoda or Chewbacca. And you can go on and on. Like, you know, for example, I'll give you a good one. One of the people I most relate to is Rocky Balboa. And the reason I really relate to Rocky Balboa is because he lost to Mr. T in Rocky III, because he did lose everything and went back to the slums of Philadelphia in Rocky V or VI or whatever that one was. You know, I like a story that has not only in a part of a film, but in the actual whole film that talks about adversity or starting from zero again or dealing with death, right? And in the many Rocky films, we watched him lose his mentor. We watched him struggle with his relationship with his son. We watched him, you know, we watched him lose his wife, who is like, Rocky, Rocky one's a love story. Adrian, I'm getting goosebumps. Adrian, Adrian to me is like, you know, especially like someone who like desperately loves their mom and like always kind of put like female, you know, tenderness and strength out of pedestal even before it became fashionable to some. You know, Adrian is so big for me. And yet she dies, right? Lion King, when I saw him, I was on a high school date with a girl and I cried in the middle of, you know, crying in 1994 in the middle of a theater as a senior in high school around Disney animation is not necessarily the coolest thing to do, but like the story captivated me so much because I loved my parents so much and I was able to put myself in the story. And then all of a sudden my dad dies. That hurts my feelings. Like, you know, stories are amazing. I tend to associate with a story where the lead character is not only dealing with adversity but I would say is enjoying adversity but is coping and dealing with discomfort and navigating and fighting and moving forward. I also associate with the superhero that gets punched in the face by the villain, like spits out his tooth and then looks back at the villain and says, now you're in fucking trouble because I have that gear in me, right? Like when I'm pushed to the edge, my greatest luck from DNA and parenting and circumstances, I fight back. I don't fold like a cheap chair. So I associate with that person. But my mother may associate more with somebody in a story like, you know, Steel Magnolia's and the mother figure. Like, you know, like, and so the elements of a story is, is it relevant? Does it associate? Does it make you connect? Do you see yourself in them? And are you a concise communicator? Stories come in different ways. When you review products like I did when I came out the gate and this is when you first saw me, I talked about wine in such a different slang than anyone else did before. Rap and hip hop is a storytelling medium that they did it, the pioneers in the late 70s into the early 80s when it was really being formed, they did it differently than music had been done before. They talked about different stuff than we had heard before. And so, you know, there's the communication style. There, you know, as you also know, because me, you, Pat Flynn and others, we grew up in that 2005, six, seven internet era. You remember, this is gonna land with you. I was like an interesting character because I was a little bit more jersey than like the business world had accepted. I dressed casual and I cursed. And as you know, as you think back, that really worked for a lot of people, but for a lot of people, it was a turn off. It was too aggressive. And I always understood that, but I always felt that if you speak your truth, you'll be in a better place than trying to conform to something you're not. And so the art of a story to me and the art of stories is, are you authentic to yourself first? You know, Jaleigh, again, I think this will make sense because we grew up in that era together. A lot of people, CA speakers, a lot of our friends at different events, they told me like, Gary, if you just take it 20% down, if you just took it down a notch, you'll be so much bigger. And these are people you respect. These are people that like at CAA, they're like showing me emails exchanges with people that say, we'll pay him $20,000 more. We'll pay him $40,000 instead of $20,000 for a speech, but can he do a couple of speeches, not cursing? And can you wear a suit? Can you tweak him a little bit? And you have to respect that. That's the market talking. But for me, it was more important for me to be authentic to me and to myself. And it allowed me to feel more comfortable to tell the stories. For me, when I spoke, it was less about me wanting to make as much money as possible. It was more that when I was on stage, I was obsessed with being historically correct. That what I talked about, about Twitter or Facebook or YouTube would become true because then I could trade on that reputation. And that matters to me. I'm in time again, you've been proven correct over the years, which brings up tick talkification. What is it and what is this impact on both content creation and brand building? Everybody should be inspired on this call because what we talked about earlier with my 15 million followers that year, 175,000 and Pat Flynn going to Pokemon versus profiting and me going to business instead of wine and all the other things we'll see through the years. The fact that it was harder to amass a million followers on YouTube subscribers for Pat, then every single person listening now in this new tick talkification, what does it mean? Joe, the actual, let's play a game. What have you not shared with your audience that is a hobby or like a micro or an emerging new passion of yours that you've picked up in the last three years? Give me anything. Pickleball. Okay, first of all, thank you for saying that because I own a pickleball team. I know. So the fact that you right now should forget about could should make a pickleball video, maybe a green screen from an article where you add your two cents or literally go outside and just like film yourself hitting it and then come over and be like, is anybody else like making new friendships? And like, whatever it is, whatever it is, that you should post that on your tick talk tomorrow because that content will find the pickleball audience, not the business podcast audience. Now it may get 40 views, but it also may get 43,000, but more interesting if your profile is set up properly with a link to your podcast and who you actually quote unquote are professionally besides pickleball. Somebody may see a pickleball video and agree with you that pickleball paddles should be better or that the best thing about pickleball is exercising with your grandfather or whatever it might be. But then they're gonna be like, oh, I like this. I agree with this guy. And then they're just gonna look at your profile and be like, what's this podcast? Like you will literally more likely, this is real talk. This is like crazy. This is like we're having a consulting meeting. I would say to you, brother, once a week, minimum five times a week, pickleball content on TikTok and YouTube shorts because they have, you know, Instagram's harder. I'll get them in a minute. But I think you would pick up more subscribers for this podcast because you started adding pickleball content to your content than the reverse. I do garage sale content, New York Jets content, wine content, business content, branding content, parenting content, now a ton of VFriends content, which is my Pokemon meets Sesame Street. And for some people it's too much and like, Gary, he's all over the fucking place. What is this bullshit? But the way that world actually now works is it's finding its different cohorts and audiences. And that's because the TikTokification what we talked about earlier. Anyone listening right now can post something on these platforms and get 100,000 views. Whereas for 15 years, if you only had 49 followers on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or LinkedIn or YouTube, well, you got seven or nine or 11 views. Now, everybody listening right now can create an Instagram, Facebook, YouTube shorts, Snap spotlight, TikTok, and I recommend all of them. And posting these algorithm based feeds, LinkedIn just announced theirs. People that have never posted anything about business under LinkedIn write one article or you take a clip from an audio clip from your podcast from this episode, post in your LinkedIn and you may find 20,000 new people that consume it, of which 147 signed up for your podcast. This is how your podcast would grow. Byrne Nation, I hope these are spinning the wheels in your own mind about your brand, your building, your attention, which brings us to day trading attention, Gary, because we have five minutes left. I wanna make the most of it. When you write a book, it is the first thing that's on my Audible wish list, the first thing that's on my Amazon wish list. I read it, I listen to it, I do it at the same time because it's just always entertaining, great, meaningful content. So talk to us about day trading attention. Thank you. First of all, we have 10 minutes because I wanna milk every second with you. Two, thank you. And I think the reason you do that and the reason of people that haven't heard about me in a while or hearing me for the first time or have heard of me and they're like, who is that guy anyway? Like, I think the reason JLD does that is I have enough of a track record 15 years in of I'm of the moment and then I'll write a book every three, four years of the moment. This is really the follow up to Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook JLD. So like day trading attention is, so okay, we've established that organic social media is definitely the answer for everyone here. But now the question becomes which platform? So for example, I know most people that are advanced in social media content that are listening right now are doing either a podcast and then chopping up some clips, doing YouTube long form, or most likely have Instagram and TikTok as their core. With a little bit of Twitter and Facebook potentially being the next year, with almost nobody taking LinkedIn as a social network or Snapchat spotlight as serious alternatives to these feeds. YouTube shorts, different than long form, also mailed in by too many. Yet I know every person here, whether they're trying to build their podcast, sell more roses at their flower store, get more people to use their auto body shop, get more people to consume them as a thought leader and buy their courses or programs, that three or four of those seven platforms will come more native to them. Everybody should be marketing on more platforms and what content you put where and how do you do it in what I call PAC platforms and culture when you make content is the variable of their success. Plain English, there's a dog walking business listener right now, or he wants more clients. I know that Facebook organic, if I can get them to start allocating another hour to five per day, per week to just making content that's organic. But when they make it, they think about the different cohorts, people that have more money than others, gender, race, what side of the tracks do they live on this neighborhood? Some people have parents of kids with athletes, so they'll make a video like, I'm just gonna go very detailed for this audience. Hey, are you a parent of a kid that plays soccer or basketball or some other sport every weekend? I'm the dog walker for you. Now all of a sudden you're posting that. Now that the algorithm is gonna find people more likely like that, then if it does well, now you start running ad dollars on it, not upfront, I go into very deep, deep detail. JLD, remind me, did we send you the galley or you don't have it yet? Don't have it yet. When I tell you, when you get it, right, when you listen to me reading it on Audible or you get one, and I think a lot of people are gonna end up cause they like when I read it and I go off script, are gonna get the Audible, but then they're gonna realize how many times I'm referring to the book with the charts and shit, and so I think people are gonna buy this book and it's more of an evergreen book. Even if someone as advanced as you, because I have a 2,000 person global agency, the thing that has happened the last seven years with me that I think is under the radar as my notoriety and my awareness got bigger, is the whole time I've been building VaynerMedia. This is gonna be impressed by this a bit. VaynerX now is 2,000 people globally. It's a $350 million business. I'm the active, active CEO of the company. So not only do I, and as you know over the last five years, Gary Vee, the brand has gotten bigger, not smaller, so I'm personally a practitioner of this, but I also have the luxury of seeing my agency spend billions of dollars in media, charge hundreds of millions of dollars to make pictures and videos and creative for it, and I watch how the Fortune 500 works versus the companies I invest in. I see how the emerging creator brands work, like Poppy or Prime or Beastables. I'm me, and I'm watching. So the level of detail I went into this book, when I think about somebody buying a book for $28 on Amazon, which will probably go down by the time this comes out in a month, where I don't know when you're gonna air this, it's probably out now, but it's probably under, you know how Amazon works, it keeps going down in price until it finally hits its launch date. I'm obsessed with people getting value for 20 to 30 bucks. I'm so peace of mind in this book because every chapter, because I go into every platform or every thesis, post-creative strategy, reading every comment after you post all these things, every page has $30 value, but the answer comes into that dog walker. Does she know that she's more comfortable in being in LinkedIn and talking professional versus being on TikTok and maybe being a little quote unquote cooler? Does she understand that Instagram is competitive now with day trading? Day trading is supply and demand. Instagram has so much content right now, posted on it every day, and some of the attention has fragmented to YouTube shorts and to TikTok, so now all of a sudden, like four years ago, it's harder to get reach because the attention has moved. Meanwhile, Elon, any moment now is gonna relaunch Vine, which was the original platform for a short form video, and the people that go there first and go ham on it, especially people that look like me that already have audiences elsewhere, they're gonna get underpriced attention because there's not gonna be as much content made at first for the amount of people that are actually on it. That's what happened on threads, but threads didn't really stay, right? So it was awesome for a month, and that was great for me. I crushed underpriced attention on threads. Now, it might be proper attention because there's not enough attention for the amount of work you put in, but for me, I'm going omnichannel, so every channel is something I'm gonna trade on, but I'm a psycho and I'm going for broke. For somebody who's got a small business and is trying to pick a platform or two, couple things, you should be on many more platforms, use the same video, but in the book, I'll show you and I'll do it right now, or if you can't afford the book, go to Pirate Bay and steal it. I don't care, but get the information in your head because the first second of a video on YouTube, shorts should be different than the first second in thumbnail and copy on a video that you put out on Facebook. Because on Facebook, you know it's gonna skew older. On Facebook, you know it's gonna skew a little bit more local family vibes, whereas YouTube is more of a search engine, where TikTok is more trending and cool, which is Instagram, which is more like the magazine and the establishment, which is Twitter, where it's a little bit more contentious and political. Every room is different, every platform has different things, carousels versus reels. Everything's got best practices per video, but you can court one video and get six posts out of it, but the copy on every post needs to be different. The first second, some of the hooks, some of the slang even. You might have to make two different videos, one for under 35, one for over 35, because you in the video wanna use different terminology, different analogies. If I make a reference to the Cosby show in my video of why I'm trying to make a point, I'm gonna do that for 45 and older. And that same thing, I might make a, if I'm going for 35 and under, I might make a Nickelodeon, hey dude reference. And if I'm going for Gen Z, I might make a reference to 310 Baby or the rap battle between Drake and Kendrick and Rick Ross. So like context, the obsession with context, the obsession with distribution, what are the platforms caring about? TikTok Live, they care, so they're giving you more awareness. This is real fucking science, bro. I go really fucking deep. In a two hour podcast, let alone a 35 minute one, I can't get there. That's what often forces me to write the books when I write them. When I know, I'm like, oh fuck, I need 300 pages to help fuckers on this. Fire Nation, you can hear the passion, you can hear the fire, and Gary, you're so kind to really squeeze out every minute that we have together, because I've seen your schedule, it's back to back. I remember when you used to do those videos where you would actually show your whole day because people wouldn't be busy or crazy your life was. And I used to watch every one of those just being like, man, this guy is a bee, he's an animal. And that was like 10 years ago, and you're still doing it, it's unbelievable. So finish with one word, authenticity. Why is it important to bring it home? You know, it's funny, I'll use that word and bring that home back to why I'm still doing it. People ask me a lot now, it's different. They thought 15 years ago I was doing it for the money, or the fame. Now they're like, what the fuck's going on? I'm like, I was telling you back then. I mean, look, I'm looking at my book right now, crush it. Let's read the first title ever, the first book I ever put, JLD, you know this is the book that put me on the map. Why now is the time to crush it? And why now is the time to cash in on your passion? The key there isn't cash, the key is passion. Authenticity matters because if you're doing something that is authentic to you, then the audience will know it's authentic to them. And that is the key. Most people don't do things that are really in their soul. They're looking to achieve success, to put band-aids on wounds they have with their own insecurities. Their own trauma of the past. They believe that money will let them buy things to fix things. And I believe at 48 years old that that is false. I believed it at 18, but I know it to be true at 48, because I've had the luxury of spending so much time with people that in my youth, and even now, don't have quote unquote a lot of money. And I have tons of opportunities to spend time with people that have way more money than me and some of the most monies in the world. And there's no correlation. So I think authenticity is why I'm still doing this. Authenticity is why I'm on this podcast with you. I authentically like you. I authentically like your audience because I like you and I know that that audience is gonna be attracted to you. And I authentically love the game of building. I'm like, you know, I wasn't good at Legos, but if I had slightly different DNA, I would have been the best Lego person of all time because I like building. I don't like, I'm not a general contractor and I'm not a developer in real estate, but I've had slightly different, I would be an amazing, amazing developer. I would be a remarkable coach for a sports team because I love the process of taking something from one state to a better state, primarily based on emotion, then built on tactic. And that's why I find myself 15 years being public around mindset and those things and tactics. This book's exciting for me because I just wrote a book 12 and a half, a couple years ago, that was very mindset, very perspective, very macro. Look what happens. I go right back and follow up three, four years later with day trading attention, which is tactical as fuck. I literally was bored at parts of reading my book because it was like so technical and obviously I knew what I was writing. Like I just had to get through it, but I was also pumped because I know everyone's different kinds of learners, but authenticity matters because authenticity is the only thing that allows sustainability. The reason I'm still here, JLD, and you've seen a lot of personalities, you and I grew up in the same internet era. You know this, in 2005, six, seven, eight, nine, I was bet on as someone who would come and go because I was so loud. People confuse loud as not substantive, but amongst the personalities that were part of that era with me and back in 2006, seven, eight, I like where I sit amongst the 10,000 people that were vying for being successful and important in 2024. I think I've done a pretty damn good job out of that crew. I can say without reservation, you sit at the top as number one of those 10,000s. Fire Nation, day trading attention, May 21st, get it in Audible, get it in Amazon, any bookstore that you want, Gary, last sentence, and then we'll say goodbye. When you're 97 years old, none of this shit's gonna matter, so please focus on being happy, be nice to people. It always comes back to you, spend more time with the people you love, and find something you love the way I love communicating opportunity. And honestly, this book ties to crush it. I believe at this exact moment, when you hang up at the end of this right now, when you stop, when this stops and goes on to the next JLD video or podcast, please just understand how, the world is selling you so much negativity, why everything's never been worse, everything's never been better if you decide it. And so you have a huge opportunity, and so if you're passionate about accounting, or hairdressing, or pickleball, or rugby, or anything, the opportunity to be great at organic social media to then start the process of you living a happier professional life, which we'll bleed into having a happier life, is more real than when I wrote Crush It because of the tic-tac-ification, and I couldn't be more interested in you seizing that because smiling is better than frowning. Gary, I love your brother. I love you, my man. Thank you, my man. See you next time.
