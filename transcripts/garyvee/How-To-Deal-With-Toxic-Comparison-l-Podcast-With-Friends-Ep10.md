The most scary thing for me is that, and Gary, I want to know if you go through this. We spent decades hustling 24-7, 365, to build to where we are today. Now we have teams of hundreds of people. In order to let them do what they do well, you have to let go. So my fear is the letting go and does it spiral out of what I've built? Or do I really trust that the people that I've built, the team that I've built, can actually handle it? And I can actually let go, breathe, and maybe build a new chapter, but that letting go is always a little bit very scary. Respect, and I understand. For me, it's not because I'm not scared of cleaning up the mess. I'm not scared of accountability, that it was my fault to give them too much room. So that's first two, the I'm sorry. Like, if I let somebody do something that was for something important and it failed, I'm very comfortable going to the person being like, I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm very comfortable with accountability. I like to support my team when they make mistakes. I don't yell. I want to hold them accountable. Like, yo, we fucked that up. Let's own that shit. I love jumping in me. Like, I suck. I own this. Like, you know, like, I'm very good at that. So I'm lucky in that one. I think one of the reasons I have 7,340,000 businesses is because I love letting go, because I'm just not scared of the mess. Attention is the number one asset. Inernation, how are you? Another episode of Podcasts with Friends, where we get three incredible people together with the hopes that they become friends. And more importantly, that all of you become friends with them as you get to discover their journeys. We'll talk, you know, we'll talk vulnerably and transparently about the journey, because I think that's more and more of what brings value. And we will get to know them. A big shout out to Twitch Army, twitch.tv, slash GaryBee. GaryBee.com, slash Twitch, if you want to join us live there. I also scream my entire day. It's just me sitting in the office. It's definitely some ASMR for all the entrepreneurs out there. So really excited about it. Let's go around the horn and give everybody two or three minutes to say who they are and what they do. And then we'll go into it a little bit more. Ladies first, let's kick it off. Hi, everyone. My name is Umi. I am a multi-dimensional artist. And my deepest intention is to create art that makes people feel warm and reminds them of the human connection that we have with one another. My music is very healing in its nature, but also very experimental. We're just talking about genres. And I don't really like to explain my music through genre because I really have a playful childlike spirit. So I like to play with all different types of sounds, but I think my voice and my intention is the thread that brings it all together. And meditation is also a big part of my music. So if you come to my shows, I always open with the meditation. My live streams, I always start and end with the meditation. So if you're interested in connecting more with your soul, I think my music will sit right in your belly for you. So that's who I am. Where are you from? I'm from Seattle. Born and raised? Born and raised. My mom's Japanese, so I spent also a lot of time in Japan. Every summer I would go out there. That's amazing. You have family there. I have family there. So amazing. We'll get more into it. My man? Well, firstly, thanks for having me. I'm so excited to be here. I've seen this office on social media for so long, so it's a real honor to be here. And I'm looking forward to listening to your music because that sounds really cool. I need a bit of that in my life. So my name's Joe Wicks, also known as the body coach. And I'm from the UK and I started out like most trainers in a park, boot camps, one-to-one training. And I love that from the start. I always enjoyed getting people moving. And then I pivoted and started sharing stuff on digital with Instagram video back in 2014. Short little 15-second videos. I called it Lean in 15, so like a 15-second... Do you remember in the old days, it was 15 seconds back in the day. So a healthy recipe in 15 minutes on a 15-second video. That led to cookbooks and a publishing deal in the UK. And I've actually sold four million cookbooks from that idea. So that's pretty crazy. And along the way, I launched a digital product. So like a PDF, quite sort of old-school fitness plan, which nearly, you know, almost a million people signed up to. And more recently, we launched fitness apps. We've sort of digitised the business. So essentially it's a fitness brand, but I do healthy cookbooks. I do a lot of work with kids. And my proudest achievement is during lockdown, I did a live stream every day for 18 weeks called PE with Joe, which was basically like a 30-minute workout for families and children. And that had a million live connections most days and 100 million people took part. So that's my kind of proudest career moment. It was massive. It was massive. Yeah, and I just loved the mission. Ultimately, I just think about getting people moving, get people cooking, essentially for their physical, but also their mental health. And that's the kind of North Star that I focus on. So there we go. Good stuff. That's inspiring. Nice. Thank you. My friend. What's up? My name is Jeff Staples. What up, Twitch? How you doing? Damn, I feel inferior. I have inferiority complex here, Barry. No, no, no. Listen, bro, I felt pretty bad about myself. I have two of them, so two. This is the Jersey side of the table. Just two of you sitting on this side. I guess, like, if you know anything about people lining up for sneakers or reselling sneakers or kids making streetwear, some people blame me for that. So I might be part of the problem there. I started my brand in 1997 called Staples. I started it by breaking into Parsons School of Design to hand silk screen 12 shirts. I flipped them in Soho. 12 became 24, became 48. And I just continued on for there for just 25 years, still doing the same snowball, rolling over and over. Along the way, I collaborated on a shoe that many people know in 2002 called the Nike SB Dunk. That is one of the grails of sneaker culture. Like, Sotheby's just sold one for $100,000. Wow. Why that one for 100? Rarity, I guess. Is that one pushing that number now? Yes. Is that right? Yeah. That's crazy. Gary's like, put it on my shopping list. No, I'm like, I have one. I just think I... Yeah. Oh, shit. I just didn't realize it got up to that. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, no, I'm just trying to innovate for the next quarter century, trying to spread the word of independent creativity and thinking that me, as a Chinese-American first generation, my parents came here to have me as the first blue-passported US citizen, that you don't have to be a doctor or a lawyer. And I had to fight a lot of that with my traditional Chinese parents that there is another career path, so I'm trying to show young kids that hopefully it doesn't take them 25 years to do what I did. It just takes three. If I can give them the cheat codes to it. I love that. Yes, we reply to the stream for the people that are asking, big shout out to Dake who's going back to YouTube because he doesn't want ads. Respect. Big shout out to PokerProsNFT, who's buying Tier 1 stubs so people don't have to get ads. There's a lot going on at the watch. For the podcast that's listening at home, there's a lot going on in the live, which is a lot of fun. We'll interject them in a little bit. But let me back to you. You know, so, okay, I hear what you're going with. And so I'm like, of course, Japan is such a sacred place for the energy that you're bringing to the table, so that makes sense. Yeah. When did the meal that you are, because you had ingredients, right? I like that. Right? Right? You're into music. You have this Japanese part of your family. Like, when do you think you started wanting to be who you are? Or when did you think you could have begun to believe you could be who you are? Or when did things start to become kind of like less hazy and like clarity of like what you might take a stab at that has created this? When did that go down? I think there's like two phases. Phase one is my childhood, because ever since I was little, I've always known I was going to be an artist. An artist, musical. I know because the way I would play, my form of play was always music. It would be standing on top of the bed, pretending my sisters were my fans, or like building a studio in my room. My dad was a DJ, so he had like a tape recorder, and I would like pretend to be singing my tracks. So that's how I know it's just my spirit. Yep. But I will say I had the worst stage fright for most of my life. Interesting. I was so scared to sing in front of people, which is what made me start my YouTube channel. So it all works out in the end, but when I got to college, I started doing open mics every week. And that's when I really committed to my... Was that in Seattle area or no? In LA. I went to USC. Not even with the intention of graduating. I knew I was going to be an artist, but I knew I had to get... You just need to get to LA. I need to get to LA. I need to get over the sphere. So you were watching USC football and rooting for Sam Darnold to become your track? No, not at all. Everyone was out the dorm, so that's when I record my songs. Yeah, of course. And I put them out on SoundCloud, and I would do open mics every week, and I would take these opening slots for performances. At that point in your life, if I may interject... Yes, please. Who were you looking up to musically? I was really looking up to SZA, Frank Ocean. Those are my main influences at that time. I feel so weird. I mean, I feel... Because she's looking up to people that are... I feel like are modern. I thought she was going to say like Marvin Gaye or like Prince or something. I'm not very much inspired by like D'Angelo, Air Cabo, I believe this is much. Yeah, thank you for making the OG feel a little bit better. Yeah. And SZA and Frank... I mean, both of that, if you like... I don't know how deep you go. Like, I don't know. They've been around for a while, maybe not to the level of fame, especially SZA now, so happy for her, but like, the undergrounds are so, so new. I know, I just... I mean... I feel like I was just in front of her, she was like... I just now know our difference, our age gap is by her answer. How old are you? Young, how old are you? You look pretty young. I'm 48. Wow, you look good, man. I'm 48. You look pretty too. Are you 75, 1975? Yeah, 1975. 1975, Jersey, right here in the house. But I was born in the USSR in 75. Okay, a little bit different. What's your birthday? March 7th. You're older. I remember 14. You're so old. You're the oldest person in the room. So that's what was going on. So you were scared, even though you were doing it in front of your sysses, outside of that, you were like, fuck that shit, I'm scared. You were worried about judgment? Judgment, mainly judgment. I feel like I was... My voice isn't the best voice, I'm not the best performer. Like, think that you have... You didn't know at that point that you didn't need to be the best at anything if you had it and you were good enough that you could really do it. Yes. Because when I think... Even when you were talking, I was like, man, I should put out music. I swear to God, when you were literally talking, I'm like, I think it's time for me to put out music. Downloads. Because I feel like I can really spit bars, but I have no musical talent. And I mean zero. And I mean like Robert Parrish, which is double zero. You were about double zero. You were double zero. But like... But I'm kind of like, man, even with double zero, I think I can pull it off with all the fucking bullshit that they do now with auto-tune and this and that. I feel like I can figure it out. You didn't realize at that point that you had enough of everything to pull it off. Yes. That makes sense. That's honestly it. It's like you go up on stage and you feel that... You try to understand when people are going through their minds, you can't really know what's happening, but I'm like, oh, they're judging me, they're thinking this, they're thinking that. But that's what made me start my shows with a meditation because I would have to calm myself down because I couldn't even breathe when I would go on stage. Interesting. So I would breathe, ask the crowd to breathe with me, and then over time that turned into a whole thing that I do. You still get stage fright? No, I love being on stage now. Oh, now you turned it into an addiction. It's like, I can't work to go on stage. Turning your fear into an addiction. Have you done public speaking? Yeah, I used to be really nervous to hate it. And have you? Yeah, a lot, yeah. Do... Do... You still, all three of you, so all of you do it, you still get that adrenaline rush that is like a mix of confidence, concern. Like, I'm very... I'm a very highly compensated public speaker and I have one of those careers, and I, doesn't I broke something? And I still sometimes, once in a while, have the fuck, I would call it once every seven times. The second, before I go on stage, I have this thought of like, is this gonna... Because I do full improv. When I tell you, right, that's like, you know, like the second before I'm on stage, I'm like talking to the officer, like, tomorrow we gotta do the meet, like the second before. They're like, and Gary, like, Vaynerchuk. And I'm like, all right, make sure we send this to the client tomorrow. Like, I'm working. I'm 100%... Oh, done it again. Down again. I'm 100%... 100% improv. Just reaching the heart. Yeah, I'm the same. 100% improv. But do you still get nervous? And so because... Well, it's not gonna get nervous, but because I'm 100% improv, I do have this one out of every seven times. I'm like, is this gonna be the time where I don't know what to say? Because it flows. It's full, back to music. I'm the guy, if I was a rapper, I would go in completely from the top of the dome. Completely. And so, anyway, for the three of you, you're still getting those mix of energies. Even you at this point, you say you love it, but there's still some mix of that, right? Yeah, definitely. You? Not really. You know what my nervousness comes from? Will they show up? Oh, and so if I'm not organizing the people to come into the seats, I'm good. But if I'm responsible for bringing people into their seats, I wanna walk out and know that if there's like three people in a room and 100 empty seats, I get really, really nervous. I'm so the other way. When I tell you, I have no attachment to my self-worth based on attendance. I, if two people show up, I get fired up. That's awesome. Because my brain goes into, this doesn't represent if I'm good or not. Clearly something went wrong. There shouldn't be two people here when there should be a thousand. But my brain very quickly goes to, these two fucking people have just walked in. You just changed your life. Yes. The ultimate fucking experience. I'm trying to train myself for that. Bro, I'm telling you, go there. I'm like, you two? Come on stage. You won. Because I'm about to fucking change your life. We might become a family. Come with me. Travel home with me. I just think you can make lemons, lemonade, that whole thing. What? To me, it's like, what? Yeah. Back to judgment. Like what? Were you always that way? Did you learn that? I got very fortunate in that I had a lot of adversity as a kid. And I had incredible mothering. And yeah, something I've started to talk about a little bit more is how I crushed peer pressure in high school. And now I've decided that if you do that, there's nothing even close after that when you get older. And I really crushed high school. Like if my high school friends are even in the chat right now, like they know I was weird as fuck. Like friends with everyone. And I was in the 90s. Like now kids are trying to fake be nicer to each other. This was like no fucking, like Jersey? And we grew up, we graduated in 94, 93. 93. Okay, I'm 94. So we grew up in the exact same year. People were pantsing each other in the hallway. Yes. Do you know what a book check is? No. Do you know what a book check is? See, book check is when you're carrying a shit ton of books and a kid just comes in. Book check. They really do that. That's nothing. Do you know what pantsing is? Is that wedgie? No. By the way. It's absurd. And the prerequisite, if you wanted to be in the top 10% of popularity, you had to have 60% meaning in you. Because it was just a currency. And I just was not ever willing to compromise. Yeah. I had all the pieces to be as popular as I wanted to because I was charismatic and I was who I was. And I wasn't scared. But the reason I never went to the tippy top and just stayed there and I went coast to coast and with different friend groups and genders races, like coolness factors, like my single best friend Brandon Warnacky, who I talked to today, who runs Wine Library, my best friend in the world. He was so nerdy. The glasses, if I showed you Brandon Warnacky's high school photo right now, he makes Urkel look like fucking Brad Pitt. Whoa. And I didn't give any fucks because he was the best dude and that was my focus. And this all goes back to your question. Yes, I've always been like that. But more importantly, the reason I'm telling this story is singularly to get everyone else like that. Yes. I'm desperate to build people's self-esteem. I'm desperate to get people to lean into confidence. I'm desperate for people to understand that if someone's mean to you, that is no reflection on you, it's a reflection on them. Someone shits on you. Don't feel bad for you. Feel bad for them. Because they're in a bad place. Could you imagine walking around Earth trying to make people feel bad? That's crazy. And now the sad thing is... The sad thing is now you could do it from your living room sofa and just talk shit in the comments everywhere. That's the modern-day version of that. And brother, when I tell you every single time I see it, I feel bad for them. I just don't know how to feel bad for me. I check myself. I love that. I don't want to be high on my own supply. I read it. I read it and I try to take it in. Because I don't want to become delusional and overconfident. I don't want to misstep. Because the way I see my career, and I'm curious, we'll jump back into y'all three. Look for you to answer this. I think my career, it doesn't matter. You're on the beginning's journeys of this. You've done some real shit, my guy, and you're a fucking legend. I kind of think about my career as like, I'm aware of what I've done. I got a lot of wins. But I think of this as sports. Like, you know, like... Roger Federer wasn't the same Roger Federer last year than he was seven years earlier. Like, I watched Larry Bird not look like the Larry Bird that I saw as a little, little kid. I watched Jordan and Kobe and many others. I saw what Drew Brees and I saw Peyton Manning's last year. That wasn't the Peyton... And Beckham and Rinaldo. It happens to everyone. And that's what I think about my career. The reason I listen to the negative or the pushback is because who gives the fuck what I did yesterday? Like, this could be the beginning of me not being as good at what I do. So humility is my favorite relationship. On the same token, I have complete conviction and confidence of who the fuck I am. And so I take it, first passes humility. Is there anything behind this that is right? Am I losing a step? Am I getting delusional? Have I lost touch? You get really scared when you come from nothing and you go somewhere of losing touch. The street's not fucking with you anymore. But quickly, because I'm pretty good at that and I check myself, quickly I go into deep compassion and sympathy that this person's in a bad fucking place. You know what it is? We're all only as good as our last output. You could have fucking nine Grammy award-winning albums, but then if your 10th one is a dud, you are unfortunately just on that and same with you. We're not accountants or lawyers where there is a hard right and wrong. If you're a rockstar account, it's because you've never made a clerical error on your tax returns. You're a rockstar, right? But us, it's subjective. So we do have to be... We always have that sort of like... When do you move the total of the horrors? Go backwards. Oh, actually, we haven't even gotten deep yet. Go ahead. I'm sorry, I'm too excited. I'm enjoying it. I at least have it. Go deep. What were you asking me? Actually, let me ask you this. What are you most scared of right now? No bullshit. Say something that you didn't even think you were going to say. Coming into this. What are you most scared of right now? That's a good question. I think I'm scared of building... Well, what I've built, I'm so proud of it. I've had so much impact. And I always feel like that P. E. J. moment in lockdown will always be like my career defining moment. I often think, what can I do that will be more meaningful than that? Cos it was so big. I just felt so big, but also I felt so connected. I was like, this is... Cos it was my dream. My dream was to get kids in the UK moving, exercising, like really, really kind of looking after their mental health. And so I think, how can I eclipse that moment? And a fear of kind of like... When I do... If I run out of energy for this, who's going to carry on the legacy? Who's going to keep the mission alive? Because I'm so connected to it. I'm so passionate about young people, mental health, and getting kids exercising and eating as well. Cos we live in a time now where kids are suffering, like mental health's increasing, social media's taking over, technology. And so it's that fear of kind of, yeah, when I... That you'll never do anything more meaningful than what you just did? It's a really good... By the way, it's real. Back to music. It's rare for people to make a more meaningful album than their first one. I think it's just people aren't growing. I think it's because they have their whole life to do the first one. Mmm. Yeah. Think about that. Think about what our child... Think about... I'm sure you do. You're a musician. You know, you have your whole... I'm with you. I'm not saying it's impossible. We've seen tons of people do it. I'm saying most people's most meaningful album is their first... True, most people. ...and they have their whole life to do it. Yeah. Same happened with my cookbook. My first cookbook, I sold like 1.4 million copies. It's the second best-selling cookbook of all time. And then everything after that was in... It's in the shadows, but I don't have that kind of connection at all. And by the way, those books right there, I've written five New York Times best-selling books. The first one, Crush It. It was my purest expression of what I'd been thinking. I also... It was timing. I predicted influencers and YouTubers. And that was a moment in time. Me coming out and being like, you can make money on social media. It's not very profound right now. When I wrote that shit in 2008, people were like, what the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, true. You know, there's moments in time. You know? What about you? Not the same, ironically. Maybe in fact... You wouldn't say that in fashion. People's first collections are their best ever, because I think there's this cumulative build on the seasonal thing. Yeah, because I agree. And plus, with music, especially if they're the writer, again, it's like you're a book, an album, you're writing. With fashion, I think it's more like entrepreneurship. You're gaining skills along the way. Exactly. And it's a collaboration. It's constant collaboration. I feel the most empathy for musicians because of what you have to do. Like, just go up there. The only profession I feel worse for than musicians is comedians. Oh, felt. Comedians, for them to just go up on stage, no hype man, no band. I actually... Make me laugh, motherfucker. Literally? Literally? I'm completely the other way. Right now, I think the people that have it best are comedians. What? Because they're the only ones that can spit facts without people having feelings. Okay, true. True. Understood. Right? Understood. But think about it, we need to get out of comedians, man. Oh, my God. Really? I'm such a feelings person. I'm using it as a different slender. All I care about is emotional intelligence. I'm all about feelings. I mean, we're in a very entitled state right now. I think everything's best when it's balanced. Balance is something I think a ton about. I'm obsessed with this concept of purple. In the UK and the US, the political systems are flipped. Are red and blue. And I think all the answers are purple. And I just think we've gotten so... In our feelings about talent, we spend so much energy explaining why shit is fucked up for us that it makes us unhappy. We're just pointing fingers, which makes us hopeless. When you don't think it's your fault, you're dead. There's something amazing with accountability. If everybody, all the 100 plus people that are watching right now and the millions that will listen to this podcast over the next year or two, if every one of them said to themselves right now with anything they're unhappy about, that it's their fault or they're capable of getting out of it, their lives would be 10,000 times better. Now, of course, when I say things like that, people are like, right now, driving and saying, fuck you, Gary, my dad just got fucking cancer. And that's what I'm upset about. How is that my fault? Of course not. That's not what I'm referring to. But if you're like, fuck my job, post on LinkedIn until you get new job offers. Like no one can complain about their job on Earth. This is how I really believe this. Because we live in this new world, people will talk about all the downsides of social. Every human who doesn't like their job, all they have to do is post about what they know in their career, constantly on LinkedIn, and they will have unlimited job offers. Yeah, that's true. I think about that shit. Accountability is an intoxicating drug to happiness. It is. It's like realizing it's all here, outward. It reminds me of confidence, because I feel like recently I've been stepping into deeper levels of confidence. I love that. I'm realizing it's an empowered self thing. And if it's embodiment, and if you can embody confidence, embody self-knowing, and it doesn't derive from out here, it's the most sustainable form. And it's the same with happiness. Your happiness has to come from your own connection to your source with your own sense of self. And that's the most sustainable way to be happy. Of course, because that game is simple. Mmm, simple. The more simplicity is the fucking anecdote. Yeah. What are you most excited about? Oh, I don't get to answer the one we're excited about. We moved on. You're in full control. You don't have to answer my question. You can answer the question prior that you want to answer. I would like to address the most scary part. Then we would love to hear it, Jeff Staple. All right. The most scary thing for me is that, and Gary, I want to know if you go through this. Please. We spent decades hustling 24-7, 365 to build to where we are today. Now we have teams of dozens, hundreds of people, right? And in order to let them do what they do well, you have to let go. Yes. So my fear is the letting go, and does it spiral out of what I've built? Or do I really trust that the people that I've built, the team that I've built, can actually handle it? And I can actually let go, breathe, and maybe build a new chapter, but that letting go is always a little bit very scary. Respect, and I understand. For me, it's not because I'm not scared of cleaning up the mess. Oh! That just unlocked a lot in my head, yep. You like that? I like that a lot. Real talk. This goes back to not being scared of two people showing up. It's the same energy. Both you bringing that up and this is your thing. I think the reason I do so many damn things, and have so much going on, is because I'm genuinely not scared of multiple things. I'm not scared of accountability, that it was my fault to give them too much room. So that's first. Two, the I'm sorry. Like if I let somebody do something that was for something important and it failed, I'm very comfortable going to the person, being like, I'm sorry. Like if I said, Tyler, they'll go do something with you, we got that relationship, and he doesn't do it well, even though he's been here for a decade and you know him and all that, and it doesn't go well, it's uncomfortable sending the text, and be like, yo, can I call you for five minutes? And be like, Jeff, I should have fucking, I'm sorry, my guy really thought we had it. I should have been there, I apologize. I'm very comfortable with accountability. I like to support my team when they make mistakes, I don't yell. Like I want to hold them accountable, like yo, we fucked that up, let's own that shit. They'll tell you right now, we're going through a lot of different patterns with my content. I love jumping in me, like I suck, I own this. Like I'm very good at that, so I'm lucky in that one. I think one of the reasons I have 7,340,000 businesses is because I love letting go, because I'm just not scared of the mess. Can I ask a question? Please. You're always so positive, is there anything you're scared of? Is there anything in life you're fearful of? The things I can't control. So there's nothing in business I am scared of, nothing. If you lost it all, you'd just start again. You know that, don't you? In a way that's super weird, like in a way that's probably not healthy. In a way that I get concerned that I may subconsciously sabotage myself. To test yourself to see if you could do it. Jeff, it's so fucked up, it's like something. When I watched that Rocky where he lost everything and was back in Philly, like two minutes in once I understood what the movie was about, I started, I noticed that I was smiling and I was like, stop it. There's something very fucked up about how much I love the dirt and the zero and the process and the not being known and the under. Like this goes back to like, I probably eat, like this is now getting, I'll be vulnerable. I'm not even sure. I'll give you an example. Like VaynerMedia, VaynerX. VaynerMedia and VaynerX is a 2000 person, $350 million a year business. I read it. I started from scratch. My brother, AJ. 82% of the people that see my content are like, he's an influencer. He's a motivational speaker. My most substantial business and definitely, and you know this, like what I do in non-profit, what I do, like the best shit about me on paper is the thing that least is known about me. Like I almost feel like I'm self sabotaging in a lot of ways to stay underrated. I just love being that person. I don't even like being where I'm at professionally now. I feel like I'm known and I've got cred. And like, so when I start shit now, people think it is gonna do well. And I like when people think it's not gonna do well. And so I've got my own little spiel on that. I'll give you a nightmare scenario. Please. Gun to your head, choose one business. Dismantle everything else. Won't do it. Blow my head off? I think it's good. One. There's two ways to answer it. Of course not. I don't wanna die, I wanna play. But I would tell you, I would be heartbroken and not successful in running one business. I need to do lots of things, because I'm too creative. I would make a lot more money if I shut down everything and did one. But money's not the driver. It's the game. And here's a big one. This goes back to why I'm not scared to clean the mess or have two people show up. The sheer detachment I have for my success and Gary Veev et al is pretty staggering. What am I scared of? I'm scared of someone in my family dying. That's it. Literally nothing else. Everything else I can take care of. I can go to zero. I can deal with all of you saying, see, he wasn't good. You all got tricked by him. See, he wasn't good. I'll fucking eat that shit. I will fucking live in a fucking dumpster with that phone. Live in a fucking dumpster and read all those comments and eat it and completely build from that moment just for that. Like, that's what I live for. I love that version. The thing about your... Well, the reason I followed you for so many years is because you've been saying the same thing for so many years. You've been so consistent. So when you say that, I believe you do. I mean, a lot of people say, I'm not about the money, it's not about the success, but I can see how much you do love building. And my brother, Nick, is quite similar in that respect. We're on this journey together and he's a CEO, but I genuinely think that's why you're successful because you care about this, the funnel being business. This is the most obvious thing to entrepreneurs. First of all, I'm so happy that the gleam is coming off entrepreneurship. I like that the youngsters... It's just a little less cool than it was three years ago. That's good. That's good. Because that's a lonely, hard game. People want to be creators and that's entrepreneurship. I get it, but... Yeah, I mean, purebred entrepreneurs are in it for the game. Nobody believes them. Nobody believes them. Nobody without money believes them. And I understand, I'm empathetic. It also doesn't mean it's not true. Yeah, we're on. You know what I mean? Because all those kids that then come up, the amount of people that come up to me and say, I hated you coming up the game because I didn't believe you. Because I wanted the Lambo and the Ferrari, but then I got there and it wasn't fulfilling. It's just not. It's just not. Stuff, stuff, and you make the best stuff and I can't. I like rock, I like stuff. But stuff is garbage. Yes. And if you're only about stuff, status, blue check marks, who's on your hand, money in your bank account, house, private plane, I just know it leads to unhappiness. Which is why I don't post it. Yeah. You could look at my content. I do not post. You're bling. I don't think it brings any value. People are like, no, Gary, it's aspirational. I'm like, bro, more people are laying in bed feeling envy than they're feeling inspired. Mm-hmm. People that, like, I promise. And so, I don't know. What are your thoughts on comparison? Like, how do you stop this? Nobody else's life has anything to do with me. Mm-hmm. Sizzas, Grammys, don't mean shit to you. Mm-hmm. Like, it doesn't mean that you're not good. Mm-hmm. Like, I get pumped when entrepreneurs build bigger things. I'm pumped that there's NFT projects that are doing better than mine right now. I'm pumped that there's agencies bigger than mine. I'm pumped that there's people that have more followers than me. I'm pumped that there's people that sell more wine to me. I'm competitive. I want to do great. But why in the world would I be mad at someone? Mm-hmm. I'm not inspired by it. Some people go that route. They're like, oh, I'm just... I'm not. I'm just in my shit. Nobody else's life has anything to do with you. Mm-hmm. The comparison thing is just another indicator to insecurity. Mm-hmm. Can I ask a question? Are you both parents? Have you got kids? No. No, you've got kids. So, maybe it's for you, because I've got three kids. I love kids. I love being a dad. Wow. Clearly. You like making the kids? Yeah, I love making the kids. What's the matter? You want something to have a little fun here? One of the things I battle with is, you know, the balance. I'm very... I'm with them a lot, but I find it hard to be present. I think with the social media, like, it's such a poor, it's such an addictive thing, and it's mainly because of the connection. Like, I do a lot of DMs and voice notes. I'm so plugged into that. And so, I have this thing where I'm with them, but I'm not fully present. I'm just... I wonder if you've got any advice on that. Do you struggle with it yourself? I... I never share that part. I never share my personal life, and what he's talking about, I would say that I've ebbed and flowed. You know, when you're super passionate, you're super connected, you're gonna have moments. So, there's been plenty of moments where I wish I was more in tune. But on the flip side, over the last four to five years, I've gotten much better at full disconnection when I'm with them. Just unplugged, which... Because that's why I have to physically turn the phone off and leave it in another drawer. Yeah, that's exactly right. So, be really engaged, yeah. That's right. That's exactly right. Do you incorporate your kids into your content? Yeah, so sometimes I see the world through a lens of content. You know what I mean? My kids are so cute, and I do something. I'm like, oh, that's... Because I've now got my little daughter, she's cooking with me, like she's five, and she loves cooking. So, I like sharing that, because it's inspiration, I think we need to get our kids to cook in. But I don't want it to be like a reason that I'm sharing. I don't want it to be like... It's like I need her in every video, but I do share my family, but also... That's probably the most challenging thing that people are thinking through. As you know, I've never shared my personal life ever. I think making that choice for a child, for me, and I judge no one else, everyone should do what they think is right for their family. For me, the thing I think a lot about is making that choice for a child. Right. I see a lot of people really blasting out their kids, and those kids are getting stopped in neighborhoods. Like, choosing fame is a fucking hard game. And then watching so many parents choose it for their children, I think some kids are gonna flourish with it. I think some kids are not gonna do well at all with it. And I think you don't know early on. And so, again, that's no judgment. I really... I like talking about macro, parenting stuff. I never, ever would ever think about telling someone how to parent their kid, because it's a very individual game. But I don't think we've lived through the full cycle yet. We're the first gen. And I do think it's like eighth-place trophies. They were well-intended, but they fucked up the world. They taught people that losing is bad, and they taught indifference, and a lot of that has led to mass insecurity. I will tell you right now, eighth-place trophies have done more emotional damage than social media. And it's not even close. And I know that most people don't agree with me, but social media is an exposure. It's an empty vessel. What do you mean by eighth-place trophies? Is that in competition, the things? Eliminating winning and losing for children, because we didn't want kids to be upset that they lost. So you give them a trophy. The demonizing of losing and modern parenting. And the last 30 years... You're the first and the second and the third. Everyone's a winner. Has destroyed Earth. Really? Just destroyed motivation and ambition, you mean? It has suppressed... It has confused alpha ambitious people. They're kids. They're five and six. Wait a minute, I'm trying to win. Don't cry when you lose. It's just a game. Fuck you, it's just a game. I'm built as a fucking competitive alpha. So you're confusing someone who actually was gifted with something. And then on the other side, you've taught the insecure that losing is terrible. We as your parent, when you're four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, are so scared for you to lose that we're gonna create a game of not losing. Thus, when you go into the real world, you're like, this is why everyone's so scared of everything. Sports and fighting and punishment and all these things, they had value. Balance. We went too far. When letting your kids win in everything, they know you're doing it. It makes them insecure. Interesting, yeah. Well intended. Remarkably well intended. By the way, one man's point of view. One man who reads hundreds of thousands of DMs over the last decade from 18 to 25 year olds at scale and sees it very clearly. Well, back to your point, I recently posted a thing about my wife and our anniversary and it was like the highest performing post. And I have an agent and he was like, listen, this post did like 12x better than any other post. You need to post your wife all the time now. And I'm like, I don't know. So I have to answer this conundrum of like, do I really want to expose my private life because it performs better analytically for the algo. People want to come into your personal life to then judge your personal life to tear you down. And then build you back up and then tear you down because that's what we do. We build up Brittany, then we tear down Brittany, then Brittany's back, bitch. This is what the world does. Build up, tear down, build up, tear down. Like it is what pop culture society humans do because it's the escapism for humans to escape what they're upset about. This goes to Misery Loves Company. This is why so many people comment negative things. It's an endorphin hit to tear someone down to make yourself feel better. I think there's actually a... It's a different piece of content that might have caused it to perform better because it's not the same thing they're used to seeing all the time. I would say yes, comma, unlikely. The family thing is real. No, no, your point is well and you're so advanced now with like, you know when we mix it up. If I do a mocktails video, it gets 3 million views. That said, the much more macro trend is when people introduce kids or family, it is the thing people want. Like it is just very real. People want to get in. They want to get in. We're nosy. We are a rubber-necking society. Reality TV worked for a reason and that shit's not even real. So when we're doing this shit, it's fucking real. Dustin, I want to take some questions from the Twitch. Wait, I have one thought. Yeah, we're going to keep jamming. He's going to keep looking at the screen. He'll interject. He's very good. He'll jump in. Yes, he's interjecting. We'll see how good he is actually, but like, go ahead. I'm curious. I do think there's an element of the person attracting that type of reaction from people. Like when I go to concerts, I feel like sometimes people's fans are a reflection of the energy of the performer. 100%. If you're a performer that's insecure, you're bringing to people who will be more mean to you. Like I feel like my fan base in the way that I interact, I get a lot of kindness. And when people look into my personal life, it's a very kind interaction. So I don't fully believe that if I share more that I will be torn down. You just haven't hit scale yet. But I get, do I agree with that? I don't agree with that. You're just curious. I could be wrong, but I'm looking forward to your message in six years when you hit scale. I lived it. 99% of my energy, 99% of my comments for six years were positive. They're scale. You start tipping over and people don't know you like that. When you have 100 million fans, 50 million fans, 10 million fans, they don't know you the same way your original 100,000 know. You got it? So what happens is they don't understand the context. Plus, as you get bigger, there's default subconscious by default and v-ingelacy that doesn't exist of the way up. They're cheering for you now. So there's new context. It is like, mall averages and unlimited good stuff. It's like, mall math, right? It's just math. If you let 100 million more people into your room, inevitably, even if it's 1%, are going to be like not knowing, don't have the context and maybe have the hate rate on you. And plus, you evolve. Yeah. You evolve, you start touching on different things as your platform gets bigger. You decide to get involved in things. All of a sudden, if you touch anything that is even remotely political, half the people are mad at you forever. There's real shit. And then the first 100,000 want the original Umi. Yeah. You look at Lauren Hill and she said it so many times, people just want the Fuji's Lauren Hill. Always. Like, sorry. Big shout out to Pucking Blitz. She shows up. First time Twitch. 100%. People love to build up their band. Everyone loved Nirvana when they were finding them in Seattle back in the day. And then when they sell out, they're mad at them. Because they were yours. When I transitioned from wine to business, so many people had feelings. Like, just keep doing wine. Why are you doing this? Dust? From a gone site, which... How does anyone here deal with trolls? We've been talking about it. Actually, we've been talking about it, but to your point, not directly. Jeff, let's go around the horn. How do you deal with people coming in that are really trying to tear you down? You mute them, you delete them, you engage with them, you ignore them, you dwell on it, a mix of all of it? I definitely don't dwell on it. I've built enough of a force field of a Captain America shield that it doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I'm sort of on the Gary tip where it's like, I eat it now. And it's like, to me, people leave really negative comments. And my friends are like, why don't you delete that comment? It looks like I love it. I want it to shine on my feed. Because people who are smart will be like, yo, Jeff moves the crowd. Like, look at this dude so mad at Jeff. He's really able to shift perception, right? So I learned to leave it. Every once in a while, I learned this from Gary. I learned to address them. And nine out of 10 times, they'll be like, I'm sorry I was having a bad day. I didn't even know what I was saying. I used to reply to every negative comment. He's crazy. That's like 2,012. Turn around, so-to-thing. Yeah, I wasn't even trying to flip them. I just have love for... Bro, do you know that I don't like dogs? I don't like dogs. Segway. Segway. I like to throw that as a shocking statement because everyone loves it. I don't not like dogs. But let me tell you what I mean by that. I love people so much. I love people the way people love dogs. People universally like dogs by default. I watch HubeN after HubeN. I do that too. Love dogs by default. You don't even know this dog. You're like, I do that with people. I'm like, oh, nice little pink. I just love y'all. And I fucking mean it, bro, from the bottom of my heart. And yet the rest of the world doesn't do it. I watch people after people fucking be cynical, hold off people, look and be like... Like just the cynicism. Because they're trying to protect themselves because they're soft, they're weak, they're scared of judgment. It's wild to me. And so to me... You okay over there? To me, that's how I see it. I'm not trying to flip them and make them fans. I'm trying to just be there for someone who's not in a good spot. Yeah, nice and nice. How do you guys deal with it? Or do you get it? Do you get them? Yeah, go ahead. Well, I think on the way up, I think quite a lot in the fitness industry there's a lot of egos, a lot of people kind of present for. And they didn't really like maybe what things I was saying because I was always in the early days like I didn't sort of promote calorie counts. And you know, if it fits your macros and track all this. And I was always like, I just want to get people cooking. So I said something once about calories and I don't put them in my books and things. But to be honest, and I used to get a lot of people who make podcasts and videos about me, mainly in the UK. But once I'd done Pee with Joe and I got all their mums and grandmas and kids and nephews exercising, it's like it almost disappeared sort of thing. I've done so much good now that I've got a very positive sentiment on my channels. But I've always in the past ignored if it's really offensive, I'll block it and delete. If it's about a client, because I post transformation like before and after, there's a sometimes I've got to be a mean comment like she looked better before and I hate that. I upset some say. I'd always clear that out. But I also think you can nurture your own community. I do think goodness attracts a good nest of people. I couldn't agree more over time. But scale does come. That's all. It just comes in. Sneaky ones. Yeah, exactly. But I'm agreement. How do you get it? Dwell? No. Do you get them though? Not really. Yeah, you're so positive. Not really. I feel like the trolls I get are inappropriate comments. Right. They want to hook it up. Yeah. They say like just weird stuff. And I just laugh and then I just keep around like. Just makes sense. Makes sense. It doesn't bother me though, those types of things. Nothing bothers me that people do. I have zero expectation of human beings. That's a good place to be. No shit. Umi, I'm telling you right now, you want to have love life, have 0.0 expectation and be grateful for the good interactions and understand the bad ones. Mm-hmm. There you go. Clip that. That's the clue. Ready? There it is. That's my life. Zero expectations. Be grateful when you come across wonderful people that you're excited to take from stranger to acquaintance. We were strangers, then we were acquaintances. Acquaintances to friends and friends to family. And the ones that don't go well, don't be mad or feel bad. Understand. Not everybody was as fortunate as you to have an emotional foundation. Not everybody was born as talented. Not everybody put in the work. Not everybody saw optimism and practicality. They chose cynicism. They were parented with cynicism. I had two opposite parents. Both came from very challenging upbringings. They were born in what was the North Korea of its time, the USSR. You couldn't leave the country. Both of them lost the parent by the time they were 15. Like, but my mom is purely positive and my dad was incredibly cynical. But I knew my dad's mom. She was more cynical than him. And everybody had kids so young in Russia. I knew my grandma's mom, my great-grandma. And she was even more cynical than my grandma. So how could I be mad at my dad? He was in that framework. How many people are mad at their parents without realizing that their grandparents made their parents? The one that drove me always crazy as I was growing up was people being super mad in their 20s and 30s at their parents but loving their grandparents. But you could see that the grandparent was the one that made the parents. I was like, you're a hypocrite. Just because Nana gave you lollipops and didn't do it to you doesn't mean that... So just like... Fucking no expectations. Bro, nobody owes me shit. There's not one human of the 8 billion... Excuse me, 8 billion growing around. I just... Like, I'm just fascinated by people believing that someone is supposed to. That word's supposed to. Or should. Should. I don't like should. I never use should. Fuck those two words. Before we get out of here, what else is... Oh, you got something else? Yeah. Okay. Anne, bag, ask... If you're full of ideas, how do you choose which to follow and which to make up? Great. We're going to go around the horn on this one. There's no doubt that all three of you have plenty of ideas. That is just a prerequisite to get to a place in your career. Umi, how do you think about picking the different ideas in your mind? I go by my heart. What brings me the most joy? I usually wait until it brings me joy. And once I feel this feeling of excitement... So you're touching and flirting and doing a little bit of everything? Mm-hmm. I like that. And then I feel like I pursue and jump into the thing that brings me the most joy. Because I feel like then you align with an effortless timeline in which you're not overextending your own energy, you're riding the energy of the universe and also your own excitement, which makes things flow. And I also wanted to tap into your thing about people's first albums being their best albums, because it kind of connects to this thing. I really feel like artists can make better albums after that, but after their first album, they disconnect with themselves. I couldn't agree more. So they don't tap in with their spirit. They get caught up in this stuff. Exactly. They want the trophies. They want the... I fully agree. So if you keep true to your heart, I feel like you allow yourself to take your time, you allow yourself to create... This is why I'm completely detached from my success. You need to be so you can create the best output. That's very true. 100%? Fuck that guy. Fuck that. I hate Gary Vee. You're like, okay, cool, whatever. I love that, but I love your energy. You're really putting out a good vibe, you know? Thank you. Yeah, for the first time ever, I've got a journal by my bed, and I started writing ideas. A few hours ago, so a few days ago, I had a couple of ideas come to me. It always comes to me, like, what would I enjoy doing? What would I learn from? What would make me feel happy? And I've got this connection to young people. I do a lot of work with schools. I do tours with the UK. I've got thousands of kids a week. But I also like being with my grandma and old people, learning from generations that have got more wisdom. So I've got this idea of going into care homes, because a lot of times, old people have forgotten about it. They're not exercising, they're dementia and Alzheimer's kicks in, and they just left the land. Can we please send him my retirement home podcast? Just give him on. I'm the exact same way as you, brother. I really like that. I knew I've always liked you. I haven't heard a lot of people talk about this. I'm full youth culture and full, OG, OG, 80-year-old shit, full. Yeah, just think about, well, the conversation would be amazing. And just, like, getting them moving and finding out about their lives. And what was life like back in, you know, 50, 60 years ago? I don't know. So basically, for me, it's like an emotional thing. I like stories, like real people, like connection. And as long as it's something like that that's valuable, that I could share a story or share someone's journey, I think that's really uplifting. So that's kind of... My ideas always come from that originally, like... Love. ...it's about people, relationships, and me just talking. I just wanted to say that sparked my mind, because I'm working on an album right now. This album I'm working on is called People Stories. And it's all based on the stories of my fans and other people, and I'm just being the vessel for their storytelling. Love. And it makes you want to... Something that was in the song kind of thing as well. Yeah, that's a lovely idea. But that makes me think I should ask my grandmother. Can I rap on that? Can I rap on that? Yeah, I'll send you a track. You really want to rap on it? Yo, I gotta fucking go to this next meeting. So, Jeff, get in here and sneak in with your answer to this question. My little thing that I do is I have, in my Note app on my phone, probably like 4,000 notes. In my Reminders app, I have like 300 reminders. Every time I have a thought or an idea, I stick it in there. And going back to the universe, for some reason, the universe tells me which one starts to bubble up. And I'm like, oh, I have a note for that. And then it just starts to coalesce. It's really cool how it happens. But I think there's a theme here of listening to the universe. And I think it's agnostic of whatever you believe in. But listening to the world, the universe, your community, just pulling it out of you. Don't ever have an idea and be like, that's whack. Forget about that. Like, no, put it down. Put it in your journal. Put it in your note. Whatever. It's gonna bubble up if it's meant to be. I love that. My answer to the question is, I guess. Which is no different than following the universe, which is no different following my spirit and my soul. And here's the insight that I have on this one. Because I wouldn't know the alternative outcome if I did something else. The reason most people don't do things is they're scared of choosing the wrong thing. What I know is there is no wrong thing. I pass on it. Because you chose it. It's the right thing. Yeah, because you just don't know what would have happened. If I did this thing, my whole life would have been a different way. I'm grateful. And so I guess, because you have no other choice, you have to guess, feel the spirit, let it come to you, ride the energy. The actual answer is the reason people don't choose is they're scared to fail. Because they're all your ideas. They're all good. You want to eat them all. But you can only eat one now. So pick it. And it will be yummy. It'll be fine. And I don't want to be like, I should have picked the pasta. Who gives a fuck? I ate the steak tonight. There we go. Awesome. Love you guys. Twitch, thank you for watching. VaynerNation, I know you loved this episode. I just know how good it was. Umi, your energy is just off the chart, chef. Thank you. Boys, everybody. Joe, I'm really proud of you, bro. Thank you so much. Thank you for watching. I gotta go to a meeting. I'm busy. Bye.
