## Transcript
I don't need to be a genius to know that the last decade, every day, looking at the top of the charts has given me an incredible indication of what's going on out there. There's a direct correlation of what's going on in AI and this app being number one. Makes sense. The one that stands out right away is number five, Threads. Threads is declining from that height, but here it is up there, but then you keep going. Shine and Timu, low cost shopping, okay, e-commerce. Number 10, wow. Cap cut being number 10 speaks directly to why I wrote day trading attention. There is art and science to being great at social to really crush. That's interesting. Attention is the number one asset. All right, hey Gary, how's it going? Welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. Yeah, of course. Pleasure to have you here. And you know, we got you here for many different reasons, but obviously the one big reason today is to talk about your new book. I actually have a copy right here with me. Wanted to talk to you a bit about this book because it comes out May 21st. And you know, you've written a lot of books in your time and compared to other works like Crushing It and the other works that you've put out, what's so different about this one and what did you kind of aim to give your audience this time around? Well, it's actually kind of interesting because it's, you know, crushing it was the follow up to crush it. And I would say day trading attention is the follow up to Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. 10 years ago I wrote a book that really hit. One of the definite reasons I wrote this book was how many people were emailing me about Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook in the last year or two. When that book was written in 2014 of best practices of social media creative that was intended to really be a book that was good for 2014 and 15. And I was like, wait a minute, people are emailing me and saying this is so great and it's helped them grow. When I know 83% of that book is obsolete or not as great as they could be doing it. And originally day trading attention was called Jab, Jab, Jab, Left Hook. And so it's different than some of my books but it's very similar to what I've written in the past. And then specifically now, because I really do think marketing has finally tilted to we're on the other side of the hill. No longer are we debating is social an important part of the mix, part of the mix. I think you've got to be pretty out of touch, delusional or corporate political to be fighting for alternative platforms as your predominant bet on building a brand and driving sales. Obviously Google AdWords is intent based selling, right? People search something, they buy it, fine. But I'm talking about brand building for the sake of brand building or sales, both for personal brand, nonprofit, political aspirations and definitely selling stuff as an entrepreneur or a Fortune 50 company. And I would say the Fortune 5000 set is incredibly bad at social media marketing. And I don't say incredibly bad lightly and I'll be honest with you, I actually think I'm being kind. I think there's a huge disconnect. There's not ways to measure it. There's a misunderstanding. It's incredibly corporate when it needs to be authentic. And so big opportunity to write the book and really I wanted to make it. John, I don't know if you, did you have a chance to read it or skim it? Or? Yes, absolutely. Read or skim? Read. Read. So actually just to flip the turntables for fun, what was the biggest aha or biggest observation you had? I haven't been able to talk to a lot of people that have read it yet, so I'm pretty excited right now. What was the take? What was the oh, or like what was the best part or the most surprising part? I gotta say one of the things that really did surprise me in your take on everything. And it's something that completely kind of goes against the grain of everything in advertising as far as big brands are concerned is kind of the abandonment of brand guidelines. I thought that was a really fantastic realization because every time, you know, I've worked in ad agencies before and every time you're in there, they wanna be very, very specific about we have to use these colors. We have to use these specific fonts. We have to cater to exactly what our brand is like in a commercial. But it seems like you kind of went against the grain there and said, you know what? You have to blend in to this platform like TikTok or Instagram. You can't be a sore thumb. And if you're kind of a brand coming in there with your preconceived notions about what your content should be, then it's not gonna work out for you. So I thought that was a really fun realization. Yeah, I think that context matters. I think relevance at scale to as many consumer segmentations is incredibly more important to actually driving business than delusional subjective opinions in a boardroom of, you know, fonts and colors to your point. I have all sorts of feelings about that, but I can somewhat get on board occasionally if I'm tired. But man, someone's opinion of an adjective or like a picture. The big issue that brands have to your point is they are pushing corporate down historical academia of marketing ideology. Most of the principles that marketing in agencies in Fortune 500 land are living on is based on books and academia that is foundational to the 80s and early 90s pre-consumer internet. And so yeah, I mean, just so everybody knows, it's the way you phrased it, blending in. To me, it's like, look, if you are not relevant to it, if you go to a cocktail party and you're not relevant in your words and your dress and your demeanor and your energy and your charisma to the 27 to 32 year old Hispanic males in that corner and you come over and you bomb and they're not interested, it's unlikely that you'll be able to get them to be your friends or do things with them. Same for a brand. If your brand shows up with its textbook brand positioning guidelines and you post something on TikTok and let me say this slow, that's trying to make a 35 to 40 year old young mom buy your product, we're not talking about the kids now, this is not just Gen Z. The stunning amount of 35 to 45 year old females that consume TikTok all day long, if you're trying to give them a commercial, let's go back to what we do here. That makes them buy your beauty product or your apparel or your home goods and it is not contextual to TikTok and it is not relevant to them because in this scenario you're making an ad for Korean born immigrant moms that are into yoga in the Pacific Northwest, it will not sell and I watch every day Fortune 5,000 companies and I say 5,000 because it's not just Fortune 500. When you go into 5,000 you go into late stage venture capital, you go into private equity owned brands, I watch them continuously miss the mark by bringing television, process, operations and mentality to a social media real world and it is why we are seeing so much disruption and change. And the shame with that is you mentioned it in your book that it seems like nowadays for brands the opportunity is endless out there because they can put out any content anytime of the day, they could test things out, they can take those stats, apply them to whatever commercials they wanna do, more targeted things in the future as you mentioned, but it is now kind of the best time for brands if they wanna get on top of this trend because as you talked about it too, you have this part of social media now ever since TikTok, you call it TikTokification where you are served things based on what you like and not people you like or people you follow. So has that completely changed the game and can brands now do whatever they want? In a way that's bananas, like the merit and the, do you understand that I've been grinding every day for 15 years to build up this audience of mine that I treated like email marketing, meaning I would try to put out a piece of content that brought them value, but I knew that I put in all this work and I had 15 million followers and a percentage of them would see it just like email and email open rates. Now you brother can post a video today around ping pong, around this blog or this podcast or this whatever and if the content is right of the moment culturally and uses best practices on platform and the book I talk about it as PAC, platforms and culture, the fact that you can get more views than anything I've ever made in my career, that is a level of creative meritocracy and consumer insights to why it happened that Fortune 500's dream about and spend millions of dollars on and I can't believe that they continue to disrespect this as content. These are ads, social media ads. This is a new thing at VaynerMedia, we've banned content. It is social media ads and even the word test, you know that we've also banned test and you're not wrong about the way you said it, but when you say, hey, brand, you can test and learn up until, they just think it's a proxy to the commercial. To me, this is advertising for the sake of better advertising. John, let me say this. I start the book with the ocean spray example that it all sold out across America because of one TikTok. More recently, Walgreens has a private label called Nice. You probably bought their nuts like everybody else at the register at times, right? And I've bought their water for $5 for 24 before, oh yeah. There you go. You bet. They have a private label named Nice and one of the things they make amongst peanuts and water is mango gummy candies. That's right. So this is on your radar? Yep, yeah, we've reported on it actually a few weeks ago. I love you, because that means you are doing God's work to changing this industry. A single post, as you know, of mango gummy, nice private label, mango candy, went out, caught fire and every bag at Walgreens across America sold out. So much so that if everybody who's listening right now goes to eBay, opens up the app or their laptop and goes to eBay and types in Nice, mango gummies enter and then if they know how to use eBay, go to completed items and click, you will see that many people have bought them for a massive arbitrage on the flip because the demand was that significant. A single ad, not even done by an agency or a brand, sold out, this product across America in record time had enormous economic impact and there is not a single example of a television commercial achieving that in the last five years. Yeah, and that's incredibly impressive. It really speaks to the power of social media, the power of the internet as well to kind of carry things, get trends going. And you know, Gary, you mentioned something earlier about you spending 15 years grinding, you're still grinding, I know you are, but there was a time period at the beginning of your career where you were grinding for seven plus years about and that was alone, by yourself doing work, kind of putting it out and producing your own stuff. What was that grind like for seven plus years? A lot of creators now are one-stop shops and this was even much before then. So can you talk a little about that early day? It was enjoyable, right? I was trying to build an internet business and a retail business for my dad's store to your point. I literally made the signs. When I say I made the signs, I literally, like an hour of my day every day in my 20s was going around the store making new displays of things I wanted to sell and then taking out like an eight by 10 piece of hard paper and taking a marker and making signs and putting it up and watching consumer behavior and trying to learn how to write emails that made people buy things back in 97, 98, 99, 2000, buying my own Google AdWords, managing, operating early on in my creator career from 2006 to 2013. All of my content, I did myself, I filmed it, I put it up, I wrote every tweet. Honestly, it's the days that I most miss. It's fun, I love the journey. I'm in a weird point in my career where now people know me and that's different. That's a new phenomenon for me and I'll never do a new business or new venture where it'll be in the dark. And I miss the dark. I missed nobody paying attention to my mad scientist ways and clocking in and clocking out and putting in the work and learning and making mistakes and adjusting and really honing my humility and confidence and balancing those two and consumers and listening, listening, listening for the opportunity to talk, you know, so much of my career is based on what I say. Most people don't realize most of my day is listening, reading my DMs, watching what's happening, what's trending, seeing mango gummies go viral before it's written about or covered on a great show like this. I pride myself in having my pulse to the beginning of things and our micro moments, viral moments, actually previews of macro consumer trends. Let's say that really slow one more time because I think this could be the one sentence that brings value to senior marketers that are listening. Can a micro viral moment be the beginning of a macro consumer trend? These are things I really care about. And so back, you know, what was it like? It was the best, especially because I was building it for my father, right? I was very obsessed, probably unhealthy, obsessed in giving back to my parents, bringing us from the Soviet Union to America. I put my parents on a pedestal. They're my best friends. I love them the most. And I knew I was a talented kid with business because I proven that to myself with baseball cards and early times that I worked in the liquor store from 14 to 20. And so the early days were awesome in building the business and the early days of being a content creator were awesome because I was learning the craft. I think something that makes VaynerMedia, my agency so unique is I'm the chairman CEO, but I am an active executor of our services. And I'm easily, and this is with all due respect, I apologize to all 2000 employees that work for me when they hear this, but I'm easily the most proficient and skilled at the craft as well within the organization. That is unheard of, brother, in advertising. Every CEO that I compete with is sitting in an ivory tower of a corporation, predominantly in Europe, that couldn't post on a social network or know how to run a media play or know what live ramp is or data lakes or DMPs or forget about what I wrote about in this book, the first three seconds of a video and the creative variable and the copy and the time you post, the science around the art. I mean, this is my craft. Yeah, and you know, you do really immerse yourself in your craft. You talked about listening and that's something you also mentioned in the book a lot is that people have asked you, for example, you know, everybody knows you're an early investor in Tumblr and Facebook and Twitter. So I imagine a lot of people ask you to predict what they should invest in and what they should be doing next, but in reality, you say what they should be doing is listening. So how do you listen and how do you prescribe people to listen nowadays in social? Just spend time on the platforms or is it more than that? It's a little bit more than that, but not much, brother. To your point, the point that you were making earlier for everyone who was listening, everyone's like, man, you saw around corners. I'm like, no, I was just walking, you know, on the actual street, you know, like, and then I would turn on the corner and I'm like, oh, there it is, the trash can or the alley cat or a painting, you know, like, and so I'm a practitioner and I think that's a huge factor in marketing. I think the industry is filled with pontificators and corporate animals. I'm a practitioner. And so when I say, listen, like I'll give you an example, do it right here on the spot. I'm going to my phone, I'm opening it, yep, I'm going to the app store, I'm going to search, right? This is how it'll happening in real time. I didn't get a chance to do it this morning. Usually I try to do it, but I didn't, so this will be fun. I'm scrolling top free apps. Number one, chat GPT. Okay, I don't need to be a genius to know that the last decade, every day, looking at the top of the charts has given me an incredible indication of what's going on out there. Chat GPT, I would like to think most people know what that is that are listening, as you can imagine, there's a direct correlation of what's going on in AI and this app being number one, makes sense to me, right? The one that stands out right away is number five, threads on Instagram. I'm feeling threads is declining, obviously from that hype, but here it is up there, I'm like, ooh, is there an update today, is there something going on? I have to look a little bit deeper, right? But then you keep going, right? The fact that Shine and Timu, low cost shopping, so shopping, okay, e-commerce, cap cut number 10, wow. Editing soft, like literally cap cut being number 10, speaks directly to why I wrote, jab, jab, jab, excuse me, that's funny, but why I wrote day trading attention. We are in the moment now where people are realizing there is art and science to being great at social, to really crush, that's interesting, right? I keep going, but what I'm really looking for, just so everyone knows, is I'm gonna scroll a little bit lower, I'm actually gonna go to 150, just to see real quick for the phone, or actually I'm gonna go down even further, at 200. So I'm at 200 and I'm going up now, right? And banned, app for all groups, 197, and this is to keep all your groups organized. I'm like, oh, this looks like group chat, what's this? So this is something that I now like is on my radar. Now, if for a month I see banned go from 197 to 44, well it's time to download and really play. And that's why I saw Musically so early on, and that's why I saw Snapchat so early on. And so you're really looking at these things to understand what's popping. I also see Domino's and Alexa, and I see Wingstop, 191, there's a direct correlation to this data of what's going on, right? WNBA 172, I don't think anyone's gonna be confused here. The WNBA is hotter today than it was 24 months ago. Crumble the cookie app at 170 kudos to them, that's like interesting. And so what you're seeing is I'm kind of giving you kind of how my brain works, like paying attention to what is happening. That's one of the places I may go, Trending Topics. There's an app called Break the Web that I've been using lately that just kind of aggregates the news, almost like Trending Topics that we would look at for Twitter and X was very big for me for a long time. This is doing it for the whole web, right? I see Bridgerton Recap, I see Supreme Court, I see Blake Lively, I click on Blake Lively, stars in a new movie. Now I know, right now, I didn't know this a second ago, that Blake Lively and Colleen Hoover, this is very fun to say for everyone to listen. The reason I tend to know a lot of stuff about emerging consumer segmentations and consumer trends is because I spend the time putting in the work to try to know. AKA for a lot of people that are listening in AdLand, I am a strategist. But I'm not a strategist that goes to Reddit and takes my, I'm all over the place, I'm absolutely everywhere, as many places I can. And whether that's Reddit or Instagram or TikTok, and I'm staying curious, I'm looking at the podcast, Top 100, 200, I'm looking at the apps, Top 100, 200, I'm reading people's comments, I'm just kind of in it. Yeah, and that's a great place to be. It's important to keep your finger on the pulse. And I think for, as you mentioned, as a CEO and founder of a company, to just be that on top of it, that's very unique. And I feel like that's why. My big thing here, brother, is why wouldn't you be? It's the customer. Like people like Gary, I don't time for this. I'm like, what are you spending your time on? If you're not spending your time on trying to understand what humans care about, if I'm putting on my professional hat, so that you can then have an opportunity to make it relevant to them, what are you spending your time on? What are you spending your time on if you're not paying attention to what's going on in the world, so you can be a better parent, a better sibling, a better, even little silly stuff, a better dinner date. Like what are you doing? Yeah, right, be informed. You should be informed. And you know, something that you did mention in your book is after getting informed, right? After knowing who you're trying to reach, what you're gonna do. Now talk to me about actually producing the content. So there's a lot of social media platforms out there. Everybody knows, you got your YouTube, you got your TikTok, you got your X, you got your Instagram. And it's mainly told, I feel like everybody should be diversifying the kind of content they put on each platform, but not everybody does that because they don't feel like it or maybe they produce this one content and you know, you might as well just put it everywhere and see what sticks. What is your advice for kind of diversifying each piece of content for each platform? I think you can take the same video and post it everywhere, but I highly recommend that if you're posting on LinkedIn and you're posting on TikTok, let's think about those two places. And you're posting the same video at bare minimum, and I do this a lot, because this would be my bare minimum move in this scenario. At bare minimum, please change the copy completely to support the platform. Good news, copywriters, your copy is required in these environments. Like you really need to figure out where and what the audience is thinking about, and that's how I would attack it. Like now my preference is that you would change the thumbnail, the first three seconds, the hook, you know, along with the copy. And I think as you get more advanced and you allocate more dollars to it, you should. But that's how I think about platform strategy, like and how to get more content out into the world. More platforms, more platforms, more platforms. And then more different pieces of creative. The big issue right now for a lot of people listening is on brand or tone of voice means they want their grid to aesthetically look the same. So not only do you need platform strategy, but you need within platform strategy. Hence how I structured the book. And I think that, I think people really misunderstand the concept of relevance at scale to different consumer segmentations, which is gonna make your grid look a little messy. But that's good because it means you're actually creating relevance with more consumers. Yeah, and you know, you've also talked about today, even in the past like 20 minutes, you talked about how important that first three seconds is, that hook to kind of get people to watch your content. Why is it important? Why is it valuable to them? I think value is something that you really like to hit on, which is super important. Can you give me how you construct a hook or how you would construct a hook in that first three seconds? Simplicity, punch. You obviously are leading the witness because you're educated, I do think value matters. Like what am I gonna get out of this? Right, that's how I think about it. When I tell you there isn't a single time I do creative where I'm not like, what's this person gonna get? Why should they consume this? This is what I razz a lot of my contemporaries who've done very well in life. I'm like, what value do you think you posting yourself on a private plane does for your audience? I'm like, I know what value it's doing for you, you're closing the gaps of insecurity. I'm like, but explain to me why this is good for them. And once in a while through the years somebody would counter me with like, it's aspiration. I'm like, look, if I'm being overly kind, you can probably manipulate me into believing that, but it's not why you posted it. And so I think most of my career is built on I've been obsessed to why. So when I think about the hook, it's like why? And it's very of the moment. Like here's an example, if you're in the home selling business on any side of the funnel, are high interest rates right now keeping you from being able to sell and buy a new home? Like that is pretty much explaining to that person like why? Right, like my world that I love with wine. By the way, everyone should sign up for winetext.com. Winetext, T-E-X-T, my dad would be very happy. But like the reason I just did that little funny plug, though seriously though you should buy from winetext, it's that good, is because I've been doing these, I'm helping my dad store. That's like a new service we have. It's like Groupon, you get a deal of the day on text, you just reply with how many bottles, it's killing it. And we're crushing my thesis. But like, that first three seconds need to be like, are you drinking the same rosé over and over and want to get a much better one for half the price? That's not very hard for something like, I don't know how your drinking patterns are, but if you're into rosé and we're in cup, think about when I just did that. We're right on the precipitous of rosé season. So I culturally know what's going on. I know what's going on with the consumer. And then you can see I can make that hook, right? And so, for day trading attention, it's like such easy content, right? It's like, have you stagnated your growth on Instagram? Well, the answer is almost everyone has, because of why I'm writing this book, it's hard. It's supply and demand of attention. There's too much supply right now to get easy views. And so you have to be better. That hook for the opening line, as you can imagine, I'm gonna be able to get a lot of people to stop with that because it matters to them. Yeah, because you're meeting them where they are, right? You're meeting the consumer where they are. You're addressing their concerns, I think is the important part. I'm meeting, and let me break down meeting where I am, because I think this will help a lot of people. I'm meeting them in distribution and need state. I'm meeting them where they are because people actually consume their feed in social. And to your point, which I think is what you were making, I'm meeting them on their need state right now. Exactly, exactly. Which is the most important thing for the consumer. And you talk about at least one part of your book, you kind of talked about quality versus quantity, and everybody's kind of always having that argument these days with social, right? Because you should put out more content, more content, more content, and that sometimes will sacrifice the quality. And it seems like your idea is to do both, right? Put out more content that is better. At any point, do you think creators can be oversaturating the markets? No, let me help creators right now. Almost everyone doesn't know who you are. Powerful silence after that. I wanted that to really settle in for everyone. When creators come in here, over like 51,000 followers, they're like, Gary, you know, I don't wanna be overexposed. I'm like, brother, good news. No one knows who the hell you are. Bro, I go to airports, I get stopped 13 times for selfies. It's profoundly a lot. It's a lot, but it's 13, 4,000 people walk by me. Do you know what I mean? You make a good point, you make a good point. So overexposure, no. But it's a quality quantity ratio to your point. Does everybody have enough creative ideas to put out good content? Like these are the things that are the issue, right? I think that that's a huge issue that most people aren't creative enough for new ideas, different formats. Do they have enough finance? For brands that are listening, have they allocated enough money towards it? Brands will hire a creative AOR agency, millions of dollars to think of one idea for the year, but they don't spend that much money on producing social media creative. It's nuts. It's crazy. So, you know, I think there's a lot to this. Yeah. And in terms of coming up with creative, obviously a lot of people tend to go on the platform. You know, even in your book, you mentioned search kind of what your industry is, right? If you're a car dealership, you had a passage about car dealerships, right? If you own a car dealership, search car dealership, and you'll find some content that you like, and that you can potentially replicate or put your own spin on. So the idea with creating new types of content though, it has been interesting to me. Is it all right as well to try completely different formats that maybe haven't succeeded on the platforms yet? Or would you mainly put most of your energy to try to kind of mimic other things that have already been successful, but make them your own? Yes. Both. So both. That's right. Corporate and entrepreneurs and creators alike love or. Everybody loves AOR brother. People love AOR. And meanwhile, over here, the brilliant one, the good brother of the two brothers, because AOR is the bad brother, is and. And sitting over here being like, yo, I'm here, I can solve all your problems. Like, it's unbelievable right now. I'm gonna do a really interesting exercise. I think people are gonna email me about this. My email's gary at VaynerX.com, V-A-Y-N-E-R-X. Email me only, because I get too many emails. Email me only if something profound just happened when I do this. Please stop. Forget about this interview. I hope you're enjoying it. And think about one or two or three things you're struggling with right now in life. Forget about even business. And just tell me if you replace the AOR thinking with and thinking, I can do both. And that. And that. And that. Not AOR. By the way, this happens all the time in my life when I do this with my inner circle of friends, family, associates. It's shocking what happens to your ability to solve a problem when you follow AND versus OR. And so if something just unlocked for you and you like are on your way, please let me know, because I'd love to. The answer is AND. Of course you should do what's working. It's like being a brand. Gary, should we market to heavy users? Hell yeah. We need to keep them and hopefully get another unit out of them. But Gary, what about prospecting new users? Hell yeah. We want people to start the process of becoming a heavy user. So, of course. And that's actually the issue with brand guidelines and tone of voice. It makes everything so limited, nobody can make stuff. And it's all politics. People are treating individual social media posts like a Super Bowl commercial. The meanings, brother, cost more than just posting the content. And back to that, when people are like, change that adjective or change that color purple to blue, post both. Right. See what works. You have to try different things. Yeah, and remember, it's an ad. They're both ads. If you're willing to run the same commercial on television 4,000 times on a flight, why wouldn't you post the same piece of content twice with different colors or slight change in adjective? People have got it all wrong, brother. I'm telling you, the game is broken. Fortune 5,000 treats social like a bastard child when it's the golden goose. And their operational vigor and processes are based on television, which you take nine months to think through something to get it out in the world, versus something that I've just wrote a book called Day Trading. Like this is day to day. And it's an amazing opportunity. You can advertise every single day. And things may pop. And then you sell stuff and get insights. It is crazy to me. All out of absolute, absolute ideology of the past. Audacity, creatives that don't wanna do in social cause they're too good for it. Forgot that they weren't good enough for Hollywood, so who are they? Like the whole thing's broken, bro. The whole thing's broken. Yeah, you know what? Kind of going off of that, these Fortune 5,000 companies, I really wanted to hit on this particular point that we've seen so many influencers, creators, whatever you wanna call them, people that are very popular online come out with their own products, right? So we've seen Logan Paul Prime, we've seen skincare brands, a bound, I feel like everybody's got a skincare brand nowadays. But we've seen all these brands come out from these creators. More niche creators and smaller creators than, for example, One Guy versus Dove, or One Guy versus GE, or something like that. Do you think that influencers or private brands can ever kind of eclipse corporations in this new landscape? Yeah, not only do I think they could, I predict they will. I believe that in 15 years when we wake up, toothpaste, deodorant, potato chips, sneakers, all everything, that there's an extraordinary amount of opportunity. You know how I know this? Because it already happened. I don't know if you heard of this brand of sneakers called Air Jordans. I've heard of it, yes. Yes, okay. Let me tell you what the Air Jordan version's going to be in the future. Along the way, the next LeBron, Covey, or Jordan, somebody in the next 20 years will have the courage to, instead of taking the $100 million bag from Reebok, or Nike, or Under Armour, they're gonna do it themselves. And I know people are like, ah, Gary, but supply chain, I can get it. But too many of the things are getting commoditized, supply chain distribution, and it's just very clear to me. Now that's a tough one, because of supply chain and distribution, but what is not tough is pretzels. What is not tough is tissues. And so these humans have so much awareness built in, and so much relevance built in. They're winning on relevance and awareness. It's all the same. The game's the same. Gary, you don't believe in reach and frequency. It's the only thing I believe in. I don't believe that GRPs and digital programmatic impressions are actual awareness. I think you're buying bullshit on potential reach, not actualized reach. I think I'm just buying media on places that are actually reached. That's it. By the way, I don't care about social media. I'm gonna make fun of social media in 10 years when our attention's somewhere else. I used to love email and banner ads. Brother, when you were a baby, when you were, you were born? 1994. Man, I love it. When you were three years old, I was buying banner ads on WineSpectator.com and getting 6% click through. Do you know what insane that is? I don't know if you know about banner ads numbers these days. .000000. Like, but it was the early internet and the few people, probably at the time, tens of thousands that were going to WineSpectator.com, the most progressive guys in Gauss on Wall Street and law firms in New York City that were early movers that were into wine. They looked at the banner ad because we didn't know any better. That was part of the full experience. Now it's gone. The only reason social's winning is the ads are natively integrated to the experience. The feed is the feed is the feed. Whereas when you're watching television, Gary, people still watch sports. I'm like, I know, but they don't watch sports commercials except for the Super Bowl. And so, you know, I think that there's a lot of that. So yes, I think many of the biggest brands in 15 years will be created by human-based influencers. Now, will they see them coast to coast? I don't think so. I think the Procter & Gamble's and Crafts and PepsiCo's will end up buying those things for billions of dollars and they'll become brands there so they'll buy them out. But I think they'll be created by, and I think one or two entrepreneurs will come along the way and go evergreen, you know? Yeah, I think, you know, that's, you make a great point there because I feel like there's this continuous dichotomy between the creators and these businesses, these giant businesses. Because right, you know, like Wendy's has a Twitter account, right, all of these companies have their TikTok accounts. Some do it really well, some don't do it really well, but it's very, very hard, or a lot harder it seems, for a brand to become meaningful to someone versus another person or somebody that they feel like they know. How can a brand do that? I feel like the best example of this could be Duolingo on TikTok, but how can a brand become more humanized? By having a mascot. You know, we worked on Duolingo and Lattam for people disclosure. We work on Mug Root Beer in America right now. There's no coincidence why that's crushing. It's because it's us, we know what to do, and it's a mascot. Flow from Progressive, Jake from State Farm, the Geico Lizard, they work. When I say our forefathers and mothers had it right, they did. The Jingles, the mascots. We lost our way in the 90s in advertising and have never come back. We're not as great as we think we are. We overemphasize data when it's commoditized. We're not as good at marketing. Like Don Draper's dead. Like we don't have that level of talent. If you're talented enough, you do your own shit. So we've got to recognize that. I've built one of the largest independent advertising agencies in the world in the last 14 years. The day before I started it, I worked in a liquor store. That shouldn't have been allowed. I'm gonna say it again, they allowed it. Because all of the holding companies and the creative AORs, they all poo-pooed and laughed at where the attention was, I was able to grow. That is a mistake. And that's what brands are doing wrong. Brands can win, brother. To your point, you brought out Wendy's growth. You can bring out Slim Jim growth. You can bring out Health Cosmetics growth. You can bring out Poppy growth. There's a lot of examples, my guy. You know what the, people are like, oh, people will only go with humans. I'm like, people love Louis Vuitton handbags. People love their iPhone. People like brands and products. Here's the difference. Humans, random humans, entrepreneurs, are better at marketing than agencies and brands. The reason the humans are working is they know what to do in marketing. It's called the New World. This is now the television. For everybody who's listening, I'm holding up my phone. And the television has become the radio. And we don't want to admit it. John, we do not want to admit it in agency land. You know that. No, we do not. We never did. And we may never will. And yes, we will because we're gonna be forced to. Agencies are gonna go out of business, brother. I don't think people get it. You can only hold on to a fake environment and be to be for so long. You know who didn't want streaming to happen? The cable incumbents. It didn't matter what they wanted. You know who didn't want influencers to happen? Actors and actresses. It didn't matter what they wanted. It doesn't matter that agencies make all their money on black box, DMPs, and television commercial creative. The market will adjust because the brands are gonna get hurt. And after a while of them being hurt, they're gonna blame their partners at some point. Listen, I mean, it's a big change happening. And something that I don't wanna miss is that we talk about these Fortune 5000 companies. There's also a lot in your book and just you speak about daily about small businesses and how small businesses can kind of work together at times and how small businesses can stay alive during this time and thrive during this time. Now, from that big corporation down to a small business, how does a small business create a social strategy and how does a small business thrive today? They become the agency. They have to do it internally. And they have to live my life and the millions of people I see on social for their car wash and their dog walking business, they have to do it. And so like, if you're 47 right now and you're listening and you have a, you're 47, you're young, you're younger than me and you're like, I don't even know what to do. I don't even have a social media account. But you have a sandwich shop and you have three employees at the register daily. My intuition is that a lot of them are under 25 or potentially from an immigrant. Like you gotta literally walk in as you're listening to this on the treadmill or walking your dog or on the way to the car. You gotta walk in the store and be like, any of you wanna make organic social media content for our business? Like you gotta start making it. And they're probably gonna stink or they're remarkable. Maybe they're naturally remarkable or they do it for themselves. So they knew what to do with your sandwich or your bag of chips or the milkshakes you sell. And so what do they do? They take their resources and they make creative at scale to the best of their ability. And that's why I love books. This is no bullshit job. Somebody in my company who's very smart goes, I love the book. I gotta be frank with you. I'm a little bit concerned. I said, about what? They said, it feels like you're giving our agency secrets a way to everyone. And I said, yes, we may be ahead of people right now, but it's not like, you know, like, and you know, jump for you, it's a little bit deeper. I'm sure you had, when you were reading, you're like, oh, that's interesting. Oh, ah-ha, oh, shit, that's why. So, but I'm not gonna be able to hold on to that information forever. That's why I'm so intellectually generous. Like if I could keep it forever as a secret sauce, I would make the Big Mac too and never tell anyone, but it's not gonna play out that way anyway. So I'd rather actually build relationships and karma and value for the world, even quote unquote, my competitors. What I said to this executive was, we don't compete with anyone. There's no agency taking our business. There'll be incredible agencies that beat us in pitches and things of that nature, and that's wonderful. We should, that's just, we weren't good enough. Or they were remarkable, or the person making the subjective call wasn't ready for what we do. But nobody's taking away from us. We're taking away from ourselves. If we're good, we're good. And so I think that why I'm so excited and why I write books is for 28 bucks or 20 bucks or whatever this ends up being on Amazon, you know, a small business owner literally gets the blueprint, literally. And the resources back to your question will be down to normally just them themselves or the employees they have, or if they're a bigger small business, they can hire someone to do it, and that's the game. And you know, I appreciate you bringing up that concern from your employee who said that you're giving away secrets. And you know, cause a concern that I would have actually, writing a book like this that talks about the social media landscape and how you can be a part of it and what you can do, very eloquently, may I add. The only thing that I would be concerned about is that in a year, it would be completely different. Like writing a book in 2023, writing, putting out a book in 2024, in 2026. I mean, everything could be completely topsy-turvy. You'll love this, not everything, but certain things are already different. By the way, I wish I could have backed up the Ocean Spray starting to this book with the mango gummies part. It would have made the book better. I would have given you two examples. Of sell out from one social media post. So of course, things will change. But minimally, first of all, and I hope you captured this, I wrote it in a manner that will allow people to create the macro strategy framework. And that won't change if things that I see coming like Vine coming back and it being good, like I didn't get a chance to tell you what best practices on Vine are in this book. So that will be missing. So to your point, every day that the book is alive, it has the potential and likelihood of being a little less relevant. On the flip side, I'm pretty fortunate. We are so, and I am so ahead of the masses on this, including anybody and everybody in Madison Avenue Marketing, that there's gonna be a lot of value in the upfront. I mean, there's gonna be me breaking down. Did you do any of the QR codes? Did you actually look at? Yeah, yeah, I did. That was really fun. I've never seen that in a book before, actually. Yeah, so everybody, I put QR codes to the posts that I was talking about in the book. My belief is that if for someone who's incentivized to be great at this, they're gonna do one case study in the book, one QR code, one reading what I had to say about it and be like, oh, okay. And then literally be better the next day. And all of a sudden, instead of getting 4,000 views per their videos, get 8,000. And that feels incredible. And so I think there'll be more than enough value for the 28 bucks for everybody who reads it from a creator, an influencer, a small business, an executive. I mean, I talk a lot about LinkedIn. One of the people that should definitely be buying this book are people that are in jobs that are not fulfilling them. If they get good at LinkedIn, they're gonna get new job offers. Right, right. And that's how you do it. And I completely agree. And also, with that said, you did say before that agencies will have a tough time at some point, right? What does the future look like at VaynerMedia, VaynerX, to you, where are you guys going? What's next? Overall or in an AI environment? Oh, overall. But maybe hit on the AI environment too. I'd love to hear that. Yeah, I think we are remarkable at content creation at low cost that is high value. Obviously, we're gonna integrate those kind of tools and everybody's gonna get better and better at that. And so we have to stay on top of that. So I pay attention to that. In the back row, man, I really think I'm gonna build the largest independent advertising agency in the world. I'm getting dangerously close as it is. Why didn't Kennedy's out there doing its thing? Big shout out. But we're really ambitious over here. One thing I will say, and I'm very proud of this, one thing I can easily predict that I hate predicting, I believe that in 15 years, I will be 60, what am I talking about, 63, 62, depending on the timing. And I'm gonna poke my head up and be like, wait a minute, 13 of the Fortune 500 CMOs came up as a kid at Vayner. This is remarkable. That to me, I gotta tell you, brother. I said that for two reasons. One, for all the leaders here, nothing should be at the top of your list more than the people that work with you and for you to have success, whether in or outside of your organization. And two, I say it because I can't wait to clip this in 15 years and split screen it and say I told you. Because what I do know right now is, and this is a real plea, actually this is a huge plea to anybody who's 40 to 50, maybe even 35 to 55 in marketing right now, either on the holding company agency side or in a corporation. Please don't put your head in the sand to what's going on. This is about to devour the whole industry. What happened in streaming to regular TV and cable is about to happen in advertising. And Vayner and I will benefit, but there's so much more room than just us to benefit from it. We're a pimple on the ass. So many of you can really change your career trajectory, but you've gotta get good at where attention really is and what creative is required to fill that attention, to make the action of the buy, whatever the buy represents, the donation, the vote, the consideration to do something. It's just imperative and I just think people are mailing it in and they think they're gonna be okay because they know programmatic or Google or, I'm just shocked that people are willing to let this tornado take them up. And you know, to kind of end with this, I feel like, you mentioned AI before and AI becoming, I mean, there's a lot of stuff happening with AI today, obviously at the time of recording, GPT-40 just came out, everybody's kind of in a tailspin about that, but with AI kind of being on the forefront with, I don't know, a potential TikTok ban looming, probably gonna take a while, but if that happens, but TikTok as well is advertising content that is made with AI, for example, nowadays. So where do you see social media going if AI content starts to flood the platforms and has a situation there? I mean, there's plenty of content now flooding. Like, I'm not worried about content flooding. I'm worried about people outflanking the commodity. So I'm gonna say this nice and slow, when, not if, when the platforms themselves are helping you generate the creative, because it's their algorithms and it's gonna help you create content that's gonna do well on the platform. Mid Journey doesn't know what the hell's going inside of Meta's pipes, but Meta does. Mid Journey's the commodity, not Meta, right? But what happens when everybody's using that, all of a sudden, you know this, you've seen this because you pay attention, there's like a trend of what content works. I started the trend of like chopping up your podcast into a thousand pieces, like, but then now everyone, like I've got a lot of offsprings. There's a lot of my kids out there, you know? But then I have to adjust. And so when the content is commoditized because everyone's doing it, it means that content by nature won't be as effective as we want it to be. And that's what gets into prompt engineering and that's what gets into creative thinking and critical thinking and strategy. It is day trading attention, John. I'm really happy with this title. I'll tell you why. It didn't be the other day on a chat. I never thought of it prior to two days ago. Day trading attention, how to actually build brand and sales in the new social media world. This is my dummy series. I'm gonna write a book in 10 years that says day trading attention, how to actually build brand and sales in the new VR world. The reason I'm comfortable with this book is I'm gonna help people strategically create the framework of execution and then they just have to be good at paying attention to platforms and culture daily to then do the thing. That's what I think. Well, Gary, thank you so much for the time today. Thanks for some advice. Thanks for some wisdom. Thanks for some chats. It's been really, really fun. I hope to see you again real soon. Thank you, my friend.
