When you don't have unlimited money or any money, in 2023, September 7th, 2023, and you are trying to sell shit, the number one thing on earth is organic social media at scale, cause it's fucking free. This market is completely attempt, right? And I've tried a bunch of different ways to penetrate it, and I haven't been able to do it, and I'll explain how I've tried, right? So I won this, the way- How do you define the market? How do I define the market? What do you mean? Oh, when you say what's the market? Yeah, sorry. Parents of those with autistic children, and ADHD, children with ADHD, right? So essentially, when this whole thing started, I was 16, joined this Shark Tank for high school, and I had 20,000 computers a month. So then from there, we got this pattern, and it immediately took on this own world, when it comes to media success. From the local news to People Magazine in six months, to ABC, Inside Edition, and it just kept going for a year and a half, which was awesome, glory to God. But the thing was that all our sales came from publicity, and then once that went away, I really didn't have the skills to be able to create them. We're still pre-revenue, you know what I mean? Makes a lot of sense. Yeah, so- It's a common story. Okay, yeah. Yeah, like, media coverage happens all the time. There's always a feel-good story. There's always something that the media wants to put at the end of a, they scare you to death for 49 minutes and tell you how world is horrible, and then they tell you like, a kid's got a chocolate business at the end, you know? So, and to your point, that shit can pop off, and you can get a lot of sales, but to your point, if you don't build actual, sustainable infrastructure, you don't have a business. Exactly, that's what I ran into. And you don't even know that the first go around, you just think it's gonna go forever. And it kept going. It was so- And a year when you're this young, is like a lifetime. It was honestly like two and a half, it was all the rest of high school. But then you become addicted to that thing? Did you like think the only way? Like, did you at some point realize, fuck, I need more press, I need more press? Cause that became the drug, yeah. So I was like, it wasn't a drug, but it was more. You know what I mean, right? I don't have any other way to get shit. There's no other way I'm gonna sell shit. So I was like, I guess I just gotta keep, finally. Let me just email the newscaster. Yeah, yeah. Should I hire a PR company? I get it. Like, one of my- This is why I so fuck with social. Yeah. Because it's the one thing you can control. It's like working out. Yeah, yeah. You got shit you can't control. You can control how you work out. Same with social media. Like, you can't control if People Magazine wants to fuck with you. You can control if you make a TikTok. Yeah. So I remember like, it gets to a point, so one of my advisory board members, I don't know if you know him, his name is, it's like a former advisory board member, but Jamie Simmonds, I don't know, Rick. I went to him and I was like, hey, this press is going out. I don't know how else they get sales. Do you have anyone I know? And he's like, dude, you gotta build that infrastructure. You gotta work hard, you know? So for the last year and a half, I've been just trying to different ways, right? So we went from occupational therapists and like, ABAs, which they work directly with children with autism, ABAs. I'm just making sure that we don't run out of time. The next meeting, I'm like, make sure you have your full 10. Keep going. So then I tried that, like a B2B2C route. Yep. And it hasn't really panned out. I tried, because my thought process was, go to where the market is, right? So like, it's like, not probably. What's the website? Tassiumworldwide.com. So then I was like, okay, you know, maybe. The thing is that we sold over 2000 products with this press and everyone loves the product. It's just trying to get it into, you know, to write people's hands. So like I said, try B2B2C. We tried non-profits, but they didn't want to work with us because we weren't donating anything. So then we started donating a little bit, but it's just, we can't sustain that when we're prerevenant. My, keep going, keep going. So we tried that. I tried organic, you know, with my story and everything and it only went so far. And I'm sure if I like kept going, it probably would work. But I'll stop. But I think that's what most, like that moment just happened, is everything I give a fuck about. I know, I know. You know. You can see all four of you probably know. The entire school knows. You know, like, you put it, but oh, it's the fucking game. Like, when I go to your website and it's not clickable to the TikTok, even though the logo's down there, like that's on my mind. This goes back to the fucking details. Even back to working out, now that I've learned a little bit about it, like there's a right way to do a fucking pushup and there's a wrong way. There's a right way to do a curl. And there's like, and this is like how meticulous I get to, back to the proper device you were getting. This shit back, like, bro, it's real simple. You're an e-commerce. You're trying to sell shit. You're trying to sell a shirt with an attached thing. You need to do unlimited social media content so people become aware of it. And then they need to go to a proper website, like, you know, where like the shop is, like this shop is not maximized to sell the most stuff. I know. That's right. And that's okay. Back to like, fuck man. I was fucking really good at business, all your guys ages. And like, is these gray hairs you see now? Like, I'm way better now. And so, but for complete clarity, like when you all go downstairs and be like, okay, what the fuck just happened in the attention whatsoever quick, here's the clarity. You are selling shit. When you don't have unlimited money or any money, in 2023, September 7th, 2023, and you are trying to sell shit, the number one thing on earth is organic social media at scale, cause it's fucking free. And I mean like 19 posts a day. Or you're stuck in the spot that you're in now, which is you're begging for a fucking miracle that someone's gonna give you cash. And just pitch competitions with that money and it's up. If you flipped it and just understood you're 100% in control, fuck a competition, fuck a VC, fuck everybody. Fuck it was like an M&M, like that. I felt like it was an M&M slide. Fuck a papa. If you just understand that you're fully in control and you just have to pound social and start Googling how to make the best Shopify site selling t-shirts enter. Literally that shit is out there for free. Best practices, get the proper Shopify, get your social crazy and start fucking, you know, start fucking, like life's crazy. You were here on a thing. I decided I felt something. We have 10 minutes. You give your friends, I don't literally get aware of this fucking humble hat. I'm so happy. And like your friend's gonna be like, by the way, that's one in a hundred. And that's what you need to do. You need to have the fucking, how are you getting back to Boston? We're taking the ferries later. Beautiful. You need to be, yeah, you chop it up and whatever happened in Europe, but then you have to like start DMing people in Boston, type in Boston, fucking new en masse, Boston, all that shit, in fucking Instagram, hashtag, search, top posts, click, oh this person's here, they have 400,000 followers. They're a cool kid in high school, in fucking new, enriched kid. And DM them be like, I want you to wear my fucking shirt. One in a hundred of them will. 100%. But if you fucking, I don't know, my whole thing is like, you know how I got here? By actually doing what I'm telling you to do. When nobody in the world knew who the fuck I was, I stayed on Twitter in 2007 from fucking 8 p.m. after I worked the whole day in the liquor store, from 8 p.m. to four in the morning, for fucking four years every day. You have two choices. The luck of cash, which is harder than ever because the economy's soft, though you're in a good school where something's gonna happen, or sweat. I don't know, first of all. Yeah, and I just think like, what most kids are missing, even the ones that are about it, and I genuinely, even if you guys are sitting here, like I wish I was in class with you all, you know, you'd be like chopping it up, like I believe you have it in there, I think this generation, and I don't wanna generalize, because I think there's plenty of unlimited, and you guys may be doing this, but here's the thing that I think the world fucked up for y'all, when I was coming up, it was like, we didn't have options. When I was in exactly your seat, the internet was just starting, so like, you had to like go like, work at like, the mall. You all know you can do magic here, because you've seen it. The problem is 1% of 1% hit the lottery ticket if it happened fast. The other 10% that make it, eat shit for a decade, but everyone's fixated on the 1% of the 1% of the 1% who hit something, and even those people quietly actually had to eat shit for a little while too. You're gonna start on the Peral brand? Fuck man, it took, you know how much Ronnie ate shit for how long before Kiff mattered? Rude wasn't overnight, but it feels that way. So like, I don't know if I'm selling fucking tissue with a hook on the fucking thing, I'm fucking grinding for 10 hours a day on social media. Instead of what you're trying to do, which is what everyone's trying to do, is figure out what to do. Right? Yeah, instead of pondering what fucking competition to apply to, laying bed, listening to your music, yeah, look at some girls, but then spending eight hours DMing every single human in Massachusetts saying, do you want a free t-shirt that has 100,000 followers, put in their story, ask them to put in their story, because they're not putting a name for you anymore, snap, shoot it when you fucking see that they did it, put it into your thing, amplify it with eight dollars, because that's all you got in media ads. Actually, people just lost that. Yeah, yeah. Because it seems like you can do it the other way, and who wouldn't do it the other way? But that's fucking not real. Yeah, yeah, my dream for a fantastic was really to become like the Nike for special needs. I get it, yeah. I heard you loud and clear, I think you can get it, I just think that you have to realize that you have to go into a dark, dark fucking cocoon for the next five years and eat straight shit. It's super real, I see everyone who's popped off and everyone's gonna like, everyone's gonna think it was easy, it wasn't. Tell me, tell me which fashion brand you admire. I'll tell you, how many more movies you wanna see about Nike, how close they went out of business multiple times before it actually happened, and you know how much luck Michael Jordan was? Yeah, it was strategy and the movies will show you, but he could also tour in both his knees. And one would have been it, but step on Marbury got hurt on their sneaker game over, right? Like there's just a lot, you know what I mean? Bro, at 34 years old, I worked in a liquor store. So of course I'm pumping the shit and I'm pumping to all of you, patience like me or like each shit. Like cool, everybody wants to tell me, but what about this Gary, like the one fucking lucky lottery ticket, go in the lottery then. What about this startup that did it in 18 months on some fucking serendipity of the stars? God's will like you said, like okay, cool. Somebody won $100 million just during the lottery ticket, you playing, you banking your life on the lotto. So I just don't understand why people don't get how lucky they have it. I don't know if I ever would have worked for my father if I had the internet that you guys have. I probably wouldn't have made it. I would have made too much money before then, but I would have made too much money because I'm a dirt kid. And even the dirt kids have become fancy. Everybody just thinks it's easier than it is. Yeah, I appreciate that. I also want to mention Babson. I know you know, well, former CEO, CMO, Jeffrey Nicholson came to Babson a couple of years ago to speak, but I don't know if you're ever in Boston, but our entire campus lives, eats, and breathes the content you push and all the entrepreneurship. I would love to get my ass there. I actually went there years ago, like real years ago, maybe like 12 now with early Facebook shit. I'm open to it. Send me an email. You see it works for you, right? Send me an email. It was funny, actually all freshman year, I sent for like two weeks straight emails at 8 AM directly to your DM. I love that. Yeah, see that's it. And then it worked. I did it to like Mark Cuban and he sent it to like Shark Tank. It was all a day. It's all that stuff, man. And it's like, and it's like. It works. It does work and like, or it doesn't, but like, how are you gonna know if you don't try? Bro, the only way you're gonna build this brand is by becoming a religious gangster of social media content at scale. And you all, you guys have all the advantages. When I talk to the CMOs of the big brands, they don't know what's happening in the culture. You guys do. You know you could go on the street right now and do the interview format. You know you could do this. You know you could do that fucking famous, you know the moves. I just, and this is not just to you. This is to all of you. I just don't think people are putting in the work. They're talking about it. They're thinking about it. They're just not doing it. Once you flip over and be like, wait a minute, I'm actually fully, what's fucking you up now is you're conforming to what you're not in control of. I need to find someone to write me a check. I need to win this competition. These are all subjective calls. I gotta get, no, no, no. You need to wake up tomorrow and decide what are you gonna do with that teacher.
