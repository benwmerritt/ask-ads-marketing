It's just best fucking practices, man. You know, it's not super complicated. That first second of the video, the headline, the thumbnail, the copy, the community management, commenting on pages, comments as content. Like it's literally day trading attention. It's day to day micro tweaks that create the arbitrages that occasionally create massive virality, but more often is just little tiny, tiny bricks. Attention is the number one asset. Chris, what's good? Great to be here, man. Long time listener, first time call. It is such a pleasure, brother. Where are you physically? I'm in Litchfield County, Connecticut. I love it. So before I jump in, just wanted to say thank you for all that you do for the community, and especially love what you're doing with V-Friends. I think it's a really positive message for kids. Thank you. I mean, I've got my now nine-year-old hooked, where we're tuning into fanatics for all the shows. Proud to display two of our proud offerings. The one-on-one was pulled on fanatics, and the Viking is actually a Gary-owned. Brother, that is absolutely amazing. I can't wait for the cartoons to come out on YouTube Kids this summer. The nine-year-old's gonna love them. Yeah, excited that you've partnered with those folks that make the Cocoa Mellon stuff. It's a great partnership. Great. Thank you, brother. Thank you, Chris. I want to give a shout out to your amazing team on the V-Friends side. Rips, Conman, and Courtney are really building a great community, and they really take care of every other stuff. I agree, Chris. They're one of the things. It's one of my favorite things going on in my entire business world is what's going on on Fanatics Live. Those shows, just like the community is out of control. The vibes are out of control. And that vibrates, and you've seen what's been going on with the box prices, and you can feel it. For me, especially, it gets exciting, because watching people go from the cards to then into the NFTs, which supports the original NFTs, it's just super fun. Anyway, real pleasure to see you, Chris. Thank you, bud. So my question, so a couple of years ago, my wife and I decided we wanted to start a side hustle that's now grown into a full-time business. So my specific question is, we operate a physical shop, and we have an online presence. We've got our website. We sell through third-party sales channels, things like eBay and Cherish. And we specialize in home decor, vintage, and antiques. So I was wondering what unique strategies would you recommend for driving growth to create a seamless brand experience across all these sort of disparate channels? You know what, that's an academic question, Chris. Like, even break that down, a seamless brand experience. That sounds like either you or your wife went to advertising school or took a marketing class. We have a background. My wife worked in cosmetics marketing for about two decades, and I still operate in the advertising, in the digital advertising system. This is per, I mean, I'm gonna take a lot of credit for sniffing that out based on you saying that. I will tell you the reason VaynerMedia is crushing people is that I understand that relevance to as many different consumer segmentations is a cohesive brand execution. Do you know that Nike sells sweatpants in outlet stores, in rural areas all around this country, at heavy discounts? You know that? Yeah. Do you also know that they sell $1,000 sneakers in the coolest cities in the world that are impossible to get? That's cool. I agree. They do that. They sell very high-end sneakers. They sell low-end apparel. They have stores, they have .com, they have app. They have tons of retailers that resell their shit. There is nothing cohesive about it. So worry less about connecting everything. The reason I was able to sniff out that either you or your wife and or someone close to you was coming from more of a academic or old framework of marketing was the words you chose to use. Yeah. A seamless brand experience is you just executing well for customers on all the channels. Yeah. Well, my concern is we're in so many different places. So we've got a shop in Southport, Connecticut. We've got a website where we predominantly sell, do-it-yourself products to refurbish anti-furnishings and then predominantly we sell furnishings and decor through third-party channels like Cherish where it's not our own. Yeah, but that's because you are showing up where the consumer is. Mm-hmm. Like the world has changed. Retail and marketing has fundamentally changed since you and your wife started your careers. Yeah. There's fragmentation. What are you gonna not show up in those places? No, of course. We wanna see a better place where our customer is. You need to be in more places. Okay. Ideas? Sure. What is, so break down the businesses a little bit for me. Sure. The three entities, what are they selling and how are they doing? Like what's working better than not? Sure. So in our shop, we're predominantly selling anti-furnishings and decor that are sourced from around the US and Europe. Okay. How's that going? Excellent. Should you open a second store then? Possibly. I mean, in what we do, it's all about location. We've found a solid location. We're embedded into a great neighborhood. Do you believe? I don't know if we can replicate that. Of course. Not at large? I didn't say that. I said a second. Okay. I didn't say large scale. I'm not trying to turn you into fucking Walmart. Are there other rich booths? Are there other rich bougie areas in the tri-state area that are suburbs of New York City? The answer is yes. Yeah. So, business number, any suggestions? The fact that you've got retail working at a time that retails incredibly challenging. Means that there's demand for what you do. You may not want to do a second store because stores are tough, I get it. But it's very clear that you might have the capacity to do that. Gosh. Next. On the e-commerce side, we're selling product through third party channels. So, Cherish is like the eBay of interior design. We've had success there, but obviously a lot of competition. So, how do you really differentiate yourself inside that platform? By having better images and better copy and better headlines and being a better executor of. What's up, Nick Dale? Thanks for joining. We're already Dale, right? So, the reason I wrote this is, like every single piece of content I've ever put out could have been better. The cop, like what, right? Some element of it could have been better. Like the fact that we know that and we're obsessed about it, fuck. So, same thing with e-bag. And say Cherish and all these platforms like, there's better execution. So, doubling down on that. Gotcha. Are you running ads on those platforms? We're predominantly running ads on the Meta properties, Facebook and Instagram. We find those are really positive from an ROI perspective for us. What about YouTube shorts? We haven't gotten into YouTube shorts. It's something we want to do. So, let's do that anyway, especially for what you do, because don't forget YouTube's the second biggest search engine in the world and the search query long tail aspect of your shorts, especially with how specific what you sell is, you might be able to find long-term brand building and long-term conversion on YouTube shorts in a way that you can't on Meta and Instagram. Gotcha. That makes sense to you, right? It does, absolutely. Okay, what about the third one? What was the third one? And then thirdly, we sell through our website, but predominantly because we're selling unique pieces that are one of a kind, those are traditionally selling either in store or through those third channels. Online, we're predominantly today selling products for individuals that want to repurpose. So, basically, instead of sending antique and vintage furniture that your family has, instead of sending it to the landfill, reviving it, bringing it in a day to day style. Well, Chris, how much content of you and your wife and or either one of you just doing informational videos in short form video for brand building purposes and potential upside-by-rality that would lead to people landing on your profiles and then clicking to your business? Are you guys doing brand building, not sales? We've done some. We used to do a lot more. There's a lot of competition in that DIY product space where it presses on margins and it's honestly not necessarily an area we really want to focus too heavily on. Understood. Listen, there was plenty of things we touched on that you clearly can do. I would say the last one is brand building and you're building your personal brands and that is the only boat you have in the world we live in today. Gotcha. Right? So, your short-term ROI might not be there, but it might be your only long-term ROI insurance policy. Okay. I mean, you know this, you guys both grew up in marketing. Brand is everything. Awesome. Thank you. Bye. What's up, Gary? How you doing? Oh, Joe, what's up, brother? Good to see you. You too, man. Congrats on this livestream. This is a hell of a marathon. I'm trying, man, man. Thank you for that. How's it going? Good, good. If you hear my newborn baby girl, well, she's not newborn anymore, but she might be in the background crying a bit, but... We'll also talk, brother. That's amazing. Thank you, man. But yeah, I've just tuned in. Like, is the format Q&A or like, are we gonna add value to the audience? Like, I can share a lot from experience at Instagram. Let me tell you how you add value. You're such a good dude. First, tell the audience who you are and what you do and where they can find you. And then if you have a random question for your career, I'm happy to answer it. Hey, guys, my name is John Yousai. I used to work inside Instagram and YouTube for the past eight years. And now I make videos about what I couldn't talk about on the inside and we're one of YouTube's fastest growing educational channels. We have about 20 million views per month. And it's exciting to see just all the interviews that we've done with Mr. Beast, Logan Paul. We did an interview with Gary recently and just it's cool to see the community growing. So thank you for all this support. And thank you, Gary, for having me as part of the Vayner family. We love having you have Vayner speakers. I see Zach smiling cheek to cheek here in the background. Bro, I can't wait for you to read day trading attention. I actually, I'm gonna really value your feedback. So I'm looking forward to that as well. Actually, with the new board, you can actually get the kids book too. This is good. I'm waiting on both fronts. Any questions you have, like current things you're thinking about that I can answer? The biggest thing is like, you know, I think there's a lot of people who are trying to educate in this space. And I'm wondering, what would you do in my shoes? Like we've seen like incredible growth. We're at an inflection point. Like we just like cross a million dollars in revenue and sponsorships and consulting. Like when you were at this point in your career, what were you trying to do to like kind of hit the next step change? Double doubting on what got me there. Like you're, it's too early to like rethink it. To me, it's like before you have, like do exactly what you're doing for again. Like, you know, like meaning like, you need to keep building momentum. There's a lot more to go. And it's all like the stuff you talk about and the stuff that I talk about and what this book's about, right? Like best practices, you know, it's just best fucking practices, man. You know, it's not super complicated. That first second of the video, the headline, the thumbnail, the copy, the fucking community management, commenting on pages when I call cast C and talk about in the book, comments as content. Like this is all I've been doing for the last fucking, it's literally day trading attention. It's day to day, micro tweaks that create the arbitrages that occasionally create massive virality, but more often is just little tiny, tiny bricks. Right? Yeah, absolutely. You know this, you've been in the fucking game. Like, there's moments in time. And the other thing is experimenting. I think one of the things I've done very well is I experiment with content. You know, I'm always trying to find the format. Is it a carousel? Is it an image? Is it audio? And then putting yourself in a position to create good content, right? This format's a remarkable format for me in helping the audience, giving awareness to my two new books, but it's also an incredible format to create content from. Yeah. Right? The post-production of some of these Q and A's that I've got are gonna be really meaningful content for me. Paul, I'm not taking a break yet. Paul. I'm not taking a break yet. What experiments are you seeing that are working, Gary? Like, I see you like trying out a lot of things. I'm very hot, very hot on TikTok Live. They're just creating awareness in a way that I think is meaningful. I also think it's, you know, what I think really works is just trying different versions of the same thing that might work better for you as a human. Like, for example, you, you're such a good interviewer. Like, maybe, like I, if I'm you, I do a full pledge interview with a person walking in a park. The whole interview. Like, what if that's the meant, what if you're the best in the world at that? Yeah. Because you also have improv skills and like a bird pooping on your shoulder is like the good thing, not the bad thing. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah, come to think of it, I mean, our most popular video got 3.2 million views was, I went to Florida and I spent the day with Danny Duncan and we just traveled around like his studio and all that. And it was an interview, but just walk and talk, just like you said. Yeah. And like, obviously Danny's, you know, merging and getting bigger and bigger. Like there's all that, but maybe it was, was the more vloggy style stuff, right? And maybe you do another interview where you just, you know, you know, eat at a diner the whole time. Yeah. And you're like, oh, wait a minute, this is the format. Like, you know what I mean? 100%. 100%. Or maybe you go to Vicky's ice cream store. Vicky can plug it now in, in the YouTube jet. Tell everybody about your awesome ice cream store. So like, there's that. Then there's also like, putting a huge focus on translating all of your videos into AI voice, different languages, and maybe you explode in Portuguese. Like I plan on becoming enormous in Brazil and Portugal in 2025 and six, because my content's gonna be translated. It's gonna be my voice with the raspy and the high pitch, which is very unique and my cadence is unique. And so like that's gonna do much better than subtitles. Yeah. Yeah. Actually we're dubbing our content right now because I find that creator education abroad is not as anywhere as good as it is in the US and the UK. Bro, not even. Innovation lives here with all this stuff everybody else. But there'd be no fucking confusion. Yeah. Again, I also wanted to ask, I know you've always like preached documenting over creating. Yep. You know, how do you adapt that to 2024? Cause I hear a lot of people who say, you know, there's not a lot to like document about their lives. And so they go about trying to manufacture and create something artificial. And then you can see it on camera. Like how do you, what's your 2024 take on document, not creative, somebody doesn't have a lot to document in their daily life. Cause I also helped along with folks with the executive with their corporate. Yeah. Operational and entrepreneurial and managerial ASMR. What do you mean by that? Still fucking documented. Like you understand, like document, don't document, don't create the thing you brought up. Let's bring up the meta of it. A kid who came here to like meet with me a little bit. It was something I said to him during our talk, that little clip, that was just a normal Monday meeting. There was nothing super fucking remarkable about it. It was just, I said an insight that I hadn't said like that before. I did it today during this. I've never said that entrepreneurs need to fall in love with yet. However, in the history of all my fucking yapping. So I think what document don't create allows is for post production opportunity. Yeah. Do you, speaking about that, do you write by doing everything on camera? Like I find that I look at your repurposing process and I see something that you wrote, but it was really something that you said on camera. Like all my writing, everything on GaryVinertiuk.com is from camera. And then Mackenzie will hit me up and I'll maybe add a line or two or an update, but it's 100%. My book is that too. Yeah. Yeah. Like my process is talking. Yeah. Yeah. It's so powerful. Cause I find that we're like, our newsletter is growing a lot because we're pulling from my voice in the podcast and it just makes it so, it doesn't even feel like it's like being written for me. People always come in and they're like, man, your book really sounds like it's awesome. I don't know. Oh shit. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Let me know if I'm asking too many questions. No, you're very, obviously you do this for a living and bringing value to everyone. So let's do one more. Cause I want to try. What are the most practical AI tools right now for content creation? I got a few on my mind, but I'm curious cause I think there's a lot of them. The truth is I'm not deep enough yet. We're still, what happened was we got into a place where we were so concerned about the terms of services of a lot of them, of like what me ingesting that much level of my content would mean. And so we were trying to be thoughtful. And so we're just starting to, we're kind of over the hump finally. I'll have a tremendous answer to that question in six months, but I got, one thing I'm really proud of is I try to talk about the shit I know versus when I don't. I'm high level right now, not in the weeds enough. And my team and I are just about to go on that journey in a more significant way. Cause we finally got our kind of like paperwork in a place where the market is end my legal team. Like we're in a place where I like it. And so I think that's going to be a, we just started the earliest meetings on that that I'm excited about. So I'll give you a much better answer the next time I see you. Cool. Well, if you ever want to swap notes, like our team has been testing a lot of stuff with AI. I'll have Sid who's sitting right next to me right now, reach out to you and see like what his learnings have been and versus what your practicality understanding is. Yeah. Happy to help. We've been testing a lot of things with like YouTube and Instagram just working with my old colleagues. So anything I could share, I'm always happy to help. Obviously you guys are already killing it. So. Yeah, fair enough. But you know this like one, like this is what's so fun about the game. Like we're killing it. And there's 9,700 things I know we're doing wrong. You just can't get, you know, and I think for everybody who's watching right now, even when you're at the top of your game, you're top of your game. And then you go into slumps, Tyrese Halliburton was fucking killing it too in the first half of the NBA season. Not so much right now. All of a sudden a lot of film on how he does it. People adjust. I was about to go to their necks. You tweak a hamstring. Sometimes we get hurt. It comes in the form of people like moving around on teams or different things happen or you take your eye off the ball for six months. Like, yes, we are macro killing it, but I can promise you right now, I am not in the most prime time of my career of content. There's been many times from 2006 to right now that I felt stronger about my game. And that's also because me being at the top of it is so focused on building V-Friends and VaynerX that my energy myself, like GaryVee is a distant priority for me in comparison to where it was in different parts of my career. And oh by the way, it may emerge back up in four years and I feel like I will dominate that year or a new platform will come more naturally to me. Right, the next big platform might come super natural to me. It might be a just a, just talk ad hoc from the hip platform. Well, that's gonna be good for me. You know what I mean? So like that's where we're at. Cool man. Well, I appreciate you having me on and just, yeah, thank you. I love this. I love that you're experimenting, you're humble enough to even admit that when you're at where you're at in the game. So thank you Gary. Thanks brother, love you, talk soon. Pleasure, see you. Gary, thank you for the book. I just had my first granddaughter, super excited to go through that with her. Denise, you don't even know how much that means to me. First of all, I love that photo you got in the background. You don't even know like hearing, how old is she? She's four months. Amazing. Like just the thought that you're gonna be reading her meet me in the middle. And like when she's like four, she like loves the patient pig. It's like crazy to see a dream become a reality for me on this. So you know how much I care about this world. And so just fun to keep building the bricks and we're on our way. So congratulations on the first one. That is a big mental moment. The grandparent thing I hear is super awesome. It is, it's truly amazing. I think she was born like a month after John Dumas's. So, you know, the freedom journal was a big part of us getting to V-Con. So I'll tell you what, and we're so excited that it's an LA. My question is really simple is like, my kids take care of social media for swing tables. I own a colon hydrotherapy spa. So it's all about poop every day. Yep. And I work with a lot. You're in the ship business. I'm in the ship business. And I work with a lot of people that go down, you know, are sick for a long time, which was my history. Sit for nine years, couldn't figure it out, diagnosed anyway with all different things except for what was really going on. And that was an unhealthy gut. I call my mom. I mean, I mean gut health is massive. Talk about something that we didn't talk about 30 years ago that is going to be, I mean, gut health, motherfucker, Jesus. It's such a big fucking deal. Both intuition and gut health. I mean, I'm so excited about like the fact that over the last 10 years, there's been so much progress with our all knowledge about this. And you're right. There's a lot of people that are gonna be in much better places in the future. And obviously, you know, there's just a lot to it. Obviously, there's other things to it. I mean, AJ has Crohn's disease and there's that. That's easier to diagnose than what we're talking about right now. But the gut health thing is like, I'm excited about people getting more overall aware of it. And I think a lot of people out there who aren't feeling great are on an even couple of people here that might bring this up now to their general practitioner. And that might lead them down a path that excites me. So good for you. Keep going. Yeah. So my biggest question is, I spend all day on the phone and I just, I give my time away talking with my gut, talking with my Clonic customers. So they come in, they get a Clonic, they're taking care of there, but then they book a 10 minute discovery call with me. I would, and I don't do anything on social media and I know I can. So my question to you was at this point in my journey where I just wanna be able to help more people without being on calls with them, maybe doing some videos, giving them some ideas, whether they're in our state or they're not in our state, they could use the ideas that we have. Literally replicate what I'm doing right now. You should run some ads about, you're doing a Q and A around good health on this date, eight weeks from now, email everybody you know, text everyone you know, hit up to clients, talk about friends, make some content, run some ads, and literally, literally just answer on a live stream questions about it. And then post after it's done, take the recording, take the recording, clip it up, and put it out on social. What you wanna do is what I wanted to do, I wanted to help more entrepreneurs, not less. There's only so many entrepreneurs I can help with the Sasha Group. People watching right now, you should go check out thesasagroup.com. It's a great agency, we're the best in the business for small businesses, but some people can't afford it. Some people don't want to, some people can, but like content, content, content, content, but Q and A is a great way to create content when you have an expertise. And do it live, just put it out there. You don't have to, but it is one of the ways you can do it. Yeah, I just, I don't want to currently, I don't have time currently to learn every platform and start posting and doing it that way. So if I literally just go after this on a live level, do the question and answers, and then see where it goes from there. Yeah, I mean like, you just said that at this point in your life, your number one goal is to help as many people about this as possible. Correct. So how do you not have fucking time to learn all this shit? I gotta tell you, I don't know, it must be a major blocker. Of course it's a major blocker. If your goal is to help as many people as possible, your number one job in the world, because you already know what the fuck you're talking about, you don't need to go study more of that. Right. You need to figure out how to get more humans to consume the information. Okay. So learn it. So learn it. Right. Think about how you feel when you hear people like, I'm not feeling well and you're like, gut health and you go do a little research that we could talk about. Like I'm talking just casually and they're like, Yeah. And then you're like so frustrated with them that they're not, they're complaining about not feeling well but they haven't got. But they're not, yeah. That's what you're doing to me right now. You just told me that your biggest goal right now at this point in your life, your number one goal is to help as many people with this as possible. But then you told me that you don't have time to figure out how to create distribution for that message. Ooh, you nailed it. Awesome. I'm so excited you're gonna read this book. I'm telling you right now, this is my best effort in book form to help people be good at what I just asked you to do. And do you learn well from reading books? Yeah. Reading and writing it out and then teaching it. You're gonna fucking love it. And this one's really like text, I wouldn't say it's like full textbook but like it's like, you know, it's gonna have examples. There's fucking, you know, like, there's fucking all sorts of like weird fucking charts. Like shit that I like, like this is not how I learned. Like I hate this book, but like, but everybody's gonna, but the world's gonna love it. And then because I hate that, that I also then made the backend, which is like, you know, quick takes and opinions. And like, you know, like pot, I mean, it really goes deep, podcast clips. You know, like this is gonna be a to do. Like I'm pretty, I have a feeling like, I have a feeling even people that like to shit on me and aren't GaryVee people are gonna like, I'm gonna see tweets out there like, you know, I don't really fuck with GaryVee, but I gotta say this book, like I feel like it's one of those moments in my career, which I remember that happened with the big PDF that we put out the 84 pieces of content that helps so many people. Like this is, it's gonna be fucking huge for you. That's awesome. And that's the first one coming, right? Yes, that's the, of these two bundles. Yes, that one comes out May 17th. May 21st, July 16th for the kids book. It's perfect. Cause the little one's so little for the kids. Right. It's perfect. Yeah. Thank you. Love you. Thank you. Love you too. Andrew, what's good? What's up man? Great to see you. What do you got? I'm a real estate guy. So I'm trying to do this pivot, right? I've been doing this for 20 years. And truly my passion has always been the investment side of the real estate. And so I'm kind of getting into this whole space. And I've done, I've done some, you know, I push the button, I've done a little bit of content. You know, you might say that I'm not very consistent cause I'm not, but I'm trying to look more for, you know, what is it, where do I start? Dude, I mean, I know part of it's pushing the button and I'm, you know, I can, I can, I'm pretty knowledgeable. I can talk about a lot of things. And we've done like a lot of X spaces with- What about podcasts? So me and my brother do do a podcast, but it's not a real estate podcast. So we do a podcast. So I do lots of shows. Start another one. That's real estate and interview people in the real estate industry by reaching out to them on LinkedIn and like people that you can't even get to because a lot of people that you can't get to tend to say yes to be on podcasts even if you have no listeners. I'm dropping some alpha right now for everyone. A lot of people want to get to people in life. Forget about fandom and they think you're cool. I'm talking about business. Like you'd love to pick the brain of one of the biggest real estate developers of all time. Well, right now you have no fucking chance of doing that because if they're one of the biggest real estate developers they're 70, 80 or 90 and they're fucking richest fuck and they're like off the grid. But some of these people like want to tell their life story, want more people to know who they are. And like we'll say yes to you emailing them on LinkedIn about doing your podcast in a world that they would never even look at any of your other cold outreaches. It is a hack. And I think I've been pretty successful with getting some people, I mean, but you're right with the real estate side, that would be good. And I've gotten some good people in terms of, you know. When you say start, like what are you trying to accomplish? It's sharing the knowledge because I, you know, I've been doing it for so long. There's so much information that- Why can't you just be sharing the knowledge? Cause if it was just about sharing knowledge you'd be sharing knowledge. Right. And it's getting people to, I mean, I guess, you know, you feel like it's sometimes a waste of time when nobody shows up, right? Well, that's just called lack of patience. I worked out every day for the last 10 years and didn't have any chest muscles to show for all the fucking work I put in. And then for some reason it just started happening last year. Tell me more about like the podcast. So if I were to start, I mean, dude, you don't just do just the podcast. You should probably do like short videos. Right. You do the podcast and then you clip from the podcast. Like you will see clips from this day all over my social over the next several weeks. Yeah. Post production of longer form content into shorter form content. But then you have to know how to make the thumbnail, the title, the first, second, the copy. Like this is a skills game, but it will likely be a single piece of short film video content that leads to your growth of your podcast. Through something like TikTok and threads, all that jazz. Yep. My last question, dude, and I asked you about balance, like the balance between work and life. And you told me there is no balance. Cause there isn't. But my definition of balance is and yours and Zach's and Dustin's is different. And by the way, all of the people I just mentioned, we've got different definitions of balance than we've had before. Every one of us is definition of balance is different today than five years ago. Meaning how we subjectively decide how we're balancing right now. Yeah. I don't know if I said who the fuck is the judge and jury of balance. Yeah. Balance in a relationship is decided by the people in the relationship. Yeah. There's a lot of relationships that liked it. Like my mom and dad joke of like, they liked it when they were like both divided and conquered. And now they like it more than they like it ebbs and flows also. Balance is someone beating themselves up. I hate that. I hate when people beat themselves up. And do what makes you happy, right? I mean. And you need to be compassionate. You need to be considerate. And you need to know life is fair. Meaning if you're out of balance and you don't spend a moment with your kids, when they're 20, they'll tell you about it. Yeah. And when you're dealing with that pain cause now you want to spend time with them and they don't want to spend time with you, you'll pay the price. Life is fair. 100% man. Love it. Thanks for everything. I got 25 books. Kids are coming to VCon, VCon 24. We'll be there baby. I love your problem. Hello Gary. Andrew, how are you? I'm fine. Thank you. I'm from Romania. And I will give you a little bit of context before I start. By the way, Andrew, I apologize. One of my most viral videos ever, the one where I talk about self-esteem with the young woman that's always pinned on my top of my accounts was in Romania. At Brandmines, I think. I was there. That's right. Go ahead, my friend. Okay. So I'm a former professional ballroom dancer. I began to dance since I was nine years old. After that, I began to teach. So at the age of 20, I started my own dance studio in Romania. Okay. After that, inspired by your videos, I began to make a content in 2020. Something like that when TikTok was at the beginnings. After that, I made thousands of video and I have an audience with around 800K followers now on my Romanian account. Okay. To monetize this audience, I scaled my business with an online dance platform for the wedding dances, prom dances, dances. Okay. This year, I wanted, okay, maybe I can do that. I can do that in an international level. So I begin a content like in English. Okay. And I started my account at the beginning of February and I made one million followers on Instagram in 30 days. How? With a good format. Clearly. Yes. So I teach people how to dance in squares. What's your Instagram account? It's like my name is Andrew. I see. I see. Okay. Keep talking. So I did this format where I teach people how to dance in squares. That was my first three videos that went around 20 million views. Okay. After that, I replicate that format because this format is also great in my Romanian account. So I try to do all the best things I did in my Romanian account to put it in an international one. Okay. Now, last week I was in Turkey in Istanbul and I tried to do some clips with some creators from there. For example, I filmed with a guy with 5 million followers on TikTok. Okay. Try those kinds of things. And now my main question, because now we have a little bit of context, is the following. I should, okay. I can go with this format till, I don't know, till where, but I can do it. But to make a real connection with people, I feel to broaden, to broaden a little bit the content because to be more like, put a little bit of personal branding in it, not just to be a teacher dancing in the squares. 100%. More and yes, instead of no. Of course you should mix that in. You should at least see how it does. My main fear is the reach, of course. Of course. You know, even the way you asked that question, you've heard me say this before, you know. I get that you're scared of that. You're not gonna fuck up the algorithm. You'll be fine. Okay. Because the only reason you're looking to do that is you can feel that it's plateauing. Yes, yes. I know, I know what you're thinking, Andrew. I can feel that, right? That's right, you weren't thinking about expanding at your heat, which is when you should have been doing it to show other sides of you. You're only now willing to listen to me because you can feel your plateauing. Of course. Of course. So. So fucking do it. Knowing that I should again climb the mountain and after that brought it, or I just can do it now, even if I have this fear of maybe. You already know the answer. You don't have an option. I know, but I want to hear it from you. Well, I'm happy to give it to you. Brother, for everybody else who's listening, it's always more fun to put yourself out of business than letting someone else do it. Right? So the reality is very simple. The things I talk about are true. Like you have to expand other reasons for people to care about you. And when you find something that works, and you clearly did, I mean, that's insane. The kind of Instagram growth you had. Kudos, congratulations. But you've got to keep giving people things. You've always got to keep giving people things. Right. Otherwise, it becomes the mundane. But you can't do things that don't come natural or you don't believe in, right? So it needs to be authentic, whatever it is. But yeah, you got to show people other things. Okay. That's a huge opportunity for you. Even making a video of how you thought about making those first three videos and why that, you thought that and how that led to it. It'd be very powerful content. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay. And now do you think, because this is an opportunity for me, because okay, I did this account. I'm pretty known in Romania. I'm the most followed dance teacher in Romania, in that specific zone. But now I should focus 100% on this opportunity of international skating. Not 100%. Not 100%. 100% of anything is always dangerous. Okay. 80, 20? Nothing like that. That's right. All right. Okay. And the last question, because I also asked my audience about it. For example, in Romania, I have a dance platform like I told you. I should put it on the English account, or okay, in the international account when I promote it, it should be like my own name. Okay, it's Andrew minus dance or something. Or I should give it like a more branded name, or it doesn't matter, or what do you mean? It doesn't matter. Names are made. Okay. Execution. Okay, so... Execution. Okay. I'm fine with that. Thank you, Gary. It was an honor to be here. Pleasure to be with you. Congratulations on your success, brother. Thank you. Talk soon. Hey, everybody.
