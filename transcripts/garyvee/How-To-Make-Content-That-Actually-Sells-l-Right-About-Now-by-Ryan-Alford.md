## Transcript
I believe marketers and businesses are gonna regret the living shit out of the social media free distribution era, and that's why, while we're still in it, I'm yelling at the top of the mountains like, please go get your attention. Look, there might be another invention, but I do believe that in the next 15 to 20 years, we're gonna be in VR heavy, and when we're in VR heavy, social's dead, and I don't know if Apple and Facebook or Amazon or Google or whoever wins VR, if they're not in the mood to give you free awareness, then guess what? People are gonna be talking about how there's gold in your free awareness, and we all fucked up and didn't go hard enough. You know, people have regrets of like, aw, wish in college, I went to more parties, because now I can't, or like, aw, I wish, I spent more time with my dad, because he just passed, and now I can't. I want this for everyone, because I think it's gonna go away. Attention is the number one asset. What's up guys, welcome to Right About Now, where it's always right, and it's always now. Join today, you know, it doesn't need much of an introduction, but you know, I've got at least six titles for them. Serial entrepreneur, chairman of VaynerX, CEO of VaynerMedia, in five times. New York Times best sellers, and we're gonna make it six. Gary Vee, what's up brother? How are you my friend? I'm good, you know? Life is good, I cannot complain. Life is- I won't listen anyway. Life is good when you decide it's good. That's right. And control our own destiny. You know, it's actually scary how much perspective is the punchline, right? Like, there's, for every person listening, there are millions, if not hundreds of millions, and probably if they're listening to this, billions of people, actually definitely billions of people on earth that have it quote unquote worse than you. There's 800, of course it's billions, there's 850 million people on earth that don't have access to clean water. And somebody before listening to this podcast this morning was complaining that their flight was delayed for 30 minutes. Yeah. You know what Gary, I just thought about the pothole that I cursed out on the ride over here to my office. I drive one mile to work. Brother, you need to make a video of you filling that pothole in the middle of the night and post it on Facebook locally, and you'll become a local hero. No shit. I'll send it to city council. You know, they get my taxes. I should fix this one pothole. I'll do it for them, for the sake of the whole town. Gary, what the hell's new, man? I mean, you got your hands in so much shit, like, I don't even know how you keep, I have my hands in a lot of shit, and I watch you and I'm like, God, how do you keep your head straight? I think for me at this point in my career, I have so many right hand men and women, right? Like, I'm in an earned, luxurious place of eating a lot of crow and putting a lot of deposits down over the last 30 years, right? So at 48, you know, when people are like, VaynerSports and VFriends and VaynerMedia and then VaynerX, there's A companies under it, and then the pickleball team and then the restaurant group, VCR, and you know, just like to your point, and there's the winetext.com. Everybody, if you buy wine, winetext.com, sign up. Like that, like, they see it and they're like, how? And I'm like, well, AJ, my brother, Marcus, who's been with me for 15 years, runs the Sasha group. Kailin McNamara is my chief business officer for VaynerX. She's been here 11 years. Hannah's my chief of staff. She's been here for 10 years. Claude is HR for all of it, 10 years. Mark Yudkin, general counsel and conciliators and COO for VaynerX, 16 years. Brandon Warnicke's my best friend for the last 34 years, once wine business. Ryan Harwood's my GM and partner in the pickleball team. 13 years. Like, you know, you're young in your journey. You're a youngster. As you make, this is the reason people don't understand. If you wanna build something meaningful, it's only relationships. If I had people that I just hired a year or two ago in all the roles that I just mentioned, by the way, there's another 50 that I didn't mention that are here seven to 15 years, either running departments, offices or important things. Andy K runs VFriends, 13 years. Sid runs my personal brand content, a decade. Like, Dustin, you've been here now four, six. You know, like, it's, you know, build a culture, do right by people, give a shit about them, create longevity. I don't know how many people listening, like football, the way I do American football, but if your offensive line is intact, the same offensive line year after year after year, watch how good your football team will be. Not real anymore with injuries and free agency, but Jesus Christ, that's how. Takes a village. It takes a village. And it requires you to love them, not they work for you. And that's where everyone gets it fucked up. When you're a boss, you work for them, not they work for you. And the day you figure that out is the day you start creating continuity, and the day you start creating continuity, you start to build the blueprint for scale. Yep. Amen. I learned that the hard way, man. I did, you know, my time in Madison Avenue in New York, you know, in my late 20s, early 30s, and it was me, me, me, me, me, me, you know? And I thought I could carry the role on my own talents or ability or, you know, whatever the hell. And you get grounded real quick, you cannot grow, you can't do what you want without others, without a hell of a team. If people don't like you, you're in trouble. That's right. People are never gonna like someone that is only in me life. When you flip that M and you go, we life, it gets real good real fast. And then as a complex, thoughtful leader, you start to understand some people want money, some people want a title because they're insecure and they want the status, some people want work-life balance. By the way, some people, and these are the people I'm always gravitating, they want challenges and different things. They want it, some people want to travel. So, I mean, I don't know, like I'm not in the business of judging what my employees want, I'm in the business of trying to figure it out. Yep. And it sounds like you're doing a pretty fucking good job of it, you got a lot of longevity there. I saw Claude's post yesterday, I think it was like 10 years. And I was like, you know, your chief people officer hanging around for 10 years, that says a lot. In a real way, and you know, it's the thing I'm most proud of. It's also the thing I'm most disappointed about in my career, I would have more people to name for you right now if I had the ability to be candorous to my employees in my 20s and 30s. Gary V, the one that all of you know if you know who I am, he built himself on candor. It's my greatest strength, I'm trying to tell the truth, both in the macro and the micro, right? In the macro with like all my mindset stuff, in the micro, this is why I wrote the new book, this shit. Did you get a chance to look at it, Ry? Oh yeah. Did you read it or skim it? Did you see it on the screen? I did. Did you get a chance to read it, or did you skim it, or neither? I don't care, I'm just curious. No, I got about three fourths the way through it, brother. Great. So you agree with me that it's a fucking textbook, like it's detailed. Oh dude, it should be in every school, in every business school, it's more, honestly Gary, as I read it, I thought more like curriculum, slash, I was coarse like it was so, get charts and shit. I think you said that on social the other day, but that's so funny, I was exactly what I thought, I was like, it is, it's like a damn schoolbook for how to own social media. It's not even social media. I feel like that, yeah, it's market. It's like, you know, go where people are. Yeah, it's to that point. So, you know, when I think about things, I'm trying to bring value, right? That is the number one thing I'm thinking about at all times and so my candor is incredible. In, because if you don't give it, you can't really bring value as a public figure. In my private life, both personal and professional, but sticking on professional, my inability to communicate when I loved someone, and I'm a lover boy, meaning like, you work for me for a week and I think you're a good kid and you got something, I'm like, we're family, like I go in, I'm like into team, like I, like, I'm, I'm very uncle, I'm very into that. Coach Gary, Guiman's counselor, Gary, big brother Gary, I love that shit. It's my gift and at times my curse. And when I say my curse, it made me not be able to tell people that were bad at their job, that they were bad at their job. And then what would happen is I would get resentment because I wasn't communicating. And then at some point I would fire them sloppily because I didn't give them enough feedback. That is the great scarlet letter of my professional building culture career. I feel like I've really supermanned it. I think I've, I think I will be revered, I believe that. And that's a ridiculous thing to say, but I really do think when I'm old, people, when they look back at all the footage, people will realize that empathy and kindness, people that, words that people thought were like soft, sissy stuff in business land, that I looked at it as like a real thing, not because I'm altruistic, but because I wanna fucking build businesses and build empires and it requires it. And I think people will look back at me being a contributor to the evolution of finding that middle. Now the problem is when people hear me say this shit, sometimes they think that I'm talking about entitlement. Right, Rai, you know this. Right now the biggest issue for businesses, mine included, is you've got employees who don't wanna work and get paid. And so I just wanna say real fast when everyone hears me talking about kindness and all this nice stuff, I'm not talking about like eighth place trophies, I'm not talking about entitlement, I'm talking about finding the middle and I'm passionate about that. Yeah, well I think you've found a pretty good balance of it. You know, I am gonna come for my check though. I lost a million dollars found over my passion in a car business in 2014. And that shit didn't work. I had Carvana's idea before Carvana. I just didn't know how to operate. I knew how to market. Yeah, I'm a marketer. Well, you just explained that I was actually right. Right, that following your passion almost led you to Carvana, it just sounds that you weren't good enough to pull it off. I wasn't. Right, I say this all the time, like passion's always right, cause you like it more, you know this. You know, like look, I love marketing, so I love VaynerMedia. You know, I love wine collecting and trading cards and like it's easy for me to do well in things that I love. If you know, look, I'm a salesman, I could sell anything, but if you like something more, you're gonna do it at 10 p.m. to midnight cause it's your hobby. And if you're doing something you don't love, you're not. It's not complicated. And so passion's a great way to go. The problem is you have to be good enough. Yeah. Exactly. That's the, that's the thing, that's the slippery slope though. Hey, Rai, as someone who's been like, you know, growing, especially with the podcast up and it's great to see from afar, when you read three fourths of the book so far, this is down to me being curious, what was the biggest like moment where you're like, oh shit, that's how it's being or aha, like did anything strike you? Yeah, I'm gonna give you a quote. It's because people tend to dismiss what's underpriced today, instead focus on what used to work in the past or what might work in the future. The process that continue to underestimate what's working right now. And that was my favorite quote from the book because it was, I feel like I'm progressive, you know? I mean, if you're the king of progression, I mean, I'm on the second tier and so I believe it. But then I start looking at the sacred cows that I have and I'm like, I need to fucking get over that shit. You know, I've been late to the game on TikTok, even though I know it's big and I know that it's underpriced. And so I'm guilty of it, but that quote alone. And that scenario, is it that, how many followers do you have on Instagram? 200,000, close to that. So is it something where you're like, you have this great number on Instagram where you're like 200,000? Like, are you worried from a brand perception standpoint that if you go to TikTok and you have 83, it makes you look smaller those first couple of weeks and months? No, I don't give a shit what people think. The reason I ask you that is, that's a huge one for people. They underestimate the upside for the short-term worry of brand. Is it because you did the cliche thing of like, oh, it's just teenage girls and then you just couldn't get out of that mindset? At first it was, and then I started posting and hit off, this was a couple of years ago, but then I became self-aware that I wasn't doing it right and I stopped and I said, I'm not gonna redo this until I get the team around me to do this right. And now I do. So we're about to go back at it. Fair enough. I think that's a much better answer than most. Yeah, but the reality is and why I circled that quote and why it stuck with me when I was reading is because I think that's what most brands and people are stuck in though, is the sacred cows. Or the future, or the future. I talked to somebody the other day that fits this perfectly. Stuck on SEO, right? And infatuated with AI and no conversation social. Yeah. Right? Like tried and true. I'm like, tried and true for, yes, SEO works, but it doesn't work the same way it worked in 2004. No. AI, yes, but like, you don't even know what you're talking about yet and your industry's not even affected by it yet. And like, meanwhile, all your action is on posting on LinkedIn properly and you haven't even posted on there once. Romantic about yesterday, infatuated with tomorrow, sucking at today. That is the state of the union of 99%. Yeah. And they get exactly what's the point you made. You know, TikTok can't generate leads like this. Instagram doesn't do LinkedIn like that. And they get to, it's all excuses. Like, let's be honest. Well, right. It's not only all excuses, I'm starting to jump in, but also what a lot of people don't understand is and you just broke it down. I want to, this is why I'm jumping in. I want everyone to hear this. You just talked about someone who's a salesman, not a marketer. Yeah. What most people don't know about themselves that are listening right now is they're sales people not branding and marketing. If you, like, like, what could, you know, when I was coming up the game, everyone's like, oh, Gary doesn't get it. He doesn't know how to do, he's not doing funnels. They didn't get it. I was playing chess. They were playing checkers. Like, they were looking for short-term arbitrage. I was playing long-term brand. If you're listening right now and you say, well, TikTok doesn't get leads, you're a salesman. Which is, by the way, I'm a salesman. I like that. But you know who sales people are? People that don't know how to do brand and marketing. Yep. They have to be left with sales. And then you know what the 98% of the rest of the world is? They can't do either, which is why they work for sales people or marketers. That's right. Everybody wants outcomes today, damn it. You know, and everybody's impatient. And look. You know who's getting outcomes today? Nike. You know how they did it? By building a brand. Exactly. You know who's getting outcomes today? This motherfucker right here who's been doing this show for six years and Gary Vee's now sitting in front of me. That's exactly right. But that didn't happen six days in or six months in or 16 months in. It's the game. By the way, people are like, oh Gary, I was like, oh Gary, nothing. Like I worked every day in a liquor store for 13 years to figure out how things marketed and branded. Like, and before that, I spent my childhood in marketing and selling. Like, I don't know what, I think Malcolm Gladwell's thing was 10,000 hours. Motherfucker, I don't know. I gotta run the map, but whatever, fuck it. I'm not one of my 48, whatever 42 years of trying to sell or make signs or build brand or sell, whatever 40, and I didn't do school like that. I gave it none of my time. Whatever 42 years subtracted by seven hours a day and sleeping on average, whatever that math is, that's how many hours I've put into this craft. That's what I'm saying. That's why I've always, I've agreed with everything that you say, but I've always respected the hell out of you because you live exactly, you preach and you're do, if you really watch what you're doing, Gary, you've always done what you're telling other people to do. That's the secret, guys. Couple things on that, brother. One, I appreciate your opening line. I want people to hear this. No one should agree with anyone on everything. It doesn't even make sense. We all have different life experiences. We end up figuring it, by the way, we also all change our minds. Many people have written to me that they didn't believe something and then they believed it. Or vice versa. That this is why I call my book, Day Trading Attention. Someone emailed me the other day and said, hey, I watch this video. I've been trying, it's not working. I replied to him like, bro, I did that in 2009. The videos from 2009. Shit's changed. And so, we shouldn't, I appreciate that. I really do, I'm scared to be wrong. So I talk about the things that I know or the things that I'm living and I stay in that pocket. The biggest compliment I ever get in social media is normally when someone's trying to troll me in the comments. They're like, Gary Vee, you say the same shit. And I reply, I'm like, thank you. I'm like, what do you want me to make up stuff I don't believe in just to say something different? Yeah, but that's the, but what you're doing is the epitome of what you're preaching, which is brand. And brand, you play your greatest hits over and over again. And you're literally, you know, because if you're not consistent, you can't build a brand. I just saw a fucking billboard rolling stones is going on tour. I'm these motherfuckers, but do the shit for 80 years. How do they even stay upright? It's unbelievable. I know I'm like when I go out with my friends like three weekends in a row, but to be touring is a rock star for 50 years. I don't know how the fuck they do it, but. I think it was, I think it was legal drugs. I think how they pulled it off. Yes, yes. I do, I will say this. So I'm a father of four boys. And I had like a couple of things. I had to get in on top of this. I was like eight to 14 and they're into trends, but they're not into social media. I don't really, they're not really allowed to do it per se. How do you balance that? Like what's the, but I know being in the business like you, it's good. It'd be fucking great for them, you know. It starts with knowing the kid, right? First of all, that's epic. Having four boys between that age. Honestly, that's pretty, you should just be filming that. That's pure entertainment. Those characters must be doing all sorts of crazy shit with each other. Oh dude, we're doing everything. I love it. Yeah, it's awesome. As you know, out of the four kids, I'm sure if I said to you, you have to, you have to, have two of the kids be on social media 12 hours a day. It's now law or you'll go to jail. You very quickly right now already know which two can handle it better than which two. Right, so, you know, I think the way parents have to think about this stuff is first of all, every parent needs to do what's right for them. That being said, I do think we need to be a little bit more thoughtful than just demonizing it. What is social media today is amateur hour to what they're gonna be dealing with in their 20s and 30s. The cell phone and social media today, when they're our age is gonna look like the beeper and the CD-ROM. It's mundane. When everyone's like, oh, you gotta get him out of the phone. Like, I got him out of the phone, they gotta see the real world. I'm like, motherfucker, when they're 40, they're gonna live in VR 24 hours a day. There is no real world. You know, it's an empty container. Like, the world's gonna change. And so, I think it's a balance, but I think the answer to the question is very simple, in my mind, friend, which is the sooner you can build actual self-esteem in the four of them versus fake self-esteem, the better they will be able to handle anything. When they finally do get to 16 or 15 or 19 or whatever the rules are in your house and they're allowed to be on social and they post their first thing and people say they're ugly, they're stupid, they're idiots. If they have actual self-esteem, they'll be able to deal with it. Yeah, that's the key. And we put them in, we make them do tough challenges. You know, like we don't shelter them. And that's, you know, they have to be on their own merit at times and see success from it. And so, but no, I appreciate that input. So, talking with Gary Vaynerchuk, author of Day Trading Attention, coming out the 19th, I believe, isn't that right, Gary? We're like, I think days away. 21st, 21st, yep. We're releasing this, I think, just before the episode. So go buy it. Thank you. Amazon, all the locations, we'll have all those links. Gary, I mean, it's obvious to me, you know, like why you wrote the book. It's the guidebook for attention marketing today, now. But, you know, how do you implement, how do you eat your own dog food? Like what's your process for staying? I mean, you got the team, I'm sure. But staying ahead of that attention curve. It's three things. It's team on team and me, meaning there's me and I live this. This is what I do for a living. There's my team of 30, 40 people, team Gary. We're constantly flowing in a WhatsApp thread. What's working? What's not working? The first three seconds of the video. Like, it's so cool to be on this show knowing there's not a single person listening right now that should not buy this book. That's insane to me. And I'll tell you why. Because if somebody's listening right now and they're a principal of a high school, if they're listening right now and they're a middle manager in a corporation. If they have a nonprofit, if they're a board member of their country club, no matter who you are on earth, knowing how to get people to hear you for whatever you care about. Raising money for a non-profit, selling t-shirts, getting people to use your auto body shop, buying your new tequila, like whatever, it's so cool. That's why I'm so excited about this book. I know everyone's gonna get value and that's why I textbooked it because everyone, most people can learn in that format. Ironically, I'm one of the few that can't. Anyway, how do I do it? It's what I do for a living. It's what I do for 12 hours a day. But I also, like to give people context, there's 50 people that work in a department at my company called the PAC department, platforms and culture. All they do for a living is pay attention to what the platforms are doing and how the algorithms are working and what the best way to get 50,000 views instead of four views, the best way to get a million views instead of 100,000 views on every platform. Snapchat spotlight, LinkedIn. I'm one of the few humans on earth that have over a million followers on all of the platforms. Pinterest, LinkedIn, Snapchat, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter. Like I believe in all of these platforms have way more attention than people think, way more. And I believe that being the best at it matters. And so how do I eat my own dog food? I like, here's how, I'm gonna show it to you. I know this is probably audio for most people, but like for example, literally this morning, 8.34 this morning, right? I wrote the copy personally for my post on Instagram. I'm in it, right? I'm in the gym. I'm in the gym. I'm the one, there's no steroids here. There's no osempic. There's no fucking taking a young person's blood and transfusing it into me. Oh, come on, you had a vampire facial last night. I know you did. I'm fucking in it. You know, I'm fucking in it. And I wanna be the best in the world at it. And then I'm very lucky. I also, well, lucky. I built a 2000 person global agency. It's one of the biggest, best social media and overall marketing agencies in the world. So I have data. My company spends billions of dollars, Ryan, on media, on social media and media. Billions. Do you know much information I'm seeing? And for everything, chicken wings and sodas and hoodies and airlines and all of it. So, you know, I'm in a very unique position of seeing a lot more than the person you see in your feed that's giving you like an Instagram hack that's looking like a professor. And I like those characters. I think they're doing, a lot of them are doing decent jobs. But mine is so omnie. I'm sitting with information that is like incredibly rare. There are, there are no, there are zero humans on earth. That have a 2000 person global agency, global. Latin America, APEC, Europe, and they themselves are one of the most established content creator personalities in the world. I am that person and I'm very humbled by that actually. And I'm so humbled by it. And I was so parented well that, and I'm such a weird character. Do you know what my team feels about this book? The fuck? My agency's mad at me. For giving it away. Yeah, they're like, what are you doing? And I'm like, guys, this doesn't, the information can't sit with us. It doesn't sit that long. It's day trading attention. It's gonna change. But I'm gonna give everybody the principles and I'm gonna tell them there's not one person that doesn't follow this, that won't get results similar to best practices in health and wellness. I promise everyone who's listening, if you cut down your carbs and sugar and you go to the gym and actually start doing, you know, strength work, your body and your physicality will be better two years later. I lived it. You've seen my videos 10 years ago. I've lived it. Yeah. Yeah. And I've got the emails from Brandon from Wine Library from 2009. I was going through all my, I did that Gary V search through. Like, I'm like, how long have I known Gary V? Like, look, I got Brandon's fucking email sending me a wine list from 2009, I think. So when you brought his name up, I was like, I totally know. Yes, yes. Day trading attention with Gary V. So you brought up to 2000 people. I asked my community. I was like, all right, what do you want to know from Gary? Repeat question. It was all about AI, right? Go figure. So what industries, including your own, because you got to think about it, you play 2000 people and marketing and advertising will be impacted, has been impacted. So what are the industries that, you know, are gonna be most impacted and how do you reflect on it as it relates to like your company? Advertising is gonna be one of the top. Yep. Like we're right at the forefront of this. We're the bookstores, we're the taxi cabs. Like if you're an Adobe designer, if you for a living design images on Adobe for an agency, you better wake the fuck up. Like you've got a few minutes here because we've got to figure out copyright and trademark law. Companies are gonna be the big companies that use agencies are gonna tread lightly, but I mean, this shit is coming brother. It's really coming. So I think a lot about it. This is why we spend so much time on strategy and thinking and not just being someone who makes something. I tell my team all the time, we get paid for our brains, then what we make. But I mean, to answer your question, everything, if think about the last 20 years, everyone who's so proud that they told their kids to become coders and developers and they've gone on to make good money. And now you can already see the early stages of like, wait a minute in five years, am I gonna be able to build an entire website by talking it out and then an AI will just write the code? Like it's, I mean brother, I'm even worried about the only thing I've always thought I had which was my brain. I believe that you can map everything that I've ever said and that eventually the machine learning and the technology will get so good that I believe at some point, everybody on earth can think the way I think, can literally get answers to how I'm critically, like what is Gary V thinking about this? Let's say a new thing came out, Shmaga. It's the hot new app. What is Gary, what would Gary V think about Shmaga? Enter? And that because of everything I've ever said and the machine learning and all the work that the answer would actually be the answer. Exactly. That's, if you aren't thinking about that, if you don't, if you haven't made that connection, you're fooling yourself. Like if you haven't thought that deep down this rabbit hole. It's why I've always said this, the ultimate is brand. Cause it's the only thing that's left after everything gets commoditized. Which allows you to pivot to whatever is left. Gary V's carrots, organically grown. Good for your health. Bye now. Toilet bowl, whatever. I mean, I thought about, you know, like blue collar stuff. Yeah. I mean, like to me, it's like, you know, for me, as long as I believe in it, when I did empathy wines, I believed in it. I believe that with V friends, I'm building the next Pokemon meets Sesame Street. With this book, when people buy this for 28 bucks or whatever it is on Amazon, I'm like, oh my God. Like, how do they not get $28 in value within the first second? They're gonna do one, they're gonna change. Everybody's gonna change the way they make every piece of content. The first piece of content, instead of normally getting 800 views, is gonna get 8,000 and those 7,200 impressions are worth more than 28 bucks. Like that's a great feeling. That's what, people are like, hey Gary, I'm scared of selling. I'm like, that's cause you don't believe in what you're selling. I'm scared of selling too, if I don't believe in it. One of the reasons I'm so weird and say different things that a lot of people is, I don't know what to do. If I don't even know how to sell something, I don't think is right. What do you do? Yeah, well, authenticity, you know, that proves that you are authentic, doesn't it? I think so. I think it really matters. Like I really don't understand, this is what my argument is with a lot of people on Madison Avenue and you were there, right? Yup. They sell shit they don't believe in. Do you really think if you're sitting right now at Omnicom and selling banner ads on the web that you as a human think that's a good idea? Like, if you're selling, like, do you really think the best deal in marketing is a billboard outside? Like, do those people really think that? Hell no. They know. They know. I think they know. They know. Let me ask, I do have this question. I'm gonna talk about a couple of pages, couple of these charts and shit. Okay, Brian, outcomes, attention. How do we, you know, I have friends that go, well, you can take your shirt off and run around and get attention all day. What is that attention? How do you turn intention into intent? How do you turn buzz into bite? Having a good product or service that people want. Asking, this is the follow up to Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. This book was originally called Jab, Jab, Jab, Left Hook instead of Day Trading Attention. To your buddy's points, like, if people are gonna look at you because you look, being attractive is a really interesting concept to me. Right, so like, I think about why people would stop in the feed, right? There's, and really why would somebody sit? There's humor. I think we can all agree that humor is like a great place, right? There's attractiveness. I don't think this is gonna confuse anyone. We tend to stop in our feed if we think someone looks good, right? There's, and there's what I think I've lived on, which is like value of information. And I think of those things in macro and micro. There's some people that are very good at perspective and mindset and blueprint. And then there's people that will go very tactical. I've played both in a lot of ways. So, when your buddies go, well, easy for you, Ry, to get attention. I'm like, look, if Ry is selling, if he's got his shirt off and they stop, but he's selling like B2B SaaS products and none of those people convert, then what do we achieve? And that's true. But, if people stopped, and this is why I think people don't mix their content enough. If someone stops and you're looking at all diesel and they're like, look at those fucking pecs, and then they click your account. And the prior post is you talking in detail about a B2B SaaS, I mean, just think about how wild this concept is. A B2B SaaS product for enterprise corporate. If three of the thousand people that stopped to look at either they wanna look like you or they're attracted to you, and then click that other one and be like, what is this? If three of those thousand are actually in that industry, one of those three may lead to a lead. So I think where people get hurt is they do content for the sake of getting attention, but never have the other part of it. And then they don't do the other part of it because their grid doesn't look good. Or it's not on brand, they don't get it. They're in the business of the academia of marketing or the insecurity of marketing. The reason most people don't put out content that will help them sell more stuff is they know it won't do as well. So they keep putting out photos of their abs or their ass. Right? Because they want a thousand likes or they want a million likes. Yeah, that what that dopamine hit. Yeah, exactly. It's all just high school. It is. I'm on page 72, literally a chart. Amplification, spending against what works, AKA not wasting a penny, teaching you how to literally make sure you double down on what you need to double down on what you're learning. It's kind of a learn cycle, in a way. It's like, okay, what are we learning and how do we double down on it? I'm simplifying. Yep, it's the orgy. I'll make it very common sense for everyone. I think you've been paying attention. Everyone was listening. Social media changed three years ago. It's now about the individual pieces of content, the tick-tockification of social. It's not like when I grew up in social where you try to get as many followers as possible and then a certain percentage of those followers see the content. Ryan's got 200,000 on Instagram. I have 10 million. Both of us can post right now, today, and he can get twice as many views on a video than I can if his video hits right, versus me putting out something that really does not hit right. That is insane. Once you know that that content hit right, the algorithm has mitigated the biggest risk in marketing, which is the creative. Once you mitigate the risk of creative, you can then decide if you wanna amplify it. More importantly or equally as important, you can also extract insights from it. Why did it do well? That's like when I spend all my time on Ryan. I'm obsessed with why. Why? Why, why? The most successful people are the curious people. Like, that's what it is. You gotta know why. Your body, your mind, your soul, your being won't let you not ask that question. Yeah, and especially towards the human. That was always what I, like, that's who I became. Like, I was just always curious, like, why? Even when I didn't know that bullying was based on kids that were unhappy at home, even in third grade, I was like, I naturally felt bad for the bully. I'm like, something's wrong. And I was scared of the bully, like everybody else. And the bully back then in the 80s in Jersey in third and fifth grade, they were big kids. The Williams brothers, they were big kids. I was scared of them, but I fucking knew in my heart. I'm like, nah, they're not beating the shit out of all of us for just kicks and giggles. There's something wrong. Why? Why? People are mad at their boss for being mean to them, even though the boss has always been decent-ish. And now they're like, oh, my boss is a dick now, or I hate him, I gotta get out of here, fuck him. And they don't realize the why is, well, a month ago, he found out that his spouse has terminal cancer and he hasn't told you yet. So why don't we give people the benefit of the doubt? In the story that I just told, why would you, if someone's been good to you for five years, or solid, or at least neutral, that at the first turn, that they were not as good as normal and they, like it wasn't good, why do you immediately go into I hate that person, I'm done. I'll tell you why, because you yourself are insecure. You're not in a good enough place to have the compassion to be like, wait a minute, Johnny's been decent. Now he's like really not riding me for this week in a nice way. People are selfish, they go into what they're feeling. To me, that logically is like something's wrong with Johnny. Empathy, I'm very bullish on it. And that same ability in human interaction helps you be a good salesman and marketer. The reason I put out good content is I have a good feel of what the world is looking for right now, that I feel that I can contribute to. There's a lot of things I know that would do well, but I don't think I can contribute to it. I don't know it as well, it doesn't come natural to me. I'd love to speak a lot more. Here's one, let me give you in detail. You're like this, Dusty, I haven't heard this from me. I would love to talk a lot more about grieving. I think it's a big subject matter. Yeah. I just have been fortunate and unfortunate that I can't speak to it, here's why. Fortunate because I'm 48 years old, that my mom's mom, my grandma, who I really knew, my great uncle Misha, who was a father figure to me. That's where I'm at. My great grandmother, but I was little. Like unfortunate because so many of my family members died before I was even born, both my grandfathers, one of my grandmothers. So I have a small family, Holocaust stuff like that. So I can't speak to it, brother. I have thoughts on it, but I just don't feel comfortable. I can observe from afar, but back to what we were saying earlier, I like to talk about stuff I've lived. But one day I will, one day, unfortunately I will, and I have a funny feeling. In 30 years I'll have content on it because I think it's a big one out there. Yep. It is. I mean, social media has made us more connected than ever, but yet disconnected from some real discussions. Well, that's because we're incredibly, emotionally vulnerable as a society. The last 35 years of parenting specifically has been incredibly bad at getting people to be comfortable with discomfort. I mean, eighth place, bro, I hope you're 14, you're eight to 14 year olds, don't have eighth place, I hope you melt, I hope you throw that shit in the garbage. Dude, you're singing from the playbook, man. As soon as they came home with the medallion, that thing went in the bottom of the trash can, like not, didn't do it in front of them, but like that's not hanging out, you know? There's a really positive way to throw it in the trash can. Like it doesn't have to be like cliche, like, oh, alpha dickhead dad, no, no, like really talk about it. Talk about the reason, kids are more grown up than people think. You sit down 11 year old and be like, listen, it's not that I don't want you to have this bullshit sixth place trophy or medal, it's that you have to understand losing is good. You guys came in sixth, you guys lost. That's good, you shouldn't be rewarded for that. In the game of a basketball tournament, like there's a positive way to talk about it. Anyway, I think we have a lot, the reason we're lonely is we're scared. We're scared of people's opinions, we're scared of losing in front of others, keeping up with the Joneses, blue check marks, followers, money, status, how attractive is your boyfriend, girlfriend, wife, husband, how much money do they make, all these vain fucking bullshit, bullshit shit. I'll say this, that's why you need to focus on what's real, what you can do that actually impacts what you're doing. That's what this is about. Like we get too caught up in shit, it's excuses, and you know this, we all know this. You get caught up in it, you don't know it, but once you really reflect, you know it's excuses because you're focused on things that you don't have control over, you know? Well, that's what they're trying to do to us, right? Like that's what the news is, that's what society is, that's what politicians, that's what parents are like, that's what schools do, like it's, you don't control shit in like most of your life. This is why I love, you know, it's so funny after my last rant, like none of that matters. Meanwhile, I'm trying to build an empire. I'm not demonizing success or winning, that's all I'm trying to do. I'm just trying to get people to be healthy about it so once they get there, they can stay there. Bro, I'm sure even at, you know, I'm sure at this point in your life, you've seen in front of your eyes circles or closed circles, people get real paper and real money and then three, four years later, it's all gone. 100%. And a lot of times in that story, the family's gone, the reputation's gone, it's not a good life, they got to success in the wrong way. Yep. And it's, because it wasn't success, it was fake success, it was proxy success. Exactly. But. That's why we gotta be day trading attention. We don't want proxy success. We need all success. I'm telling you right now, it is crazy. I can't believe, I'll leave it with this for all of you. I can't believe none of you, most of you, the majority of you are not fucking taking this shit more serious. Social media's free. Ryan, it's fucking free. Brother, it's fucking free. They don't charge you when you post. Do you know what a newspaper ad costs? A lot. Do you know what a billboard costs? A lot. Do you reckon mail costs? A lot. Television commercial? A lot. Sponsorship event event? A lot. Google ad words? A lot. Pre-roll YouTube? A lot. Hulu interstitial ads? A lot. Influencers to plug your product? A lot. Like, I don't understand what the fuck people are doing. Organic social media's the most important thing in the world. Figure it the fuck out. Stop crying. Stop bullshitting. This is fucking it. Bingo. Free. Free. I almost called this book, it's fucking free. Ha ha ha. Double F, fucking free. And you got the guidebook to do it. Day training, attention. All of it there. Gary, a question. What's your own versus rented land? Do you leverage the free to get them to the owned, you know, the website list? Yeah, yeah. Of course. By the way, I think I talk about, I know I talk about in the book, please have your default URL proper on your social. Hell yeah, of course. Attention is always being said to the owned. Right? Yes. When you, we know, like, I don't know, I'm on this right now getting attention. And if it's, and if people like what I'm saying, they're gonna buy a $20 book. That's yours. Right. In this scenario, I'm obviously sharing that with Amazon and my publisher, but at least my publisher had to pay me a big bag to be a partner in it. But yeah, brother, of course. Because you built brand over time and you had levers to do that. Correct. And of course, like you want your podcast linked up there or something else, like, and I change my links depending on what I want people to know about. And so of course you're sending them to other places, but you're extracting, everyone's like, the algorithms are fucking me. I'm like, no, no, you should be fucking them. It's free. Extract the attention from it. That's why they're so powerful. Everyone cries about social, but it's their most important thing. Because the attention's there. Yeah, that's why. Look, what, it's a six hours a day for what, 18 to 24 year olds on fucking TikTok? Forget about 18 and 24 year olds. All of us older fuckers are on it all day. The fucker 40 year olds doing. Everyone's on it. Everyone's on it all day. If I'm not working, all day. Most people watch television with social as the companion. Definitely Twitter, definitely in sports and politics. Your phone is the TV and your TV's the radio. That's what I've been saying. That's right. That's right. Gary, I know people know where to find you, but I want to be respectful of your time. We come up to it here. Always, again, respect the hell out of your directness. How you, I don't know, man, it's always been relatable. Again, no matter what you think or what you see, you've lived it, you've done it. And I led the witness a little bit with how you're eating your dog food. Because I wanted him to hear that, Gary isn't writing this book. He's just giving you the roadmap of what he's already fucking doing every day. And he's living it. I just, I want this for everyone because I think it's gonna go away. My belief is the, look, there might be another invention, but I do believe that in the next 15 to 20 years, we're gonna be in VR heavy. And when we're in VR heavy, social's dead. And I don't know if Apple and Facebook or Amazon or Google or whoever wins VR, if they're not in the mood to give you free awareness, then guess what? People are gonna be talking about how there's golden era of free awareness and we all fucked up and didn't go hard enough. You know, people have regrets of like, oh, wish in college, I went to more parties because now I can't or like, oh, I wish I spent more time with my dad because he just passed and now I can't. Like, I believe marketers and businesses are gonna regret the living shit out of the social media free distribution era. And that's why while we're still in it, I'm yelling at the top of the mountains like, please go get your attention. So that you can then pivot and do whatever you need to do when the tide turns. And that's the biggest, that's the takeaway. That's the big aha, right? It's like, yeah, it's about, you need some more today, of course you do, but you need leverage over time. That's right, you get to take your brand to the next platform. Whatever it is. I mean, I did it. I just did that. My digital platforms. Wine Library TV on fucking YouTube. That's right, and on Vidler, on Vidler and on Ustream for live and Mircat, I got attention in. And Vine, I got attention in. And Social Cam, I got attention in. And Photo Booth, I got attention in. And Myspace, I got attention in. And, you know, it just ebbs and flows. Let's grab dinner in New York sometime. Looking forward to it. Thank you brother, thanks for having me.
