## Transcript
Fear is afraid of you too. Interesting, break that down. And like fear has so much control, but it's the same feeling as happiness. Like nobody runs from happiness. Fear is deathly afraid of the day where you turn around and be like, I'm not fucking afraid of you. It's funny you say that. And then it loses all power. Here's fake. Fear hangs out with fucking Santa Claus. Attention is the number one asset. VaynerNation, how are you? Welcome to another episode of Podcasts with Friends. This episode is actually podcasts with former friends because Joe is literally fucking 30, 26 minutes late. The whole show. Give it a take. I have a hard stop at 11.30, so I wanna apologize for you two youngsters. Joe has ruined your exposure. I was a fan of the show and you know. Joe, what happened? The Long Island Expressway. And don't pretend like you don't know. There was an accident. I will say there was. I was 10 minutes from my house, 37 miles away. I mean, come on, I did what I could. Listen, you grew up in this area your whole life. I did. You should have been here nine in the morning. You're right. You're right. Let's go on the show. Ladies first, let's introduce ourselves to the VaynerNation. The concept of the show is incredibly simple. There are individuals in the world that, me and my team spent an ungodly amount of time watching human beings move in society. Tyler Walsh, a boyd music. Tyler Schmidt and Zack in overall culture. I play a lot of role in it. And we just kind of decided, I wanted to do new content this year in 2024. And the thing that most excited me was getting people to introduce each other and get to know each other that may not know each other or admire each other from afar. But more importantly, A, get my audience to meet different voices, different people to follow their journeys on. Everyone's in different parts of their journey. And executionally wise, I really wanted to finally start screaming. It's something I've been watching for a decade and I've just never found my way in because I'm so busy. That's why vlogging worked. DRock could follow me in my day to day. But this whole concept of now twitching, especially in my office, we tried it last week, where like after the show, I was on mute and just screaming in the back. And people loved it. I muted a couple of times and I loved it. And so huge shout out to the Twitch Army, all of you that are tuned in right now. Vary Gainer-Chuck, that's a great name, big name for me in high school. I'll never forget the day my friends figured out if they reversed my two letters that they could really have some fun with me. So I see Vary Gainer-Chuck's in the building. First time chat for Jayboy, for Clay Ferno. Let me know how you got here. I just tweeted it, I just sent it to my text. Or you're an OG, I want all 300 of you to right now reply OG, text, or Twitter. Let me know how you got here. But purpose of the show is for the audience to get to know you and for us to talk about shit that's popping in society. We're sitting on our chests or our minds. We will start ladies first. Why don't you tell the Vayner Nation who you are, what you do. Yes, how far do you want me to go though? You can, it is your space. Okay, so my name is Dina Ayada. I'm 19 years old. I'm a rock and I was born and raised in Belgium. And I've always been into music. I'm an artist, so I was an artist since a little kid. Like my mom and my dad knew, but it didn't really take me serious. So I participated with The Voice Kids in Belgium when I was 15, super young, still in school. And then that whole experience made me realize that maybe being an artist is what I wanna do when I grow up. So after that, my brother, he used to make beats. So then we sat together and we decided to just make songs together, have fun. And then I was 16, I met my producer, Chucky, and my manager, Drow. We recorded a vlog on Chucky's channel, 16 year old girl freestyling on my beat. And then I had like one million views in a couple of weeks. Yeah, a couple of months. So I was like, wow. I really wanna- It started to happen. Yeah, I saw like- What happened on The Voice? Did you do well on the show? Yeah, it was very nice. I got to the half, to the semifinals, yeah. So you got a lot of exposure from that? Yes, a lot. It was nice being on stage. My first time being on stage, I was very nervous, very young, but it taught me a lot. What a stage to be on for your first one. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So then after that YouTube video popped off, what happened next? After that, I was like, well, I wanna sit down on my producer and manager, we're a team, so I wanna find my own sound, something that sounds like Dina Ayada and other artists. So it took us like three years. We was locked in. Yeah, and we really took it serious. So, and then I decided to post a TikTok in December on my birthday. And it was a TikTok of me freestyling on a random beat, because I don't listen to beats before I hop on a beat. Oh, interesting. Yeah, so. I can never do that. Mm-hmm. So then. I really resonate with that. If I had any musical talent, that would be more my style. I'm so much more improv in nature. Like it just comes so natural to me. Yes. As a human, it's how my speaking, like I literally sometimes don't even know who I'm speaking to. Right. In like 4,000 people events, until I get to the location and meet the organizer, I'm like, okay, tell me about the audience. Like I don't, I'm more comfortable. Yeah, but if I throw a beat on right now, you're telling me. No, I have no musical talent. If I had musical talent, I'd be the biggest rapper in the world. I believe that. Not really that. I'm being dead serious. I believe that. I have so much real shit to say. All right. Oh, absolutely. I just have no fucking musical. You're having a rapper name. Like real talk. Everyone's always really nice. And Gary, you can do it. I'm like, yeah, Barry Gaynor, Barry Gaynor, so I can do it. And so, and so where we at at the journey now? So I was 17 at that moment. No, I was turning 17 on my birthday. And I posted a TikTok, didn't overthink it. I was like, man, just let it flow. So then it took me a couple of days. And in the meantime, so I was telling my manager, bro, I want to go to LA. Let's go to LA. I know I'm in school, but we can go after my exams. So, so basically I had, I was in law school at the beginning of the year. And then we booked our flights, booked everything. We was ready. And then after we booked our flights and everything, my TikTok starts going crazy. It blew up and I was like, maybe this is God's plan. So after my exams, we went to LA and we was supposed to stay there for a one month, but we extended the trip. So we stayed two months. And a lot of producers, labels, artists, they start reaching out to me. So we was really just working over there, like locked in. And I knew like maybe when I go back to Belgium, I might want to drop out of law school. Because this music might be for me. And when I got back to Belgium, I was talking to my parents. I was like, yeah, I think this might be the right move for me to make right now. Like I believe in it. So I dropped out and I did it online. I remember my manager calling me five minutes later. It was like, Dina, somebody's flying us out to New York next week. I was like, this is God's plan. Yeah, yeah. Amen. So it's been an amazing journey. After that, I just continued posting on TikToks. Everything blew up. A lot of people reaching out. And then in the beginning, I told every label, I want to do a support act at the end of the year. And I just got off tour with TJ. That's amazing. Support act. That's awesome. So proud of you. Thank you. Joe. That's me. I'm a freestyle rapper. My name is Joe. I kick the funky floor. Rock dance from here to Idaho. Hey, I'm former and practical Joker comedian, started with improv when I was 19. Ran that to the ground. Got some improv experience here in New York. Moved to LA, chased a dream to be a filmmaker. Ended up working at Nordstrom, selling men's pants. Moved back here in New York with the boys. So real quick, just real quick, just for the kids, your big plan to become this movie mogul. Yeah. Go to LA. Yep. Pick it up, pack it up, go. The chapter in the book on that was, you ended up just working at Nordstrom selling pants. Yep, selling pants. Right. You're good at selling pants? I was fantastic. I was a salesman. I was selling pants to all the celebrities. I worked at the Grove in LA, which is all a hotspot. What makes you do pair of pants? I worked at the rail, which was the menswear section. And this is what Von Dutch was big. You'll remember that. And so I was rocking it out there and helping celebs and stuff. And that was my claim to fame. And then I just, I loved sales. I was always a salesman. Came back to New York and I was doing comedy on the side till we got the, me and the guys got together to figure out what our TV show was. We tried a couple that failed. We miserably found jokers and made that, found that concept and did that for a decade. Then life gave me a couple options of different ways to go and decided to focus on family and figure it all out. And now I've been doing stand up on my own and been doing touring that for two years, writing movies, actually working on something, getting something started there, which is great. And kind of been performing some big rooms, which is great. I'm playing the beacon here in New York, which is the one I haven't done. So yeah, the beacon in January, which I'm saying January 20th. Can people get tickets? Yeah, they can. How did they find it? JoeGaddoOfficial.com, no matter where you live, I'm on tour. But yeah, the January 20th is at the beacon, which is the one I haven't done. My official. Because the other one was taken? The real? Yeah, the real. It kind of goes always the real. That's like the rule, right? Like it's your name, if you can get it. If you can't get your name, you get the real. And if you can't get that, you go with the official. Yeah, I even had to do underscore Gadow for all my handles. I'm an underscore Gadow. Yeah, you're an underscore Gadow. I really feel like if you're an underscore person, like shit's just not going. You know you could probably find, it's just a common name. I mean, you guys don't have a common name. But I fucked it up. JoeGaddo in New York. I fucked it up. I had a two silent ease to it. I'm supposed to be this branding expert. I like completely fucked it up. Anyway, how are you enjoying stand up right now? I love it. I love it. Is that your favorite place to be? To entertain is, to make people laugh. And now you can get in front of people and do it that way. But I enjoy riding. I enjoy all of it. I've always enjoyed all of it. I've been doing a bunch of different avenues now that the time is like, I've had the time now. Wrote a kids book, which is coming out next year, which I was saying. But there's 800 people now on Twitch. Oh. Which is a real number. There you go. And I feel like you shouldn't say something to them. All right, everyone watching on Twitch, we just wanted to get you all together and say, you know, be kind to each other. Oh. Amen. Be kind to each other. Come on, that's it. That's it, man. That's it, man. You gotta be kind because life sucks, suck harder, friends. Get out there and do what you gotta do. Right. Keep smiling and spread some joy. I love that. My brother. So my name is Nick Kassana. I go, I'm on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Nicky Cast. The official Nicky Cast. The official Nicky Cast. He's the real underscore at the end. With an underscore at the end. But yeah, I started. No, really? What is your handle? Nicky Cast, nicky.cass. So I started. Oh, he's the doctor. Yeah, he's the doctor. No, but wait. So funny story. So that's the same handle that I had in high school. So like, what I was, my whole thing was like, I was a big sports guy. I played baseball my whole life. And I didn't really think that this was ever in the cards. And then one day I was training clients in a gym. I thought I was going to open up a gym and do this whole thing. I was training clients out of my garage. I always had like the entrepreneurial spirit. Anytime I wanted to like make some money, my dad would tell me to go wash the cars or like I'd sell stuff on eBay. So grew up like that. But my brother, I was always the class clown. So like every sports team I was on, I was always like bound to make you laugh. And it just always felt so good, but it came natural. So I was never like, oh, this is. Yeah, even the way you talk is like funny. This is talent. You know what's funny? So I was, so I was. You did do Nick's fun. No, but okay. I believe that. No, yeah, for reals. Cause I would, I used to play on this travel baseball team. And I was the only kid from New York. And every time I opened my mouth, people started laughing. I love it. I'm like, I didn't even fucking say anything. Yeah, yeah. Like, but they were all from the side. I'd say like, all right, here we go. Kid, they go, all right, here we go. Yeah. So it was the whole thing. I never, like I said, it just kind of came natural. So posted on TikTok, the first video blew up and. The first one. The first one got two million views. Yeah, two million views. Your first TikTok. My first TikTok got two million views. So I was working in a gym. What year was this? This was 2020. Yeah. I was trying to tell you. It was right before the pandemic. I was trying, boy, you know this. I was definitely, you know this. I was trying to tell everybody. But see, like, Gary. I got on because of you. I didn't have, like it wasn't part of, like my buddies were just like, cause I would send the shit to my buddies. And they were like, post it. And I'm like, I'm just gonna open up the gym. By the way, on that, cause I just want to get value to the audience. Yeah. By the way, eight oh seven, all of you, share the shit out of this link right now. And this is where I'm going. Don't share it on social. Share this link right now to that thread. We all have that thread. We all have that WhatsApp or iMessage group text. We're like, to your point, everyone's their best version in their best friend's text group. 100%. I've got a Jets one and a Knicks one. And a college one. And a, like, a sports card one. And like, we all have them. And I feel like for a lot, the reason I'm jumping in right now, I apologize, I think I'm jumping in, is I believe that there's 25 people listening right now. For sure. That are in a thread where their buddies are saying, you should do fantasy football full time. For sure. You're the smartest and best one to go through. For sure. But they're like, nah, I'm not Matthew Berry, or you're funny, which is obviously very common, cause humor is this foundation of group chats. But like, humor or knowledge. Yep. I'm telling you, for the 25 out of the million that listen to this podcast over the next three years, in the long tail of consumption, please use this as a sign, God's plan, back to your point, as like, you know what, fuck it, my friends have been telling me for two years, I've secretly been thinking about it for two months. Right, for sure. Use this moment, this dude's first TikTok. The first one. Wow. The first fucking one. And to be honest with you, to that point too, like if I, if I didn't put myself out there. Did you send the link to a bunch of your friends? I was fucking posted. It was eight minutes, I'll never forget. It was a Wednesday night, 7.52 PM, I'm working in the gym in my college, right? So I got six clients, then I'm training, I worked in the athlete gym downstairs at the school that I was at. I was like, you know what, like no one's coming in, fuck, I'm just gonna make a video. So I made this quick 15 second video, posted it, didn't think anything of it, the next morning I woke up and it was just going ballistic. But then I deleted the app. You didn't have alerts on so you didn't know? Nothing, Gary, I woke up in the morning. What? And I'm going to do my routine in the morning and my phone is like. What is your routine in the morning? I mean. Be very personal. Okay, so I wake up. The first thing I do, I take my pills, I take a heart med, not a heart, I take a multivitamin, I take a probiotic. You confused a heart medication and a multivitamin. Yeah, no, I didn't. I didn't, there's no going back. But, well, because my buddy takes a heart medication and we were on the topic, but yeah, anyway, bottom line, I did not put myself out there. I wouldn't have realized that I did have a gift, that I did have talent and that I actually love the sport of business. So the onset of like, just put yourself out there. Like I was always kind of good with me no matter what. So like, if it just didn't work out, I'm like, I don't care. You had self-esteem. You're correct. And so. It fucking matters. For sure. Honestly, 20 years into this journey, 15, and especially five to seven on the shit I'm talking about. Yeah. This is a binary, I can already feel at 48 that my 65 year old content is going to be super weird because all I'm gonna wanna say is, it is self-esteem versus insecurity. For sure. I don't wanna talk to you fucking people about anything else. Right. Like if you were insecure, someone made you insecure, go to get therapy, meditation, change a routine, cut your friends out that make you feel that way. Like enough fucking enough. So many healthy ways. Stop, like all you fucking people out there that are just willing to lean into cynicism and negativity and darkness, I promise you, it's just a pure reflection of what's in your heart. Like this is a binary game. You were good. And this is why I'm jumping in again. Everyone who feels that they're good, that's listening, should only live putting themselves out there. 100%. 24 seven, because nothing bad can happen. 100%. Because you're good. 100%. There's no fear of what are people gonna say if it doesn't do well. And like my friends would say, like I remember I went to lunch with this, with one of the, I'm not really friends with anymore, but he was like, you just don't ever feel like weird like putting stuff out on it. I'm like, no man. That's him feeling, like he couldn't do that. He would worry about what the girl that he thinks is cute thinks. He would worry about what his mom thinks. He would worry about what you would think about him. For sure. Like everything good in my life is based on the fact that I deeply care about people, but not their subjective opinions about me. I deeply care about people, even strangers or acquaintances that are becoming, strangers become acquaintances, acquaintances become friends. Be friends. There it is. And most of all, back to Mike Boyd and Dustin's on his journey, and you'll get there over time and then friends become fucking family. Amen. It's nobody's business. It's not your business what other people think of you. And that's something that's always stuck in my head. It's just not your business. I just really wanna have this combo while we're on it. Like please explain to me what somebody saying your shit actually means. It means actually nothing. Right. Like actually. It literally means absolutely nothing. Like absolutely nothing. Well, I will say this though. Don't you think like, I mean, we all have confidence, right? So if you are in the, because I feel like sometimes there is that fine line, not caring what people think versus caring what people think who care about you. And I think you have to look about where a place that comes from. Because I've been in different places too. There's a fine line of not being delusional. I'm not sitting here saying, I hate when people say, like I'm trying to be a little bit better about like other people's opinions don't matter. Actually, they do matter. Like I use people's feedback, confidence or strangers. By the way, for me, Neil Cut Comp and Salsa Chick Linda. Like their opinion does matter to me. Like do they think I'm too abrasive? Do they think I'm awesome? Do they think like it, I use it as feedback, but I can't internalize it. For sure. As the thing that gives me validation for my life. By the way, the key for me is not accepting the accolades. The reason I think I do well with negativity is cause I don't believe when people call me great. I'm just in the middle. I think one of the things, cause in the world of what we do, like everybody's a critic and what I've come to realize. And like even though like if you're securing yourself, like I would say like, if everyone at this table is pretty secure in themselves, but there are times where you do question like on the journey up. Like I'm sure when you were coming up and when you were doing your thing, I've developed this analogy called the dinner table. And so I get six chairs at my dinner table. I pick six people. When people come to me and they either say, like you should do this, you should do that. I don't like this, I don't like that. I think to myself, are you sitting at my dinner table? If you're not, I'll take what you say. But again, I'm not gonna internalize it. So for me, that's been super valuable in the whole cause when you're out there every day, like people are getting perceptions of you and like who you are. And if you try and live up to that expectation of what you think it is, you're not being you. I also think it starts at home of how, like for me, one of the reasons I also don't struggle that much with judgment is I don't judge. I've been paying attention to a lot of people that are struggling with it. I'm like, oh right. You're in the business, you spend all day going through the feed and judging people too. You're judging people, which is why you're vulnerable to judgment. I don't know these people. I don't even know Dustin and Boyd like that. These are guys I really know. But I don't really know. I know some nuances, but I haven't been in their home 30, 50, 100 times. It's not like I've had like, I'm not having a monthly dinner for two hours with them. Like so like, if I don't know fucking people that are in my inner circle, I definitely don't know anybody. Like I don't think anybody really knows anybody besides themselves, even your parents and your siblings. I think when I'm about to say, we'll hit for all of us, you know that not a person on earth knows absolutely everything. Every one of us right now has some shit that we know about ourselves, that we know not one person on earth. There is not one person on earth that fully knows you besides yourself. And so people are just sitting out here judging people 24 seven because it's become a fucking national pastime, which is why they're fucking susceptible to judgment. I'm on some, here's my judgment back to the joke you made. And I know that we connect on this because I see you see me and I'm very grateful for it. Here's my judgment. I just hope you're good. Like I struggle seeing anyone in my feed. You should see me at the airport. Like I just wanna talk to everyone. I love people. I hope you're good. Life is amazing and at times hard. I cheer for people to the format of this show. What do I want on this show? That these 800 people and these 80,000 people that listen this week, start liking you more, start listening to music, watch your videos, go to your show. Like if you're not leaving positive deposits, what the fuck are you doing? Right. Do you think though that's because of the things that you pull value to like as a human being? Like the things that you find valuable maybe like- You know like the New York Jets? Yeah, like the Jets. Not buying them, I mean like watching them. Yeah, like the New York Jets. Well, I mean, you only fucking know what to buy. I find value in one place, kindness. Right. I find value in like the warmth of knowing that if I'm struggling for a period of time that if I can call Brandon Warnickie or my mom, I'll be good in a second. Cause those are go-to people for me where I know if I call, it's gonna be a smile. And I'm that for the world. Yeah, my mother used to say all the time, watch how people treat old people and animals. And that's all you know how their heart is. Well, that's- Like my whole thing, she was like- How strong is she at times? She was a town, yeah. Is your mom still alive? No, she passed. Yeah. Yeah, I feel the same way. Well, yeah, you feel more than I do. I actually have a weird relationship with animals. I actually resent- That's a clip. I have a real statement here. It's a very, my team always tells me not to bring this up. They're always scared that it's gonna be clipped out of context. I resent the way humans blindly treat animals and not each other. It pisses me off. I don't know what else to say. I wish the world treated each other the way that- Google Jamboard. What the fuck is that? This Google fucking screen. I think you had double fingers or something. The fuck is the thing on the screen? I thought it was broken. I'm just kidding. Let me finish this thought. It's incredibly important. We are, you see a dog, you're just like pure love. Yeah. We see humans and most people have fear when they see a stranger. I feel like I'm very scared of animals. Me too. But- Wow. Fuck those animals. No, no, no, no, no. But I think it's important to really have that bond with animals too. The same way you have a bond with people, like you should treat everybody the same way. But people are comfortable with animals because they can't talk back. Yeah, exactly. Oh, they don't feel like they're judging them. That's right. Humans are petrified of other humans. They deep, like let's play it, let's go around the horn. What's your general vibe when you meet strangers or new people? Like how does it usually play out? Cautious, you know, trust is earned. Like how do you kind of roll when you meet people? I'm very- Real talk, like real vulnerable, real talk. Like from all three of you, I fucking mean it because I want value out of this show. Like for y'all, but also for the audience, what is your default when you meet people? Honestly, I feel like I don't trust very easily. I always, when I meet people, I always have good energy. Like I smile and I make sure that they, like my first impression is always very important, but I can't trust you right away. Like I gotta know you. I gotta talk to you, communicate with you. To know what type of person you are. And from there on, like we gotta build up our relationship, but I think it's very important to also not think negatively about other people right away and don't judge. Right, so it's not that you feel negative, but it's a neutral with a caution because you wanna make, because trust is important. Exactly, trust is important. Joe, how do you roll? I think it depends on my mind space. Okay, so whatever mood you're in reflects directly. Makes sense, by the way, that's everyone. Directly, like if I'm, and also like if I'm with my family, like I'm super protective of like my kids, because everybody always like, strangers taking pictures of my kids is weird. Like everybody always wants a picture as you know it is. And I always get super like I go into dad mode and sometimes I just have to explain, I'm being a father right now, not to, you know, I'm not famous, so I'm with my kid right now, that kind of thing, so they do that. Most do, some don't, but most do. And then again, that's not my problem, that's theirs. Like that's what I'm doing. I have to worry about my kid, my daughter, my son. And you know this, like I'm going through it now, like what you never think about is like most, I've come to learn most kids that have someone who's a parent of notoriety hate it. Hate, they don't think it's cool. They think it blows. Yeah, yeah. They don't want people to like them because of you. They don't want people taking the time away from them and you in the limited time you have. Yeah. For the most part, I'm there to make it like, I truly believe I live to make people laugh. I'm here to make people smile. So for the most part, I'm there unless I'm running for a plane late, but overall I think that, and I think people get that from me too. But I'm just in a weird place because people, I've been on TV 10 years, they've seen me. I was a plane of character, so they feel like they know me. Right, exactly. It's like, I come in a different way, but that I think really depends on where I'm at. Yeah, I think I try to control the other controlables. So like for me, I'm not concerned about the person's reaction. I just know that I can control my own energy and I'm huge on energy. So like, I'll put as much good as I can out there. Even on days, and I used to say all the time, like during the pandemic, like discipline is a thing that you do with like if you're trying to accomplish something, but I also think discipline is a thing that you do when you treat people. So like, even if I'm not feeling 100%, I try and give, even if I gotta like force it out of it, I give it out because I do feel like the universe is gonna reciprocate that energy back. Like my godmother always used to say, be the energy that you wish to attract. So I just try and be consistent with that. And if somebody's not feeling it, I fucking love you for this. Like on real talk, and honestly, you know what's so funny? I used to be on the track of like fuck them, but I didn't mean it. Right. You know where I'm at, it's not fuck them. It's actually, I'm in full, I feel bad for you. Bad, yes. My compassion, the compassion of catfish is you're actually, let's open these packs. We're doing the V-Friends part now. Try it. Ooh. Nice to see that. Oh, I'm excited right now. Hold on, excuse me, just traded packs. I wanna see you got some. I got them real quick too. I want to get it. I caught them off guard. I like that. Okay, all right. All right, what I want you to do is go through these V-Friends, look at all your cards, and decide which character you most associate with. You're getting glasses. You ready for this? Here it goes. That's on. By the way, I'm going through it too, brother. I'm like getting close, I'm gonna have to do, oh, I got my favorite. I got literally, I got my favorite underrated character. Here's some alpha for V-Friends. I'm getting serious about developing this character. I just got, I got a good one. You gotta get a polished poodle. Ooh, you pulled a good one. She pulled a shiny. Oh, that's a rare one. It's a rare one. No, no, look at the names. We're picking one. The shiny one. Pick one character that most represents you. But you know what's funny? Back to Compassionate Catfish being here, I was never fuck them. I was always like first and youth. I was like, they don't matter. Like no peer pressure, didn't feel it. Now in my older age, when someone's coming with the wrong energy to me, especially I'm like you, I come out the gate like fucking fire. I was a prostitute. 100%. And love, I'm always trying to make people feel comfortable. Cause I'm so comfortable and I know most people aren't comfortable. So I'm trying to make the whole scene comfortable. If someone's really not about that towards me, I go into like, my God, I just came in here and love bombed the fuck out of this room. Went humble. Especially now that I have notoriety. Now my, I did this when I was 19 and no one on earth knew who the fuck I was and it would work as a good thing for people. Now you carry some reputation so it's even double works. Everyone's like, oh okay cool. So now if I see darkness to that, I'm like that person is in a deep bad place. And I need to double down and try to get them out. I go like, why? Like what has gotten you to this point? I usually think it's like real fucked up shit. Like maybe, you know, like I didn't, by the way, just like talking about real life back to gratitude everybody. Big shout out to everybody here. Western Jack, what's good. Goods since 82, first time chat. Let's clap it up for Goods since 82. All right, all right. My intuitions, my intuitions they were born in 82 so I find that awesome. But podcast Twitch, who's watching live, if you're listening to the podcast, go to GaryVee.com slash Twitch, subscribe up. Make sure you catch us live in the future. My big thing now though is like, look, like for example, real talk. I had a six to seven PM meeting today with a journalist. Literally, yeah, because Joe was, I don't know if you guys know this. Twitch, I don't know if you know this podcast. We're listening. Joe was so inappropriately late, right? I made this episode much shorter. If you're watching right now and you're like, wait a minute, most of our 60 minutes, why is this the only 35? That's Joe. It's all Joe's fault. But because of Joe being so wildly late. We had a great conversation. We did, but I got to see this text from my admins. This meeting is canceled tonight because she's on a plane right this second to Chicago because her mom had a heart attack. Like I don't think people understand how life actually works. We're worried about all this dumb shit and real life shit. Real life shit is happening. Since we've done this podcast, ungodly amounts of tragic things have happened in the world. And I don't see that as dark. I see that as my God, I'm so grateful that that hasn't happened to my inner circle yet. Yet. That nobody lives to 100 without heartbreak. Yes, for sure. You know what I mean? That's what comes out of our scape. That's a thing too though. Like if you're in the landscape that we're on, you're putting out. So people are just seeing the product. But like day to day, I mean, it's, I mean, I don't know how it is for everyone, but I'm by myself, creating ideas, wearing all these different hats. I mean, I got the team now that helped me out, I'm so grateful for it. But like, we're human beings at the end of the day too. So there's- Flag them down. Just said Joe for president 2024. I'm sorry to interrupt your brother. Joe, are you willing to announce your presidential run right here on podcast with friends? Sure. How many votes do you think you're gonna get? Seven. Team? President company not included. I got two in this room. I don't know, I'm so working on you. I'm not working for you. Are you one of your fucking mind? You sure I've late to the campaign. Let's go. Which character out of the V friends you pulled most spoke to you? I love this. I got tough to beat a worm from the dirt. There is a worm in V friends, whose name is tough to beat a worm from the dirt. Why did that connect with you? I wanted to ask you, can you explain- I can't, but why did it associate, on your first reaction, what hit you? You like worms or? I did. I thought it was worms. Not a lot of worms. You like worms. I'm flowers, yeah. Oh, the flower, yeah. I like worms and worms. I'll explain this really simple. This is one of truly one of- There's 283 characters. This is, oh, sorry. This is literally, literally genuinely one of my favorite characters. See if I get the light here. There you go, boom. So let me tell you why I love this character. I feel like this is me, and I feel like it's all the people I fuck with. I believe that if you're lucky enough to be born into humble environments, and you have love around you, you become undefeated. That I think there's incredible vulnerability with privilege at youth. And it leads to a lot of the things I think about, which is insecurity and confidence. When you come from the dirt, you don't, you know what life feels like when you don't have stuff and fame and money and fancy things. And even the toughest upbringings have many days of happiness in that dirt. And I think it gives you a better perspective of life. I just think that that worm, it's kind of like, I mean, I'm gonna go actually even deeper. This is an alpha story. Growing up, I used to play with worms a lot. We were 80s kids. This is just what we did in New Jersey. And then I just liked the dirt, and then I thought about dirt and worm. And I think a lot of kids, there's 10, 15, 19, 16, seven, nine, 10, 13, and even 20, 30, 40 year olds right now who don't give themselves enough credit for their resilience. So sure. And resilience is required. Yeah, 100% and anything. And anything, sure. Resilience is required. So the fucking worm is one of my favorite characters. I'm a big fan, I'm glad you picked that. Joey. I went with polished poodle. Please tell me why you associate. When I look at you, probably the last thing I think about is polish. Yeah, but the first thing you think about is poodle. Yeah. I'm a dog guy. I mean, I have a nonprofit around dogs, old dogs. So gato pups and friends, shout out to the my poops. Hold on, let's do that again, not as fast. Shout out to URL so people can go in maybe. Yeah, gato pups and friends is our nonprofit. We launched last year. Yeah, that's a dot com. That's not an official. Let's see gato pups and friends.com or on Instagram at gato pups and friends. It's our nonprofit. We started last year, mostly senior and unwanted dogs. Had our 57th adoption last week, cinnamon roll. I found a home. So it was great. But I'm a dog guy, I love dogs. And I feel like I'm a little polished right now because I did some real self work over the past couple of years. I'm proud of you. So I think I feel like I'm a little on the stage of me right now. So that's great to me. So awesome. Nicky. I got the principle praying mantis. Oh, okay. I picked that because I wouldn't be where I am today without principle because I think you talk about growing up in humble beginnings, growing up, like we are very fortunate. Like I had a roof over my head, I had a loving family, but I also had a father that worked every day. And when he worked every day, like he was a leader and like leader, when there's a natural born leader, it's action, it's not telling you, like he just got up and fucking went to work. It's not preaching, it's putting in your work. 100%. And whenever I wanted to do something, whenever I wanted to accomplish something, he instilled in me that you have to work for what you get. And so being that I didn't really necessarily come out of the mud, but when I was nine years old, painting my whole fucking fence back to front. You know what's funny, let's talk about that. There's a lot of kids that grow up in middle class, upper middle class, and even occasionally wealthy families, that the parents are just like, fuck this shit. And like, yes, we're not poor, but like we're not giving you money after 10. And so like, you want money? 10. I get it. If I wanted mad and it was go watch each windows $5 at a car, the whole thing. So I think. Your dad taught you work. Instilling those principles in me. I love it. And seeing principles be expressed has led me to. That's a rookie car too. There's a series one, as you can see these whitebacks right here, where those are my original drawings. Oh, those are sick. Yeah, those are my original drawings. But this is series two. I'm sorry, but that's your original drawing. I drew that. I drew. You weren't kidding with the no artist. No, no, fuck you, bro. What do you mean? Look at this, that's fucking awesome. You drew that. That's all right. That's all right. I don't even know what that is. Get a side by side. He's like, give me that first. Wait a minute, I'm about to really fuck with you. Fuck you, I drew this and this is fresh. Wow. Respect. Respect. Okay, but hold on, but hold on. Now you also drew this. What are you talking about? That's a jolly fucking jacket. What is that? Like, I'm fucking shit. Give me that. That's your worst nightmare, fucking. That's gonna come to your house. You're fucking fucking dead. I'm gonna be scared of that. Is what I'm saying? Yeah, he comes in my house. Yeah, yeah, maybe. Maybe you took a couple of art classes in between nice two parts. All right, let me give you mine. Okay. The tenacious termite. Oh, good word. Oh. Is that your favorite word? Tenacious termite. One of my sayings is being tenacious. I have a sess with tenacity. Yes, love it. Like, again, back to like what I think everyone's trying to do here. And by the way, you said something earlier about like, the concept of it being an emotional thing, not a physical thing. I don't recall what the reference was, but that's how I think about tenacity. You know, like, I think the emotional success that I think everybody who's watching right now are listening, I think this is probably the most interesting thing that I'm personally working on. I've been in the lab, and that means in my head, shower, flights, driving. It's the best. It's the lab. It's the actual fucking lab, right? That's a great thing. I've been in the lab, and all I'm thinking about is, if I can market to the world the redefining of success to be peace of mind and smiling, instead of fucking stuff, I could leave the biggest impact of all time, and I don't know why one wouldn't try. Totally. And so I just, I think tenacity is an incredible trait, but it's the tenacity not to go on tour every day or make music every day or be an entrepreneur or build content. It's the tenacity to fight for calm. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. Emotional work, I see it. Yeah, 100%. No, 100%, and I think too, like, when you get to the place where, because social media is great, but it's also a dangerous place because there's so many people telling you what they think you should do, even if you're so deep rooted in who you are, and a lot of people are trying to define what success is and what they think your success should be, and if you kind of tune into that, it could be a dangerous place. By the way, Nikki, on that, I know people have this take on social. I will say this, pre-social, that my issue is you only had a couple of voices. Your parents defined success, and you were stuck in that two-person game, whereas now all these other voices, to your point, there's unlimited garbage. Yes. But if you try to find the gold, there's more gold out there than ever was. Oh, 100%. Than the way we grew up. We didn't have these voices. Oh, sure. There was none of us running around. And you also get to get the world and study your neighborhood, right? Think about the circle of people that influenced you. Talk to me about some, I'm gonna end with dreams. Tell me a dream you have. We've gone deep. You could make it far more light. I'd rather it actually be a little more selfish than the selfless talk we just did, like a fun thing, like winning an Academy Award. Like, you know, you're so young in the journey compared to us old guys. We're young, by the way. Anybody under 90s young. 92-year-olds, I apologize. Where are you at? What's a dream of yours at this point? I have a lot of dreams. Break them down. Shoot them. I have the vision. I had a girl. But I wanna get nominated for the Grammy Awards next year. I see myself winning a Grammy soon. Yeah. I believe in my dreams. That's why everything I speak into existence. Why do you value soon? Soon, because I believe I can make it work soon. Do you feel like wanting it soon potentially has any impact on your output? I'll tell you where I'm going. I'm worried about soon. Okay. Because for me, it's like, if you win a Grammy in seven years, you're a child. And that's fresh and amazing. And I think it takes a little pressure off your chest. Because when you put soon or fast on it, it sometimes changes the things people do because they think they need to achieve it in a window to put an ideology out of pedestal thoughts. No, yeah. I feel like soon for me means whenever God is handing it to me, whenever God's plan, it'll come whenever it'll come. So fight for it as fast as possible because that's the tenacity. But you're chill if you get it in 19 years, not in 19 weeks. Yeah, yeah. Put the work in mouth. Right. Make it work. I just wanna, like, honestly, like I always take my time with everything. I just dropped an EP. I took my time with that too. It came together very organically. I wasn't forcing it. I was like, I think it was God telling me, like right now, Dina, is your time to put it out there. So other than the Grammy, I wanna work. You like intuition? Mm. Yeah. You go with it or do you overthink it? Like when you feeling your stomach, does your brain have say? Is it a partner to your stomach? Or does it actually overrule your stomach? It used to, because I used to overthink a lot, but right now I really just go with my intuition. Like I trust my gut feeling, so whatever my gut feels like. Yeah, I feel like God's plan is a cousin to the intuitive stomach. I'm all intuition. It's a tag team. Yeah, I think it's the biggest miss in society right now. I think we've over-rationalized in the last 100 years. And that if you go back 100 years, there was unlimited people walking around of like, you know, like evil eye and stomach. And I think intuition is underrated. Yep. It really is. Yeah, I agree with that. I think you gotta go with, I mean, everybody, you're your own compass, you know? Because you know that feeling. Well, hold on. You know the feeling when it's right. You're accountable for your own right, so no falls on you. 100%. I think that's part of it, you know? Exactly. Keep talking amongst yourself. I'm trying to buy more time in the podcast. Okay. Keep building on that. Keep thoughts on that. Well, the thing about it, it's funny because like, I think it's also a young thing too, because like when I was 19 years old, you know, and I look where I am now at 47, so different, right? Like it took me, I'm an 18 year overnight success. It took me as almost a year older than you, right? To make it. Like I was doing improv in little buildings, you know? I love that. So you gotta really take your time with it too, which is good, but I love that. As long as you're putting the work in, I think that's what's important. 100%. But I love how you said 18 year overnight success. Because like it looks overnight. 100%. And where these guys come from? You don't realize all the work you're putting in behind the scenes and nobody sees it, nobody does it. What's done in the dark one day comes to the light. And when it happens, it's like everybody all overnight. No, motherfucker, I've been, you're like the whole way here, I've been working, but. Let's get a question or two from Twitch. Twitch, what do you got? I agree, Dina is a superstar. This is gonna be fun to look at. This is gonna be a lot of fun to watch in like nine years. Like, and be like, she was fucking in our office. Yeah, right? I remember Joe, we miss him. Not the Dora, Rest in Peace. Joe, don't do that. I fucking don't like that, Joe. I hate that shit, I hate that shit. I hate that shit, I hate that shit. Don't do that shit. Don't even fucking put it out. I don't like that shit. Don't even fucking put that shit out. Joe, don't be a dick face. Mike, my mother does that all the time. I'm like, no one has stopped. I don't like that. What's grandma supposed to do? That's a leverage. Like if you don't listen to me, I'll be dead tomorrow. I'll be dead literally. One day I'm gonna be here. You're gonna do it while I'm here. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone. I love it. I eat the meatballs. Forever 1620. Let's go with you, Nikki, because you're so early in your career. What's your biggest takeaway so far from your career? Will Joe Godo be at V-Con next year? August 8th to the 11th in LA. Wanna come up and make some people laugh? Do, I'm there. All right, we're gonna work on it. Yeah, I'm actually, yeah, I'm not touring then. All right, we're gonna figure that out. Joe, what was the question, sorry? Nikki, at this point, you're two seconds in, but at this point, your single biggest takeaway from this career you have as a emerging public figure that you wouldn't have thought the day before you posted that first TikTok. You didn't see it coming. You're like, oh, shit, this. Fear is afraid of you too. Interesting, break that down. And if you, like fear has so much control, but it's the same feeling as happiness. So if you run at, like nobody runs from happiness. Fear is deathly afraid of the day where you turn around and be like, I'm not fucking afraid of you. It's funny you said that. And then it loses all power. And you could be afraid and do all these, like I've given, I've done a ton of shit scared out of my mind, but I'm still me because I'm not gonna let fear beat me. And I think, you know, like for the past three years, I've been afraid in multiple occasions, but my godmother told me, you know, you have to embrace every emotion, but you can't be every emotion. So when I do feel fear, I'm just like, all right, well, I'm afraid, but I'm still gonna do what I'm meant to do. It's so funny. It's literally incredibly similar to one of my favorite quotes for myself that I say occasionally, but I say to myself all the time, which is fear is fake. It's if, yeah, it's if it's fake as fuck. Fear hangs out with fucking Santa Claus. Wait a minute, what are you saying? Wait, what are you saying? I'm saying, oh my God, this reminds me of something that I gotta tell you. You know what, do you know when I stopped telling jokes? I was in fourth grade. Do you know why? Why? Denise Laurie, if you're out there, big shout out. Denise Laurie was my sister's best friend. Okay. In first, she was in kindergarten. I was in fourth, my sister was in first grade. We come home from school. We're all, this is the 80s life, all outside, chillin'. I wasn't even a thought. It was the best. You were just outside constantly living, parents knew. There's fucking parents right now that have fucking trackers on their kids in college. I was six. My mom had no fucking clue what a fuck I was. I was in the neighborhood somewhere. Six. You were talking about a different world though. Same world. It's safer. Bingo. All right, they fucking tricked you, Nikki. It's fucking safer. With all these phones and everything, kidnappers are like fuck this shit. It's safer. Somebody had to see you. It's safer. It's so fucking safe. Somebody had to see you get stunted or struck. It's 10 times safer. It's just that the news became a business and selling fear, which is fake fucking works. Anyway, Joe, last time I told a joke. So I hear this joke. It fucking rips all day in fourth grade. I'm killing people. They're like, you're the fucking, you're a richer prior. I'm like, I'm richer prior. I'm fucking killing it. I come home and I tell this joke to my crew. Robbie Turnick, Marissa Byrd, Andy Greco, Denise Moray. Shout out, shout out. Big shout out. I'm giving all the shout out. Eric Godfrey, Ellen Godfrey. I'm like, gang, let me fucking, I'm on my way. I'm gonna be a practical joke in the future. I'm that guy. Like, here's the joke. All right, if the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus were in a room, and I threw a quarter in the middle of the room, who would get it? No one, because there's no such thing as the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny. So I tell this joke, everyone's dying, laughing, except Denise Moray starts crying. Because you dropped the truth bomb on that ass. Because you still believe. It gets worse. It gets worse. Father came to see you. Worse, I did go worse. Where is it? Ding dong. Oh, shit. Get to the door. Denise's mom, who is literally, may she rest in peace, one of the greatest women I ever met in my life. You wanna talk about sweetness? Sweetness, again, back to 80s, all the moms were my mom. My wife's mom, yep. By the way, you wanna talk about how different shit was? In 1985, if you got fresh or did some wrong shit in the neighborhood, and you were on your friend's lawn, their mom could smack you. Yeah, for sure. I was smacked by women that were not my mom. And I said, thank you very much, I'm sorry. No, sorry, apologize, I love you. Imagine that shit happening now. Come on now, no, I can't. But I ruined her fucking life. She came over, and nothing hurts more than. And I was a good leader in the neighborhood. She just looked me dead in the face, and she said, I'm disappointed in you. Honestly, I can't even tell you what's going on in my five years. I've never told this story. It was fucking devastating. Anyway, I don't know if you know this, but Santa's fake. Okay. There's just all people crying in the channel. And fear hangs out with Santa. Fear is fake. Fear is some shit you made up, and we need to get the fucking shit out of the system. Because right now, unfortunately, if you wanna know what's going on in the world, it's that fear is on fire. It has momentum. It is on fire. Politicians have weaponized it. Parents have weaponized it. School systems have weaponized it. Humans have weaponized it. Young generations have weaponized it. An old generation, it is the weapon of choice. And I fucking hate it more than anything on earth. I fucking hate fear as much as I hate Bill Belichick. And that's a lot. Fuck, yeah. Drop that mic. I think we were talking about dreams. Yeah. I wanna own a pony. Yeah. HBCU grad said, Gary, tell me more about becoming a full-time streamer. I said this the other day. I'm very real on this. I think what I'm doing right now, everyone, for me, I don't have time. If I was 22, I would get in front of a camera and stream all day. It is very clear to me that live is the opportunity right now. For all three of you, I couldn't push you more enough to do TikTok live all day long. All day long, brushing your teeth, driving, make pretend you're late on the train to a meeting. Like whatever you were actually in like to do. I drove, by the way. You drove your own car? I drove my own car. Good for you. I do that all the time. I just really, really, really think that live. And so anyway, what did I mean? I mean that I really genuinely believe that streaming is a huge platform. People are interested in people. You don't have to put on a show. You don't have to, I don't have to give a keynote. I'm about to stop this and go on mute. And you're gonna start gonna want, people are gonna watch in the background me going on with my day. And that's interesting because it's an insight because I can tell you this, 16 year old me would have looked up to Gary Vee. And would have thought it was fucking cool to see how he does his day. I'm like, oh okay. I didn't know. That to me, I'm huge on watching people being observant and watching how people move. So if I take a look at the bushes. If I got binoculars, I got the whole thing. But like I've- The bushes. I've- Nikki lives in the bushes. No, I do. No, no, no, no. Like I'm watching everything. That's great. And so like when I see that, like when I watch people work, I take what I can and I almost, like, and that's a thing. And that's why I'm so blessed to be living in this area. There's so much free fucking game out there. You just gotta pay attention. And you just gotta look for it. You just gotta have the hunger to do it. Launneeth, I need to get rid of my fear of the camera. My friends, if someone says you're not attractive, they're a piece of shit. Yeah, for sure. Like I don't know what else to say. Like can we just, can we make you like this one? Like I don't know what else. I don't like it. But what comes on your fucking platform and comes to you, they come to your home. Right. Your page is your home. Yep. And they don't take off the shoes and they look at you in the face and say you're ugly. They are a piece of shit. For sure. That's how we're ending the show. Thank you boys and girls. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
