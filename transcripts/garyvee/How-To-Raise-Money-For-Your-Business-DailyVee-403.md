## Transcript
I'm starting my vlog today solo 8.58 in the morning had something cancelled so me and Iris are on different schedules pulling up to the office. Good day. Got nightline following me around today so I'm excited about that so some of your grandparents and parents are gonna check that out on the television. You'll see that online. I'll chop it up. Super excited. All great stuff. Focused Vayner Media. Just the whole Vayner X family, Purewell. All that. It's going extremely well. Tons of strategies for 2018 being implemented. Super excited for agent 2021. Our first owned and operated conference in Miami next week. That should be great. And obviously the book is right upon us. Obviously super excited about crushing it. It's doing extremely well in sales which I appreciate. YouTube, YouTube, YouTube. If you've not pre-ordered it, now is the time. Don't break my heart. Well you know what a lot of people don't understand about raising capital is you just need somebody to say yes. It's not about you know here's how you do it. You get there's seven people running around right now that love coffee and tattoo and tattoo and as a tattoo artist whose grandfather left him or her a million dollars and they're trying to figure out where to spend it. Those people exist. Like you're not gonna go to Silicon Valley. Like the reason everyone's losing is they want to go to Silicon Valley and talk to bankers and math kids and they run you through the ringer and it's a waste of time. You need to go find entrepreneurial money who believe in you. You need to go find somebody who sold their agency and has 12 million dollars now and is looking to do something and is like oh I understand Mike and I love skateboarding and tattoos and I love do you understand? Like so I'm giving you a piece of advice that people are just not understanding. That's the game. Like you don't go to somebody who's gonna say no and that's what every creative you know entrepreneur is doing right now and it's a complete waste of time. Raising capital. So many of you have gotten caught in this bullshit venture capital and banking world. When you want to need money you got to be willing to get it in any shape or form as long as it's clean money and as long as the person you're getting from isn't going to put you emotionally in a bad place right. You know you don't want to get money from your aunt who's then gonna text you 15 times a day and say I hate you suck. You know like that brings in too much family dynamics but nonetheless what I mean by that is everybody's trying to fit into the mold of how to sell to a venture capitalist when that's like a moonshot instead of trying to find high net worth individuals who believe in your vision. Like I I've never made an I've written millions of dollars in checks through my career and it's never been because of the math and then other people have never written a check that hasn't been about the math and neither is right or wrong. It's about styles and so you you know but too many of you have no chance of getting a Silicon Valley venture capital firm to write you a check and all you do is you sit and you make excuses I didn't go to the college or I don't look the part or they don't invest in minorities or whatever you may come up with instead of going to who will give you money. Find who will give you money. You know high net worth individuals who are creative and open-minded. Find them. I'm super okay. I'm super okay. I'm super okay. Looking forward to it. Hey. Let's do it. So these ladies flew to Australia. Thank you. Thank you. What kind of teenager were you? I was a great teenager. My mom I'm writing a book called Perfectly Parented so it's interesting to hear what you guys. So I'm writing a book called Perfectly Parented and it's the perspective of a kid who feels his parents perfectly parented him. My mom and dad so I I never did any I mean I did nothing wrong except get bad grades so I never disrespected anybody I never did cliche drugs and alcohol stuff I was I was a nicest kid I was friends with everybody in my high school I worked every minute I went to like seven high school parties in my life you know I just worked I like helped around the house because I was the oldest I was I was a ridiculously good kid yet I wasn't like a square or you know like meaning I fun I enjoyed it like my my my high school years were very simple I worked every minute or I which was the happiest moments of my time whether it was doing baseball card shows selling at flea markets or working in my dad's liquor store or I was in school being miserable I didn't play sports I played tennis for two years but I barely played sports I I didn't chase girls for the most part like I just was very focused on being an entrepreneur from a very young age and I was obsessed with not making my mom upset. I love it. I love it. I do a lot of that but seeing as I'm a mom. Yeah. You know I want to. It's just true like I my mom guilted me into being a great child and a great teenager and I think that's what I do to my employees. Hell hell yeah. By providing so much love and and support that the fear is letting them down. Guilty. Iris was going to leave after working for a year that was her plan that was her thoughts but she's still here because it's better to be here than it's not to be here. Well a lot of teenagers actually disconnect from their parents because their parents are screwing up. Their parents are doing the wrong thing. Their parents care about themselves not their kids. Parents are struggling out there because they're insecure and their parenting their children based on the judgment of other parents not based on putting their kids in the position to succeed. I understand that. I got to figure out anyway so we started basically the digital agency. Yep. What was that? This is like late 20s. Middle of 2016. Okay. And I mean it's just straight to the bottom. Yep. And I have no problem with that. Like that's where I think I thrive. Took us a little bit of time to figure out what our niche was and then once we figured that out and you know it's been a really incredible like I have you know we have a team of six like co-workspace in the city. I mean it's typical stuff trying to make it happen with you know before we can. And I guess you know one of the main things that I'm running up against now is like I need to scale. You know like I don't I need a couple more people. I need to be able to do certain things that I'm doing. There are only two ways to do that. It's a chicken and egg game. You either go out and get enough business that allows you to afford it or you convince people to work for you for free because you know you're a good enough guy that when you can make it whole you will. But there's a ton of 22 year old you and me and boys and irises. There's a lot of them. There's just a lot of kids who are 22 who want to fuck with you. You just have to create the net. So you have to start like people are scared to ask for people to work for free but you have to find two people who are worth a year that are willing to work for $14 an hour because you might have to pay minimum wage. I don't know what the rules are. Here's why. Let me tell you. I know. I know. Let me tell you the secret of why I fuck with it. Because I'm going to pay them back more. And I know I'm capable of. And I know that if I wasn't capable of I would die to the end. If this went bankrupt because there was fraud going on and I owed a lot of six of them dollars well that's what I would work on until I would start up again. The biggest reason people are scared to ask people to work for free is they think it's doing the wrong thing and I think it's doing the right thing. There's a lot of street kids who are not going to NYU who are going to a community college that no agency wants to hire because they're hiring from better schools who you'll fuck with and they'll fuck with you. You might have to kiss some frogs. When you get free you get what you pay for sometimes. But I spoke for free. I do stuff for free. I'm doing stuff for free constantly. I'm doing this meeting. The fuck is this meeting for me? Well I'm getting. This is my version of working for free. Like people, you know when I talk about working for free people love to come out and fucking kill me. I don't know what you guys are thinking. They're just not as smart. There's two people on earth right now who can be a designer or an account person or a media planner or whatever the fuck you do who are willing to work for you for $15 because you told them at a pop up salad QSR for an hour that you'll fuck it. You got them. And they're going to say you're brown like me too. It's always the ones that look like you. You know like kids that went to Yale and went to MBAs they don't fuck with me. Which is cool. Until they break at 29. Then they find me. So to give you a little bit of background about myself and how I got started. I got into fitness in 2012 kind of accidentally. I was on my own journey experiencing health problems. My journey was very much in fitness more about the health side of things. And I joined Instagram to motivate myself. We were actually living in China at the time. And being alone on that journey. That Instagram was my way to connect with people. Especially back home right? Yeah. And since that was really at the beginning of Instagram I started organically growing a page just by connecting with people. I know enough about that era of Instagram to know that you were on that wave. I remember. Okay so fast forward to today. Pretty much you know I built this brand kind of on accident. But it's been amazing since something that I'm passionate about. And I'm able to connect with people on. And you know I launched the app December 17th. So it's been just a few weeks. And so the launch was great. My community kind of just freaked out exploded and they're loving it. I would just say that where we're at now is we're a pretty small team. We're a team of like five. And the demand is like exceeding our potential as a small team. Well let me give you a first big piece of advice. Try to keep less money. Of course. Invest more in the company. 100%. Unless you're retiring next year. The biggest mistake that people that go through what you're going through right now make is they're trying to maximize profit. To buy the things that the two of you want. So they're willing to not hire three more teammates. And invest in the business. Because they want an extra vacation. Or a bigger bedroom. Or three more handbags. I mean that's real. The biggest first piece of advice I would make is the following. There are Ming right? Min. Spell it? There are 7000 men right now. Do you know how pumped men is too? Do you know how many? You have to understand how this is all playing out. Men's a young woman. Alex. You know like Iris. There are people that are under 25. Alex is way over 25. But there you are. Wow you look great. But there's a lot of people right now. There's an unbelievable amount of talented 22 to 24 year olds who look up to you who are willing to work for very little. You need to build out your team and take it out of your short term pocket to create long term success. I get 40 emails a week minimally of like I have an MBA. I've been running a business for 40 years. I've made, forget about learned. I've made more money in the last six months watching your vlog and listening to your podcast than I did the last six years with all that background. Because you have to understand this is of the moment. The reason you're so, do you understand that all of you in this room don't realize how smart you are? Because you're in your own bubble? I mean this. You're in the forefront of something which then means you don't understand because then you're only surrounding yourself with other people that are doing the same thing. 99% of the people don't believe what's going on in crushing it. Like when I wrote the first one, the thought of making money on YouTube or social media was absurd. I mean go read the first Amazon comments of my first book nine years ago. So you've already got the mentality. Now let me give you the practicality. Get four people on your team for the cost of what you probably allocated for one. An enormous amount of 22 year olds right now and more next year because they're getting affected in teenage years every year more. Dream job in life is to either be an influencer or work for one. That's just real. It works. I agree with the book. Thank you. Yes. Yes. Enjoy. I think you'll really like it. I hope there's one or two little nuggets that can. You're so in it that it will come natural but I really actually wrote it for people like you. There was like four to seven things that are in there that I'm like okay this is the best shit I know that I think maybe even for the people that know they may not know. Thank you guys. Thank you guys. Take care. This is intriguing is that the streets will fuck with it and so it's got bigger upside. This is why I'm going to go to the point that I want to make which is when I think about businesses like this the biggest thing that I'm going to give you a huge piece of recommendation. You don't want to be at the mercy of these fucking logos. Got it. You don't think you've got Penn State, Michigan, Indiana. Nope. I know exactly what you're going to say. Here's the good news. No. Here's why. You don't have the leverage. I'm going to say it again. It's way better if you guys desire. You guys designed something with a logo that was yours and people started coming to you. Your patent's not gonna hold, your brand will. Let me ask you a question. Louis Vuitton is not a one single product company. It started as one. It did, but is that where your single product could be? Where we're doing more things than just the hood? That's how it always works. But just, you did say it. What do you think Under Armour started as? What do you think Nike started as? Every brand we're about to say started as a single product company. Your fifth business book just came out. Yes. It will have just come out at the time of this interview. Right now I'm in Tosfer, something dealing with TV. You're having a moment. Yes, yes. And I'm trying to see where the right place is to grab it because I love what I do. I absolutely love what I do. I love the classroom. I love working with kids. But I'm I'm. Do you understand that you have a moment right now and you can always go back to the classroom and maybe never have a moment like this again? Have you thought about that? Because a lot of times I think people think about selling out or changing their lives. But like what I love about being a teacher and many other things that people do, I always remind people, just do me one favor. Know what you can come back to and what you can't come back to. I definitely got a great unit. I mean, I couldn't ask for more. Then you should go for it. When shit's good, you go in the offense. You're crippled by opportunity. My answer is if you've got a good at home and she's supporting you and the little one's not going to remember any of this anyway, then go. Take your moment. This is the stuff that I'm telling my kids. This is, you know, go forward. You know, like take what is there. Take this opportunity. This is what I'm trying to find. It's easier to give advice than to take it. Which is why I think I've popped because I think I only give advice that I already took so nobody can call me on the vulnerability. I'm a practitioner of all my thesis. Casey actually, you know what? Fucking Casey. Casey Neistat's a fucking beast. What he said? Where is he? Where is he? The name GaryVee has become synonymous with motivating an entire generation. No one understands the power of social media better than Gary because none of what he preaches is theory. It's an understanding born from his deep expertise in business and life. What Casey understood about me in his quote for this book is, I'm not guessing. I would have regretted if I didn't take my moment back in 2006 where I'm like, wait a minute. Am I your wine merchant or am I a anthropology, like digital, like what am I? I could, I never knew the word in. I wasn't a good student so I didn't know all these words. They came to me later but I failed forward. I tasted and most of all I just did not worry about what anybody else thought. Go do your thing. I'm ready to man. Just go do it. Just honestly, just go very hard. Say yes to everything. Until you can't fucking breathe. I'm ready for it. And you know what, it's funny, this was the year I said at school, I was like this is gonna be my year to say no and watch all the things that I'm accepting but I realized like you're saying, the more important focus is that yes. And we're putting those yeses. Dude, you know what's up? When you say yes and you can't breathe anymore because you're saying yes to everything, the yeses are giving you more oxygen. Yeah, yeah. That's the truth. Thank you for this. You're welcome. Talk to you soon. Stay well. Thank you so much. Peace out. The day's been fucking crazy. Straight fucking crazy. Right? Yeah. Even by our standards. Okay, you ready? Do you think that there's destiny in life? I think DNA is a big fucking deal. And I think has a whole lot to do with how things play out. And I think that there's certain people who have DNA traits that create scenarios that are easy to see from far away. This is a, we just have to clarify some of our lives. I'll see ya. If I don't have it. I don't have it.
