The skill set of content and social matters a lot more than if you're a travel blogger. There's a million travel bloggers that don't get any views. Attention is the number one asset. I wanted to ask you for a lot of Americans, they're moving overseas and they are becoming digital nomads. So I wanted to know if you didn't want to become necessarily a travel blogger, what's a good platform to use and what's a good strategy if you're an entrepreneur and business owner but don't necessarily want to do travel. So you're saying you don't want to travel? No, I'm going to travel but I don't want to document it like that. I want to educate people but I'll be in different locations. So would they be more interested in the different locations or are they interested in what I'm teaching? Well, a bigger question is what would you like to teach? Like what are you trying to accomplish? Right, because I love that you're thinking about them which is exactly right. But ironically the best way in the world to be selfless is to be selfish. Meaning for me, for example, why I'm even on this stage right now and why you know me is I think the world lacks perspective on how much good there is and how much opportunity there is and how much is going well. We are fixated on what's not going well. So I have a passion to talk about those things and I've had a passion to talk about entrepreneurship and wine and lots of stuff. Many of things that weren't really popular when I first started talking about them. And so I can give you a lot about what the audience is going to want but first I want to make sure I understand what you want. What would you want to do? What with the content? What are you trying to accomplish? I would love to educate them in those environments. That's what I would like to do. Educate them on the things that I've been learning throughout the years. Firearms training or personal defense and how they can protect themselves wherever they go around the world but making sure I do that in a peaceful place for me and my mental health. I love that. So the key here is it doesn't matter where you are to do that. I built one of the largest wine shows in the world from New Jersey. And I did it in 2006. Like everybody was like well you got to do this in Napa. You have to move to Napa and I'm like why? So you know are people intrigued by the visualization of where people are? Yes. But it sounds like you're trying to teach people something that's important to many people and the setting for the backdrop is not very very very important to that. It's a component but you can do that anywhere and anywhere. And I think the question becomes do you actually know how to do it? Ironically this is fake cover but I announced this today. So I'm launching this next year right? And it's heavy detail on what I'm going to tell you right now which is it doesn't matter if you're in Sri Lanka, Japan or Manhattan. If you want to reach people you need to make sure you know what time to post what the first three seconds of the video look like, what the thumbnail looks like, how LinkedIn works different than YouTube. You have to understand the distribution and the content that works in it. And then more importantly the slang, the wording, the copywriting. The skill set of content in social matters a lot more than if you're a travel blogger. There's a million travel bloggers that don't get any views. 10 million travel bloggers that don't get any views. How well do you know your content of all the things you've learned, self-defense, all this firearm training? And then how good are you at the craft of putting out the videos, the pictures and the written words on these 10 social media platforms that dictate society? No that's great. Okay, next question. Gary, grateful to have a little time with you. I'm Kristina and I'm known as the yoga boss. And my intention is to inspire and empower people with yoga meditation. And I've used NFTs to help give people access to meditation. And I feel like especially in the last year the criticism of and skepticism around NFTs has created a huge marketing challenge. So I'm curious how your vision of how creators can utilize NFTs as vehicles for consumer engagement and customer retention has evolved over the last year. Just patience. You're absolutely right. No different than in 2001 when all the internet stocks crashed and everybody had a bad taste about the internet and all the articles were written that the internet was a fad. All I was doing at WineLibrary.com was just building. I was just building the website better. I was getting my email newsletter better. I was making the store better. Same with BeFriends as the NFT thing had an over excitement and a re-correction crash. I've been working on the physical stuff, squishy blows, trading cards, pins, and refining our Web3 products and services, building and preparing for the next wave. And so to your point, I'm not in the business of convincing. I'm in the business of conviction. So my conviction for the blockchain and for Web3 and for where NFTs are going to be in society hasn't changed in the height of NFT land. And it sounds like this might be your radar. I was making videos that 99% of NFTs were going to go to zero because NFTs are a platform, not individual projects. So you're right. Right now, the overall consensus on NFTs because people are headline readers is the same way people treat everything. They don't fully know and they're just kind of like looking at it. And there was over speculation. 99% of sports cards are not worth money. Michael Jordan's rookie card is 99% of contemporary art is not worth money, but Rashid Johnson's art is 99% of sneakers that people wear are not collectible sneakers. But there's sneaker con and there's all sorts of Jordans and Air Force ones that are rare and sell. So people got caught up last year, two years ago, thinking everything that was an NFT was worth money. No, it's a digital collectible or in your world, it's a digital asset or marketing tool to get people to make it a utility, a membership. There's a lot of things that are going to be used for. In the meantime, to your point, you can't lead with NFTs right now because it's not that time. You need to be building your skill set and be prepared for when it is that time again, whether that's six months, a year or two years from now. Ironically, NFTs from a collectible and trading standpoint have had their best week this week in the last 18 months or 12 months. So you never know when it's going to happen, but I think for you right now, I'd focus more on content and social networks while being behind the scenes, educating yourself on all the advancements of Ethereum and new NFT protocols, and keep practicing and then be ready to hit hard when it's back, just like 2005, six, seven internet was that post 2001. Hey, I want to jump in really quick. I want to just ask a question. How do you stay abreast? You're always right on the edge of culture, where things are going, and then you start leading it. How do you, in which strategy, when you learn something, you just jump in, but how do you keep abreast of it? And then how do you make those decisions to say, I'm going to do? That's a great question. I put in the work. I got Vegas F1, a lot of business development this weekend coming up. I have a five-hour flight at 8.30 in the morning on Friday. From 8.30 to 11.30 on that five-hour flight, I'll get my work done, my email, this, that. The last two hours, I'll do all sorts of random curious stuff that's happening in the world. For example, if you can see, I'm wearing a corduroy hat, right? As you know, because you're hip, people are rocking corduroy hats. I'm actually curious why. Hmm. Like just like in the late 90s, early 2000s, corduroy'd hit, pants. Right now, corduroy hats, corduroy jackets, they're hitting again. I like to know why. Like, and then I'll go into chat, gbt, or Google, or social media, and actually spend an hour trying to figure out who popped it off. Did Michael B. Jordan rocket it? Paris Fashion Week, and that got it going. Is there some TikTok or nobody's ever heard of, but she's the next fashionista? Was it pushed by a brand that really wanted it to pop off, and they have the juice at the moment to get it done? I always want to know why things are happening. What Netflix show is working? What food trend is happening? What part of the world is popping off? Like, why, why, why, why, why? Everything is curiosity, everything is why, but here's the thing. Even at my state of where I am in my career, where my time is now really valuable, I still think that I out-curious most people. And so for me, when I saw Ice Spice happening six months before, people really felt it, because I'm in the trenches. I'm looking at social, I'm looking at Google Trends, I'm just listening. You know, it's funny, I'm such a talker. You know this, actually. You and I, tonight in Cannes, talk about a pretty important subject around race and life. You got to see a version of me that most people don't get to see. We sat on a boat, you and I, for three, four hours, and I only talked once. And it was not only because I was being respectful to the subject matter, it's because I listened way more than I talk. Y'all see me when I talk, 90% of my day is behind the scenes. And so I think the reason I've always been on it is I'm not sure how many people are out working me in paying attention to culture. Culture the way that we now talk about it, which is like, let's call it what it is, black urban culture, which is the cool. But then, you know, Midwest culture, hunting and fishing, country music, Latin trap, food trends, diet trends, why is stoicism increasing? Why are people walking barefoot in grass for grounding? Psychedelics, Japan, anime, video games, Fortnite recall, like, I'm in it. You know, and I think that's one of the reasons why, you know, I feel like you saw when I was on the boat, I had a manga comic I had created and the artist I had actually created. And similarly, I think that curiosity is one of the strongest tools that we don't, like, I read Japanese and Korean fiction every night, and I've been reading it for a while now. Curiosity is probably going to be the thing that allows us to really solve some of the wicked problems just by just 100%. 100%. And it's my entertainment when people watch Netflix or, you know, obviously I love my sports teams so they get precedent when they're playing. But for me, it's like fun, you know, think about all the people that love curling up to a book for two hours before they go to bed or watching the same movie or watching a Netflix show or drinking wine or going out at night clubbing. Like, it is my great joy to sit for two, three hours of curious culture digging a night. And I just think I'm out working the world on that. And I also think I'm naturally talented at making the next leap, which is some people can read and see a lot of trends around cupcakes, but I have a knack for understanding what does that mean and what's going to happen next. Hey, my name is Charles Menifield and you've had your company, well, one of your companies, your media company since 09. Yes, sir. I wonder what would you do if you were starting that from scratch today? How would you approach it if you were building your media company? Well, yeah. Yes, sir. I would do the same exact thing I did in 09. First, I would keep costs down. I started the company in a conference room of another company. So I had no cost because I didn't have money. I believe when you start a company, you need to start from the dirt. When come, you know, everyone talks about, I need to raise capital. I need to raise capital. I always get scared because I think like, you know, like, you know, when we were kids, if you were the kind of kid that got like five bucks and then you bought some shit in the store real quick and your grandma would be like, man, that money's burning a hole in your pocket. You know, those people, I feel like that's what a lot of founders do when they raise capital. They spend it on dumb shit. So the first thing I would do is keep it humble. And the second thing I would do is what I did with this media company, which is sell things you know. What I knew in 2009 was social media in a world that most people didn't know. If you're asking this question for yourself, you got to ask yourself, what do you know? People start companies around where they think money is versus starting companies around things they like or things they know. The only companies that I get excited about as an investor is if I feel the founder really knows it or really loves it and you show me somebody who really knows it and loves it and I'll show you something I'm really interested in. So I think that keep it humble and keep it slow. People want it fast and then do something that you really know or you really love. I really think that framework puts you in a best position to have a successful company and then be patient because it takes time. Hi, Gary. My name is Jose Marquez. I'm the chairman and CEO of Tech Latino. You've heard of us. And Danny Vampena has been one of our members that has been who lives in New York and ran our Twitter for a while. He's a good friend of yours and I wanted to say hello first of all. Awesome. Say thank you brother. Second of all, I want to say thank you for introducing me to yard sales. Because let me tell you, I've become a yard sales warrior and because of your advice, I found a very, very prosperous card of Roberto Clemente's working card. Unbelievable. You know, and that was right there in the box and people didn't even know it was there. Amazing. I want to thank you for that because that was a $21,000 windfall that I made for two grand for $2,000. I'm sorry. $2,000. $21,000 for $2 investment. I know brother. It's there. I keep trying. Listen, I make those garage sale yard sale videos because so many people email me and say, Gary, you're talking about investing in Facebook. I got $48 and I was like, you know what? I'm going to start making content for people who have $48 because I know exactly what I did and I know what's going on out there. I believe that most Americans are lucky enough to be in a place where they could go garage sale or thrift store shopping or goodwill store shopping and spend $30 and make $300, $400 every week. And that really matters for a lot of people, a lot of families. And obviously you're talking about a very incredible find, but for a lot of people, the emails I get, like somebody emailed me actually yesterday, I think they're going to Disney World. They're paycheck to paycheck family, but the entire family for Christmas is going to Disney World proper to like nice hotel, good flight and all of the money happened in the last five months, making $7,000 buying $1 items on that garage sales and selling them for $30, $40 on eBay, Poshmark, Facebook marketplace. It's there for people that want to go get it. And it's fun if you like it. So here's my business question. I've been doing Tech Lentino now for 27 years. Wow. We have brought the Hispanic community from point A to point from nothing, but not even knowing what Cisco was to over indexing on cell phones and getting that broadband experience that they needed and they couldn't. What do we do next as an organization to help our community? I mean, look, I think there's a lot of ways to think about that. I think similar to the first question, it's what do you feel is most needed? I believe education is massive. And then the next part is the putting people on. So for example, maybe we can do a business development deal where people that want to either enter marketing technology or switch careers and get into it. I'm a unique entrepreneur where if someone is in joint Tech Lentino and they, you know, they're a lawyer, but they don't want to be. They want to be in like digital marketing. I'm not the kind of guy who's scared to hire someone like that just because it's not on their resume. So I think what's next is going from education to becoming a place that puts people on and start business developing with things that creates opportunity. So I'm Isabel Molloui and one of the hats I wear is as a professor at Georgia State University. And this is where we're calling you from. So it's incoming, right? You've been very transparent about how you feel about how you end in very colorful language. Yes. I've been a challenge. I love that. And so, but assume for a moment that we are working on a position that is in college and committed to continuing. So they've already made that decision. At our best, we're a community of practice with a captive audience that's willing to learn. So how do we leverage that time at the higher experience and our resources to help them develop their entrepreneurial skills, which is literally something that transcends discipline and that will be perhaps more useful long term than the actual craft that they're using in the moment. I love it. A couple of things. One, on the subject matter of higher ed, I actually am dramatically more, as you can imagine, when in context or clipped in a certain way, it seems that there's a certain point of view. I have an higher ed, but just so because I respect it so much, I want you to hear this. You know, obviously I'm 40. I actually turned 48 today is my birthday. When I grew up, every single kid in junior high and high school was told that if you do not go to college, you are a monumental failure in society. So a lot of the content I started creating 20 years ago was like, look, college is not for everyone. I'm one of those people. But boy, do I think college and higher ed and advanced even, you know, the highest levels of ed is exactly right for a lot of people. I genuinely believe that. My big passion is trying to make sure that people are self aware to your point. What I love about your question is, look, I believe where higher ed struggles for people that are looking to be an entrepreneurship is similar to the concept of reading about how to exercise versus exercising. And so what do I think you can do in this captive audience? We have to go to the field and do entrepreneur classes from your incredible institution to Babson to USC to all these places that have come and spoke. They must require these kids or people that are transitioning into new chapters in their life. They must require them to do. It's very, very hard to get good at swimming without swimming. It's very hard to get good at cooking by watching unlimited content about cooking and reading cooking books must cook. And if we're going to advance entrepreneurship, y'all need to create programs where the entire semester is actually being an entrepreneur. Hello. One more Gary. Happy birthday. Thanks for being here. I'm an executive with storage, distributed cloud storage and share of storage institute. My question for you is what excites you most about the future of technology and what scares you most about it? Great question. What scares me is that people are scared of it. We're incredibly good at demonizing technology. What excites me is it's the undefeated advancement of the human race. Everything we are today is based on people innovating in technology. 80% of us were on farms 150 years ago until we started inventing the tractor. So what I'm excited about is it's why the world continues to get better. We sit and listen. There are unlimited problems. Humans are flawed. But we continue to get better and better and better, even though it doesn't feel like that in social and traditional media. So technology is why our life extremencies and all these things are so much good about technology. What I fear about it is we're going to over demonize it because it's getting more powerful. And what I mean by that is of course I understand what AI means. It means it may commoditize something that is special. My entire life is based on my brain power. If everyone takes every video of me and everything I've ever put on the internet and put it into an AI learning bot, my special sauce gets commoditized. I'm not confused. I also know that I can adjust. I believe in the human spirit. And so I'm concerned that we continue to demonize technology to a point where we start to suppress it and manipulate it into something that doesn't have the potential to bring as much value. Ironically, it's similar to the last question. My issue with education is the way that we package and sell it, not the concept of education. There's nothing I believe in more than education. My most emotional, exciting answer in this entire interview was me staying up at night, educating and trying to be educated. So I think our relationship with technology is, you know this, we all know this. 15 years ago, all the tech stuff was clapped for and amazing and doing these positive things. Now it feels like it's all bad. AI is going to ruin the world. I'm not naive. Boy, am I practically optimistic. And so when parents are like these kids, they're on their phone and they're constantly on their phone, I look at them and say, so be a parent. Right? Like to coming to like, we like, like, what happened? Like all of us in this call, like we were parented. If my mom didn't want me watching TV, I wasn't watching TV. We need to focus on modern parenting issues, not on technology issues. I know that's right.
