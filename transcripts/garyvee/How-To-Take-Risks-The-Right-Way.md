From 22 to 30, every human on earth should live with four roommates in a shit hole and go for every dream they have as hard as humanly possible. Now, if you're gonna be that kid and you're gonna go for your dream, pay attention to this next part. Attention is the number one asset. But I know that you guys, some of you have questions for Gary. Oh hey brother, what's your name? My name's Abiyah. So you've run so many successful businesses. A lot of them have been, the single business that you've run have been successful enough to help you for your whole life. Yes. What gives you the ambition to jump from business to business when you know that one of the businesses is enough for you to keep going forever? What gives you that courage to go from one business to another business in community appeals? Because I view my business life as playing games. To your point, if I viewed my life from the framework of it being the financial needs I needed to live my life and my lifestyle, I'd be done already. I just don't, well, I don't want to do that. I don't want to ski. Like, I don't want to golf all day. I don't want to go to Saint-Tropez and be on a yacht and drink rosé. I don't like that. Except for maybe three days a year. I want to build businesses. It's the game, it's the challenge. I professionally navigate my day to day the way every person right now if they close their eyes and thought about what they like to do the most for a day. Whether it's ski, golf, yacht, cook, listen to music, watch movies, make music. Like, it is my favorite thing to do. It's why I got such poor grades. I was incapable to even get Cs because I couldn't give up every second of my nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 year old self to not try to sell trading cards in the back of the classroom or daydream about things I would do for my dad's liquor store. Couldn't even give them a minute. So it's who I am. Hi, Gary. I like to story like a mom being... A gangster. But also like the fact that you're investing in people and so many things going in the head right now. How do you become godless in business? And once you've got your funding from a investor, how do you not ambush? How do you get to start? What mistakes do people do once they've got their funding and they've to pop up? If you're talking about once you start a business that's funded by a VC, the mistake they do is they make every action to get the next round of funding. Oh, I see. Do not convince courage or lack of fear with insanity. Do not, right? Like to me, I have never done anything professionally. The first 12 years of my career, my dad paid me somewhere between $40,000 and $80,000 a year. I made very little money in the scheme of things to 34 years old. During that time, I almost bought nothing. I lived in a very uncomfortably humbly apartment. I saved money making $50,000 a year. When you think about things like losing your house, like when I say sell your home and then go live in an apartment so that you can buy yourself two years of coverage to go start something, that's about regret. That's different than having some random idea and maxing your credit cards out. Like there's frivolous and then there's strategic for your happiness. And so it's very nuanced and has to be important. This is also why I tell everybody in their 20s, if you're 20 to 30, you should be doing nothing but high risk behavior. This is how the world has everything backwards. We tell kids that at 22, it's time to get serious. And they should have everything figured out. And you must go get a practical job. They're gonna live to 100. That is insane. From 22 to 30, every human on earth should live with four roommates in a shit hole. Sorry. Sorry. By one dollar bad food and go for every dream they have as hard as humanly possible. Now, if you're gonna be that kid and you're gonna go for your dream, pay attention to this next part. And you're not allowed to ask your parents for money. Your parents should not be the funder of your dream. You should. Because if your parents are, you will become an entitled loser. But if you do it, you will actually have the behaviors that may lead you to accomplish it. But if you don't, you will feel so good at 28, 29, 30 when you decide to go do something practical that you actually tried. A lot of us in this room over 35, 40 didn't get this chance because the internet wasn't this internet. But the world we live in now, the most practical thing every 22 to 30 year old should do is to go for it. But that's different than like, hey, I have a three year old child. I've got this idea, it's gonna be the next Facebook. And you mortgage everything on this wild dream. There's too much delusion. That's very different than strategic, practical, happiness reset. So just wanna make sure we have that calibrated. We've got time for one more question. Hi Gary. How are you? I just wanna say thank you because you've really inspired me to be an entrepreneur, Johnny. Thank you brother. I'm a huge reason I started my company. So I started a company, we sell played with toothpicks. Yes. My first question is, if you think played with toothpicks is a good business idea. My second question. Why did you start it? Basically, we've seen like chewing gum, it's a huge market and for 100 years it's been no real alternatives. Yes. And chewing gum's like sort of plastic inside it. Yeah, of course. And it's great. Played toothpicks, we did toothpicks, we learned much more badass. Do you know how big the toothpick market is globally? Do you have any sense? I'm genuinely curious. No, I mean it's kind of like we have to create a market for ourselves. Yes, well from a flavored standpoint. But the overall, but you know, so let me tell you why I do like it. I believe that the world, that the past will tell you the future. So ironically, I asked you those questions because I was curious about how you were thinking about it. But ironically, you're gonna be very excited to hear this. I've actually looked at starting a toothpick business. I think she works together. You willing to give up 99% of your equity? You know, I looked at it about six or seven years ago because you know, there have been pockets in the last 100 years where toothpick culture was very high. And I actually think that there is room for it to get cool again. 100% I think it's gender-cultured. Can I get you to try one real quick? You sure can. Thank you so much. So, macho mint. How are you? I'm very good. I'm folk. Lovely to meet you. Pleasure. Thank you so much for doing this. What flavors do you have? So we have macho mint, pleasing peach, mindful matcha, and we just released two new flavors, mango madness and cosmic cola. How much is this? So we're currently selling them in triple packs. So we sell three packs for 12 bound. That means you're making real profit. Stop with that part in the video. Why are you telling them? We sell them online on the website. So we... Have you had any viral TikTok creative yet? Yes. Yes. So we actually launched back in April and we're at around 490K followers. So... What's the name of the company? Enforce and... So this is real feedback. Yes. So as someone who ironically genuinely does use toothpicks a lot often, the first thing that... So first of all, from a flavor standpoint, very good. Yeah, like I like it. Like it's... From a flavor standpoint, I'm happy. I like where you're focused on social. That's real. That goes back to the practical. You could do it at night and you could do things like... Many more people here can achieve things than they realize because of where social is. I think from a product standpoint, I'm surprised how quickly it's breaking on me because I chew... You know, like... Do you know that already? Yeah, I mean, we're constantly... Yeah, because of course, of course. So that would be my first quick observation that for the small group of people like myself who actually use toothpicks, it's breaking too fast. But the reality is most people, if it got hot, wouldn't know it because they wouldn't have context. But I do think that that's something to attack on. You're just getting through them faster and then order more. Yeah, exactly, fair enough. Yeah, because he's fair. I do feel gangster. I think it suits you. I think it suits you too. I think you could continue trying to show it. I actually genuinely think that this could become a thing the way fashion works, fashion circles. This was very big in the 50s and 60s. I think a lot of people do want to get out of bad habits. One of the things I'm incredibly concerned about is how accepted vape culture is for kids. Like, I don't know what we're all doing about this. It's a joke. We put all that work in to get them off cigarettes and now they're on this shit. And I have a very good feeling that in 20 years, everyone's like, oh no, everyone's dying from cancer from this. This is black and white to me. So I get excited about something like this, not only from the entrepreneurial journey. And I hope this works for you. But this is the kind of thing that I think could also get people that want to get off bad behavior. No, a lot of people have said that it's stopped them vaping. So it's been a really good thing. Good for you. Let's clap it up for them. Of course we'll clap. Thank you. Let's clap it up for them. Come up. Of course we'll clap. Thank you. Where are you fucking making these things? I mean, you've got a question for me. I have a question. Please. Hi. So I run a pasta brand agency. Mainly because you signed me to Suburban with pasta brand in 2018. So thanks very much. Of course. I think the biggest issue of an agency is you probably found a professional acutely than I have is scaling human capital. Yes. Stelling people as a product. Yes. How do you effectively scale that, keep good people? Without any obvious answers. I don't know if you guys agree with that. Without any obvious answers, how do you scale that human capital in a way that's sustainable to a point like the level that you are? Because the biggest issue I've had is you get great people in. They start through their career. We start up, then they breathe stealing. We can't think of anything anymore. Then we go on, all we bring people out in the shed. The thing that worked for us is we grew so fast that we didn't have ceilings at the same pace that most do. And then the other thing I did I don't need to rekindle it was I really went deep on the people. We're a 14-year-old company with 100 employees that have been there for over 10 years. That's insane. Especially in AdLand, you know, right? So the two things you need to focus on is spending so much time with the second. How many people do you have? I have two of my team. We can 10 now, 11. Yeah. Oh. You should have them all move in with you. Like, I would say this. I would say, and this is like obviously with them there, but this is like real talk, you have to go into your head and decide which of the 10 to 11, hopefully for you all 10 or 11, realistically the way the world actually works, four or five. Whoever the four to five you think are that you want to be with you in six years from today, you must completely change your behavior with them 10 night. You must genuinely actually know bullshit, treat them like family, ask them the questions that are scary for small companies. You know, I've been through it, which is like, what drives you? Because when they're like money and you don't have it, you're like, uh-oh, like, you know, but you have to have those combos. And on the other side, you must at all costs focus on business development to get more business in, because those dollars are feeding the oxygen for the retention because inevitably for so many of them, money is going to be one of the variables, right? But inevitably out of 10 of them, five of them are going to believe in you long term so much that they'll be able to invest too. Just like so many of the people that work for me that are 10 years and longer, they made very little money. We were a smaller company, but they believed so much in me and then they got rewarded on the other side of the rainbow and I'm proud of that and that builds that retention and you're gonna have to have those conversations. Yeah, I mean, I wanna say for the power of personal branding and Q and S, you were 100% in balance because of the violence in the Jeff-Jab-Jab right there. I'm proud of you. It's funny, the book that is coming next, next year, or this year, we're here now, I'm putting out day trading attention. It was originally called Jeff-Jab-Jab Left Hook. It's the update to that book because I got so much feedback. Like you're giving me now about that book that I decided to write the 2024 version. I'm really excited about it. And like, as you know, even in this short window, how to be great at social media content not only changes every year, it changes every month, it changes every week. And so thank you for saying that and I'm excited about the new book. Thank you. Gary. Yes. I'm very proud of you. For? You only throw a sword three times. Thank you. Thank you. Gary, thank you so much. Thank you. You have been absolutely incredible. I think everyone will agree, yeah? Yeah. Thank you. We appreciate you being here. Thank you so much. Here's Gary. I'm going to be very unapologetic. Yes. It's somebody's time. No worries. 2019, Wednesday the 20th. Do you know what you were doing? I do not. You was in Birmingham and you spoke and I was there and you told me to jump on TikTok. I uploaded that day and now I'm here. I uploaded that day and now it's my full-time job. So I just want to say thank you, appreciate you. And now I want to say can I get you on a piece of content? 100%. Okay, cool. So how's your general knowledge? My overall general knowledge? Solid. I'm very deep in stuff. I would say I'm solid in general knowledge. Okay, cool. So I've got two questions for you. Well, personally, how's your geography? Geography? Yeah. Solid. Right, we're in the UK. So how many countries are there in the UK? Four? Can you name them? Scotland, Wales, England. Ireland. Ireland. Ireland. You've got to help with the... All right, last one. Was four right? Yeah, yeah, it was four, yeah. Last one, last one, last one. Just repeat after me. Red. Red. Blue. Blue. Yellow. Yellow. What color's the grass? Green. I've already got a Gary Vee and I. I've already tricked him. No, no, no, you got it wrong. I believe you. Yeah, you know you got it wrong. No, repeat after me. Red. Red. Blue. Blue. Yellow. What color's the grass? What color's the grass? There we go, there we go. Thank you, Gary. Cheers. I appreciate you. Stay well. It's really refreshing hearing not swear. Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you, thank you for saying that. It could take a picture. Yes, of course. It's gonna be two. I got you. I got you. Thank you ladies. Cheers. Thank you so much. Of course, take care of yourself. Thanks so much. You're welcome, cheers. I really like what you were saying about kids and losing. I have to lose. They have to lose. We've completely missed this one. We're teaching them that losing's bad, then they become scared of it. I mean, I'm just so. It's just, it's so, like, I'm so empathetic to why we got there. It was well intended, but it is destroyed then. And I don't use that word lightly. It is destroyed. So many people in their late teens and early 20s in the world are just not in a great place because they think making a mistake or losing or failure is like death. And life is hard. You've gotta get used to it. It's true. I used to get the slipper. Yeah, of course. I mean, of course. I lived in a beef when I was 20, so you know. Yes, I know. I didn't know who you were before. I'm really inspired. Thank you. It's nice to meet you. You too. Take care. What do you look for in the CIS? You said about entrepreneurs. Yes. When you're an agent, what do you look for in them? You know, I just take the meeting, you know, and I listen to their logic and I ask them questions. Because I am one, it's not very complicated for me to understand it. It's like all of us. Whatever you really are, it's not hard for you to know your own. And so because I'm such an entrepreneur, if I spend 45 minutes of listening to you say, this is my business, I'm gonna have a good sense. Yeah. Yeah. I used to spend too much time paying attention to the idea. Yeah. Now I'm spending more time with your ability. It's kind of like the jockey and the horse. Yeah. I just spend too much time on the horse. I need to know if you know how to ride the horse. Yeah, yeah. How are you? I'm good, how are you? Good. Can I ask you a question? Please. So I'm an ace movementist community, so helping more people come together and feel less lonely and less isolated. And I'm finding that a lot of people say they wanna feel more connected and don't actually do the connected. Yes. And they don't take the opportunity. Is there any advice to get them more engaged? So in that scenario, I would go to the people that directly one-on-one that didn't show up and actually have a 20 minute conversation with them on why. Yeah. And then take the feedback of 30 or 40 people and see if you could find the insight. I believe it's because most people are either one of two things. One, they say it, but they don't mean it. Yeah. Like the world is filled with that. Two, they feel like they don't have time for it because they're so day to day in their small business, they want to come in network, but they think if they're out of their business for an hour, that it's a problem. Yeah. So they're either stuck micromanaging or they don't actually have the energy, the spirit or the intent by telling you that they want to, they feel they accomplished it. You know, like writing something on a vision board means nothing unless you do something about it. So, but the world has gotten very comfortable that by saying something or typing something that they've actually accomplished something. When that is very not true. So they'll tell you, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know? And then they feel like they did it without actually doing it. So it's one of those two. That's really helpful. Sure. Yeah. I'm glad I appreciate you so much. Thank you. I found you in 2014. Yes. Learn what you said. Yes. He did it in an accent. People paid me. And where I am. That's amazing. Do you remember John Fordwell? The billionaire named him. I set that up. I remember that. He didn't go with you in the end. No worries. No worries. Yes. You know what they're like. They don't get content. I understand. Let me do this. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. Appreciate it. Thank you. Sorry. No worries at all. Cheers. Good to see you. Thank you. Keep it up. Say, well. Hi. We can debase the bathroom. Yes. I'll do two for one. You both work in that West in the marketing team. So you always laugh your content. Thank you so much. We just wanted to, like, prime. Thank you. And it's so funny that when you talk about people who want to get out of their job. Go to work. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's like, how do you, like, differentiate the vision from, like, strategy from the frivolous and determine what is the best path? For yourself and what you should do? Yeah, it's like hard to know. It's like there's so many things you can do out there, right? It's like. Yeah, I think it's a great question. I think too many people chase the thing that they'll make the most that they think will make the most money. Yeah. And I always say, chase the thing that you like the most because then you'll work on it the most because you like it. Yeah. Which in the end actually gets you to the most. In the end actually gets you to the money. Yeah. So that's the mistake people make. They're trying to find the right trend or the right idea. Meanwhile, they go thrifting every weekend and they could make a million dollars a year thrifting and flipping on the internet. Yeah. So all the time houses these days, there's so many out there. There's so many. Thank you. You're welcome. I wish you well. Thank you. Just to advise, it's insurance, like more like a boring thing people don't want to talk about or want to hear about. So what kind of advice would you give if you put a message out there? If it's a topic that's more boring. Yeah, like insurance, if it's this. Make it more about you, make it more about the education. People are bored to your point about insurance until they need insurance. And so if you're consistent, then you're there. And all you have to do is give good information, good information and give stories. Tell stories of things that people did well and not well and you become valuable. Thank you very much. How are you? I'm good. The first thing that you do is take a pine. Yes. What's the second? So to the question you're really asking, the thing that I really do, and it may be, sometimes it's even before I grab the phone, it may be before I brush my teeth, but pretty quickly every morning, and actually often after I grab my phone, when I grab my phone, and nothing bad happened to anybody that I love, I really genuinely say to myself, thank God. Like I have a very, I pretty much on a daily basis have a single gratitude moment for it being another day where the things that I most fear didn't happen. You know? I think we, like it blows me away how much energy and time everyone here spends on what they don't have, what they want, what they need, and they don't take the time to be grateful for what they actually have. There are 845 million people right this second that don't have access to clean water. But with the addition of not to have gratitude, I think you can find it very hard to have gratitude. Yeah, gratitude is absolutely my fuel. I'm just grateful. So to the other, to like where I think you were going with the question, the one thing that I do mind, that might be a little unique. It's like just having one gratitude moment, like okay, just like, you know, like I got a lot of headaches and things, but like thank God this, you know? Cheers. Thank you so much. Cheers. Oh, butter. Just get a quick picture. Yes. Because I got one from Mr. Nessy. There you go, as again. How are you? Quick question. I built my business based on two, I think big passions of yours, employees and marketing. Yes. The recruitment and marketing agency. Good for you. And I'm really facing like trouble. People just believing in the power of recruitment, marketing and employer branding and to attract talent directly. Like what do you think that is? Like I've tried to ask them like, it's strange, right? It should work on paper. Who are you trying to sell that to or convince your story tell to? Ambitious SMEs. So founders of ambitious fans. I don't know whether it's just like this. You might just be going to too small and firm where they can't get over the financial hurdle. Sure. You might just want to level up a hair higher. And CEOs, talking to CEOs, the owners of the business. There's a big gap between a big CEO and like just bigger SMEs. Yeah, I was talking to HR teams. I think it's probably right up at level. Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Cheers. Cheers, thank you. Have a good trip. Stay well, happy holidays. You go. Thanks so much. You got it brother. Last one question I want to take it to your time. I know you spoke about accountability for our generation. Yes. But you're also big on taking risks when you're young. 100%. So I'm in my final year if you need to try to build a business along the side. And I'm just curious, I feel like I don't have a complete sense of direction right now because I'm big to step out. Of course you're a kid. That's fine. But I'm just wondering what your message is to people my age, right? Is it to take risks and go wild? 100%. Because you can do absolutely nothing right for the next eight years. And be so fucking young and have plenty of time to live a normal life that you have to take that. Accountability has nothing to do with taking risks. Accountability is after you took the risks and you failed not to blame your parents, not to blame me, not to blame the world, to blame yourself. The learning that comes from this. Correct. Got it? Thank you. Cheers. Oh yeah, sorry. You guys, we have like one minute so can we just rush the photos? You got it. Sorry, I forgot to ask you a question. It's quite straightforward I think. To be authentic self, we'll play the game or both. And why? To play your authentic self is the actual game. Okay. The game is a short term win. Okay. Authentic self is the long term win. It's a tortoise and a hare. I agree. That's great, thank you. You got it. You got it. Cheers, take care. Bye bye. Bye everyone, thank you. Bye, cheers. Cheers. Bye bye. Great to see you. Cheers. Cheers.
