You've been pushing a lot of organic social. Yes. Instead of paid. Yep. If someone has been doing organic for a while. Yep. And hasn't been seeing the best results from it. Then they're bad at it. That, but should they still consider doing paid at all? No, because if they're not good at making content, if they're gonna do paid, they're gonna make bad content that's, it's gonna cost them even more money because they're amplifying bad content. Like, you've gotta get good at the content. Any advice for people that aren't sure if their content's good or bad? What are you doing?" Everybody's saying that I lost my mind But I'm never ever giving up this time How do you prove out the value of a personal brand in building or boosting a business brand? Intuitively and anecdotally, we know it's invaluable and yet so many CEOs fail or refuse to invest in their personal brand. Based on what I just heard, whether this is an employee or somebody who's running an agency that does that work for people, you don't. I'm not in the business of convincing people. I just want everybody who's watching T with GaryVee right now this morning to know I don't give a fuck if you do anything about the stuff I talk about. When a CEO's like, Gary, I don't think this works. I'm like, that's nice. Like, what do you want from me? Of course it fucking works, you idiot. There's a billion examples of it. Like, but I'm not here to fucking convince you. I have conviction. I say this all the time. Have the conviction, don't convince. I think it's crazy not to build a personal brand, oh by the way, CEOs don't have to, like, do you know how many people have huge companies that don't have personal brands? I don't think the only way to win is to have a personal brand. I think it's one of the ways. Not tired and definitely not unhappy. The Knicks are playing for a huge game tonight. What I think you're responding to is the gray hairs are coming in, the European, you know, bags under the eye, like, good news, Granny, I'm fucking, I'm super pumped, but I appreciate the concern. I wanna make a point about how I'm building V-Friends. Just think about this scenario. The average five-year-old kid who's like, this snake is so cool. Now that's given the parent the ability to talk to that kid about what rational means. There's not any, wow, you know, parenting is hard. And it's gotten harder. And there's not a lot of things out there where kids think it's cool, that give a parent permission to teach lessons. And so, for me, like, that's what gets me hyped on something like this. This is the comic book. Oh, dang, oh, there you go. There we go. Here's the comic, right? And so, this now gets into origin stories. So, like, we're really building out this world. That is amazing. And so- It's not like, it's not like as an NFT is crazy too, you know? A lot of these NFT products back in the day, I was an incredible level. 99% bro, I'm sure you remember. I'm sure you remember, I was making all those videos saying, 99% go into zero, 99% go into zero, 99% go into zero. Cause cards can't be collectible unless people love the characters. 99% of cards are worthless, 99% of comic books are worthless. 99% of everything is worthless and collectible. I'm gonna say this as gangster as I can say it. I'm building a real fucking project in front of everyone's faces. And a lot of y'all know me like that. And you're still sleeping on what I'm doing with V-Friends. And I highly recommend you wake the fuck up. Hey boss man, if you're here, I need a box, bro. It's real. My man, I gotta run to my next meeting, but I just wanna thank you. Love you, bro. Stay well. There was a mom who came to the, you know, one of our meetings, we do these Zoom's with the Founders Farm and she started crying. And she said, for the first time in my life, I have given myself grace to realize that it's okay to work hard and slack a little as a mom because she felt that she was an awful mom and not performing at her best at her company. It's an events company. And the book helped her realize there is no balance. She needs to be, you know, kind to herself and just realize that she prioritized family and work. She can't do everything perfectly. Every day's a grind. And it was that imbalanced life that we captured that has given a lot of people a mirror to say, what I am doing is okay. And I'm building a life that I'll be able to sit back maybe later and enjoy some of the spoils, but my kids will be okay and the company will be okay. In fact, one of the most profound moments of my career happened on a speaking tour in Asia where I had like a VIP event after and it turned into me having to hang with like 2030, very successful people. So it was really fun, young. And this young woman said, we got into deep philosophical shit and this young woman said kind of like jam sessions. And this young woman said something that I will never forget to the day I die. She said that growing up, she really resented her mom because her mom was one of the five biggest judges in the Philippines or Singapore, I don't recall. And she said, she turned 20 and she had this moment of like clarity where she realized, yes, my mom missed recitals and stuff of that nature. She's like, but oh fuck, I'm in university with all these girls and I just realized something. My mom showed me how to live. She didn't tell me how to live. And I was hanging out with all these girls that had moms at home who told them what to do, but didn't show them what to do. And it crushed me to my core because what people don't tell each other enough is kids, you have three, I have two, kids are all different. And they're all gonna get different things. Me and my sister are pretty close in age. The way my sister and I view our childhood, what our parents did is different. It's different. It's different perspectives. And so whether you over-coddle, under-coddle, whether you stayed at home or went to work, the reality is you don't know how your kid's gonna perceive it. You might be doing a disservice in the thing that you think is servicing them. And it's a really interesting game. ["Mis and Mises and Misses"] Gary! And your ad is coming off of a tea with Gary Vee, number 75, that's crazy! Yep, did that. I've also done a podcast in two meetings since that. So it's a very active morning here. You mentioned when you have a high-performing piece of content to turn it into an ad. Curious if that's just boosting that, or if you're like saying, hey, the video was good, I will repurpose that and put a kind of different copy behind it. Number two. Okay, cool, so just use the content. And then for podcasting, curious on how... And not only different copy, like I would create a call to action alongside the video, at the end of the video, at the bottom of the video. Maybe you re-record the ending to make sure you have that call to action. Yeah, I wouldn't touch the first three seconds ever, because that had a lot to do with why it did well. But I would definitely change the copy and add a call to action for a sales conversion entity. Okay, awesome, love that. All right, gotta run team, great to see all of you. You're supposed to be able to slip them on and off without ever having to tie them. Stand up. That was interesting. Yeah, I would be a 10 and a half, but it didn't feel like so. And that'd give you an actual like half an inch too. Oh, I feel that. Yeah. It was a lovely. Yeah, it was a nice one. It was a nice one. It was a nice one. It was a nice one. It was a nice one. You're allowed to change what you're going for. Exactly. That earlier thing that I said, the people that want margaritas on the beach are the ones that don't get it. A lot of people on the other side said, you're wrong, Gary. My friend Don worked for 30 years, made a lot of money, retired and drank margaritas. That's not what I was saying. What I was saying is, if Don had wanted margaritas on the beach when he was in his 20s, like so many people want to do in retire, he would have never gotten there. Don wanted to hustle. And then Don at 59 was like, you know what? I'm good. By the way, I, you know, Dustin, I talk about it. I'm talking to Dustin, the guy behind the scenes here. I talk about this a lot, and I'm starting to believe it's gonna actually happen. I talk a lot about, do not underestimate one day me waking up and just telling the world, I'm good and I'm going into that phase. Yeah. I'm also equally say out loud all the time that it is 100% that I'm gonna die at my desk at 93. And let me tell you why. I know I have the capacity for both. I equally in my body have the ability to do this forever. But you know, look, back to my parents. When my parents pass, God, you know, it's gonna happen unfortunately. And please God, they should pass before me. That's the life cycle. I don't know how I'm gonna feel. You know, I might be affected by that given how close I am with that. Of course. I don't know what's gonna happen in the world. I don't know, losing my mom changed my life. Of course it did. Though it does. I think the most important chapter is in a human's journey. The death of your parents and the birth of your children. If those things happen in your life are the things. Everything else becomes incredibly secondary outside finding the love of your life. I mean, you're talking about like, there's levels to this game. So I guess what I wanna say on this part to everyone that's listening is you're allowed. Give yourself the grace to change your mind. You were going for money, good for you. You're allowed. But he's putting themselves in these boxes as if we've signed in blood of who am I? I'm fucking different tomorrow than yesterday. Life is in phases. Yeah. And truly, right? And that's the beauty for us as you start to live another decade, another decade. That truth becomes even more clear, right? Not totally. And by giving us grace to change our mind, we don't box ourselves in. But here's what I like. Please. Because once you decide on the phase that you're in, all we're saying is that be intentional, strategic about it. Because stop fighting what society thinks, what other people think. Decide that this is your phase. You wanna make money great. You wanna make impact great. You wanna grow your career and titles great. Whatever it is, you wanna balance whatever, drink margaritas. But just decide and start being intentional and strategic about it. And execute. That part. That part. Do a little wrap up for a daily V. Oh shit. I didn't even know we did a daily V today. So the question I had was, you've been pushing a lot of organic social. Yes. Instead of pay. Yep. If someone has been doing organic football. Yep. And hasn't been seeing the best results from that. Then they're bad at it. Bad, but should they still consider doing paid at all? No, because if they're not good at making content, if they're gonna do paid, they're gonna make bad content that's, it's gonna cost them even more money because they're amplifying bad content. Like you gotta get good at the content. Any advice for people that aren't sure if their content's good or bad? Or I mean, obviously it's bad, but like how to improve it. GaryVee.com slash attention. There's millions of other people besides me spitting knowledge on how to get views organically. Try to find different interesting ways, break patterns, fucking meditate, go on a trip. But most of all swallow a humility pill and realize you fucking suck at it, get better. See ya.
