There was an entrepreneur that bought 10,000 horses the day before Henry Ford's like, you know what? Right. That happened. We need to not be delusional. Correct. Technology is undefeated, and every time something comes up, it changes. I was in a restaurant in New Orleans, and three or four people were sitting at a table next to me in their 60s or 70s, and one of them was explaining to the others why they need to use chat GBT and not Google to search. This is going to happen fast. There's this notion around artificial intelligence and people faking it like they know what the hell they're doing. So most of the people that I'm on boards with are much older than I, less tech savvy than I, and their fear of disintermediation. Of course. And so there's this. That last part. But that's the thing. And so it's like, well, but nobody really wants to admit what they don't know. How do we actually move the needle to, like, actually, one, bring people's guard down so they can actually leave their trepidation of what they don't know and, like, just say, man, I don't know. And, like, where are you actually staying intelligent on this shit? The real answer to the question is good parenting. You basically just asked me, how do we tone down the insecurity and rev up the humility of people that have achieved success, often by posturing, being political or just the luck of the draw, besides all the elements of their own hard work and things of that nature. It's a huge challenge. One of the things that's been fascinating to me in the journey of my career is I started in such humble places. There was, and I wasn't around corporations until I was 35 years old, I didn't know anything but family business. Everything that we ever talked about was so practical. The first 15 years of my career, everything was so practical, like, marketing, which is my passion. My father, Sasha, cared how many bottles sold in a store. He didn't care if it would have won the award. All this stuff today. It's perfect that we're filming this today. He wouldn't give a shit about an ad meter. He wouldn't give a shit about USA Today's Top 5. He wouldn't care about the Twitter. Did it work itself. Right. He would be like, did we sell stuff? And did we sell stuff today? And can we feel that we've sold stuff tomorrow and things of that nature? With this conversation, because of Web 1, because of Web 2, and a lot of my career, when I started to understand corporations and what you're talking about, with Web 2, social. And then with Web 3, blockchain and crypto. And within them, as they were iterating, it became obvious to me, I'm like, oh, snap. Some of the most intelligent, powerful, best, most accomplished people I know, when the new thing comes, they peacock. And they don't know. It was shocking to me at first, because I was so naive. I didn't grow up at good academic structure. I just didn't see it until well into my life. And all of it was based on the stuff that I do know well, which is human behavior. It was always about insecurity and humility. So for everyone who's listening, when you are faking it, when you're a 57-year-old or 40-year-old or 12-year-old or 90-year-old, but let's talk about boards or executives, because that's what we're talking about here. Please know something. And this is literally for the creme de la creme that I know we're listening to this. When you're faking it, the smart 3% know. Absolutely. Let's talk about our industry, the people listening here. There are a lot of people that are wildly successful in our industry known. Absolutely. In the marketing hall of fame on the list, have big money, but are not as respected as they think they are. Correct. Because they are constantly bullshitting or building up their personal brand or things of that nature. By the way, everyone who's listening is allowed to live their life the way they're living it. I, in fact, even with, ironically, within the AI thing, because I've been so busy, you know me pretty well at this point. When the Web 3 thing happened, because I'd spent so much time on it, because I'd crossed every T&I, I was outrageously loud. You were. I'm not very loud about AI. AI's been red hot for a minute. For 15, 18 months now. You know this. I'm putting out unlimited content. People are not seeing a lot of AI content for me. They're seeing macro AI content more about fear. Like, they'll hear me say, people used to be scared to put electricity in their house because there was demons in it. Let's not do the same thing with AI. They'll see those things. But I'm not going deep into the modeling. I'm not going deep into my point of view about the news or the new app of this or what happened with Blue Sky. Or DeepSeek or that. DeepSeek and how quick. I'm not jumping hard on that because I know I'm stretched in right now working on different things. And I know where I'm at with AI. What I do do that I wish more people did is I'm in my journey of not being scared of it. I use it every day. That's it. That's it. I use it every day. I use many of them. The day I heard about Mid Journey, I used it. Let me see how to make a picture in a video. Absolutely. The day, perplexity. I'm doing it. I'm using it. But there's people within my own. Usually I pride myself of being the guy. Literally when I say the guy. In Vayner, I am genuinely in belief that I know how to do social media creative to maximize reach better than even my experts within my own company. Currently, there are many people because I've sent them to go do the work that are deeper in AI stuff than I am. And that's one. And that's OK. I'm on this platform. I said yes to doing this interview. Correct. And I have the confidence and humility and comfort of being like, hey, I'm just I'm only a couple steps into my journey. And I don't think I can go on a panel with same altman, even though I have the name status to be on one. The reason I'm saying no is because I'm not going to contribute well. And I don't want to go up there and just say a couple of fucking 50 words of just generic shit. Where am I? I understand that. Where am I? I'm meeting with startups last week to figure out how to win the SEM on AI bots. Because I know what happened with SEO. I was there when we went from yellow pages to search engines. That's right. I know search engines are in trouble. 100%. We all know. We're watching how we all work. Like I'm 49 years old. I'm in the business. But I got one for you better. At Super Bowl, I was in a restaurant in New Orleans. And four, three or four people were sitting at a table next to me in their 60s or 70s. And one of them was explaining to the others why they need to use chat GBT and not Google to search. Oh my god. This is going to happen fast. I mean, it's happening so fast, which is why people are saying, like, you've got to divorce your fear from it and to your point, admitting what you don't know, allowing people to actually educate you or your company, or just experimenting with it. Part of the issue that people have is that they're not testing it. Well, now you're going into my biggest issue in life. Let's get into it. My biggest issue in life is that most people are not practitioners. In fact, back to your former employer, I had a meeting in that office right across where a big dog within your company, she's no longer there as well, was starting to break down things for me. And I literally had to stop the meeting and say, you don't know the platform. You know how to make a lot of money for the platform. Correct. You do not know the platform. That's actually not how it works. And so, or how to get the best results, I know that you've been told as a sales individual what best practices are. That's wrong to the algo right now. So again, if anybody who's listening to this leaves with anything of value, download all of them and use the play with all of them, that is how you will have some level of context. And then when you're ready to go in, surround yourself with people that have actually done something. When the NFT thing was going on, one of the things that I would have a lot of conversations with companies and different things. And a lot of them would be like, oh, what about? But Gary, I heard this. And I'm like, yes. But I did this. And this is what happened. And what you heard, let me show you what they did and what happened. Like, I think a lot of this comes down to, A, do your own homework. That goes back to downloading the apps and playing. Do your own homework. B, pay very close attention to who you're listening to. Are they? And I live both of these lives. But the way I live the first one is one I'm most proud of. Are they a talking head? We know a few of those. Or have they lived that life? I'm a talking head that only talks about the things that I've lived. Well, you're a practitioner and an operator. And you're translating that to other individuals to bring them into this sort of conversation. There are many things I wish I was talking about. In fact, this, again, makes proof into putting. I wish I was deeper right this second because I would be so happy putting out more meaningful content around AI because it would be good for me, my business, my opportunities, and the audience. But again, I haven't had the luxury to go as deep as I want to. But it's a smart way of doing this. A lot of this is about making sure, one, you're testing and test and learn, test and learn, test and learn. But also, you're listening. And this is part of the challenge. That's the whole game. And you don't have a galvanized group of individuals. There isn't a community, a safe place, to be able to say, I don't know. Or tell me what you do know. And that's one of the things we've been interested in. That's why I love what you're doing. That's what we're trying to do. By the way, why do you think I said yes? I love you. I love Steven. I love you guys. But I also really know what you're doing is going to help a lot of my friends. And the community, at the end of the day, with some interesting insight, everybody's wondering, is this going to be evil? Is this going to disintermediate people? Some people are going to be obsolescent. There's obsolescence, if you will, as associated with this. 100%. Of course. But by the way, everything's done that. Absolutely. The car did that. Correct. Electricity did that. I didn't walk here. I see you know what I mean. And by the way, there was an entrepreneur that bought 10,000 horses the day before Henry Ford's like, you know what? That happened. Correct. No one's crying for the people. I don't hear anyone when they're like, hey, I was terrible. I didn't hear any of you when the leading salesperson for the Yellow Pages lost her bag. No. I didn't hear from you. When you guys, I don't hear from anybody when pop-up bagels comes and explodes and a local deli closes. Correct. Because they don't sell bagels anymore. I don't see the wah, wah. You just like your pop-up bagel. Correct. We need to not be delusional. Correct. Technology is undefeated. And every time something comes up, it changes shit. But there's a wait for it to coexist. I mean, I think about painting in the invention of the camera. It's another canvas in which to paint on. People still paint. It's always in. It's always in. And photography is a wonderful medium for self-expression. Both can coexist. Both can actually be in the same gallery. And you can appreciate both of them for what they are. I've been thinking about this for a while now. And I may go there. There is this obsession with the word ore when life is about it. I like that. And I've been thinking about the concept of the power of it. Make a quote you on that one. Please. I really, it's one that really is a big observation of my life. I think a lot about why did things work out for me. A lot of improbability to my circumstance. Not my macro circumstance of being a male. I mean my micro, the truth of my life. And a lot of it is the obsession of and over ore. And I see it in so many others. We are fixated on ore. We love black and white. Black and white makes people feel safe. It does. But life is gray as shit. It's so fucking new. It's why everyone's on tilt right now. Correct. It is not blue or red. It's always purple. And when you believe that it has to be blue and or red, you're fucked. And that's why everyone's anxious. And that's why the pendulum continues to swing. And that's why we canceled very effectively on the left. We're now canceling very effectively on the right. It's such a joke. That's the reason for our problems. That's not quite. Correct. Once you get to purple, and the problem is both sides are actually 100% wrong. Yes. Like if you're red or blue, if you're black or white, you're 100% wrong because it is purple and gray out here. And that's what's going to happen with AI. To leave with one last final point here. Absolutely. Just please go into maybe zone, everybody. I used ore. But maybe's act. Ironically, it's maybe that really triggers my success, the power of maybe. I don't say no, which is why so much good has happened for me. I would agree. But saying yes is also delusional how you lose as well. It's why maybe is so powerful. That is a fantastic way to end this interesting thoughts around this thing. I think the piece of this is also just got to be able to invest some time. Everybody has infinite amounts of time. And this is moving so fast. And how can you pontificate if you haven't put in the work? Correct. By the way, this was social. I would talk to CMOs for the last decade. They're talking about things. I'm like, you didn't do it. But think about all the conversations we've had at Cannes. It's like people running around, having these conversations. It's not real unless you've actually put it into practice, learned something, and likely failed at it. You're basically failing at all times until you're not. Correct. Life is just walking and eating. The way we all watch, I wish all of us could watch our videos or our first attempts of walking. It wasn't successful. It didn't work out. Eating was all over ourselves and in our hair. This is life. And it doesn't change from infant to where we are now. And I really, really, really encourage all of you, anyone who's listening right now, that is using this journey and consuming this content because you're in the camp of no AI, and going to fear right away. And listen, you and I care about this stuff. But everyone's like, the AI is going to be biased. I'm like, before you tell me about the world's problems, about race and gender, the world is always going to have that. Why is that where you have 100%? That's where you want immediately. It's very noble, but you know this. People are posturing to look good. Correct. They don't even fucking understand technology. They haven't used it yet. I was like, how about download one fucking app and use it? Be like, just how about that?
