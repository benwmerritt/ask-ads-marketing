You can't win if you don't like it because somebody else likes it and they're gonna outwork you. I did trade attention and build businesses. Legacy is greater than currency. I know it's your first New York Comic Con and this capacity is super exciting for the company. How you feeling right off the bat? This complete chaos which excites me to no end. All the energy is always gonna excite me. I'm an energy person and so the fact that so many people are gonna walk in and stumble into V-Friends and be like, what's V-Friends? What's V-Friends? What's V-Friends? That excites me. I think what you're gonna see from V-Friends over the next six to 12 months is more affirmation to the fact that this is a brand that has the ambitions to be at the highest levels. Let's go! First scissors shoot. Ah! Eat it kid! I met you at a garage sale last month. Yeah. If you remember. I'm actually here so I can buy another V-Fress. No kidding. You're gonna garage sale? Yeah. My man. Because of you. I thought I was there to buy another V-Fren. I did. I got a series one gift code and a series two gift code since then. So I just want to say thank you. Can't believe I met you man. Okay. I'm stuck here. I've been in a couple of weeks with no job man. I'm kind of like. Doing it. Taking it right now. Yeah definitely. But any advice? Don't be scared. Be patient. It's okay to live in the dirt to find happiness. You're young. You got time. Yeah. You know what I mean? So like people jump into shit too early because they're stressed. You got time. That's the answer. Appreciate that. Thanks for meeting me. Nice to meet you. It doesn't. Both clips of rock, paper, scissors. I'm going to put together. And then I want the whole thing to be like nobody on TikTok can be me and rock, paper, scissors. Let's play that out. It'll work. What do you see in the future for social media? You know it's funny. The reason I think I have a good track record and the way you set that up is I don't like predicting. I move fast when there's new stuff. I taste it. I watch it. I analyze it. And then there's a moment where I think it's crossed over intuitively. And that's when I get loud. I look at all technology that way. And on the flight out here, we were working on a new book ironically about where social media is right now. And I didn't realize I was on YouTube so early. YouTube came out in December 15th, 2005. One of my TV was February 21st, 2006. So within two months of YouTube being out, I had a long form show. And I think from that day to this day, I'm proud that I'm still in the dirt, in the trenches, in the streets. And I think I'll stay that way forever because that's the part that brings me the most joy. That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! All right, let's get into it. You know, maybe I had it right with my first book. My first book, subtitle of Crush, it was Cashing in on Your Passion. Maybe what was clear to me in my early 30s has become, again, very clear to me as I get closer to 50. I don't know how you can work hard enough to beat your competition if you don't like the thing you're doing. You can't win if you don't like it because somebody else likes it and they're gonna outwork you. It's not sustainable unless you love the fucking process. It's too hard to be an entrepreneur. I know it got cool. I'm a direct beneficiary of it becoming cool. But if I could wish anything for everybody in the stream as I look corner to corner, besides health, I would wish you self-awareness. There's a lot of people sitting in here wanting or are delusional that they're a great entrepreneur and what they really are is a great number two and a great number three. The number four at Facebook and Tesla made a lot more money than 99.9% of the number ones that started companies. Everybody's so focused on what they wish they could be that they're not paying attention to who they are. Hi, seriously. I call out today a school teacher that teaches entrepreneurship and finance to a group of kids paid probably 50 high scores that he teaches to come to this event. It's amazing. But where's that group of high schoolers? There you go. One piece of advice. If you gave one piece of advice at our high school, what would you tell the high schoolers? They literally are sitting there thinking they're getting close to having to have their shit figured out. Kids, I got a big one for you. You know how your parents and teachers are telling you like you gotta get fucking focused. You gotta figure out your shit. You're not gonna believe this. It's really fucking funny. None of them have their shit figured out. All right, let's take it. You guys can get it around the wall. Thank you. Thank you, San Diego. Thank you. The keynote koala. This token allows you to go to any keynote that I'm doing publicly in the world. You'll have ridiculously good seating and a minimum of a 10 minute green room session with me before I take the stage. Jam with my friend Michael Rubin and helping out on this all in challenge. I'm giving away a workout with me and Mike Vakanti. You're gonna be a guest of my podcast and I'm gonna fly you all paid plus one to three of my keynotes. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a special edition of the Money Mondays podcast. On the Money Mondays we're talking about three core topics. How to make money, how to invest money, and how to give away the charity. There is no better person to ask these types of questions to than the one, the only, Mr. Gary V. My guys. I hate when people invest in shit they don't understand because someone's smart told them. You know what I will say, for sure. And this is what my number one belief is, is that it's the cross section of something you like and something you understand. I'm pretty much stuck in between I'm working for a company and paying. So are you trying to do the art full time? The competition just gets me nervous. What the fuck do they have? Competition's fake. There's nobody beating you. There's nobody taking your paper. That's just your insecurity. V-Friends, this thing I'm trying to build. This whole comic con is competition and they're all further ahead than I am. None of them are stopping me from building V-Friends.
