Every single creative industry, VaynerMedia, Hollywood, Madison Avenue, is going to be massively affected by AI. I think I'm going to make feature films on a computer. Avicii sat in the middle of Europe on his computer and changed the world. So that's what's going to happen. Sorry, Hollywood. Sorry, VaynerMedia and other ad agencies. It's changing. You're in trouble. Sorry. Just like the Yellow Pages salesman was in trouble. Just like the bookstores were in trouble. Just like the taxi drivers were in trouble. The whole game's about to change. The end. One of your pieces of content really resonated with me. If you're going to your job Monday and aren't happy, what are you doing to change that? I've been applying to a bunch of positions, gotten the response. You're overqualified. Why are you looking to make a change from a lawyer? How many people have you asked? I try to send out at least 50 daily on LinkedIn and Twitter messages. I've even emailed you and AJ and Tyler and Craneck and Jeremy. And what are you looking to do in my company's world, for example? How AI could be really useful in the V-Friends and storytelling. And I have made it a little mini passion project of writing, going back to the OG days, writing little workplace warrior stories about how the different V-Friends could represent actual jobs and entrepreneurs, whether that be doctors, whatever, lawyers. Let me give you some insight. So for V-Friends, because so much work has been put on the Canon era and the origin stories, it's a timing thing. We're in a place right now where the creative team is so locked into what we're doing and it's mapping the next 36 months that the value doesn't come in new ideas. But on the AI part, if you're actually learning how to use AI and sent examples of how you created things using AI with the creative, that might give you a leg up. I think that's what I can speak for us. And I would say AI is a great place for you to go all in on because the next 24 months, everyone's going to be looking for AI, people, AI, knowledge, AI stuff. So what I would say to you is less ideas and more execution, I would get very deeply good at AI storytelling and then sending companies like us and others things you made so people can see it and then bang. Yeah, that's actually what I've been doing. I've been emailing the team stories that I've used AI as prompts. That's not going to be enough. I would say, again, because that's grounded in ideas. Notice what I said earlier, the ideas part is not the interesting part, only because we're stuck in this spot right now where we've spent two years in the last six months, especially setting up the next five years of Canon. So it's just a timing thing. It doesn't, for many people, that would be valuable. What we would be valuable, what we would be excited about would be creative output, like a three minute video taking what you know this, if you made a three minute video taking what was in the last comic book or the next comic book and creating content, that gets on my radar. I'd be remiss real quick before I left. I'd be remiss if I didn't ask for that big chinchilla plush. I'm always in there asking. I'd be remiss if I didn't bring it up. I've promised the crew that the chinchilla that's here stays, but I can confirm a little bit of alpha here. There has been an overwhelming response to that chinchilla, and there is significant momentum on us producing it and making it available. So more to come on that. Every single creative industry, VaynerMedia, Hollywood, Madison Avenue, is going to be massively affected by AI because you can make incredible visuals for far less money without ever leaving the comforts of your home. The whole game's about to change. The end. Like I think I'm going to make feature films on a computer. And by the way, that's how music's made now digitally in a way that a lot of people don't feel great about. But nobody in Hollywood cared about the music people when they were disrupted by Napster and by being able to Avicii sat in the fucking middle of Europe on his computer and change the world. So that's what's going to fucking happen. Sorry, Hollywood. Sorry, VaynerMedia and other ad agencies. Shit's changing. And so if you're not fucking adjusting, I'm spending an enormous amount of mind time and strategy on what we're going to do about it. And what we're going to do about it is we're going to become great at it. And so what you're going to the people that are creative and strategic are going to get most of the money, not the people that are lugging shit around the person that's holding lighting. If your job is to hold the light, if you're a light man or woman, right, there's people that do that. You're in charge of the lighting. You're in trouble. Sorry. Just like the yellow pages, salesman was in trouble. Just like the bookstores were in trouble. Just like the taxi drivers were in trouble. Just like the people that literally Pablo, do you understand on this little island that you're sitting on right now 110 years ago, a lot of people's job was to clean up horse shit. That was their job. We all got around on horses and horses shit. Pablo, do you know that horses shit? And the shit was on the street. And do you know that people got paid to clean up the shit? When we went to cars, what the fuck do you think happened? Do you understand when we went to the telephone instead of everything being a letter? People that were part of the letter business ink, paper, the delivery of letters. When we went to telephone shit changed. We didn't cry for the letter people. We just marveled at having letters like, yes, shit's going to change. So that's it, man. If you're in fucking Hollywood or Madison Avenue, start adjusting. The game's changing. Thank you studio for the raid. Let's do a big giveaway. We just had a big raid. Let me do this giveaway. Let's do this for all the sports fans. Either you like this and you're going to rock it because it's rad as shit, or you don't like it and you're going to get it for free and sell it for 40 bucks on eBay. Pretty good job. And I'm honest. I'm not complaining, but it's just, I don't know. I just, I don't, I don't enjoy this as much as I used to. Well, change. Change your job. If I like, I don't know, ways. It's just a really good thing. Just a really good thing job. And I don't know. So suck it up. And get, and get your joy elsewhere. Yeah. I know. I just, I get the, I've also just, I just reached out. I don't know, just the point where I just like, I got, I got, I said in the text, I said, I feel like I'm burnt out. I just, you know, I'm motivated. Well, then quit. You're a grown ass man, my man. Oh, this is called life. Ain't nobody going to fucking hear your complaining. That's going to be productive. You're, you're fucking strong. You're fucking capable. You're allowed to quit, try some other shit, fail at it, and then go get a job that's similar or the same job with your tail between your legs. And it's all good. That's not failure. Actually, that's strength. You quitting and trying to make yourself happier and then losing and then going back to a job. I admire that. What I don't admire is dwelling. Action, my guy. Either take the action of sucking it the fuck up, like we all do in many parts of our life. I don't do it in my job. I do it in other places and fucking get your joy elsewhere or have the courage to chase a dream and get the fuck out. And then don't be scared of losing, because if you lose in whatever the fuck your alternative is, you go back and get a job. That's called a real man. You're a real man. Big shout out to Bach Krug, I think. Bach Krug with the wind. It's so funny. Meowie says in the chat, brother, your 50s shut up. It's so funny. 50s, the people that should be, listen, should be talking. What's that? The one, the person that just won, the bar rushes, she works on the team. That's awesome. You know what I mean, Charlie? Yes, I do. So what do you think you want to do? What do you think you want to do? Honestly, I just, the job I have now is, I got really good at it in the, I've rose and I'm not a manager, but I'm like, I rose into the top of the lead, basically lead text company. Okay. And but I feel like I'm just working. This is just a repeated cycle, just working in nine to five. There's almost no freedom for me at all. Like there's no, there's tons of freedom nine to five. Do you work nine to five? Is that the actual hours? You know, you know, you know, you know what I think is happening? I think you're, you just might be too talented. You're not challenged enough. I think you secretly know you've got more in you and can do more, but you're scared of that. I think you're listening to conservative people too much. I think you're ready to jump and I think everyone around you is telling you not to, because you got a good situation. But I just think you're more talented than everybody that you're listening to. Think about this, everyone who's telling you to stay in your job and then you got me telling you to quit your job and go. Of those people who's more successful, me or your fucking relatives that are telling you to stay in the fucking job. Good. Always judge who's giving you advice. It's the number one rule in life. Judge the judges. All the people that are judging you judge them back. So when your auntie says, what are you talking about? You have a great paying job. Be like, auntie, I don't want your life. Charlie, who are you living for? You or someone else? I know the answers for me, but I don't know. I just I grew up in a home book where it was just me, my mother and my brother. And because I was like 11 years old. And my father left us and I had to step up and become support for my mother. Yeah, I get it, bro. I admire the shit out of you. Both my parents lost a parent. I was the financial foundation of my family as a young dude. I get it. Guess what? It's not your fault that you ended up being more talented than what you're doing right now. It's a blessing. You need to walk into your destiny. And if you fail, you brother, let me promise you one thing now that I've chopped it up with you a little bit. If you go fail at the thing that you're trying to do that's bigger than what you're doing now, what you're doing now will take you back in open arms, whether this company or something like this company. Let me promise you that, my fucking guy. Bro, you're fucking bored. No shit. You're fucking bored, my dude. You're too talented for what the fuck you're doing. Quit and do something bigger. And if you lose, go back to this. At least you knew you tried. You won't regret. Go jump, bro. You're bigger than your job. You're going to do better. And don't worry about everybody who booze you and tell your mom or your brother or somebody, anybody else that says, what the fuck are you doing? Gary Vee's wrong. Tell them from Gary Vee. Fuck you. We just started a podcast talking about like our bond as twins and no one can really understand that. So how can we kind of like ban cast and get it out there? We're probably on episode like 20 to 30. We have someone like producing it for us and everything like that. But we're just trying to grow it like as quick as we can and get as many like twin guests on and you know, share all of our interesting information that not many people know about twins. So I think one issue is that you said the word quick. Okay. That is killing kids. Yeah. Like all of you want it too fast. Victoria Anna, I worked in a liquor store from 22 to 34. Quick was the tell. No, I get that. Quick was the tell in your question. Yeah. You know my answer is going to be you already know what my answer is going to be if you're on this show. You need to make a fuckload of social media content to bring awareness to your podcast. Yeah, we did the video for like the a to z thing through all of our contacts. I love that. I love that. But how much content are you putting out on social every day? At least once a day. Good. Like religiously, at least once a day. Which platform? TikTok, Instagram and then our YouTubes are like a little bit of the shorts and then like obviously our podcast. And what about Twitter and what about Facebook? Facebook and Twitter now. I want you to add that. Okay. I want you to post what you're posting on TikTok on Snapchat spotlight. Okay. I want you to post two times a day on all those platforms. Got it. And I want you to close all four of your eyes and wake up in five years after doing it and then judge if it's working or not. I'm currently unemployed, took a chance on making more money in the state of Minnesota. I left my cook job and also my family back in Texas for a chance to give them a better life. I've been here a week already and I feel homesick. Did I make a mistake and better yet, how have you handled transition periods in your life? It sounds like he's just starting. I've handled transition periods by not judging transition periods in the first week. I judged transition periods in multiple years, not in multiple days. So I would say that I handle it by deploying patients. And I don't think he's made a mistake. I think he's jumping too quick. My life kind of got flipped upside down a few months ago, going through separation right now, three kids. And I currently work full-time job at an ad agency in New York City remote. But I'm also building out my own agency. I've been doing it for the last six years. And I guess my question is right now, I'm in a tough spot because I'm going through custody situations. But while I want more time with my kids, I need my full-time job isn't enough to support financially. So I do need extra, which is no problem. I've been working seven days a week all day for years. Like I have no problem putting in the work. But it's getting to the point where it's a hard decision. Where do I fight for more time with my kids now and work my face off and figure it out financially? Or do I agree to the minimal time now and build it up and then fight for more time with them later? I know it's like not not like for legal advice or anything. No, I understand. Like, listen, I have a lot of compassion and empathy for you. This is obviously a challenging chapter in your life. Here's the good news. First, I think you can find some solace in this. I really am fascinated by kids and parents and all that stuff. I spent a lot of time on it in the last 20 years. First and foremost, just please focus deeply, deeply that your children know that you love them and you're always there for them. You're lucky. We live in a world where FaceTime and all this other stuff, you know, as you can imagine, there's no quote unquote right answer. I think that the struggle between financial realities and family realities is very real. And even for people that are not in a divorce and custody situation, people struggle with this. I would say focus on a couple of things. One, realizing the only right answer is that those children know that their dad is there for them constantly and always in any situation and that you love the living shit out of them. That is the only right answer. Right? You know, look, I think you want to you want to you definitely want to fight for as much time as you personally think you can go for. Meaning I think there's potentially an in between from the way you structured it. There's probably an in between from the most minimum amount of time with them. But also an in between from like you leaving a little bit on the table from the work stuff and the kids stuff. So it's kind of finding purple instead of red or blue. Right? Instead of it being black or white, fight the gray. So whatever you're feeling right now, whatever the bare minimum is, like 20 to 50 percent more than that, based on your situation is probably quote unquote a good place to target try to target. And then in the time that you're not with them, that you're upset that you can't be 50 50 or as much as possible over indexing on them, feeling your presence. And here's a big one dominating when you're actually with them. Right? Like like being exactly and honestly not beating yourself up. Here's what will happen. There'll be a time where you're with them and works on fire and there's a problem where there's some other problem where you're not in your best self because you had a tough day or a tough argument with their mom or who knows. Right? If you have a bad weekend or a bad like time with them, like you didn't feel as present as you want it to be, not beating yourself up and knowing you have the next time with them to make up for it. I appreciate that. Yeah. You understand? Being kind to yourself. Yeah, I really appreciate it man. That helps a lot and just appreciate everything you do. You've been a big help for me and a beacon for years man. Just really appreciate it. I'm really cheering for you and brother. There's some real light and gold at the end of this tunnel. I promise you as tough as this is in context, there'll be a lot of good things that come out of this even though this is painful. And I really believe you're going to get to the other side in a good way brother. Thank you. I feel it and I can see myself. Thank you. You're welcome brother. Take care. By realizing that if you don't, it's probably not going to go well. And so really this becomes a game of knowing you have no choice and not again similar to the gentleman before. Here's my number one thing right now that I'm hot on is being your number one fan versus being your number one critic. Like when she says that it's likely her next four job interviews are not going to go well. She has it in her. Right? Like for example, again, I'm bringing up yesterday, like for all the people that were watching basketball yesterday, when I lose my chemicals go weird. I know that like me just like leaving the game and not doing the Astro shirt, that was not like the right thing. But I'm not going to sit today and be like, I'm a piece of shit, even though like some of the feedfront's communities like that was fucked up, Gary. You know what I mean? Like, you know, I had a bad moment and everyone's allowed to. And so like she's allowed to have shitty interviews. And the more she's not upset at herself for the next shitty interview, the more likely her next interview will be good. Right? Like I need people to really understand this. How does she address this? Is when I do my most pressure, I gave an NYU commencement speech, as you know, most a lot of people saw that video. I did not prep for it at all. And right before I went on to go, man, is this the right thing not to prep for even though I never prep? And I'm sitting there and I'm like, this could go really bad. Or this could go well. But the reason it went so well, I believe, is because if I fucking bombed and it was terrible, I'd be fine. And again, I think the thing that's fucking up so many people right now is they're not their number one fan. You got to be your number one fan. You can't beat yourself up. Like for example, I'm looking at all these people on TikTok and Instagram right now, right? Grego, Jacko, Samachi, Wolf Tang, High Chase Gray. I need all of them to be on one knot. I need them all to be on one knot. I hate them all right now. I'm angry at everybody on all my socials that have not come over here. But they shouldn't be mad. They shouldn't be sad that I am mad at them. They need to be insular. They need to be insular. You must be insular. What's her name again? Hannah. Hannah, you the way that you can deliver on big moments is by already deciding that you lost the one place in my life personally and professionally, emotionally, everything in my life, I decided already lost. V friends failed. Vayner failed. I failed. I've decided it. I have felt the feelings. The only place in my life that I have decided I haven't lost yet is when I compete in sports. You guys have seen me when things don't go well. I'm like easy, easy big shit lost $10 million account. Not a vet. Not a vent. Lose a stinking pickup game last night. Four games to love. Dead. Dead. I have three about to be four rental properties and I'm working on a flip with some partners. I don't want to get another full-time job. I want to do full-time real estate on my own, do my own thing. Love it. I just don't know what exactly that means and what I can do that. It sounds like you're doing that. A little bit. The issue is I don't have what I had in the office and take up 40 hours of my week. You know, I can do it in five to 10 and I still want to do more. I just don't know what that is. Why don't you do more of what you're doing? Well, I guess some of it is a money thing. To buy the rentals, I have to have a little bit of money so I'm trying to figure out where to find the income to do that. Makes sense. Well, what about getting a job that is more in line with what you're interested in? So one of the things I think about is when you're a young kid like you wanting to get into a business, there's a ton of shit you don't know about this business. Right. Even if you got an entry-level job at a company that does what you do at way bigger scale, you'll be learning there. You see where I'm going? For sure. Yeah. Absolutely. So one of the options for you and everybody who's listening is to take jobs in companies that do what you're wanting to do to do it at a much bigger scale. Right? And so because you'll learn. And so I think one of the options for you, brother, is to go and get a job at a real estate company that does what you're doing at a much bigger level so that you can learn while you're there for a little while. I see. You see where I'm going? I got you. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I have thought about that before. I guess the job market is a hard thing to get into one of those things. Yeah. But again, if you decide to do it smaller, again, it sounds like you want to do this entrepreneurial thing. Absolutely. Are you willing to live humbly in this part of your early life? I do now. I live in, me and my wife live in a one-room apartment that's part of one of the houses we are renting. Smart. To the teacher, all our expenses are covered. So I can kind of take this time to do whatever. I can try to build something, be a realtor or something like that. Bro, you could also be the assistant or the greeter in a company that does what you want to do at a larger scale and get paid minimum wage. Right. You see where I'm going? Like the job market's hard when you try to get jobs that are bigger than you. You know how many people are doing that right now? Everyone's like, the job market's hard. I dig in and double click and I look and the person's trying to get a job that is way overqualified for them. The job market's hard when you don't have humility. But I'm for sure a believer that you could get an entry-level job in a real estate firm that does flipping at scale. Right. You see where I'm going? Ty? Yeah, absolutely. That. Absolutely. That. And if that's not it, get a job at a marketing firm that does personal branding as an assistant or a greeter or an entry-level employee so that you can learn how to do content and marketing so you can use content and marketing for yourself to get deals and opportunities. I see. You see where I'm going? Go work at somewhere that will teach you a skill that you want for yourself based on what you want to do, even if it's an entry-level job. I work as a plant manager for a small family-owned manufacturing company. We have a maintenance technician that reports directly to me. He recently went through a workers' comp case and has created quite the headache for our HR department, lowering up and threatening legal action. His work ethic and skills are phenomenal and I don't want to lose him, but he has been a very emotional, dramatic employee. As a knowner, would you allow someone like this to stay? When someone justifies bad behavior, and by the way, I don't know if this lowering up, like that employee might be right. So on the record, I have no idea if he's right. I'm not worried about the lowering up. I'm worried about the way the question was asked. So many people look the other way on employees that are emotional issues, distractions, cancers, bring negativity, cause problems, fuck the machine up because they're good at their job. It is a massive mistake. Now, you want to give effort and you want to try to build that person up. You want to explain to them that. You want to mentor them. You don't want to just like first time. There's three strikes in baseball. In life, you got to give people more grace than one. But when there's consistency in that, emotional shortcomings in the workplace are often mapped with emotional shortcomings outside the workplace. And they're hard to change sometimes. And people do grow up. People do become more accountable. People do get better. People get less insecure, less territorial. But I never have ever kept anybody in a company because of their skill set. I've kept them in the company because I felt like we could give them one more chance. I root for them. That's fine. But justifying keeping someone in the company because they're good at their job when they are an issue to the system is why the most talented sports teams don't win championships. I've been on a roller coaster since I lost my mom five years ago. She was my friend and number one supporter. Now I'm being pressured by family to work a 40 hour a week job that I don't like doing. I know my flaws are that I give up easily, but I'm really trying to finish school and figure out what to do. Any advice on keeping up my motivation, not giving up or knowing what I really love to do? This is a little tough because when I hear that especially with all due respect to the devastation of losing a parent, when I hear the other family members pushing for a 40-year-old job and I hear I do give up and all that stuff, what I'm concerned about is that mom was the enabler. And that's tough to say because mom's not with us. And like I struggle, I struggled. I think everybody knows I go pretty candorous here. On the record, that was hard to say out loud. That was a challenge for me, but I really want this person to be accountable and ask themselves. A lot of people think your biggest supporter is a supporter, but the actual reality is that your biggest supporter oftentimes is your biggest enabler, not supporter. A supporter is going to hold you accountable. I would say that you never want to give up on dreams and passion, but that line in the question of like, I know I give up easy and like the moms and dads are almost always the enablers. And it's so tough. There's such a fine line between being an enabler and being a supporter, but that's what I would ask this person to be self-reflective and find out. You know, finishing school sounds like that's been dragging on. Sounds like the person doesn't want to do anything. You know what I mean? Worried about that.
