And the big organic reach right now is on LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Instagram is hard. If you're posting on Instagram, it is hard. Too much supply against the demand. So much of the young demand went to TikTok. More content was made on Instagram yesterday than ever before. But the audience has fragmented more than it was pre-TikTok. Attention is the number one asset. Hi, hi, hi. Good to see you, bro. Good to see you, good to see you. Hi, hi. 37 joining here. We have what, 20 hawks at the end of the site? Yep. Caw, caw. Yeah, that's a caw, caw. Yeah. This is amazing. First of all, let me focus on everybody in the Zoom since I've got everybody in the room. Everybody, it's great to see you. Hope everybody's super well. Thank you all, many of you for the birthday wishes. And I'm excited about this. This should be a lot of fun for all of you in here. It's also on the big screen as well. So get it when people from the Zoom ask questions that you're going to bring them up, or you're going to bring them all up on the grid, or you're going to bring everyone. Yeah, that's what I want to do. Please do that. Please. Hangout Hoc 11. We're going to first start with Seidel. Seidel, thanks for joining us. Go ahead and click on the mute. Welcome to Hangout Hoc Session 11. Your question number one, man. Well, thanks for having me, y'all. It's great to see you guys. So my name's Seidel Jirudel, and I'm currently developing a social trading platform. So we're live in the app store. We're venture bagged, USB, Dragonfly. And we're doing really, really good with the Web3 audience. But we're trying to figure out how to bring some of that magic of collecting cards, trading them, staking them, playing them to the Web2 masses. So we're trying to figure out how we can position ourselves in a way that appeals to Web2 people that don't necessarily understand those concepts of staking, ownership, and creators, et cetera. So, Gary, I just wanted to know what you thought about that. Yeah, Seidel, thank you for that. Yep. Listen, a couple things. This year with Hangout Hawks, I'm really focused. I said this to Daniel. I want to really deliver on the energy of the purpose of the token, which is really do business one-on-one and personal one-on-one. Obviously, a lot of the last couple years is like, what are you going to do with the Hawks? Or what's happening after the Hawks? And by the way, I'm thrilled to do that. But Daniel and I can do that ad-hawk as well. We can do that at the end as well. Just to start off, I really want to actually deliver on what I want to do with this question. So for example, no matter what anyone's doing here, this answer is going to work. And I want you to all hear it whatever journey you're on. First, you can't hope for consumer reality. This is very important to understand. You can't hope for what the consumer does. You need to understand what the consumer does and make it for them. So, brother, to answer your question, when I launched an e-commerce website in 1996, I knew it was going to be a while before all of you would buy everything on the internet. Of course, I wanted people to buy wine sooner, but people made fun of me and said, why would I buy wine on the internet? I'll just go to the store. That was 90% of what people told me. I'll just go to the store. So you can imagine, people understaking, there's web two and web three don't exist. They're just humans. What I mean by that is, I know how we all define them, but people that play games, gomagachi or whatever that thing was, that was staking. Your egg was brewing the longer you held. People understand the principles. It depends on how much friction you have for people to do the thing. And then, more importantly, for everyone here, how good are you at getting people to know about the thing? So if you think about this, think about how many people we onboarded with WeFriends onto Ethereum. That required marketing. We did lessons. We made content. We did blog posts. For a lot of you, we were that person for you. For a lot of you. And for a lot of people, we all know it. Like, you know, and so, you know, I think what you need to do is focus on two things, brother. One, is it just understandable? And is there any friction in how you're doing it tactically? You know, I mentioned something on the fanatic stream that some of you might have watched. We're even thinking about, like, there's so many people right now asking how to buy a V-Friend, who even when we send them all the stuff we have, just don't want to create a MetaMask. But they're ready right now to buy like a $20,000 V-Friend. So as you can imagine, I'm like, this sucks. Like, we need the bigger dissapear. What a different kind of marketplace. Go figure, right? So like, what we, A, you gotta think about your friction. Right? When I launched WineLibrary.com, the friction was people didn't even have email. Like, that's where I was sending them their receipt. They were like, what's email? Like, but this one makes sense to a lot of you because some of you know that AI's out there, but some, many people in this room have not really spent an hour playing with chat GPT yet. You know it's there, but you haven't. Like, and that's how 97 was. They heard about the World Wide Web, but they didn't bought anything on it yet. And you have unlimited friends who have not bought an NFT using blockchain technology, right? So two things. One, are you creating friction for them? Two, is it understandable? And then three, most of all, which is universal for everyone here is, you've got to know how to storytell at scale. Where do you put out your content? Do you have a podcast? Do you have a vlog? What do you do on Instagram? And the world lives on these devices. And you've gotta be able to storytell. So you have to create demand through creative, whether that's paid advertising or organic, preferably organic, because that's the world we now live in, right? Like it's super cool for all of us entrepreneurs. You don't have to pay unlimited ads. If you are the best in the world at TikTok right now, if you are, you will get unlimited people to know about everything you want. So that's the, I think the web two world just means consumers. You know what I mean, brother? Like you're just talking about consumers. So I think it's about, you have a marketing question. You know, it's a marketing question. I agree. I really think it comes down for us the storytelling. We've tried to reduce the fiction by getting the app store completely removing that amount of all that. That's huge. To your point, like narrowing down that storytelling. Notice where I went with it. Cause once I heard you say that, I'm like, okay, he's already got over that hump. People do know how to download an app. Oh, by the way, when the iPhone came out day one, like that was the friction. Like, you know, Twitter was desktop when I started on it. There was no app, you know? And so like that was the friction. And that's why huge companies were built. Uber and Instacard and because that was the friction. So yeah, it's a marketing story for you, brother. You got it. And the big organic reach right now is on LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts and TikTok. Instagram is hard. If you're posting on Instagram, it is hard. Too much supply against the demand. So much of the young demand went to TikTok. More content was made on Instagram yesterday than ever before. But the audience is fragmented more than it was pre-TikTok. Things like that. Or is your audience even there? If you're selling B2B SaaS products, LinkedIn's better than Snap. Some of those things as well that we have to think through. Awesome. Gonna hand the mic over to Bryce. Bryce, thank you for joining. Just make sure to click on mute when you're good to go. Awesome. Thanks guys. Gary, thank you for your time. Always. You spent time with us, brother. Are you kidding me? I'm pumped to be with all of you. Quick background. I am a first marketing hire for a 75 plus year old building products distributor. And I have a million and one different angles that I can play. I've spent the first year and a half building out infrastructure like brand guidelines, new website, first ever CRM for the company. Tons of big projects. Two part kind of question. One, how do you... Oh, you wanna mute, you get mute by accident. Something happened. How do I? Sorry about that. No worries. Kind of a two part question here. One, how do you view or create overall marketing strategies on the one person department right now? Who are you trying to reach in this company by the way? Is it a B2B business? Yeah, we primarily work with contractors, GCs, building professionals remodelers. Right. So... Are you... Bryce, did you go to school for marketing? No, I'll self-taught. But through, I'll tell you why I asked. The brand guidelines that you're going about it very academic, which doesn't bother me. That wasn't like a RAS even though I was an F student, everybody knows it. I'm just trying to get your framework. Like... They had no consistency as far as branding, colors, logos, any of that stuff. Why didn't you gravitate towards that? Is actually my question. You need to rally behind something out in the public, right? There needs to be a visual identity that people associate with your brand, right? But you're a beat, you're not Nike. You had the win on relevance more than brand positioning. I spend a ton of time on it. I put that together, it's like a one-sheeter basically. If that's what you're asking. It's more about the first year, how long have you been in? About a year and a half. So those were just some of the key initiatives. I mean, the CRM was a huge thing integrating that with our ERP software. For sure. And we're working our IT department on that. Yep. I mean, I had a website by myself and completely transferring that over. I just got first phase involved with that. I have seven, eight phases, 75 plus pages yet to build out for that and a content and SEO strategy. I'm trying to figure out from a holistic picture, ramping up content by myself. I didn't even have a functioning website to send them to. Of course. So I had to get some of those pieces put in the book. Of course, of course. Overall picture, how would you approach that? And then tactically as a one-man department, how do I kind of take the biggest and best bite out of that apple? So I assume the organization is a sales organization. Right? And so who are these individual contractors? So we were distributed. So yeah, we're working with individual contractors and contracting businesses, roofers, siders, citing contractors, et cetera. And you're selling direct to them through the website or no? We don't have an e-commerce aspect yet. Right. So the website is informational that leads to the phone call or the inquiry. It's the lead gen sales engine. Yep, for now. So a couple things. First of all, where if anywhere is the content studio in the world? And here's what I mean. Not a studio. You're delivering goods after they phone call you to them, right? And then they are working, right? They're doing their thing. The first thing I would do is play on people's ego. I would create a program for contractors that are like the gold standard contractors. That you are anointing as a wholesaler, these 12 to 20 guys and gals as epic at their craft. By being chosen into the gold standard circle of our distributor, we think you're the best contractors. We are gonna come with our iPhones, AKA I, Bryce, I'm gonna come with my iPhone. And we're gonna actually film you on job. And we're going to give you that content and we're gonna use that content. So what you, the way you're gonna create besides SEL, which is absolutely gonna be a monster for you and you've called that out. If you're talking about the question directly that you're asking me, it is pretty crazy how much you can get out of LinkedIn and YouTube shorts because of search engine on YouTube and because of the way LinkedIn targeting works against contractors that thinks of that nature. But you need content. I think your content studio is you picking 12 or 20 customers and flattering them that you think they're good and going and filming them for the day so that you can then post produce it for your content. Solid. So from an overall standpoint, figure out getting that whole content engine up and running. Content engine is every single question that every single person's about to ask me is content engine at the lowest cost possible? It's the answer. Now there's a lot of answers after that. Fine, now you filmed it. Now what? Like do you know how to do a thumbnail the first three seconds? Do you understand a LinkedIn carousel is PDF versus the, do you understand Facebook? Facebook groups, like do you understand your content should send to a Facebook group because you can create virality within it that then sends to your website? Like there's a lot more, but like anything in life. Like where the, what's the feet? You know, I don't know if you know this, but your back issues are really your feet. Your breasts. Right? Yep. It's a brain fuck, but it makes so much sense. It's your feet. And so just like that, like just like I talk a lot about parenting, that's pretty foundational, right? Like so yes, notice what I did and I did it and went in detail because it's a unique answer to your question, but it might have sparked stuff for people in here. Thinking about making content for this business, like fuck, studio, I gotta hire three D-Rocks. Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da. Here's a way to do it for free. We're gonna flatter the people who already buy from us, make them part of this special club. And what we're gonna do is go and we're gonna bring value. We're gonna film. Oh, by the way, the iPhone is more powerful than the camera D-Rock. The iPhone today is more powerful than the camera that D-Rock used starting to film me. Right, so that's another low cost, go film. And so yeah, that's exactly right, brother. I'm trying to figure out how to, and by the way, there's so much wild shit. Literally you doing fulfillment in your warehouse, filming that, and if you really know how to ASMR that stuff and do some other wild stuff, they're just wild shit that none of us would believe in a million years would work as business development or marketing that works. There's somebody in your warehouse named Carl that's been there for 29 years, who if you just filmed every day is actually famous and will drive your whole business. So it's thinking about these angles that you haven't thought about before that drive down your cost of creative at scale. Filming yourself every day writing a book becomes the marketing of the book. I filmed me drawing every single V-Friend. I got it, it's there. I've read a documentary one day, hopefully, in the snap, but I can use it for marketing right now. Like, that'd be a good post for us, right? Just watch me draw Hangout Rock. Like, I don't know, like so, that's what I'm thinking about a lot. So as the only person in the marketing department focusing only on content, don't worry about the balance of everything else that has to be taken care of. Just try my best to allocate as much time as possible to that. I think it's a mix, brother. I think the way, to your point, like, you know, you can build on something that I said that I felt that was fairly smart and you might get smarter than me. You might be like, wait a minute, I'm just gonna ask them to film and we're gonna showcase them. Now all of a sudden, they're doing everything. You're just giving them the cosine, right? So like, no worries. No, no, but what's good about Hangout Rock and what I really wanna do this year is like, I wanna go deep, like, I need, my dream of this was that one thing was said to you that you took, like, these are things that everyone can comp on. Like, I'm a restaurant, I need marketing. I'm like, film the kitchen 24 hours a day instead of having a day when you do content. Especially for the mix, you wanna go there. 100%. If there's a story there. But again, if I go for the Jaclyn there, he's gonna run a question for the Hawks that are in the conference room, go for it, Jaclyn. Yeah, just, you guys wanna raise your hand, we'll be in person. I saw it. Cool. You're here for, you wanna ask a question? Sure, so. By the way, I know you guys and gals know each other pretty well, but not everyone knows everyone. So once again, name and like what you do a little bit, that's good for all of you. Oh, we all know. Yeah, fair enough. But some of the people are good. I know, I know, I know. Fair enough, fine. Listen, if you feel good about it, go ahead. Go ahead, Mike. You don't need to. I'm Anthony Masucci, hi Anthony on all the socials. Like, friendly Anthony, not this kind of Anthony. Anthony Zero. Anthony, exactly. Oh, by the way, I had a meeting today that was a guy I met at Beacon and through Hawks, it's a long story, the short story is something great's gonna happen basically because of you guys. No, because of you guys, like us, it, friends. Networking, being out, hanging out, Hawks. It's the best. Just throwing that out there. When it's at right, it's the best. Go ahead, brother. So I know we're all excited for your new book. Yes. I'm writing a book and I wanted to ask you two things. What, like how much, where did you have the most fun writing the book for you personally? Where was that? And the other thing was how important it is to have the audience before the book or does the audience come later or et cetera? I'll answer the second one, both happen, right? There's people that build big platforms, they write a book, people buy it, obviously easier. You know, Rachel Ray, back to food, you watch her on TV, she writes a book, you're like, ah, and then there's people like Malcolm Gladwell. We never heard of him, he wrote a book, it was fucking epic, it went viral by itself. And then, so both of them. But like, me, crush it made me big. The book, I was getting going a little bit but I was really in wine. And yeah, I got a couple keynotes and definitely that one keynote smurfed up, like that changed my career, one talk. But the book was equally a big factor. The book organically did well. I don't know if I, yeah, actually it's really funny, this new book because of its title. So a couple of people have seen it and now I've announced it and like I've gotten very aggressive reactions to it and I've always thought books, like a post on social media, the thumbnail, titles matter. And there's something about this title that just resonates with people from an intrigue where I fully get it or like fuck, that's the thing. So I think I might have something with this one. It's funny, it's been a topic the last two days, I'm like, we might have something with this one. But Tim Ferriss tested all, right, four hour work week, he tested that on Google and crushed. Tim Ferriss would be an example of somebody. So the second answer is it could go either way. The first one, so first of all, when I write a book it's all audio. I talk it out. It's your phone. You know, I always laugh when I have book signings and people are like, man, the book really sounds like you. Like, it is. You know, cause normal humans who write books, you know, speak one way and write a different way, I can't write. That is the one medium that I really don't have. So I talk it out. So for me, I'm very passionate about bringing value. It's very important to me when you sell something. Wine, v-friend. And you know, this one obviously, I think everybody knows I'm thinking for, in a very long way, other things like a bottle of wine. Like, empathy crushed. I'm gonna make this very simple for everybody. It was $40 wine for 20 bucks. Wasn't super hard to win that game. We had the leverages of the relationships to get the grapes, cause I had 30 years in the business and I had a billion favors at my disposal. And we were just able to make $40 wine for 20 bucks. And people tasted that. Like if you really drink it enough, you kinda knew. Like definitely people that bought $15 wine that like Gary Vee and decided to pay 20 for empathy definitely felt the difference when you're drinking a $40 wine when you normally drink $15 wine. Same with this book. Like, fuck man, I went so hard at this one. So my favorite part is I've never pushed myself this far. I feel, if I'm being honest with myself, that it took me writing this book to realize that what am I about to say? I'm not sure I ever, I always talk about I give away my best stuff. And you guys and gals have been on the journey. Like, I figure out TikTok, I'm loud. I want you to win too. But something about this one, I think I went like another inch. Like, I'm a human. Like, maybe I don't, you know, it made me question. Like, have I given everybody 100%? No, wait a minute, I've given everybody 95%. There's always been something I held back. Maybe I didn't fully know if I was right yet. Maybe I'm just a normal human being. I was like, wait, I can't give away every, every. It really made me question. Cause this one's 98% and I feel it. And my publisher wrote me a, she's been with me in every book. She wrote me a banana's feedback on it. So my favorite part is I think I went further. I'm about to find out. Did you like talk while you were walking? Did you have a favorite place? So, Raghav, we should actually bring in here. You get to meet him. Like, he's been on my team. He's been doing a lot of my LinkedIn stuff with Mackenzie. Like, he like put together a lot of structure. There's, I'm gonna give a big shout out to VaynerMedia on this one. I had a lot of people from the agency like help me get it further along. Then, then I get asked 8,000 questions and I answer. We turn that into statement form instead of question form. Then we, yeah, then we read it. Yeah, I mean, I do like the opening rant, which is like, like the book really, like from a like, the book is like a philosophical book for the first 25, 50 pages and that becomes a textbook to get you to do it. Like first I'm like, here's what's the fuck is happening. Right, even like just what earlier just happened. Like I felt great about what just happened where I was like friends, drive down the cost of creative. But do it in a way that like is different than you're thinking about it. That doesn't mean hire somebody. Obviously AI will have a big play in this in the future in a massive way, but then everyone's gonna use it, which means it becomes commoditized. So then what's your element out of it? Prompt engineering. There's a lot that's coming. So I always tell my clients, if you can't pray, you can talk. And then she just. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy andy. Andy. Andy Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy. Andy, then I'll call you. Andy. Andy, you're gonna divide it into two teams and have a better conversation. So Danny, Garry and I recently like last year blew up with these, I mean I look similar to this Andrew Tape kind of, these dancing videos, right? Yes. Kind of situation. Yes. And I'm a music artist and a former show dancer, singer and stuff and I wanna translate that a little bit more into the music and the entertainment stuff, wanna do my own shows and stuff. And I'm known in this, let's say, manosphere in a way, like Of course, I understand. I'm known, let's say, and I would say that's, at the end of the day, you know, I do this kind of, you know, my little dances and stuff. So it's like, I can't consider it very gay, but the moment I speak about that I'm actually gay, it's like a problem something in a weird, I'm known in a weird space and I feel I should, I don't know if I should change the target group or like, find a way to expand in a different way, you know? Yeah, I'm listening, I'm listening. Look, I think, first of all, your permission for all of us, any shape or form, whether you look the part of like, or you are it or you're not it, gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, interests, we as humans have the ability to expand the base by communicating. Right, like a very big thing that happened in my career that I want all of you to hear back to value for all of you is I was the wine guy. I was on Conan O'Brien and Good Morning America and like I was the wine guy. And I wanted to like, you know, my life was going through a transition, I knew that I was going to start this company and like my brother was in college and I wanted to start another company. And then I also at that point in my life knew, oh wait a minute, I'm a marketing business guy who also loves wine, yes, but like, I definitely associated with myself as a businessman more than a wine expert. And so I started making business content, right? And brother, what happened was everyone's like, what are you doing? What I don't think people understand is we have permission to do whatever we want. And so I think the question becomes what would you like to happen? To, I mean I'm highlighting the fact that I'm a singer, I sing more in my content. No, I love this, I'm following very along. Let me just jump in because I think I want to get to the punchline because I want to get as many as possible. I assume you want to be as commercially successful singer as you humanly can, yes? Yes. Then you need to sing. Like and, and you need to keep doing the things that are getting you attention. And you need to keep doing things that might get you attention, right? You see Andrew Tate happening, look obviously, I don't think, I'm sorry it's not working, his username is bottomG because Andrew TopG, like you figured out your thing, but like me, right? Think about how confusing I am as a creator to the world and I continue to be. One post I might post about V-Friends and you know this, you'll know what's going on with V-Friends and you're into it, but a lot of my audience is like, I don't care and I don't like that NFT thing. And then the next post I'm posting about the New York Jetscore and I'm sad and like, right? And that's the post and like for a lot of people that are like following me because they're a Fortune 500 CEO trying to get a business insight, they're like this is silly and I'm not even sure I want to take this guy serious because that's not, and then the next post I'm posting about like, here's a hack on Instagram and a lot of you like that because everybody could get value from that. And so I'm doing a lot of, I'm in the and business and you're asking me an or question. What I can definitely tell you is every third post that you put out, you need to sing. You make sense, right? No, no, it's funny. I appreciate what you're doing right now because this has really worked for a lot of people. I understand what you're asking and it's happening to everyone, right? Like when I break it down this simply, it seems so like silly in common sense, but everyone's so subconsciously or consciously stuck on the algorithm and how to grow, they forgot why they're even trying to grow. Yeah, this happens with a lot of attractive people. There's a lot of people that have shown their body, both boys and girls, to build their audience, but that's not what their passion is. That's just how they get a lot of likes. They want to talk about cooking or they want to talk about their car collection or they want to talk about clothing, but the first time they post something like that, it gets nine views, but if they go fucking all like, thotty, they'll get 40 million and they're sad and they're stuck and I keep saying, like, what are you doing? Like, what are those impressions aren't worth anything if it's not what you're doing? But it can be and. You can do that to garner the intention and you've just got to be, and the only thing holding back people from doing it because it's so logical is their own self-esteem issues of this post didn't do as well or it's gonna fuck up the algorithm. It's all fear-based. So, bottom G, do them all. So like a combo, like, highlight more, the singing still do the things what gives me the attention, let's say the viral video. And you know this and that attention's only gonna last for a little while because it's a moment in time and it ebbs and flows and then a third thing, try new shit, do you cook? No. Good, me neither. Do you, like, add a third thing and a fourth thing, garage sales, wine, the jets, mindset, blueberries, V-friends, VaynerMedia, VaynerSports, basketball game, like things, and, and, and. But stay in the core, yes, you find something that works, don't give that up unless it's completely killing you inside. Keep doing it, but, and. But what's holding people back is you do your bottom G skin or whatever you're doing and it gets 100,000 views, you go and do a song and you sing and it gets 49 views and you're like, fuck that, suck. To me, I'm like, no, no, no, that's right. Because oh, by the way, to remind you, you just need one right person to hear you sing. True, yeah. Councilor George. Thank you, Bob, for your great work. Got it, I think, honestly, I think that's, again, why I'm sitting on some of these today because I think some of this stuff's universal. Like you're trying to build your law firm or your real estate practice or this, but maybe your golf content is helping you sell your real estate stuff. Maybe your AI observations leads to you selling your book. Maybe your parenting advice helps you sell your book. Like, you know I say this a lot, I know a lot of you've heard this from me. Watch what I do, not what I say. I'm showing a lot of it. And on top of that, on top of everything else, I do another thing that fucks everybody up on the reverse. I keep my private life private. On top of all that, what most people go to to get likes, their baby, their relationships, like you know I keep it tight. So you're in control. Oh Gary, I don't wanna do this, I don't wanna show my kids. Don't show your kids. Is that the same thing if you're building a company page as well, do you show a bunch of different things or if you're doing a company Instagram, do you stay focused on what the company does? No, a bunch of different things. The secretary of the company, the office, television shows should be in play for all your businesses. Because it's, you got it, I'm glad you picked up on that. The funny banter between you and your employees might just be why people even know that you sell XYZ. It's this game of and. Like if somebody said bad news, you gotta write a book right now on top of the book, you just wrote, I'm like fuck it, I'll write and. Because I've been on it, like everyone's fucked up with or. Bottom G, thanks for the question. We have folks in chat asking for your handles, so if you wanna share it out here for the local, you know, Hawks, that's awesome. I'm gonna hand the mic over to Rarity Dell. Rarity Dell, go ahead and click mute, thanks for joining us here early. Maddie Mayo, your goatee's looking good today, bro. Yeah, hey thanks for having me on. I appreciate it. You gotta go. I got this from Mohe since I was in a Zisc course. I love it. Pleased to be able to come here and do it. It's good to see you. It's part of that, so. Two questions, real quick. One, first question is, what's the single piece I would buy somebody gave you that just stuck with you forever that's been the most important? It's when my dad told me my word was bond. I was so gift of gab, I was a kid. I just wanted to sell everything. He just like, it was in me, but like, I was very intimidated by my dad and he was, he's just very black and white. And very, like very. And I was very affected by that in a positive way. I'm incredibly gray. And that really helped me and it was at the right time. I was 14, it was the right time. And it really, I think it really impacted, you guys know how much love I give my mom. But that was huge. Like I think when people wanna think I'm a bad version of who I am, I think that guy, if I had terrible parenting, could have been affected by that. Like it was really good advice and a really important time in my life and I'm really grateful for it. Thanks for that. The second one is I own a merchant payments, payment processing business over at ISO. So you know, it's mostly viewed as a commodity for the most part, commodity service. So besides our local client base that we can get face time with and show them some love and care. How, what do you think that I could do to try to change the paradigm of the clients that are in the rest of the United States besides the local market so they don't view me as a commodity versus a deeper relationship. Become, become, become flow from progressive. Insurance is a commodity, which is why Jake from State Farm, Flow and the Geico Lizards exist. So back to your point in the beginning of content. Brands? That question is gonna be answered by content. Brand is everything. Yep. There is nothing else. It's how humans make every decision. Makes sense. Yeah, so like to your point, for some of us in this room, you'll feel comfortable to be in front of the camera. Good news, you don't have to. Just like I don't have to share my personal life. You do not have to be in front of a camera. But if I'm you, Dale, I create a mascot. Like look what I'm doing with V-Friends. This is the extension of me. Like empathy, I need to scale my message for my own enjoyment. I'm aware that not everyone's gonna like or listen to me. It's not how the world works. So I'm going from being Hulk Hogan to Vince McMahon. I'm gonna make a lot of characters. Now I'm on a mission, I'm still doing me and, right? But we're doing a lot of work over these next, even look at how many people saw the alpha story on resourceful Robin on Fanatics Live. Anybody, raise your hands if you saw the card break. Two, three, four. I have a pixel, no love for me. No reason. So you guys saw that, like even me going further to why I drew the resourceful Robin. Like I have no idea how it affected or not affected, but watching Decisive Duck, Rare Robot, when that song came out, all of a sudden, like storytelling, connective points, why? You know, and so, yeah, Dale, everything's a commodity. Like everything ends up being a commodity. Like it's so hard to not be a commodity. And so like all of it becomes brand. Like what the fuck? Like everybody can make this for $9, or whatever the fuck it actually costs to make. That's scale, da-da-da, we all understand. So it's all commodity. You need to create a brand, and if you could do it as a human being, that's epic. Because that's what you're doing locally. It's you the human. You're shaking hands, kissing babies, like high touch, warmth, scaling through content. Whether it's you or something that people can attach to. Do you know why people's, a lot of companies are there, are called ABC Delivery or Laundry? It was because the yellow pages. Right, you would show up first. But now that's bad, because it's a commoditized brand. Right, and so like brand. I actually have a live question. Okay. Yeah, I'm over here. Hi, I'm a luxury realtor, but I have a new business that I'm going to launch. So this is more of a nuts and bolts question for you. Most people want to eat healthy and make healthy food choices to be healthier. However, many of the choices suck and they taste bad. And so I'm going to use my superpowers of culinary, good flavors and things that I do when I cook. My superpowers for good and create some spices that you add to other products. There's nothing like it right now. And I just learned my good, hot buddy, Fernando has a packaging company. So, I love it. I love it. I love it. So I'm wondering if you have some companies you can recommend that would do organic, non-GMO vegan spices, because I'd need the packaging for the- The co-packing? Like you need the creation. The creation of my mixes, and they would be added in single package. Yeah, send me an email. Okay. You take the email. I need to make a note. I need to speak to, I need to introduce sort of Garrett. I'll take care of the rest. Yes, I have somebody in mind. Okay. It's not being done. And I think it could be very helpful for people. And we have a very exciting, I'll sample everyone. And are you going to sell it direct to consumer at first? Or what's your plan? My plan would be to sell it direct to consumer through, we could do drop shipping through Shopify. Because then it'd be very easy. We could do it in bulk. It'd be very easy to have it pre-made. And then these choices can be vegan. It's not done widely in restaurants. Most soups are with cream. It could be with coconut milk. Very easy for them just to add packages. It can be done at home. The videos I've created minutes long. It can be added to both yogurt or soup. Are you making food content now yet? No, what I do is it would be like if you make a smoothie, right now you can make vanilla, chocolate, strawberry. And everyone has a million choices and they have their favorite brand. So for one of mine, you take your vanilla, you take a scoop of pumpkin for instance, to get your fiber and then you put in my spice package. And now you've got a pumpkin pie smoothie. You can look forward to it for breakfast. That I understand. Are you the human, you? Yes. Making any food content yet now? I've just done a few videos myself. In general. In general but I'm not going anywhere yet because of the question. That's what I would like you to make unlimited amounts. Back to his question. What you would be doing in that environment, that becomes the Rachel Ray version. The more you can start making content now about your entire point of view on food period. Clean, vegan, grass fed versus grass finished. All this stuff like, the more you can start building now, you don't need to wait to make content. You should go eat something outside now and make content. You should start making content as early as possible. Back to book. If the content you're posting is you writing the book along the way, that's a very good formula. So if you wait a year, because this is gonna take a year. Formula, packaging, it's gonna take you time. Like in that year, seven months, nine months if you go super fast, it would have been nice if you posted two to three TikTok and Instagram and YouTube shorts a day about food, which gave you a base by the time you launched this versus a cold start. 99% of consumer package good products fail. So you're walking into a 99% failure rate. One of the ways to mitigate that is to start building community now. You don't need to make it about your stuff. You could make it about just food. Like you could, I mean, especially when you're in New York, there's so many good options. You should start doing that now. Okay, great. Let's start doing it. Okay, we'll do it. Thank you. Awesome. We're gonna go back in here just because we know folks are virtual and aren't with you right now to spend time. So I'm gonna hand the mic over here to the doctor. Thank you for joining us. Just go ahead and click unmute. Okay. And Daniel, you're in the comments, right? Normally I'm in the comments, but since I'm in a room. Yeah, cool. Go ahead, brother. Thanks, Gary. Happy birthday, bro. First of all. Thank you, my brother. How are you? Good, man. Good. Hey, two really quick things. One, I'm sitting in the business. I asked you a question about back last summer about how to start. And we have blown up, by the way. Proud of you, bro. So thank you very much. That's awesome, bro. I'm sure you're a guy. Proud of you. Thank you, brother. My next question is actually the more important one. And I'll try to make it as quick as I can, but. Well, the first one was a statement. I'm not bringing things. I'm just having fun with you. Go ahead. Okay. I really want to kind of go back to the whole Web3 ethos of things. So kind of the environment we're in right with Web3, it's kind of become a weird place to navigate from a business standpoint. Nothing to do with this business, but I know she's in the room right now, laptop Laura. And we teamed up a while ago to use IP rights from the NFP projects from 2001 that aligned it with the book Duck Buddies. I'm looking at it. Yeah. And we'll stay tuned for the next one. Could you set titles matter? The next one is the horny yeti. So you'll love that one. But we were really committed to use this project in the Web3 world. Like that's why we wanted to go into it, not only from the IP rights standpoint. So that's great. And value to our readers. Cause it's a hard industry. Like kids books, like you may be able to jump into like a million people pool, right? It's a tough one. I'm about to find out. And we can't do back what we did two years ago. Like here's a bunch of tokens, here's a bunch of NFTs and here's ownership, blah, blah, blah. How would you navigate the room? Good news. I just want to, this is important based on the energy of the room. Neither can people that do DTC after iOS 14.5 update took away cooking. Neither could people that were first result on Yahoo when Google became the primary search engine. Neither could people that run television commercials perfectly, but now nobody watches them and they have no idea how to do social media content. Like it's very important. There's something going on in the web three world that they're like, oh, now there's a stigma around NFTs. I'm like, that happens every day in business all the time. There's always ebbs and flows. So I just want to ground that first. And more importantly, this is what like, social media took 15 years for the main world to be like, okay, this is a thing. All I did was be in rooms like this in 2006, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13. And people are like, when are they gonna take Facebook serious? I'm like, one day. You know, now that being said, this is more what internet 2001 because the crash of the internet stocks on Wall Street in 2000 gave the internet a stigma. NFTs have a stigma because of the up and down. But that, like, I don't know. Like literally nothing in my brain has changed about how I see all this. And like, you all know this because in the height of all the prices, I made videos saying 99% of these are going to zero and all the time I said, this is 30, 40 years. Now I myself got caught up in the excitement of things of that nature and I understand that. But like, the macro thing's the same. Like the block, as a matter of fact, the advancements of AI over the last year and how fast it's happening and how much deep fake video is literally on the precipitous of being everywhere, the blockchain is gonna be the most talked about technology. It's gonna verify all information. I am not gonna post one thing on the internet ever in 2026, which is two minutes from now, until I post it on the blockchain to show that I posted it. And so when you watch it, you can be like, did Gary post this or something? And with the rise of how, because everyone's gonna be scared fuckless about AI once they really see, do you understand how if we wake up every day and 80% of the videos we see on the internet are fake? How fast is it gonna turn? This is gonna be one of those things. You're gonna wake up and it's just gonna be like everywhere. It's already happened. It's not zero right now. It's not zero. ESPN reported something about Dame Lillard that was a deep fake. That already happened. They already had to rescind it. It got a little bit of headlight. It was a little bit of a strike in the weekend on Zoppe. That's right. It was a fake. Right? So like, their writer's strike, an actor's strike took a while because of this shit. Like there's a lot going on. So anyway, to answer your question, brother, first I just want everybody to know, if you like the blockchain, good news, it's not going anywhere. Right? If you like NFTs, good news, they're not going anywhere. 99.9% of NFTs are not gonna be collectible because the people can't create demand. 99% of sports cards aren't valuable. 99% of art is not valuable. 99% of comic books are not valuable. 99% of sneakers are not collected. Watches, cars. That was the part that everybody got confused with. NFTs aren't beanie babies. NFTs are stuffed animals. Stuffed animals do great. Squish balls are hot right now. But it's an individual project within a framework. NFTs is the framework. Got it? So to answer your question, you gotta weather the brand storm. Or not do it, I don't know. You know what I mean? We're committed to doing it. We could have dumped the WebDID a long time ago. We just wanted to make sure that. Yeah, I mean. Oh, and there's so much cool shit going on in Web3 right now. Technology advances. It's getting better and better and more interesting. It's gonna be easier for users. And it's so cool. But yes, I'm aware of the brand positioning of NFTs. I promise you I'm aware. Awesome. Thank you, director. Appreciate it. One more virtual that we're gonna go in person. I'm gonna hand the mic to Benny. He was next up with the hand raised. Thank you very much for coming. Benny. Benny gets too. Hey, what's up? I feel like Benny gets too much airtime, right? Oh, I get too much airtime. Hey, it's going to get in your attention. But here's the real deal. I'm out of here. I know if it's about Robin Hood's yardage, he's got a huge, uh, war is hat. You remember their story? I do remember that kid. Down in Miami. So, I know, hold on. I want to make sure the team in here knows. So there's an artist I met. He's in New York now. I met him at Art Basel. A war is hat. Benny got good. It was good things happened, which is just like surreal. And like, he came for very challenging circumstances. Got some momentum going. Go ahead. Just trying to get a little framework. You can create more. Thank you. I went out to his van after I met him at that ladies event that where we talked to him. Yep. And I bought all of his artwork in his van. Well, I had no way to get it at home, right? So I live in Pittsburgh. I said, if you drive into my house in Pittsburgh, I'll pay you the rest of the money. And that's it. So he came to Pittsburgh, fell in love with him even more, heard his story, ended up feeling like compelled to, like, drive the rest of the way home with him. I got in this Hoop Teamini van and drove to Brooklyn with him. I interviewed his family. I interviewed him. I saw where all of his art is. I saw all the stories of his art. Anthony, who's sitting right next to you, has been part of this. Jay, Jay Dove, my media guy, he's got all the footage that I recorded. And we were thinking about, this is before the announcement of Beacon and LA, I was thinking about trying to figure out how to make a documentary with my own media team. You should. I'm like, this guy's story about, his story about Arbazo. You should first and foremost, 1,000% put out a mini doc on YouTube, like a four of Vimeo, like a five, seven minute, like call it half trailer, half mini doc, just play a little bit. OK. But keep going. And then I was thinking, well, then when you announced that Beacon's going to be on LA, and you know, I love a good satellite event, and the Hawks like a satellite event, I would love to do a production where it's like, this movie presented by like the Hangout Hawks, you know, maybe if we can get VaynerWat involved with it a little bit, I was going to reach out to your partner on that. I know it's my all-long shot. My body language is, I literally just got a meeting with him three hours ago where he's like, hold on a second. And then I remember one of your first speakers work at the first economy in Minneapolis. It was Spike Lee, the famous Brooklyn director. I've heard of him. This guy grows up Robin Hood is in the hood of Brooklyn. I'm talking in the hood. Yep. And I just think that there's this weird thing that's brewing right here. And again, I'm just Betty Fisher. Like, I'm a roofing contractor. Like, I'm not a filmmaker yet, but I'm really passionate about this project. And I want to know the next steps. I like the mini doc idea. Well, a couple of things. I do think you should put out the mini doc because I think the world is about executing or asking. I'm a big fan of executing because asking's hard, right? Like, if you think about your long-winded sentence, there was like four asks in there. Well, I'm not asking. But you are. But you are, which, you know, I love you. Like, you are. I'm going to ask you right now what I'm doing. Now. I'm going to ask you that next step. No, no, no, listen, I'm trying to really help you. I think what I like about the mini doc is it puts you in the leverage of it coming to you versus you having to ask, right? By the way, you know this, Benny. You know I have a lot of love for you. Like, I could send an email to Spike Lee for you and be like, here you go. But like, that's like, and I can text them and call them and see them. And Nick's going to be like, yo, check that email. But like, that happens to be 40,000 times a day on the other side. And like, 0.001 of those things happen, right? Mini doc is coming. I'm just going to let you know we already have a production. Mini doc's coming on the next Hangout Hock call. I'd love to show it to you. Right. Like, fine. I think we'll probably set that up separate on your ask. I'll watch it because I don't want to eat up into the time of the rest of the hawks and the limited time that we have in these things. But I would say make the content. You're one TikTok away of one scene that's been captured from getting an email from WME agent being like, yo, we want to talk to you about this. And now you have Hollywood representation. You can make a movie. It happens all the time. Matt, right? That's right. I think it would be awesome because it would culminate art. It would culminate entrepreneurs' journeys. It would culminate V-Con, V-Friends, like the whole thing. I think it would be a great piece. So I'm going to get busy working on that project. I'm rooting for you, Heavy. Thank you. Thank you, Benny. I'm going to pass the mic back over there for on-site and for Q&A. Cool. Hey, everyone. Hey, Gary. Mark Cerniglia. I own a marketing agency. And I've heard. So I'm actually working on a new business idea that I want to give you the Cliff Notes version of real quick. And then I'd love to hear your thoughts both. Obviously, in a way, it would help me, but also in any thoughts that might help the room. So I'm going to work on a new business model where, instead of providing marketing services to people, I'm going to provide marketing staff, like marketing assistants. Yeah, makes sense. But what I'm going to do that's a little bit unique is I'm going to have a fractional model where they can have full time or part time. But the real thing that's going to make it different from any like staffing model is we're going to provide ongoing support and training to that staff. Makes sense. Right? Makes sense. And then that really blends well with the evolution of AI. Because part of that ongoing training will be AI training. Great. So it's this kind of hybrid model supported by an agency. I'm just kind of curious to know your thoughts. I think the one challenge we're going to face is we're going to solve the need people have in a way that has not been proposed to them yet. That's right. Right? And so just figuring out that messaging and just also in every thoughts you have or questions you have. I would produce a lot of content on LinkedIn of why you believe this to be true. Like literally, here's what I see. Here's why this works. Over and over and over. And I would, like to me, you're going to get a lot of no's because you're solving it in a different way. Similar to so many things that we've done at Vayner. But I think you're going to find a lot of traction in small businesses. And small businesses are not corporations. Right? My dad doesn't give a fuck of how it's supposed to be done. He just wants to know how much. And so if you're like, it's $1,800 a month. He'll be like, what about $1,000? And then you'll settle at $1,400. And then you're good. I think if you were working with Pepsi or like the companies I am. Small business. Yeah. I think you just focus on price. Small business is the easiest. Small businesses are like guys. They're easy. Small businesses you just walk in and say, cheap. One, they know the answer. And they're like, what? You know what I mean? They're like, what? Like you're going to be able to win on price. I'm being serious. I'm making some jokes, a little ha, it's nice to be together. You're going to win on price. Yeah. I don't think you're going to get that much friction if you got to win on price with small businesses. Yeah. And one of the things I've been pretty good at is I've been touring my own team through hiring some staff. Like it's in Mexico, South America. So I think part of this business model is going to be, you're going to pay for a third of what somebody costs. How many people on Team Gary? Off the top of your head. Yeah, no, Team Gary. And how many of them live in places like Mexico and Poland? Yeah. I get it. Yeah, no, exactly. I think it's getting the market to get it. I got to go. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I assume I'll see some of you soon. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Awesome.
