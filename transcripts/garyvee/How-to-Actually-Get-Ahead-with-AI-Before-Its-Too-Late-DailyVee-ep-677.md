## Transcript
All of your content, your podcast, your tweets, everything was erased tomorrow and you just had 60 seconds left. What would you leave the world with? My big thing to the world is love yourself because if you don't, what the fuck are we doing here? Everybody else sucks too. Everybody else has shortcomings. Everybody else wanted to hang it up. Everybody else has shit too. And so what I would leave the world with is if you can't find a way to love you, then no one else is going to be able to love you. And you are definitely not going to be able to give love and that's a sad place. And so love yourself because you're trying and you deserve it. That's a good keynote here. Kind of the accounting industry, a lot of change going on. AI in the air, consolidation for private equity, a lot of business stuff. And then from here we'll go to two sports car shops. We'll catch up. You and I will answer some people's questions during the day and thank you so much. Head back to New York. What's amazing about technology is you could have missed every trend of the last decade. And if you actually decide to get serious and do the homework an hour a day, what does AI mean? How do I use AI? And AI is crazy itself. You can use AI to get smart about AI. You can literally go into chat, GBT and be like, literally this is what you type in. All right, this morning I was at a keynote with Gary Vaynerchuk and he made me feel some sort of way. Like you could literally type these kind of things in. I am an accountant. I am a fractional CFO, whatever it might be. The biggest issue right now for a lot of you using AI is you don't know how to be good at using AI yet. So I think what I'm excited about, what motivates me to continue to do what I'm doing right in this stand-off second is I'm desperate for one person in this audience to hear me and say, you know what? I have an hour a day. Yeah, like I'm doing this for another 20 years. I don't want to fall behind. This is real stuff. Gary's not wrong. Let me put in the hour a day. And you could literally go from someone who's been not on the bleeding edge to being the most bleeding edge because you put in the work. I genuinely think about it like health and wellness. Some people do not live healthy for 20 years. Eating, drinking, staying up like no exercise. And then they just start. And it's a little ugly at first. It's hard. But a year later, it's a lot better. And that's exactly how I feel about this technology thing. You might have been the person that like passed on learning how to do research and you kept doing direct mail instead. You decided social media was stupid. You might not be apps. Like you could be that person. And yet tomorrow, you can decide that this keynote this morning motivated you and you agree. And now you spend an hour a day researching and you could be cutting edge in a year. And I could not recommend that more because I believe that this AI thing is big, big. And some of you are old enough looking around here to remember we underestimated the internet and a lot of the internet companies have been a problem for our business too. And this is bigger than that. You got to go. I just want to tell you I'm with tax TVT but I listened to all your videos when I got home from Afghanistan. And you really got me out of it. Well, brother, thank you for that. Thank you for that. And thank you for what you've done for us, brother. Really, I mean that. Thank you. Such a pleasure. I love asking inspiring people. What is inspiring you? What pushing that was inspiring you right now? I am inspired by the following scenario. I have a 6 a.m. flight in LaGuardia. I have to wake up at 4. I'm in the car at 4.30. And I look out the window and I'm driving through New York City. And I am watching a 63-year-old woman get out of the subway going to work her 9 to 5. And I'm at the stop sign and I'm looking at this woman in the face. And I admire her. You know, she is... I'm making up this whole narrative obviously. I'm looking at a stranger. But she's providing for her family. She might be in a situation where she just lost her husband and still has 2 kids to put through school. I just am inspired by people who have no choice in their heart. But to do the hardest things for the people they love the most. What inspires me is the men and women around the world who have it the hardest. And if they're the version that doesn't complain, oh, then I'm just like... You show me someone who's got it shitty by all people's standards. Who's grinding 70, 80 hours a week just to buy a present for the birthday of their grandkids. Or something like that. And that person doesn't complain. That to me is the number one person on earth. And we don't cheer for them. I'm probably one of the few human beings that will even say something like what I'm saying right now. And when I tell you I'm inspired by a daily brother, I think about it a lot. And I come from that cloth of those kind of people. And I'm appreciative, I'm grateful, and I'm incredibly inspired by the billions. I want everyone to hear that number. The billions of people who wake up every day and grind and grit and fight for very small luxuries and things for the people they love the most. And then the ones that don't complain will to me they're the superheroes of our society. That last part I definitely want to expand on blog. I really mean this. I think that we get our inspiration from the wrong people in society. And I think that's hurt us. I think that last answer, you know, to me those kind of individuals really deserve our admiration. And the people that are really fighting the fight daily for their families. Yes. I have a question. Really matter. Yes. So I'm 39. Yep. I recently got divorced three years ago. Yep. I often hear you tell people who don't do what they love, which tax certainly is not what I love. Yep. What do you love to do? And I don't know how to answer that. Like I don't know. What are you interested in? I'm interested in, I don't know. What do you consume? Like what do you watch? What do you read? You know, celebrity gossip, you know, sitcoms, sports, cooking. Yeah. Like do you have a sense or not really? I mean I do love cooking. I love my faith. I'm getting deep in my faith. I love that. And I just love the sense of helping people, you know, like helping people be a better version of themselves. Yeah. At the same time, I feel like, I don't know. No, that's really... Like how do I even do it for myself? You know. I get what you're saying. By the way, going through adversities like divorce or being in a profession that doesn't, you know, really light your life up does not mean that you don't have your shit together. Right. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like I wouldn't say like you're not allowed to have that communication. You know, there's not a human on earth that doesn't have flaws. Yeah. There's not a human on earth that doesn't have losses in the L column. Right. Right? Every one of... And so if that was the barometer of who's allowed to help people get better, not one person can meet that framework. Right. So I wouldn't shy away from going down that path of being of service because you've decided that a divorce or a lack of understanding what your passion is right this second. I don't think that's a prerequisite. And don't forget, some people are great coaches that never played the game. You might be able to see it in others better than you see it in yourself. I would argue that that was my journey. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. So, you know, don't close doors for you based on judgment you're deploying on yourself. Okay. That's one thing to definitely give some thought to. Yeah. You know? Yeah. But I mean, are you looking for a career change? I... Is that the essence of the question? Yeah. You know, I just... It needs to be practical. I just don't know where to go. Yeah. I... look, I think the way to go about that is to just keep talking to the world. Just keep talking. Just keep trying things. You know, it's really like exercise. Like sign up for free classes, go to events. Like it's just putting yourself in a position to create the serendipity of the moment. Yeah. Give yourself that hour a day. Give yourself that hour a day. Because it's there. Yeah. Not having it is an excuse. Great. Great. Cool. Thanks so much. I'm tired. Yeah, I was. I agree. That's why we vlog. That's why it's exactly the same. Yeah. Yeah. I think about that. Yeah. I think about that a lot. I think that people understand... when I talk about having good behaviors, and if you don't, or if you don't put in the work, the behaviors won't happen. People understand it more in health and wellness than they do in business. It's just been in the air for long enough that people understand, like, oh, if I don't do the right thing, then the right things won't happen. And they also understand that all these skinny quick schemes and all this stuff, they're not sustainable. It seems like the new super drugs, the ozempics and things like that, if you get off of it, it just makes sense. There's in life, this is what's so amazing about life. There's no shortcuts. People want them. Fuck man, I want them. I want shortcuts into things that don't come natural to me, that aren't easy to me, that I don't want to be doing. Who does it? The problem is it's just not how it works. All the best shit is hard. And I actually think that's the way it should be. Did all the best shit be hard? That's why love is hard. That's why raising kids is hard. Right? All the best shit should be hard. These cards I never pull or things of that nature. Speaking of which, I have not pulled jack shit. Jason's having me open a pack right now. Hold this, Jason. There you go. All right, let's see if we can... Here we go, Jason. That's a good idea. That'd be so amazing. I've not pulled anything such as that. All right, I did get a... I got a manga speckle. Oh, I got a nice pack. I got an insert and a manga. Slaying slug. The manga. Very nice. Little shoot shark. In a nice way. I was told by everybody that knew my father that I was going to ruin his business by doing this computer thing and that I should open a second liquor store if I really cared about that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. And that I should open a second liquor store if I really cared about building my dad's business and that your dad worked so hard bringing you to America, you're going to ruin it for... These are grown men when I was 20 years old telling me to my face, in my face, in my dad's store, don't do this. Don't spend this kind of money on this thing's a fad until it was the thing that changed my dad's life. When I started my agency VaynerMedia, there was tweets and articles written that the wine guy is so fucking delusional. He thinks he's going to walk into Madison Avenue and build an advertising agency. He's a fucking idiot and got me fun of and all those jokes. And in the last 15 years, I've taken a company from $0 to $350 million a year and we're the largest independent advertising agency in the world. VFRIENDS is going to be the same thing. I'm going to... Listen, Pokemon, Disney, Marvel, I will say it again, I'm comfortable saying it. I aspire to build something like that. Comma. It is not lost on me. If I do everything well for 30 straight years, that gets me not even into potentially striking distance of how big those things are, but why would I not try to? Yeah, what's the advice to business women and why are you spending time to go to that podcast, go to the... Like you said it a little bit, this is your gateway to the Jets. Yeah, I mean I'm just... Nothing happens by accident. You don't get the big guns if you don't put in the work. And so going to card stores, doing card podcasts, doing keynote speeches at conferences, doing the conferences podcast is both building the Gary Vee brand and the VFRIENDS brand. Right now, I have been flow between brand building and operations for the last two years of the downed operations, but I feel like this is the beginning of me going all in on brand building and building community. Shaking hands and kissing babies here matters. Say when elections. Hello, hello. Hello, hello. Hello, hello. Hi, how are you? Hello, hello. Nice to meet you. Pleasure to meet you. Hey, how are you? Good. I changed my life six years ago. Okay, I was in college, senior, and I saw one of your videos and it just spoke to me, man, and it spoke to the entrepreneur of me. I became a digital marketer and I've left so many businesses. I'm much better placed than I found because of your philosophy and your books and everything that you've talked about. It was so great, Bill. It's awesome. Thank you for sharing that with me. Thank you. Really, thank you. It's only a week old. That's pretty cool. Yeah, it's been going really well. Yeah, let's do it. There's one-on-one super frack. There's W nice. It's chrome. It's reds out of five. Oh, you got something. You got a manga. 2.3 in a box. That's the number one card you could have gotten. Yes. Humble hedgehog. Sweet. That was a very good pack. How are you? Hey. What's up, everyone? What would be your piece of advice for people that are wanting to start in growing a social media brand for reselling Pokemon or just a personal brand since 2025 is also kind of a big year for personal brands? What would be your one piece of advice for them? Put out as much content as humanly possible on social networks. It is literally reps. This video, the next video, the more knowledge you have, the more you have things to say, the more you can post that stuff, the more places you can post it. Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, YouTube Shorts. And then start doing live shopping and clip the highlights. You're doing a live show that you can clip. You don't even need to have a production day. The show is the production day. So that's why I love live shopping. A little gloomy here in Nashville heading out. Very productive. Two podcasts, two store visits. Had a great catch up with Jason just now. And honestly, excited about the three hours worth of work on the plane to clean up my inbox. It's just some of that mundane shit that you just got to get done. And next Pacers tomorrow night. And brick by brick, brick by brick. So, see you later, DailyVee. My life's up in smoke. How you doing? I'm fine. Thanks for asking. I'm trying to get these right.
