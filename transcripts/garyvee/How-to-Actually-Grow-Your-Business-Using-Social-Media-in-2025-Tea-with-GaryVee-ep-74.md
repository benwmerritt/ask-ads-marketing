No balance. Go hardest on both. Should I post about the business or should I post about this Taco Bell? The answer is and. What kind of constant? Just like founder story? And that your piss that the heat got knocked out of the playoffs. And that your grandma was your hero. And that you f***ing love burritos. Human s*** and business. Do you know that I'm a New York Shets fan? Yes. Do you know that I like blueberries? Yes. Do you know that I like garage saleing? Yep. Do you know that I have a marketing company? Yes, sir. Do you know that I have v-friends? Yep. You following? Yep. My brother, everything. Everything, everything, everything. Yep. I got you. Everything. What's the one strategy you recommend that we double triple down going into 2026? How much content are you putting out on LinkedIn a day? A week? A month. Don't post. We post every. We post every day. So we have a full. What's happening is you're doing way too much words and a couple of pictures and like this isn't Michael. Is this going to is this going to excite anyone? Probably not. I believe what's happening here is classic quote unquote checking the box to post every day without it's kind of like going to the gym but not doing the exercise as well. Does that make sense? Yep. So I want to get you to go. So here's where I want you to go. Even just seeing you on camera with me right now. I want you to post what you're posting now is fine ish not my ideal but I need you to post a video from you every day. Okay. Okay. What's the what's the strategy? What the fuck is being talked about in your world? Like like think about where you're placing what like you're talking to people every I know everything CMOs and marketers are worried about. Right. I because I talk to them every day. You guys are placing B2B executives every day. You know what's going on in the market. Yep. So in terms of like how long how long a video. I'll do it. I'll make the video. What's up everybody? How do I do it? I'll do it. What's up everybody? It's Michael from Talent Tractions. All right. One of the things I'm seeing from everybody right now especially in the B2B SaaS sector is that people aren't as excited about what college you went to but they're really looking for how many years you've had with AI at all. Even if you had a year of AI work you're going to get a huge advantage. So a couple things for the people out there looking for jobs start taking these AI courses start using them and for recruiters out there here are some of the places where you can find certifications that matter. Bro, I just did your post. I'm not even in your business. How do you then attract the B2B exec? Right? You're saying that they'll see those posts as well? Bro, I just got offered a board seat. A board seat to a publicly traded company off of one video I posted on LinkedIn. Now. You're Gary Vee. Yeah, but I was fucking Gary in a liquor store making videos every day that nobody gave a fuck about too. It's content. You're exactly right. That's where I was hoping you would go. I'm Gary Vee now because I fucking did what I'm telling you to do for 15 years every day. I've given away content for free that's valuable. I've put out good information to the universe and in return I've built reputation. Your videos are going to be based on how well you know it. It doesn't even have to be you. It could be people on your team. It could be you and somebody on your team. But we have to put out content that brings value. How are they going to see it? They all live on LinkedIn. Yeah. Right? Just like 14-year-old girls live on TikTok, executives live on LinkedIn. That's why I've been yelling about LinkedIn for 100 years. George from Providence, New Jersey. What's good, brother? George, do you go to Wine Library? You're very close at New Providence. I'm going to be very upset if you go to some bullshit store around you like Bottle King. You better fucking go to Wine Library. George, answer me. 39165 George. Yes, I do. Let's go, George. Thank you, man. Gary. You said we're on going, brother? I want that content like here's what's going on in the market. Here's what's going on in the market. Here's what's going on in the market. Here's why somebody loses their job after six months after we place them. They made this mistake. Here's why employers are bad at picking employees. I've helped people do this. You know your shit. You're in your shit. Hey, Gary. I've been selling full-time on whatnot for almost two years now and I've scaled close to $2 million in sales. I'm 22 years old. Stop right there. She's 22 and has done $2 million in sales in the last 24 months from 20 to 22. Live social shopping is a monster. Like straight up even like this weekend. Sign up for a count on what not. Sign up to sell and like sit in your living room and sell random shit in your house. It's like eBay. It's free money, Dustin. Anyway, go ahead. Do you think it's time to start other businesses or should I keep focusing on what not? No, unless you hate it, but she's just starting. Like no, no, no. Get that to $10 million. Save money. The number one goal for anyone who's trying to live a life on their own means is to cut down their overhead. Save money so much so that you can attack your dream for a year and not worry about money, which means you kind of need 18 months worth of money because you attack it for a year. And then when you're like, fuck, I failed at my dream. Let me get a job. You got to give yourself a couple minutes there to find a new job. So my number one goal for everyone is cut your overhead, meaning cut your expenses. Like you don't need for streaming services. You don't need to buy $8 coffee. You you could take public transportation instead of Ubers. You don't need six handbags. Maybe two is good enough. You don't need to buy fucking collectibles rips. Like don't let anybody be buying these fucking VFRIENDS collectibles, even though they're going to go to the fucking moon because I'm going to ask you for 40 means 40 years. Don't let them buy it right now if they don't have money. I get upset rips. I don't know if you've seen these tweets. Sometimes people are like, oh, I can't buy the comic book this week. I have to wait for my paycheck. I literally DM these motherfuckers. I'm like, do not buy the comic book, even though I think the comic book, even though the comic book was a good buy, right? Even though it was 20 and you can sell for 50. I do encourage flip life. Like what if it didn't do that? Like we need people to understand the game. 18 months of savings against a low overhead, less expensive apartment. If you're if you're 26 and you're living on your own apartment, move in with your roommate, with your best friend and have a roommate and cut it in half. If you like you don't need Paramount Plus. If you don't have $100,000 in savings in your bank, it is inappropriate to have Prime, Hulu, ESPN Plus, U2TV. Like what the fuck? Yes, that's where I'm going. By the way, you can have I noticed what I said. You can't have six services you're paying for. You can have two. I'll let you have Netflix and one other. All right, you got it. So anyway, no, not move on. She's just gaining heat right now, but she's not as far like maybe like there's follow up questions there because she might be talented enough. But anyway, yes, you do cold message. She's desperate. She has no clients. Everybody who's got a service business, you do you cut hair. You do consulting. You're a physical trainer. You make a video that looks like this. I will now make it for everyone. Give me a phone real quick. Hey, everybody, I'm making this video because I just started this personal training business. Hey, everybody, I'm making this video because I just started my own accounting firm and I'm looking for clients. Hey, everybody, I'm finally going after my lifelong passion to start my own landscaping business. So you're getting this video because you're in my context, contacts on my phone. Some of you are my best friends since high school. Others, I probably met once and you're in my phone. I'm sending this to literally everybody from A to Z in my phone. I'm not asking you to hire me to do landscaping, but I'm asking if you know anyone who might be in the market for a landscaper. This is my one plea, my one ask as I start in this journey. And I hope my journey maybe even inspires some of you to finally jump and start your own thing. So I'm starting with Andrew Anderson and I'm editing with Zachary Zazaloff. Please, I apologize if we've only talked once and you find this to be spam. I will put the link to my social media and website if you like my landscaping business and it means a lot to me if you even watched 30 seconds of this video because it is really my dream. Have the best day. Make that video, Cass, and literally text every single person. Grab your favorite beverage of choice, tea, wine, water, put on your favorite music, start at 2 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon, go into 9 p.m., get it done, you will have a business. All right, let's give away the Mindful Minnakao, one of the fucking most bad ass V-Friends characters, the Mindful Minnakao Chrome card, distractions, soars above, soars above distractions, bringing wisdom and peace through thoughtful reflection and patience. The Mindful Minnakao's quote, rise above the chaos to find your clarity. This card is fucking awesome. So I started a clothing company a while back and I just focused heavy on posting a lot of content on the business, going crazy on different kinds of content. And I left my own personal account, just haven't been posting. I want to bring it back into it because as the founder of the clothing brand, I feel like I could also... People can promote me, promote the brand. And people connect to humans 100%. Exactly, that's what I'm seeing, they connect way more with that personal connection. So I'm trying to see in a sense how to balance, let's say, that personal branding with my own account with the business. No balance, no balance. Go hard as fuck on both. And let's say from the personal account, what kind of content, just like founder story or show? And that you're pissed at the heat got knocked out of the playoffs, and that your grandma was your hero, and that you fucking love burritos. All right. Human shit and business shit. All right. Do you, you know, how long have you been following me? Um, oof, at least, I don't know, since before 2020, I would say. Okay, do you know that I'm a New York Jets fan? Yes. Do you know that I like blueberries? Yes. I remember I saw that in another video that you posted, you talked about that actually, the blueberries. Do you know that I like garage saleing? Yep, flipping and everything. Do you know that I have a marketing company? Yes, sir. Do you know that I have v-friends? Yep. I have cars. I've collected two. You following? Yep. I got you. Everything. Gotcha. Just like whatever is personal to you, whatever you just like, don't even ever think it. Just like, go for it in a sense. My brother, everything, everything, everything, everything. Do you understand? I appreciate it. Yeah. And one thing that's funny, what I noticed is that like you said something's the most like raw, unedited content performs like the best. The other day I was at this place, I did a random video, compared to my average views, I got like three acts of views and it was like the most random like, hey, what do you guys think of this random like location? And then everyone's like commenting. And so it's funny how that works. Play, play, play, and, and, and, play, play, play, and everything is and. When you're like in your, when I'm not here with you and you're in your head in three weeks, and you're like, should I post on my account or should I post up my personal or the thing? Or should I post about the business or should I post about this Taco Bell? The answer is and. But here's why Pablo, it's good to do that. Because some people can't afford it and some people need just the surface level. Other people need deeper fucking execution. Today was a post by the sign guy in Long Island. He did a free sign for my dad's store. I gave him consulting way more valuable in return. His business has exploded, exploded. But he read day trading attention and the deck and he didn't get it. He needed those extra five hours. If you're a plumber and you know that a third of your clients hire you for 500 bucks to change a little thing that they could have changed if they went to YouTube and to Home Depot, if you make that content and say, don't hire me on this situation, go to this video. In fact, if that person made, if that plumber made the video instead of pointing them to a video building brand and said, go to this video that I made and go to Lowe's and spend $19. And this is how you do it. The level of trust that happens that when that same family that didn't need to sink, but when their oldest son took a huge poop and exploded their bathroom and it fucking broke and they actually did need help, which plumber do you think they're gonna fucking call? It's called trust. The number one way to do business in the world is trust. I see Matt Garcia over your shoulder. Matt is a fucking real marketing executive. He's now been in VaynerX for a little while. He now leads the Sasha Group, which was a big promo for him when Marcus went to go run International. Matt is like, look at his slick hair. He's a salesman. You know what I mean? He's a real fucking salesman. I promise you, if you go talk to him and ask him what's happened these two years, he'll say it's stunning how our company is not as transactional as every agency I've ever worked for, every agency I've ever worked for. If they even like, if the person even walks in the building, we're selling, selling, selling. Gary's fucking making us do shit for people for free. Reputation. Trust. It's doing the right thing. So, you know, that's what I think. You know, that's what I think, Pablo. I think why do you tell people not to hire you? Because they end up hiring you when they actually need you. I don't want people hiring me when they don't need me. I don't need people doing that. I want to start a catering business for offices in New York, but I have zero dollars and don't know how to get my foot in the door. How can I market myself? She should go work for a company that does that and gain experience while making content of what she's learning. Got it? And like do a whole content series called The Road to My Own Business, showing people every day what she learned on her job, doing that for three years, saving her money, not spending too much, saving. And then starting her own business because she did three years of content. Like, intern Wattenburg can literally go home and be like, here's what I learned today. That's what she should do. Like, when you have no money and you have no experience and you have no connections and you're not doing anything, what content are you going to put out? So many people, Pablo, that want to be something. I want to be a rapper. I want to be Gary Vee. I want to be a sneaker store owner. So many people should literally take a job at a company or for someone they want to be, document every day what they've learned that day about it in their content for two to three years, and then they will become. But all you kids got confused and thought like you're all Mark Zuckerberg and you can just start a business and be a billionaire. I didn't do that. It's like it worked in a, the reason Wine Library exploded right off the bat. You know, people are like, wow, 22 to 27, you took it from three to 50 million. That, that, wow, that's crazy. It wasn't that crazy if you realized that I worked in that fucking store every weekend and every summer vacation from 14 to 22. When I tell you I walked in day one, May 19th, 1998, first full day of work. I walked in like I'd been doing it, like I was 79 years old and knew everything, like, like, like a veteran and too many kids are like, I'm going to do this on what? On who? The best content series right now. I'm in love with this advice. Go work for what you want to become. Get home every night and make a video while you're cooking or decompressing or on the walk home or on the ride home or like after you take a shower in the bathroom video with clothes on preferably. Make a video about what you learned because then there'll be three to four years of what you've learned on the internet, which will give your customers confidence when you open your own shit in four, five, six, seven, eight years. Imagine if all of you did that. That's, you know, obviously you guys know I co-sign you and all that stuff, but you'd have your own leverage by taking that video and connecting with every CMO of every Fortune 500 QSR company in the world on LinkedIn and then messaging them the video that you made and how you did it. Then going to chat, CBT and say, give me a list of 10 CMOs of Fortune 500 companies and their Instagram handles. And then when it gives you 10, say, and now 10 more and now 10 more. Find the CMOs, the chief marketing officers of the biggest companies in the world. Go to Instagram and DM them because they don't get a lot of DMs there. And say, here's a video we made and we would love to do it for you. My question is related to my spouse and how like even since like 2021, 2022 when I was getting into NFTs and she's like, what are these stupid pictures minted the ferry? And she's like, you sold half of your Apple stock to buy this picture. How much is it worth? And I said, I haven't sold it yet. So it doesn't matter how much it's, you know, and then, you know, I've been getting on what not. I'm like four shows in. Absolutely love it. I have a full-time job I love and I focus on that when I'm doing the job, you know, but then I'm doing these shows and she was like, why are you doing this? It's because I love it and I might actually build something out of it. I have a passion for it. I've been collecting since I was a kid. So my question is like, did your did your work? Did your wife, you said wife, right? I want to make sure her that way. Did your wife grow up with very little? Maybe like when she was until she was about five or six and then her parents like were entrepreneurs and they built a few businesses from the ground up. So she didn't have to for very long, but to be honest, like six years ago, her and I got out of massive debt. So we'd been there before, you know what I mean? So I think she probably doesn't want to go. She's gunshot. Yeah, yeah, it makes sense. Yeah. So I'm saying I'm going to take this slow, you know, not in a hurry, but I like doing it. But I show her these cards, you know, I say like, and I read some of these to her and she's like, okay, whatever, you know, story cards. These are just like little kid cards, you know, like, I mean, look, that's what a lot of wives said about Pokemon in 96. And now when they sell for $30,000 at auction, and husbands that shit on their wives and husbands, you know, eat their fucking words. Now that being said, your wife could end up being right. God forbid I could get sick and die. And I won't have the next 30 years to build what I know I'm building with V friends. What I love about the what not part is that's not relying on me. You're learning the skill to sell on here. So I love that. Look, you have a fearless fairy series one NFT. No, no. Well, yeah, series two. Yeah, I meant to say which is great. So look, I think I think what you're kind of trying to express to your wife is you're trying to balance both responsibility along with trying to have happiness and joy in your life. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And you know, look, I'm empathetic to your wife. I don't think she doesn't get it. Of course, you know, any of those things. I hope that you guys can continue to over communicate in a healthy way that allows her to understand your needs for this energy. And on the flip side, I hope that you are very conscious of not going too delusional on your dreams and hopes and needs that you put yourself in a vulnerable place that's practical. For example, I think if you showed her the practical peacock and told her about the practical peacock, she might like the practical peacock. She might. She might. You know, you know, she's a very organized person. I keep on telling her, take the quiz. I have a theory. I think she's going to get the ostrich, but I don't know. Look, the more you love it right now, if she's worried, the more she's going to hate V friends. You know what I mean? Kind of thing that happens to. So you can't push it. It just comes natural. I like the tone and tenor of this kind of look, brother, I'll tell you right now, just like I was 100% positive that if people went ham on TikTok in 1817, 1819, it was going to pay dividends. I'm 100% positive that if people on here jump on whatnot and start garage selling or selling something sustainable on it, that it will work. So keep pushing the whatnot thing for sure. I would just talk about practice. Probably do this, brother. I would just do Q and A and ask people to ask me clouds and dirt questions, right? Psychology, mentality, emotional questions. Like my mom is, you know, ruining me or, you know, my brother's super successful and smart. And I'm like barely staying in college here and I don't have the same talents. Or, you know, that kind of stuff. And then, you know, or my dad has just got cancer. How do I deal with that? So emotional stuff. And then just tactical shit like, Gary, I want to get more views. I'm like, here, let me show you now our team's work. Like here's how. Notice the copy I wrote here. Why did I write that? Or what's this tactic? Or here's what's going on in Facebook. Do one second videos instead of pictures. So it would be, I probably call it clouds and dirt with Professor V, right? Clouds, macro psychology, dirt, tactical in the grind shit. What is it that you do for your leadership so that they take your culture, what you, your dream, your vision and they put it into the company? Love and accountability. So number one is love. The reason people deliver for me and my companies is because I deliver for them first. I truly believe in my soul that I work for everybody that works for me. I believe it to my soul. I know everybody in my office is motivated by different things. Some people care about a title, right? Zach over in the corner doesn't give a fuck about a title. He's trying to put in the fucking hours to get the skills, build a close relationship with me, and then he'll decide what he does with that. Other people need money, right? Like something bad happened in her life and they're motivated by money right now or not even something bad. They just are motivated by money allowed, motivated by title allowed, motivated by mentorship allowed, a mix of all three allowed. What I'm spending my time trying to figure out is who wants what and how do I deliver it? So, Katelyn, first it's about what I can do for them. What am, how am I delivering for them? That all of a sudden gets them into the same place that I am with the world. I am grateful and I'm grateful and feel guilty on how my circumstances played out. Meaning I got lucky that I had the best mom in the world and that I grew up in shit. Growing up with little and having the best mom made me fundamentally unstoppable. So I have spent my life trying to give back to society through Gary Vee and now through VeeFriends. When I do, what I do for my employees, they go through a similar guilt and gratitude framework. They have unlimited buddies who hate their job. They go and try different shit and sit in a cubicle for one second and they're like, fuck this shit, I'm coming to family. They can taste it. They can taste it and then that motivates them to deliver on our North Star, right? And then accountability. When an employee doesn't do that for a sustained period of time, especially if they're senior, we have to give them a candor that they're in trouble and then they're fired. This is tough to say out loud, but we fired two very senior executives at VaynerMedia last week. Very senior. Oh no, I'm sorry. One ran an entire office, one was a number two and like, done. Just where we were unable over years, years to get them into the right place and it kills me. And by the way, I have to approve every firing. So literally in my 2,500 person company at VaynerX, I have to approve every firing because I want to be the last line of defense in case my company gets political. So I feel very good about that. I feel like I've crossed every T and I. So because I've always struggled with firing that led to bad candor that led to all my problems, lack of candor. So that's where we're at, sister, you know, love and accountability. And how do you measure that or how do you observe it in your leaders so that they, you're saying, okay, I can see you're doing it. I can see you're doing it. Like what are the warning signs for you? Meet the warning signs. Yeah, if they're not doing like you said you let two people go. Unfortunately, this is the last week. You know, I have seven people in HR that have been here for a decade. They're like sisters and brothers to me. I trust their intuition. We take feedback from people. We create a safe lack of fear environment that a lot of people, a lot of people trust. So they'll go and talk about people's bad behaviors. We look at client feedback. We look at results. Businesses like sports, if someone's the head of clients and they've lost three of their last four clients, well, guess what happens? There's results to that. Yeah. Especially when I make them feel safe and say, hey, if you feel like you're losing a client, use me. Bring me in. I can help. So just real life family, family business vibes, you know, by realizing you don't have a fucking choice. Negativity is windless, Pablo. People in the chat that are spewing positivity on their way to winning. People in the chat that are cynical cats and spewing negativity, currently losing, digging deeper holes of losing. The second you're against hope and happiness, you're fucked. And guess what? Nobody gives a fuck. I'm out here trying, but the negative energy out here, they're not my fucking children. I'm trying because I'm a good dude like that because I got lucky because I have a great mom. But if you don't and you want to dig your heels in, I'm like, fuck you, Gary. It's negative. The world sucks. OK, knock yourself out. Like, knock your fucking self out. Negativity is lonely, y'all. Why do you think they like the Internet so much? Oh, I know it's true. I'm fucking 49. I got great fucking hairs. This is in day one for me. Not a fucking kid. I've watched it for 40 years of my life and I was a I was a fucking into an emotionally intelligent, super league, emotionally charged, thoughtful, wisdom oriented child. So I've been on this paying attention to fucking human beings kick for 40 fucking years. You want to be negative? I got good news for you. You're only dragging in people that are negative too. You better be a fucking positive porcupine because being a cynical cat is a fucking lonely life. And no one's going to give a fuck because everybody that gave a fuck, your negativity is going to chase them away. You're going to end up lonely. So fuck you. How about that? How about a little punch in your face too? Clearly love isn't working for some of you. Clearly love is not working for some of you. Some of you that are cynical on me. Clearly love is not working. So let's flip it up. How about fuck you? What the fuck are you going to do about it?
