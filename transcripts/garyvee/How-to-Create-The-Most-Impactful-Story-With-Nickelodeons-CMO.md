New SpongeBob still plays incredibly well. And then also the spin-offs, like we're talking, we have Camp Poro coming up, we have a Patrick Star spin-off, we have a Sandy Cheek spin-off. So we really are able to build on that franchise because all of the characters are so rich. Hey! You got your perspective. Yeah! I just want to be happy. Don't you want to be happy? Before Nickelodeon, she was the CMO of Gemalit Media, a Spotify company. She was the head of marketing for Hulu. And prior to that was the VP of marketing at Netflix. We're excited to hear about Jenny's impressive experiences. And Jenny, please help my child stop watching Paw Patrol all the time around the clock, y'all. You won. You won in this house. Paw Patrol, everything. Thank you, Paw Patrol, everything. Good job. Jenny, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for being part of this and anchoring us this wonderful morning. Thank you, Gary. And thank you, Roy. I'm excited to be here. Jenny, I'm actually going to use your prior experience a little bit here to bring value because I'm reading Twitter and trying to bring as much value to everybody. A hashtag marketing for the now if you have a question or an observation. Jenny, talk to me about audio. Obviously, you know, you being at Gemalit and a pioneer there, just two seconds before we go into other matters. How do you see audio as a medium? Where do you see it sitting? Obviously, Roy's career a lot was built on the back of radio. We see this whole revolution of podcasting. You're too sense on it because I do think you have a lot of important observations. Yeah, I mean, audio, I specifically took the job at Gemalit in order to learn audio because I felt like it was an extremely important touch point that was missed during the day. That from that, I used to call it that, well, I still call it the eye, the ear strategy, meaning once they leave the couch, how do you actually keep people engaged in your brand? And with Alexa and with cars, it just makes sense that you continue the story throughout audio or whether that's in your ears. And it's also what I learned there is just how intimate really the audio experience is. And Daniel X said something really, I think important when he acquired or his company acquired Gemalit. Obviously, that just showed the, I think, relevance of where they were putting their bets in regards to Spotify, embedding in podcasts and also just audio storytelling. And he said, I can't believe that the ear or the eye is 10 times more expensive to buy than the ear. And he just felt like that was just something to say, this is actually an extremely important medium. And so going to there has actually helped me as another step in my career to realize, okay, let's just use an example for Blues Clues. And maybe your son's too old for that, but Blues Clues, we're gonna do story time, with Josh and Blue, whereas you could use it at nap time or you could use it at bedtime. And so just trying to find these moments or like, okay, the average drive is eight minutes to a preschool. What do I do with the kid in the car? And okay, I've got to watch, listen to story pirates because it's actually an audio experience. And then also I just think that people's parents, including myself, with a six year old, especially during this time is really trying to figure out, how do I get my kid off the iPad? And if I can get them into more of imagination through sound and actually creating worlds just for the kids. I think that's a big deal. Yeah, so anyway, that was longer than my two cents or two seconds, but I do, I think audio- No, no, but this is why we wanted you on and this is why I wanted that question. I think your point, when you listen to some of the incredible storytellers of the 1970s, 1960s, a lot of them refer to sitting around the radio and listening pre-TV as an incredible driver for their capacity for imagination. And I think why not replicate that? I like that, Roy? When you all, let's just talk about the pivot at Nickelodeon, the cultural pivot, not COVID, but with George Floyd and just totally as a company, what were some of the internal discussions that you all had as you started making the decision over it? Because I feel like the corporations and networks, there was kind of a staggering of which companies and which media started doing stuff. And I feel like Nickelodeon was at the front of that. Where was the decision? Talk me through the decision to be one of the first networks to make a bold statement. And you can tell everybody what the statement was with the 846. Yeah, so it wasn't hard at all. And that was, I think we realized very quickly what side we wanted to be on. And Viacom, CBS came out with, we're gonna go dark, Bob came out, we're gonna go dark for eight minutes and 46 seconds. And we said, who's participating? And I have to give credit to my boss, Brian Robbins, didn't waste one second and said every single network, including Nick Jr. We did wanna make a statement in regards to where our support lies. We also truly, truly believe that education and enlightenment starts at a very young age and that we have the platform to help start education and actually foster those difficult conversations but also help educate and enlighten is the word that we like to use. So not just entertain but also enlighten. And so it was a very simple decision to go dark for eight minutes and 46 seconds. And so there was a couple of different spots. There was a George Floyd, eight minutes and 46 seconds of a man breathing, a very, very provocative that caused a lot of conversation, I will say, on Twitter and social just about how to talk to children. And we also ran a kids bill of rights for eight minutes and 46 seconds. So about you have the right to be heard, you have the right to not be judged by the color of your skin, you have the right to an education. That's turned into a much larger campaign that we're running. But that also, so there was, it was a very easy decision for us. And we believe all the conversation really opened up to say, listen, we can actually talk to our kids about more difficult things. And it allowed us to say, listen, we're treating our children like with kid gloves. And we're also treating our children, some people have different experience and some kids live in fear every day. And we owe it to ourselves for white children, for black children to open this conversation because racism starts between the ages of two and four and is embedded by age 12. And I think that we have them in the sweet spot, two to 11. And so we cannot not help in this situation. And thus I think then moving on to the Juneteenth education that we did on that Friday the 19th. And then moving to Alicia Keys, we did another town hall for race, kids and unity that again, you could watch on YouTube if you'd like. It's a really incredible, some schools have picked it up to sort of teach and help start the conversation. But it was not hard for us at all. And we're continuing to, I've now made this an initiative at Nickelodeon where we're putting money behind it and I'm working with Maverick Carter, LeBron's company and we're hopefully working with them. We're coming up with ways we could work together to develop content where there's short form, long form, that this is not just a campaign, it's a sustained effort that we continue to do both inside the company and outside the company, meaning diversifier employees also, as well as our vendors and our outside, behind the camera and front of the camera. It's become a huge initiative for us and we are definitely not slowing down. What's the biggest challenge for you and your executive team during COVID itself when it first hit? Were you surprised by any of the remote capabilities or did you feel like that was going to work out? You have obviously worked in some progressive companies in the past, did you yourself, are you missing random interactions in the office and travel or are you loving this? Like a little bit of just like the insights to leaders during this time. I think it's incredible how people have creatively pivoted and sort of embraced and solved a lot of the creative adaptability, if you will. So yes, I think we all miss a little bit of those hallway conversations and we miss being able to basically just knock on, walk in and talk to somebody. But I think what's been really great is we've been able to figure out how to do our work, even if it comes down to shoots, like working with families to shoot themselves. And I think what we've, I think Gary, you and I talked a little bit about this is sort of the humanistic approach with the stuff we're doing now is a lot less polished and actually it's working better for us because it's more human and it's more about actually families and them interacting together. So I think that's been a really positive. Also the hardest thing for us is that not being in production with new shows. So we're coming up, we're not able to go on set. So I think just keeping the content alive, meaning that we're coming up with shows like Unfiltered, which is sort of a game show that we do completely remotely. We have these Danger 4 Shorts, we're doing completely remote. Our marketing team is now developing shows. We developed a SpongeBob fan favorite special with the cast rereading. You should go check it out. It's really fun. I will. They're on YouTube, but they're acting out famous scenes. And it's really great. So we're just coming up with kind of creative ideas of what programming could be because this might last for a really long time. Animation obviously. How won't the animations in a better spot than live action or filming? Do you feel like this is, like what's your personal, like any insights that I mean, are we looking at? At this point, it feels like the rest of this year is definitely not going to be the normal we knew prior to this. Is there programming concerns? Or because I was gonna just ask that, your animation chops, do you feel like you're sitting in a little bit of a better spot than maybe some of your contemporaries? I think we are setting, I mean, animation takes a really long time to do. So we're having to speed up that process a little bit, but it's really great. We have some amazing shows like Casa Grande, It's a Loud House, we have new SpongeBob, we have It's Pony, we just renewed. We've also just, you know, green lit a bunch of other things that will happen come next summer. So we're, I think we're in a very good place there. And I think we're also in a very good place that we've got an incredible YouTube team that comes from full screen run by Ashley Kaplan that actually can make incredible content remotely really well. So I think we're in a really good spot, but I would say that for the rest of this year, it is gonna be challenging, you know, especially with what's happening in California, how it seems to be getting worse at the moment, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll get a few things in and we're shooting some things in Vancouver, which is in a better space. So I think we're definitely gonna have a good Q4. And so that's, I think some people that are able to shoot, let's say in Europe might be at a better place, but if you can shoot in Canada, you know. Right, right, right, right, right, that makes a lot of sense. Right. As a parent, how much does that help you at your job? Immensely. Another reason I say, I take each job I take for a reason. One, I took audio, I wanted to learn audio. I took this job one because I wanted to see if I, well, one, I love Brian Robbins. I think he's an incredible leader and I always wanted to work for him. And I also just felt going and being at six years, sort of on the digital side, what could I bring to a linear channel that's evolving into digital to help it make that move? But it's also, I would be lying if I said it does, I can't, I love it that I'm a hero at my, that my six year old kid loves what I do and also loves the stuff I work on. But I also have a focus group of one here that I can like, bounce things off him and I run trailers behind him and sit, you know, in front of him. And so it's really incredible. And also it's really helped open dialogue. The thing we were talking about before with George Floyd and racism about how I talk to my child. And it's helped that figure out like, how do I talk to a kindergartner about racism? He's gonna be in first grade. And how do I talk to a sixth, like a sixth grader? And it's very different. And so we're finding these ways to figure out how do I make the most impact with each age? So I do have one focus group of one here that's six that I can bounce some things off of. Can, a really important question for me. Can you please go to some sort of warehouse and steal some rare teenage mutant ninja turtle stuff for me so I can flip it on eBay? Is that, can we make that trade? Is that, is that allowed? No comment on this big part, but we do have some new we have some new teenage ninja turtle stuff coming up, which I'm super excited about. Is it, you know, one thing I'm very fascinated with, I just heard new SpongeBob, new TMNT, right? Like, it's kind of intriguing. Just give a little glimpse into this that I think a lot of viewers wouldn't think about, which is the incredible opportunity that once a franchise does hit that status, it really does play, quote unquote, in perpetuity. Like, you actually get to reboot, restructure, think about, spin off. It is a real gift to be able to play with these kind of franchises. It's also probably a huge responsibility. I'm sure there's a lot of emotion and politics behind it, but it is fascinating. I mean, just when I heard you say, you know, some new SpongeBob, I'm like, ooh, you know, TMNT, ooh. Like, like it's powerful to have these franchises, thoughts. Extremely powerful for us. And just also we have the whole CP side of this. So we know that, you know, that from a plush perspective, like like Blue's Clues right now is the number one toy in Walmart even during this period of time. I think people are looking for some comfort, but we have that whole side of where it actually, we can actually touch lives in a bunch of different areas when we create these franchise, but like SpongeBob, yes, new SpongeBob still plays incredibly well. And then also the spin offs, like we're talking, we have Camp Coral coming up, we have a Patrick Star spin off, we have a Sandy Cheek spin off. So we really are able to build on that franchise because all of the characters are so rich. And then working on the Broadway play that we aired us also the SpongeBob musical, if you haven't seen that, it is so fun. But it's really, it really takes it into a different realm, but also just as the same humor. I thought that was super, I saw it, it was super clever. Like that was a challenge. Oh, huge challenge. When I first heard it, I'm like, I thought it was extremely well done. Not, by the way, not like, I was pumped. I was like, I'm an operator. So I'm like, ooh, how the hell would I operate that? Like, where are you going creatively with that? I thought it was super clever where they took that. I think the biggest thing that was hard is that SpongeBob doesn't know people exist. So he doesn't really understand the world. And so then you've got people playing SpongeBob and Patrick. And so there's that little suspension of disbelief you have to create. And those characters have to really embody those characters under the sea in Bikini Bottom. And they did an incredible job. So, Sheddy, you did an incredible job here. Thank you for your time. Hope you have a great, great rest of the week. And thank you for your leadership in marketing community. Thank you so much. And thanks for having me. It's good to see all of you. Bye-bye. Hey, everybody on YouTube. First of all, thank you so much. So humbled for your time. I don't want to watch, but time is the biggest asset. So thank you for watching that video. If you got some value out of that, there's plenty more where that came from. Feel free to check it out.
