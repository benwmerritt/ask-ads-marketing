## Transcript
I've had a six figure car detailing business for eight years. Love and congrats. It's been great, but I don't like it anymore. I know I want to do my own thing and specifically streaming like in fortnight specifically. Are you doing it at night? Yes. And how's it going? So slow. Yeah. How do you make content that's like stands out by you being your full self? By you talking about guitars, by you talking about car dealing, by you talking about your Candice, you got to make four night videos and you got to get them to know you. You got to tell about life stories while you're playing, make the jokes that you're making. You have to make it you. Right. Everybody's generic out here. And even worse, everyone's trying to figure out the hack to go viral. Aaron, let's get the first question. When you're building your side hustle outside of your nine to five, when do you know the right time to jump and go all in on your side business? The second you can eat shit for a year. Now, whether that is you saved enough money and you're willing to go there or you don't give a fuck and you're willing to give up a lot of luxuries. You can pay your basic needs like roof over your head and transportation. Right. But if it's really burning a hole in your heart in your stomach, not your heart, you know, you may even decide to take public transportation instead of having a car and you give up your lease. This is about how much you're willing to like be resilient. Right. How much do you love your passion? But I will say this Aaron, this is super common. This is incredibly common. A lot of people do not jump when let's let me just paint you this picture. You make 93,000 in your job and your side hustle is making $2,000 a month. So you're thinking 93 K and 24 K, but your side hustle is getting so little of your time because you have a job. If you're at 93 K and income and 24,000 inside hustle, you're likely when you jump going to do 100 K inside hustle because you have so many more hours. This is the math. This is the calculus that most people don't get. Sid, you've never heard this from me. This has been I see how you react. This is one of my best pieces of content. You make 93 K in salary. You make 24,000 inside hustle. But when you jump and do side hustle, you make 100 K inside hustle and now you're thrilled. You have more flexibility. People think you have to have like even, even you make 100 K. You need to get to 100 K because you got to pay your bills. You don't realize that those 40 50 60 hours per week. If you've been able to make 24 K with a couple of hours a week when you go all in plus you're happy plus your 40 hours are not equal. Your 40 hours at work are shitty out. Your C minus your 40 hours on your on your new found primary hustle is a plus hour. So it's compounded. That's the answer. How are you my friend? Gary, what's up bro? What's up my man? Where are you calling from? Derek Hughes, New York. You actually know who I am. Oh, I know who you are. I just don't know where you live. It's good to see you, bro. Derek Hughes, New York. Hughes. I love it. We're orange all the way. I know it brother. How's life? So I'm chilling. I own the financial practice. I work with blue collar people just helping them out with their financial affairs or investments to retire myself. Not that I've lost my way, but like I've lost a little ambition. I lost a little, you know, just go getting attitude. You know what I mean? So why I mean, I don't know. Do I like it? Do I want to try something else? Do I want to add different streams of income? Have you contemplated a side hustle? I have. And where do you go? Where do you go in your mind when you think about side hustle? So my goal is to start like so I want to start a business in a practice. Do something down in like the Boca area, right? So this so you want to move you're tired of the snow. I mean, yeah, I mean, nobody wants. I don't want to live here the whole year. You know, I mean, yeah, it's beautiful. It's beautiful right now. But like, are you a Bill's fan? I am. So I lived in Chicago when I was a kid. Oh, you're a Bears fan. I love it. That's much better. That's much better. Good. And 85. Yeah. Right. You just missed it. Okay. So so move to Boca. I'd love to. I got to, you know, I've got a family that, you know, there's. You know, what are the dynamics? So we're breaking into it like I'm split right now with my wife, which is very hard right now. And regardless of what happens there, I still have a son who is of course years of high school. So I can't get a little on your golden. You're good, bro. Do you know how many people are in the exact same situation with you with three kids under seven? You're fucking your moonwalking. Your boy is fucking going to college or not college in like three minutes. You're good. Thirty six months is nothing. Right. In fact, that's actually perfect. You can like start putting the pieces together for 36 months from now. But nothing like I don't just need. I don't want to abandon anybody. Right. You're not. That's what I meant. Like you're actually. Notice what I said. You're not abandoning anyone. You're staying in fucking queues for three more years. Which it's lovely all in itself. But at the end of the day, it's 36 months. This is where do I take time if I jerk for going down there once a month for a week and trying to set stuff up and you know what I mean? Definitely not. Definitely not a jerk. I mean, obviously it depends on how you got custody going down and what's going on and you know, obviously so much depends on how your wife or future x way for not x way or whatever happens here. I don't want to get in your personal business, but there's she's great. Like, you know what I mean? So I mean, honestly, think about what you just said. Like in the tough situation of a marital split, right? A you have a child only one and they're already 14156 like right there. They're in striking distance to like their chapter 18 on and you're in the heat of this very tough situation and you just said she's great. So you're very fortunate. Like you are way ahead of most people. So I think if you're over communicating to her and your son, you would be able to find many weekends or many five days or maybe four days and maybe seven days and maybe even ten days because she and the son go on like a vacation and you got like you're going to find two, three, five, seven day windows over these next 36 months to set it up. I love to set it up with all of them, you know what I mean? But how do I try? I'm not going to try to relocate. You're not going to. It doesn't. Yeah, you're not going to Abbey fish with the big one. What? Blind box. Okay, we'll open that up brother. It sounds like you're not ready to do that right now and that's okay. Like you're going to have to eat a little bit of patience and that's I respect that. You're a man. You have responsibilities and you just, you know, this is what's so awesome about being a kid. When you're a kid, you could be 100% selfish. When you become a fucking man, you become 100% selfless. I respect the fuck out of you for that. Yeah. So you just maybe just not even making any moves until we figure out that I know you're missing again. You're going black and white. Let's go back. You're making a lot of moves. You're going down to Boca a fuckload every second you can every second. You don't have a responsibility to your son and every second that you can afford to be down there. You're down there. Setting up shop networking, going to events there, looking at locations, trying to get your name out there, making content out there, networking, getting a feel for it. Maybe you don't even like it like you thought you did. You might start fucking going down there once, you know, for the first year and be like, fuck Boca. You know what I mean? I like Boca Del Rey that that like area doesn't have to be with the 85 year olds, but like, you know, there's certain things that I think we can make money on and I think we could take a take advantage of the area and you're thinking, you're thinking all the time. You're thinking all or nothing. I think you can. I got a lot of shit going through my head and a lot of things. You know what I mean? I'm here to simplify. I'm here. I'm here to fucking help you. That's why we love you. That's why I love you back. I loved you first. That's why I'm doing it. Listen to me. It sounds like you'd be down in fucking Boca if you can afford the flights and the stay. It sounds like you could be down there fucking 60, 70 days a year. Yeah, that's a fuckload. I like that. Yeah. This is perfect actually. In fact, I think people should do this even when they have complete flexibility. Instead of just jumping into the cold water, you put your little fucking toe in there, right? You know, I don't know how you jump into pools, but I like to put my little fucking toesie in there. You go all in. You're fucking gangster. Yeah. Honestly, I actually go more in now because sometimes I find out it puts out when I put my toe in there. Like, shit's cold. But if I don't know, it's like fuck it for a second. I'm good, right? But Matt, listen to me. 70 80 90 days 30 days 40 days that's gonna actually prep you proper by the way by doing that you may end up in Austin, Texas You may end up in fucking Miami you may have You know fuck with Miami, but I'll stay away from Texas fine You're allowed to go wherever the fuck yeah, I hate the fucking Cowboys too like you know Whatever it might be like you know like you know whatever it might be Actually by the way on the record. I just did that for fun like I was improv I actually love the Cowboys because I hate the fucking Giants So I love the Eagles the commanders and the Cowboys I like the Redskins and the commanders and the Washington football team all three versions of them in the last decade That's how much I fucking hate the Giants. Fuck you giant fans. You fucking entitled fucking crying about the last decade not being good You motherfuckers won four Super Bowls in my fucking face Your second to the Patriots you motherfuckers Often Yankee fans to I'm a Yankee fan, but like you know super entitled motherfuckers Let's go Eagles fly fucking I like the Eagles I like the Cowboys and I like all 17 versions of the fucking Washington football team anyway Matt You're golden the fact that you have this situation you watch this Matt read the comments How many of you are separated from your former spouse and being separated? I mean, I don't know if we might get back together because I still love her and that's amazing Respect respect exactly watch this though. I want you to read the fucking comments How many you separated from your spouse and it is a very negative situation? It is not good. Say, that's me in the chat Say, that's me That's me. Don't say me say that's me Look at us. So the fact that you have so many people You know that are going you know and then again those people that have negative spouse social situations Also oftentimes have want to go on and move to Boca and do their thing But they have a four and two year old you came in with a fucking kid that's going into a sophomore year, right?

There's the fucking clip be happy that you're there for 65 days Which is unusual for people in your situation because the age of kids and Relationship with spouse or former spouse or working through it with spouse or whatever versus crying that you can't be there for 365 days And I talked to you when I first started my business and you're the you're the one that said just don't do your own Why are you remember I remember and I remember it's great and it makes me good money and I'm comfortable And but like is there a next step and yes, this is a 2.0 conversation Yeah, there's so much shit going on.

This hat is gonna be crazy The giveaway is up look at this awesome African simit this will be out in the fall Okay, this hat is crazy. I am awesome, which is why I wear this by the way Everyone should buy this everyone is awesome not on some like weird third grade teacher shit on some it's actually true And you motherfuckers believed your broken parents or you believed broken society or broken fucking spouse or girlfriend boyfriend Or broken best friend you listen to someone that was broken to tell you you're not awesome when you're fucking awesome Everyone's fucking awesome not on some rah-rah. I'm like a guidance counselor shit on some it's fucking true Shut the fuck up. You're fucking awesome And if you're watching right now, and you think you're not awesome someone put that in your head I'm looking to take it out of your fucking head But you don't get it Gary I've lost my whole life and Just because you've been losing doesn't mean you can't win I call it the Monday night miracle thesis Court do you know what the Monday night miracle is? I'm about to tell you the Monday night miracle you can Google it or chat you Bt it is when the New York Jets We're losing to the Miami Dolphins on Monday night football 30 to 7 with like 10 minutes left in the game and Came all the way back in one Just because you've sucked at life And you're 66 years old and go Gary fuck you right now like I triggered some feelings watching this and you're like it's not true I'm not awesome. I've lost that everything drug abuse lost my loved one like losing like by how we would all scare you know Consider it. I literally believe that you can win and Many have so many people especially when they get terminally ill they notice what happens you get terminally ill you change your behavior When you change your behavior good shit happens when you deploy love not hate so many have poison in their soul They got to get it out Aaron keep it going the question is if the best form of advertising is now organic social media How will companies that thrive off of paid for ads make money i.e. a news company? Why would companies pay for ads or brand deals if organic social media is cheaper and better? Because it's harder ads are guaranteed Organic reach is only based on your merit and in fact if you get Virality in an organic post the next best practice is to amplify that creative or reuse it as an ad So paid advertising is phenomenal especially when you're buying under priced attention Underpriced attention sits in many places the Super Bowl if you can afford it is under priced Like I'm contemplating v-friends commercials for for in the Super Bowl in the future because I think it's underpriced if we can afford it One day I will do it So the ads are under priced on meta Instagram and Facebook It's just that if you start with organic, you know the creatives good and that's what you should be amplifying So it's both not or but for a lot of us right now that are watching should realize that it's an Opportunity because they don't have ad revenue, but they can win organically Understand so that's the key Okay, next question is from Doug. Do you feel organic reach is less now with Facebook advertising boosting reels for money? No, I Think it's more now Organic reaches higher now for good content and lower for bad. I think it's more merit than ever I think is a Doug Doug Doug needs to look at himself and realize his content is Not good enough right now and he needs to mix it up It's I do think it's harder to be consistently great. I think competition has grown, but it's not the ads It's many more humans with organic content, but the good gets more and the bad gets less. It's more merit-based That is what is up. Everybody if you just joined first time on whatnot Please follow hit the icon in the top left. Please follow v friends on here bookmark shows I'm so excited for you to be here.

Okay, the question is from Paul the nepotism is alive and well in my workplace I'm one of the most qualified people there even over my younger managers. It is impossible to get ahead simply because I'm not from here I'm so tired of fighting it. I know you're going to say leave, but I need to hear it leave Like fucking leave leave leave leave leave leave like you can't fight it leave by the way leave everything You can't fight your mom for 60 years who has was bipolar or narcissist. You don't leave her. You just limit her It's either limit or leave loved ones limit non-love ones leave leave the job Like marriages a lot of people need to hear it's tough. I'm not advocating for that at least go through the therapy like work for it Like do something don't eat it either leave Either go for the work, which would be therapy exercise life is leave or work or shut your fucking mouth Because complaining limit or leave or put in the work or shut your fucking mouth Complaining and pointing figures is fucked Accountability to the max here's the nuance that almost no one sees Accountability even when you're right Being the bigger person even when you're right I have someone in my life who cannot go there because they can't forgive Lack of forgiveness is the poison that is ruining your life There's nothing Aaron you can say to me that would not allow me to forgive including the ultimate darkest shit that can come out of your mouth Let alone stealing money let alone Cheating let alone backstabbing let alone talking shit. These are things that people literally eliminate loved ones and friends for Literally, do you know many people right now have eliminated loved ones and friends for talking shit For talking shit as if they never talk shit You know what I love right now is like watching people shit on people as if they've never done anything wrong Even when they die Hulk Hogan died He fucking died and people were giving tributes and of course like every other human and he's done some bad stuff I get it, but I love those comments. I'm like I'd love to know what bad stuff you did Fucking tired of this bullshit. Can we get the fuck out of this matrix? This is why I'm doing tea with Gary V.

Okay next question How can teens today start learning how to build a business online while still creating emotional boundaries between who they are and what the algorithm rewards? That's a fun great question There's a lot of ways to think about this big shout out to Addison Ray who's been saying this I heard Mona listening to this I overheard it while she was listening Addison basically said You know, she did what she had to do on tiktok to get the fame and now she's quote-unquote different big who won did not Steven's View win Stephen that's amazing Stephen Congrats good big coat big part of the be friends community She said she did what she had to do and now she give me more of herself And I think a lot of kids can learn from that like you can make content that the out now you got to make content That's somewhat in you you can't like say shit. You don't believe or do shit You don't believe but if it's not all the way you the answer is both You can do both Right like you can do both. I do that all the time. You guys know this The post I did the other day with me and my dad doing a wine video You think I thought that was gonna over index the algorithm I sure did it and as you know said we're just we had a little moment on Instagram We were testing ads and doing things and it threw up our algo. We're just getting ourselves back We want to get into that organic reach system better for the algo and yet I still posted that video with me and dad because I want to post that video for me and dad because I promise you When my dad's gone, I'm gonna be happy that I posted that over getting an extra hundred thousand fucking views on fucking Instagram So the answer is both So that's it All right Who let me know if you picked up a kid sock in the store and you can get it for ten bucks if you use the code if you've never bought anything Next question. Let's keep it going tea with Gary Vee everybody on all my other socials We're on whatnot get over here Gary Vee comm slash whatnot download the app live social shopping massive trend in 20 27 20 28 I want you to be early on it Who's in whatnot right now of the 600 of you that this is the first time you're on the app say first time you just downloaded it Say first time also Adrienne could you put up v friends comm slash quiz all these first timers?

Okay. What's that? Oh, we're gonna open it already is the blaster packs in front of me. They're all blaster. No hobby Which how do I see again? If there's right, so this is the blast pack. We're giving this away. These are like what to 200 a box right now divided by How many packs eight in a blaster? 23 25 bucks. We're giving this away. You can get your first chrome go to eBay and check this out You've got some stuff I can share with them. Ooh, do you have the comic book? Video yeah prep that up. Let me answer this question Then I need to show all of you something if I'm literally building the next Marvel and Pokemon at least that's my ambition Obviously, I know that's a big stretch, but I'm going there literally in front of all of you Gary V business content friends in your eyes And you're not even knowing it. I'm gonna show you something that's gonna blow you away Also vfriends comm slash cartoons if you have a three to nine year old in your life Go to v friends YouTube kids channel. It's linked. Adrian's got it right there Okay, let's go to the next question. Okay, this question is from Muhammad How do you communicate with an employee who's in trouble at work? They really need our help, but they don't know how to ask and we don't know how to assist kind candor You know how to assist by telling the the honest truth with kindness And if you say that we don't know how to assist because you've been doing it already and they're not getting it Then you may have to cut bait. There's nothing worse than fight for me There's nothing worse than firing an employee But the reality is it took me into my early 40s Maybe even mid 40s if I'm being honest to realize you're doing them a favor not the reverse Because once they're dead on arrival and dead man dead woman walking in your organization, you're not doing anything right by them Let's keep it going I'm growing a brand and community called no me's that revolves around the tabletop role-playing game community My friends asked me to delegate tasks to them, but I noticed they start strong and then don't deliver They say they want to grow this community with me, but how do I keep them accountable so we can grow? By firing them and paying them Like yeah, like it doesn't sound like he's paying them So it's hard, you know, some people are motivated at first with passion But then they worry about other things like you have to know how to and by the way Some people don't need to get paid and they're motivated by the joy and they would do it for free and that's awesome But that's a small percentage and then if you're paying someone or not paying someone and they're not doing a task You release them of that task That's what leadership and ownership looks like that's the responsibility Let's keep it going Okay question from Laura. I'm 41 years old trying to build a brand But it's hard because I'm shy and I feel but I feel I have so much to give I'm also very self-conscious about my accent. Can you give me some advice, please? Look, this is the classic question, right? Like, you know First when she was saying she was shy I was gonna tell her she doesn't have to be on camera Then she threw me a double curveball by saying she's worried about her accent big win for the J. Max 79 What did they win a pack another pack what? Another another blast break I'll open in a second. So look here's the punchline Either get over it or you're you don't like if someone makes fun of you for your accent if someone makes fun of you Whether you're seven or seventy seven I'm gonna say this slow if someone makes fun of you they the person making fun of you is a piece of shit or And in actuality, they're the one that's hurting Literally no one that makes fun of me upsets me what they get for me is compassion empathy and sympathy They are hurting Nobody who's not hurting makes fun of people. I do not make fun of people nor have I ever made fun of people a little Razz little like, you know Jersey boy shit, but I've never really actually Tried to hurt someone's feeling because I got very fortunate luck of the draw DNA wise Circumstances environment and most of all mother who made me not hurt Thus, why would I be hurting hurting only comes from a hurt place? So if she's worried about her accent is her strength not her vulnerability her accent makes her first of all incredibly relevant to a lot of people and Then to everyone else. It's just a nuance. It's I wish I do you know Do you know much bigger I would be if I had an Ivan Drago like accent if I was like you are an asshole Like that would be way better How old are you like that would crush? Stop fucking watching lost. I would fucking dominate Sid I'd have 80 million followers and set a 10.8 on Instagram if I had a real fucking Ivan Drago I must break you I would fucking dominate in fact with AI I might go accent I might go Russian accent for a decade all content Russian accent only all of it Only hurt people make you hurt Understand like I would fucking dominate Accent is strength Fuck I That's where I'm at. All right, let's open up this pack who won The J-Mac J-Mac oof fearless fairy in here true shark ooh a Common sense cow number to 199 what I hit this is a nice little hit and a fearless fairy that I'm gonna auto Which is gonna give value? That is a big win for the person that got it. Oh, we did we had a giveaway right somebody won this box who won this Abby Abby Congrats you got the heart trooper big shout out Jeremy The heart trooper all right, so we got that and then what was there another winner? Blaster pack for who? Cookie cookie with the blaster pack here we go. That's a hobby.
