The second you own what I'm about to say is the second you're gonna explode. Quality of my post is insane, but I'm not getting a lot of engagement. Not true, not true. Excuse City USA. When you say the quality of my content is insane, immediately you're in that place that I'm trying to get everybody out of. I secretly get more excited when my content doesn't do well and I get like fired up because I love the humility that comes along with it. I never think my content's insane unless it gets a load of views. Let's break down the answers. Number one, how much content are you producing for the company on LinkedIn? On an everyday basis, don't bullshit me. I have been living on LinkedIn, dude. I built a beautiful profile. I did it myself. I've been spending hours a day and it's finally just as of yesterday to the point where warm, inbound leads are coming to my inbox and the page is working for me. So it's beautiful. More, more. And when you say working it, are you cold emailing or are you making content? Are you replying to comments? What are you doing? All of the above, but right now I'm at the point where my page is set up nicely. So I'm engaging to try to obviously get more people and more folks. What's the name of the company? It's MXNN Creates. And our AI research division is SILZO. And again, we have our own proprietary AI model that we've already developed. It's in V1 Alpha and we're using it on every one of our projects. And one more time, when you said my page is now set up, it's your personal account that's posting the content or the two companies posting the content. I have the company pages up. I haven't really worked on that much. I just focused on myself first because of my credibility, my work history, all that really. And you yourself, if I go to your LinkedIn right now, I will see posts from you multiple times a day? Absolutely dude. I have a lot of, quality of my posts is insane, but I'm not getting a lot of engagement. Well, that means it's not true. Not true, not true. Excuse City USA. My team will tell you all these characters, they will tell you, I secretly get more excited when my content doesn't do well. Like right now, the last three or four posts on Instagram, I'm like, eh, and I get like fired up because I love the humility that comes along with it. I never think my content's insane unless it gets a fuckload of views. Fair enough. And so you know your shit. I can feel it even in just the words. Yeah. Doesn't mean that you're great at content creation yet. Doesn't mean that you figured out LinkedIn and back to humility, it ebbs and flows. There's like, a year ago today, we were terrible on Instagram. The last four months of this year, we got our shit together. So yes, you may feel confident in knowing how you trained your AI. You may feel confident in your coding ability, your front end, your UX. But that doesn't mean that your content's insane. It actually means that it might be mundane because there's a lot of people that know it. So you've got to really think about the first three seconds, the thumbnail, the headline, the copy, and then the other thing, because I heard you say yes, so I'm gonna believe you, searching more on LinkedIn on things you know about and leaving very thoughtful comments on posts that are doing well. What we call Cassie at VaynerX, comments as creative, going and being very thoughtful. This is good advice for everyone. Whatever genre you're in, going to a social media post, consuming it in your business, and then leaving a very good comment, whether it's very funny and that's good for your brand, those are usually the ones that get to the top, or in his scenario, just fucking six sentences breaking it down while the person's 90% right, but did they think about this one thing, humbly but with authority, and somebody reads that and goes, who the fuck is this guy? That. So I'm a content creator and in the health niche, genetics and longevity, and I was wondering how can I integrate whatnot? Do you sell any physical product, Mila? Not yet, I'm waiting for my studies to be done by the end of this year, and I will be selling coachings, and I'm writing a book also, yeah. When you have something to sell, then I think whatnot becomes a very smart platform for you. But until then, I would rather see you go live on TikTok to have people discover you. When you go live on TikTok, it shows your live in People's 4U page, and then they'll discover you. And I think right now, as you're building up your profile, you need discoverability, does that make sense? All right, yeah. But how can I build a following on whatnot? Do not become overly emotional about whatnot, as excited as I am for everyone about whatnot. I'm excited if you are selling something physical, understood? All right, yeah. But so I wanna make sure that you don't force it just because Gary Vee is saying beyond whatnot, if your product doesn't fit it, right now what you need to focus on is you have to be on TikTok Live. You have to be on TikTok Live. Okay, okay. All right. So you're prioritizing TikTok Live. Yes. You're on Instagram. And teaching people about all the knowledge that you have. I would love to use whatnot. I'm thinking middle of May. How do I walk that fine line between building up my brand to make whatnot worth it? But at the same time, do you like the short-term left hooks because I gotta get paid because I've been looking for a job? So how do I walk that fine line? By doing both. If this was a health show and you're like, Gary, I'd like to lose 20 pounds and get stronger. You have to both actually go in the gym and work on gaining muscle while also eating a very different way than you've been eating. Two very different activities for the same goal. Right? Right. You're asking for a financial goal. Right? And so you've got to ask and build brand in parallel both at the same time. What you've been not doing is building brand. I realized I was late to the game and I realized that. But by the way, don't get crippled by late to the game. This hurts everyone. They're like, I was late to the game. I've heard you talk about this for seven years, Gary. By the way, I was late to the game in my health and wellness. I didn't start getting serious until I was well into my 38th birthday. I wish me and Mike, my trainer, who I was with this morning, joke all the time that if I started at 28, I'd look like a fucking Adonis. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But instead I look halfway decent-ish. Yes. Bro, you look pretty good. You're looking pretty good. I respect that. So thank you. But that's the punchline, brother. Like please don't dwell that you're late to the game. Right. Please just start fucking doing the right thing, which is writing articles, making videos, putting out content on LinkedIn, the end. In terms of what not. So I understand what you're talking about. Talk to both of them. Build up the cohorts. I read your book many times. Yep. So focus on, you know, I guess the left hooks, if you will, for the short-term finances. Focus on building the brands. In terms to make what not makes sense. First of all, what not is amazing. And I love it and we're on it right now. I would say that if TikTok isn't banned, or if someone's watching right now that's not in America or India, TikTok shop does both because when you go on, like right now I'm on TikTok, a lot of these people are on for the first time because TikTok just randomly shows you to people. You can be found on what not, but not in the same way that you can on TikTok. But how do you make what not work? You sell something that's good or interesting and make TikTok and Instagram content to drive people to your what not. Right. And make good thumbnails on what not. You know when you open up the what not thing, you're looking at different shows, the thumbnail matters too. You gotta just keep practicing. What do you see that the future of what not are live shopping on bigger purchases? I think it's gonna be huge. We're gonna be ready. But I think it's something to come in the future. Right now it's a lot of small things, but what's your outlook on that? Yeah, I think QBC and Home Shopping Network proved this, Informercials proved this. I think you're right. I think people will buy 700, 900. I mean, we've sold $800 vending machines on what not very easily. So I think if you have a good product, and you know how to market it, and obviously with live streaming, what's amazing is you could literally take the phone with you and go driving around in the golf cart, get people excited, and that adrenaline creates a higher percentage of converting. I'm a big believer that in 2025, this year, that many people are going to sell items that are over $1,000 a unit on what not on TikTok Shop, on all the other live streaming that I predict will come out live social shopping. Excuse me, and so, yeah. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. We've taken on Instagram for EA Carts. No, we've taken EA Carts, we've taken your path with social media. We're about to sign one of the biggest golfers on YouTube. I don't think there's anything stopping you other than figuring out shipping and logistics and getting it right, but I mean, I think you should be on what not pretty quickly, almost weirdly in the same way you are. Are you fucking driving? No, so we're in the Uber. We're in the Uber. Okay, good, get in the back. They were drivers. Thank God, because you were just looking at me way too long consistently. I think that you should basically do this same exact thing. Sell on what not? I think you should be, somebody should be driving the cart while you're on live. You step out, you show it. I think you have a very good chance of doing it well. Don't guess or ponder if it's right. Do the action to find out if it's right. So last year, I launched the company with my friend. So basically what we do is we go to people that have Airbnb's and we take care of the Airbnb. Like we clean it, we change prices, and we have a small problem, which is that we don't know how to lead people to be 100% in it. Like we work with people and we always have to go back and say, please, can you do this again? Like can you do it a bit better? And like we don't know how to lead without being rude and without actually leading. They can't feel that they own it as much as you own it because they don't own it. Employees can't act like owners. If you want them to be like owners, you have to give them equity in the company. Yeah, I mean, well, they have equity. That's the problem. What do you mean? Me and my friend like did the hardest job of setting the website of trying to find clients. And we are actually working with other friends to just help us actually on the logistics. No, no, no. To not just say them, we will give them. You'll give them equity? Yeah. Okay, well, then good. Then you just gotta find people. Great, then you just gotta find people that are good. How many people have you tried? Two people. Great. You need to try 55 more people until you find four good ones. Okay. Promoting and firing is knowing, but hiring or partnering is guessing. And so you've gotta guess more. There is no right way. You're guessing. I'm a massage therapist and an energetic healer and moving into creating TikToks, Instagram, and I'm also an artist. So I'm trying to brand, and then we're kind of like you. We're into all sorts of collectibles as well. So I'm struggling creating my LLC so that we can protect our personal stuff. What do you mean you're struggling to create your LLC? You're struggling to come up with a name? Yeah, which is stupid because I'm an overthinker. You're not stupid, but you are overthinking it. Nobody, do you know what the LLC name of Wine Library is, my dad's liquor store? No. It's Stecklin and Walker LLC because he bought it from Harry Stecklin and John Walker. It means nothing. Do you know what my personal LLC is? That one of the ones that I use? Registered LLC is a tension at scale. Means nothing. What's your favorite color? Green. And what's your first name again? Rhonda. I literally want you to register Green Rhonda Austin LLC. That is the name of your LLC. I just named your LLC. It's called G-R-A-L-L-C. That is the name of your LLC. Go spend $267 over the fuck it is. Register your fucking LLC. Here's why. What you sell in front of that LLC can be a totally different brand name. I don't need you to overthink your LLC. That's silly. Do you understand? So I got a small scale card for thing business, I guess is the best way to put it. I sell trading cards. Love it. How do I scale from just being myself as a solo operator to just getting a little bit bigger with little to no... Money. Money, yeah, basically. I think the best way to do that, believe it or not, is add more things to your flip game. Basically I've stuck with cards for right now. So Pokemon, like Madness, okay. One it's expanding. Have you started your own whatnot channel on this platform yet? No. 100% you've got to do that. Because you're gonna be able to move inventory. One of the biggest problems with trading cards and anything when you're selling it for my dad at the Wine Library right now is sitting on inventory you can't sell. But when you're on whatnot and you put things up for auction, even though you might not sell it for top dollar, you're gonna be able to turn it into liquid. Right now where a lot of your money's sitting is in your inventory that hasn't sold, right? Right. I want you on whatnot this week. Okay. Doing auctions, starting this at a dollar and you'll build from there brother. I have the people who are looking for jobs and I in my LinkedIn contacts, I know the people who are looking for hiring, but I want to reach out to company in such a way that they give their openings to me and I directly filter and provide them the people. So how do you suggest me, you give me an advice of how do I go ahead with this in the best possible way? I think you know what to do. Like, you know, it's you're sitting in the middle on a Tuesday at a marketplace, people are coming in and then you're giving them recommendations. So I just think what I would say is high touch, right? High touch is what I would do. You've got to make sure you're giving the level of customer service, customer service, make sure that you're interacting on the phone, on Zoom, on email. Like make sure you're making the people that are using you feel valued. Make sense? Yes, yes. That's the game. My distinguisher is that I ensure that there is a personal touch in whatever I do. I guide them personally. That's it. And then as you get bigger, you want to hire people that capture your essence, you know, like are like you. Understand? What kind of content should like create as a beginner rapper? Well, then you've got to rap. Like you've got to put out your fucking freestyles. Yeah, but about TikTok, like what kind of content should I create to make it pop? Yeah, be good at rap. I don't know if in Poland they have this saying, but the saying goes, you can't put lipstick on a pig. If you make the TikTok flashy and cool and great, but you're not good at rapping, it won't succeed. If you don't make the TikTok special, but you just sit down and you rap into the camera and you're very good, it will work. When's the right time to choose saving an employee over losing business because of them? That's a rough question and a great question because I've always done too much save the employee. And I would argue that eight out of 10 times it was the wrong call. My bleeding heart and compassion was wrong. The problem is the two out of 10 times that I was right, it paid for the other eight wrong times. By kissing the ground and being thankful that you figured out that your employer is a piece of shit and you're out of that toxic, bullshit fucking loser company. Anyone who gets fired for asking for a promotion is so lucky to be the fuck out of there. I mean, people have asked for raises and promotions for me and I've explained to them why not, but it got me excited about trying to teach them a path of getting there. That's good intent. That boss is scaring that employee and every other employee so that they don't ask for more money. That is a manipulative fucked up toxic, bullshit company and that person, how should they react? By fucking saying, how the fucking Lula? Dealing with your job and your side hustle while mourning the loss of a father is a game of patience and grace to yourself. I believe that people need to be much more graceful to themselves when dealing with mourning. Everybody mourns differently. Some people go head first into their work the next day, literally the next day. Other people need an entire year to really calibrate the loss. You can't judge yourself in either. If people around you are like, Joey, you're just jumping back into work and not dealing with your feelings, that's okay, that might be true, but don't feel the pressure of other people's opinions on how you mourn. Everybody mourns their own way. If you're also not productive for a year, your business is down, your productivity is down, don't beat yourself up. We all mourn differently, give yourself grace. Humility, accountability at the top, right? And tenacity, so, oh, there we go. Hat, you gotta put your hat on. If you failed and you wanna get those investors to invest in you again or partners to work with you again, you gotta put on your hat. You gotta lean into humility, so you gotta own it with humility and accountability, and then you gotta be tenacious about over-communicating to them. The truth, the other thing I would say, brother, is you gotta give them a good deal the next time.
