I have this really interesting 2017 challenge. It is my belief that everybody has a ton of chachicas, ton of former, like clothes, ton of electronics, I'm trying to find my iPhone, but different generation iPhones, flip phone, thank you, camera, you know, iPhone 4 sitting in your closet, you know, a Ramman, one that's actually from 84, that'll probably go for nine bucks. Here's my big belief. My big belief is this, my friends, the 2017 Flip Challenge is this. I believe that if you amass the hours that you allocate to, you know, a iPhone game for three hours here, to when you're on the bus commuting for an hour, instead of just reading, escapism's important, but if you want the $21,000 that I think you'll get at the end of the year, and by the way, we're gonna have a 21,7 family thing at the end, we'll have like a $21,700 club and everybody who's hit it, maybe we'll all get together at the end of the year, let me figure that out. By the way, I just changed my mind, it's $20,170. The 2107, the $21,700 challenge means it's the year 2170. Yeah, I was like, what the hell? I was like driving a straight, I was like, anyway, we're gonna have a $20,170 challenge. No cheating and you need to be fresh. There's a bunch of people like Resi Resales and some of the other people that are already making tons of money. The Marshall's employees think I'm Santa Claus out here spending $2,000 on shoes. Little do they know I'm getting that online money. New fresh, you've never done it before or you've never massed more than $5,000 before and you're gonna do this $20,170 challenge. I believe if you take that one hour when you're commuting and actually search on eBay and search, what are clothes worth? What are hammers worth? Like what does this hammer worth? Do you reckon, what does this hammer go for? $20? Yeah, $7.99, veteran zero, especially we don't have it. Yeah, two hammers, $14. Where's the other hammer? Right. It's not two hammers, $14. That's just what we're like over the time. But you can easily go search hammer and you can go then to completed items, sold items and see what people are doing. Tens of, let's go ask Age Action. Bro, real quick, how many hours do you think you put in researching eBay's sold, how do we build our education? How many hours, really? What should we do? Realistically. We need thousands, right? But it's not that, it's not thousands. I get excited sometimes. I would say. We would get pumped on Friday nights. Let me tell you something. Yeah, do you have like two or three hours just that? On Friday nights, me and Age would literally be on Instant Messenger back in the day, pre-mobile and, right, pre-mobile. Yeah, it's a message. And 2003 too. I've been using this message in a long time. Yeah, we literally would stay, like we would have to get up, but we lived far away, I was in New York, he was in Hunter and County, New Jersey, I would go and drive, oh no, we met at Springfield because you were driving now. Anyway, nonetheless, we'd have to get up. We'd have to get up at four o'clock in the morning, five o'clock in the morning to go to these flea markets and then garage sales. And at midnight, we'll like send each other a link, like wait a minute, marbles are worth a lot of money. Buttons and jars. Do you have any video games? What do you think, Gary? What's the best you think you could do out of it? 40? Look at the ladies' mornings. I like it. Anyway, take every hour, every hour this year, to make this 21th day. I would say 150 to 300 hours. Okay, great. By the way, we only did it on like 15 categories. It's a never ending game. Well, because you want to be in a position, if you want to buy mugs, you got to be in a position that when you walk into a garage sale and they have 40 mugs and they're asking five bucks a piece, you can be able to cherry pick two of them. So that's why you have to go D. Expert, but AJ, the thing that's changed huge, you have to go. Right, you have your phone, you can look it up. Yeah. Really? You know, 40 to 200 boys and girls. All the pieces for 150. Can I make 150 bucks in 10 seconds at 7.30 in the morning? It's easier. You have a phone on you. You take your phone, you take the eBay app, you can literally scan some items if they have a UPC, but if not, you just search Flintstones mug, you go to completed items, you see how much it's sold for, how often it's sold, understand the supply and demand of the market, and if the person, by the way, mugs are a quarter, they're not five bucks a garage sale. They're a quarter, maybe a dollar, and you're like, I'll give you 50 cents, and if you can make nine bucks, it's also a great hobby, but most of all, here's the punchline. So many of you are trying to build a business, and you're begging for money, you're crippled by not having money. I have a huge community now on social networks, and there are, I don't know how many people wouldn't want to have $20,170 extra in their pocket, and a lot of you have bigger ambitions. I know a lot of you are about to say, oh, this is small, I don't need it, it's taking away time, I can be working on my business. I don't want you to take time away from your business. I don't want you to take time away from your family. I want you to take your time away from other dumb shit if you're complaining. If you don't complain, and you don't want the $20,170, then do you, play Call of Duty, watch fucking every bowl game. But if you're complaining, and you're struggling, and you're hungry, and you can't breathe because you want to win like me, well then do this, because every one of you has a foundation of between $500 and $5,000 worth of junk in your closet, attic, and garage basement right now. Every one of you, it's insane, even the poorest of us in America have stuff laying around, a jacket you're not wearing anymore, sneakers that are out of style. Those sneakers go for 19 bucks. I mean, Kee Rock, I really need you to spread a bunch of stuff from the social networks, like screens here while I'm yapping. I want people to see, I made 200 bucks today, I made 700 bucks today, I made 38 bucks today. The key is doing your homework. The one thing I want to make sure, I've seen a lot of you post and be successful, but you've sold your product for half the price, because you created a buy it now price that is half the price of its worth. This image that I sent to you, Rock, completed and sold items. You have to understand that, you have to understand what things sell for, and you have to understand if they sell. The reason it completed matters is you can see 58 people didn't sell that goofy toy, and one person got sold it for 18 bucks, and that's why you can't price it at 18 bucks buy it now, and think it's just gonna sell because the supply and demand is off. It always comes down to the work. This is the most practical real advice that I've given that actually generates dollars. It is massively important if you want to be successful in life to know and try and learn how to make money. If you don't learn that, you are vulnerable in any business or anything that you create. And so I'm very excited about this. Young and old, learning this craft because you learn supply and demand, you learn market conditions, you learn speed of execution, you learn so many things. This is the foundational execution of how AJ was built as a kid. So I'm excited about you doing it, but please make sure you do the work. And so many of you already, I'm seeing it, are pricing things way too early, way too high, and stuff's not selling, because you miraculously think people are gonna overpay, and way too low, because you were pumped to sell this sweater for $33, but it was worth 57. So there's strategies of listing it at 99 cents and letting the market take over, but if you're not good at listing the name, putting out the title, you may spell something wrong or not put the extra thing or not even know the nuance of it. There's millions of people, probably not. There's tens of thousands of people searching on eBay for your misplay, right? So do your homework, learn, search, learn how to search, play within it. I can put you there, but you've gotta take over and do the work to understand that marketplace. So put in those hours, learn, and don't be crippled. Don't be crippled that you sold this sweater for $33, 157. Those learning experiences are good too. So that's the punchline, that's the challenge. $20,170. In my opinion, easily made, easily made this year, if you take the three to 500 hours that you were gonna throw directly in the trash, doing jack shit, and applying it to becoming educated and learning the markets, we didn't get into buying stuff on Craigslifts, then flipping it on eBay, buying stuff on eBay and then selling it on Facebook Marketplace. Facebook Marketplace, I think is a huge arbitrage. A lot of people don't know, they're just posting stuff. Buy there, sell on eBay. There's also all these flipping apps, let's go, let go, or something. I gotta do the homework, but everything always matters. The photos matter. Posting it on social matters, but don't spam people because you'll lose them. Selling them on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace or Etsy matters. Buying t-shirts on eBay and then selling them as thrifty vintage stuff on Etsy may create a huge arbitrage, and you don't have to go garage selling and goodwill hunting. And so it's amazing how many things matter. Do you reckon I was just talking about the questions that are coming in? These are Google-able. Don't ask me, don't ask Resi Resels, who's crushing it, Google it. Like, it's all there, it's just the work. You want me to answer you in DM form real quick. You could have gotten the answer in four seconds if you actually put in the 15 minutes to click 17 different links and read and watch a couple of videos or read an article or two. And I do believe that an enormous amount of people in my community can make $20,170. This year, converting leisure time into flipping time, going to goodwill, going to garage sales. We're gonna go hard. We're gonna do some garage sale videos this summer, this spring, DRock, and that's the challenge ahead. ["D-Rock"] Hey DRock, hey Gary. John Gianni here. I've developed them on Instagram with my son Lex. So you wanted to know about selling these things on eBay. I grabbed this here at a garage sale in my neighborhood for $5 and less than 24 hours, I ended up selling it for $20 on eBay. Once I did that, my son Lex sold these two video games for $4 apiece. Thanks Gary. Thanks for all you guys do. Have a great day. For real though, I just dropped two Gs on some shoes. I'm mad at myself. I thought it was gonna be three Gs. I wasn't keeping track. About to pull up and get some pizza on the business card. You know, it goes when you drop a couple Gs, you gotta get some pepperoni and cheese. Gary, taking your advice and selling my collectibles from childhood to help fund my new company. Hey Gary, DRock. I'm on a roll with eBay and also Craigslist. Let's start with Craigslist. Yesterday morning, I sold two couches. I put them on Craigslist. They were gone by 5 o'clock yesterday, made $400. And now the eBay, I got these Christmas inflatables. Got the ugly Christmas sweater. Got a guy coming to meet me. Give me 40 bucks. I got a couple more on eBay. One's going for $95, seriously. Thanks Gary. And for five and more. Oh!
