Anyway, I have a question for you. I've emailed you so many times that your server has blocked me, right? Is that true? Okay. I got four bounce back emails like last week and they were like, sorry, you can't email. New email now. Okay, so quick question. Yes. What should blog comp blogs, right? People are bringing content, constant tremendous content, literally five times a day, right? Two audiences and doing well. What else should they be doing to prepare themselves to be more valuable in the next five years? Apart from that content. Okay, okay. I think video, I think video is a big separator. I think deeper niches, I think that people that are putting out content need to see white spaces. So like, you know, if three years ago you understood the combination of the right white space of where interests are going and the right media to deploy it. If you three years ago went all in on vegan green juice yoga lifestyle on Snapchat and you never wavered from three years ago today, you'd be a beast. And so like that's what I've done in my career, right? It was YouTube or Twitter. And then, you know, there was a pocket where it was, and Snapchat and YouTube, you know, YouTube again, live streaming, like, I think that's the white space that's hitting it in the hedge. But it's a white space that you're authentic to. Like, I didn't go to YouTube, I did wine. It's what I knew. I knew there was gonna be much bigger genres than wine. But I did wine because it's what I knew. So if you think that green juice is gonna be a space, before you do it, maybe you document your journey of learning about green juice, right? I do watch it. I do watch it for a year, right? So we have the, we have the watches. Watches, yeah. So we have a pretty large medium in that. And we do the video, we do content, we do all that stuff. But is there an evidence that there'd be no networking, nothing, just keep hitting it. Just keep hitting it. 18 months I did it and nobody gave a shit. My Facebook fan page from the beginning of the game till three weeks ago got me to 500,000 likes, right? All this, 500. In the last three weeks, it's gone from 500 to 720. Because it's just momentum. People like, like, it takes forever. It takes forever. Like, everyone's like, oh, overnight. I've been doing this my whole life. Like, I've been putting out content to the masses for 10 years in this market every day. And I think people don't realize what kind of consistency and timing, and then there's a moment in time that it pops. So just consistency, man. And try things, like musically, I think, important. You start looking for those white spaces. But Facebook and YouTube is a, like, stand out.
