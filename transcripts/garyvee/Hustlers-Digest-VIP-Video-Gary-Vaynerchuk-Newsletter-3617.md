["Win, Win, Win, Win"] One of the things that I need to expand on in a 2017 marketing conversation is the variable of Facebook creative in its ROI. Something that I'm tapping into is that 90% of digital execution is garbage. And so I think a lot of people hear me talk and they don't hear that I say, do Super Bowl because I think it's underpriced attention. I think they don't hear me say, do Live, Read, I Heart Radio because radio's underpriced. And I think what they do here is that Facebook is magically gonna work because it's underpriced attention. That is true. Facebook will give you the best at bat, in my opinion, to hit all Americans at the best price. The problem is the creative. If it's a shitty kind of blurry picture, if it's a picture from a print ad, if it's a video that you use as a pre-roll advertising, or a video that was actually your TV commercial, you're gonna lose because the creative is the variable. Once you have my attention, you've gotta get me excited to buy your thing. And we have not had enough conversation in the marketplace around the modern Facebook commercial. This one, two, three, four, five minute video that is a story that is compelling people to get excited about a product or service or mission. And I feel like I've even been too general and I will push harder, much harder, to make sure that people recognize how important that creative is. And that's when, you know, I just read Chipotle is spending more money on television. And I'm just sitting here saying, okay, they definitely could have done better if they put all that media money into Facebook. I just genuinely believe that. But I was like, but why would television work better than Facebook if that was a bake off? And the answer is, even though it would be still gonna be a crappy 30 second commercial, it is absolutely true that they could have made a very crappy, even crappier, even crappier commercial video on Facebook. And then that would be the reason that television could outperform Facebook in a here's $4 million, here's $4 million bake off. The creative is the variable and that debate and our attention to the good creative and the great videos that drive business results needs to absolutely happen for marketers, big and small, to be successful in the new environment.
