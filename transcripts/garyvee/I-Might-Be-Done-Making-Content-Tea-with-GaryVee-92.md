Honestly, that might be it. I'm retiring. It's a wrap. I'm upset. I'm not sure if I should ever make another piece of content in my life. It's sad, man. This is it. If I retired right now, just disappeared off the face of the earth, just built my little V friends in the back, like an executive. You know, like I did with Wine Library for all those years. Like, wasn't Gary, wasn't out front? I'm a businessman. I think it's over. We're all of it. All right, bye, instrument. I'm done. No, no, I'm done. I'm retired. I'm out. I'm retired. I do not do content anymore. Tee with Gary V in my office. I'm pretty excited about this. Welcome to episode 92. Big shout out to everybody who's watching on social, all the YouTube people. I see you, Michael G. I see you, Matt King. See you all. Kate Lee, Jolly. Great to see you. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Good morning. And obviously everybody on Instagram, I've got you on the side here, but please go to GaryVee.com slash whatnot. Download the app. Learn social shopping. Get on the Ask Gary Vee show. It is episode 92. It is gloomy as fuck outside, raining heavily here in New York City, but we are not going to let that put us down. All right, everybody, let's get into it. Aaron, what do you got? Okay, this question is from Joseph. Joseph. My theory is that AI content that replaces creative work that is supposed to evoke emotion or inspiration is going to fall flat and really connecting with audiences. There's part of me that believes consumers are going to say things like, I just don't connect with that brand anymore because there's no human on the other side of the content to connect with in terms of the content creator. Your thoughts. I think you're fucking spooling yourself because you're worried about it. Aaron, they're not going to be able to tell if it's a real person or not. The AI is fucking coming. The AI is fucking coming. I don't know what else to tell you. It's here. Like we're going to have to adjust to this. Like this is like somebody saying like, oh, this new tractor trailer, excuse me, the new tractor for farms. This is 1850, the tractor is invented. And everyone's like, ugh, like everybody works on a farm and all the farmers are like, no, no, we're not going to like the tractor. Like the machine is going to like fuck up the soil. Bro, it's here. It's here. And by the way, I do think it will be both. I need everyone to understand and. It's and. You know what I mean? It's and. People will absolutely value the AI stuff because they won't know. But I also think that it's going to be a place where the human part will also have value. And we will like both. And it's like the world is now. We like the phone and being in the phone all day. And we also like the plugging from the phone and going to take a hike or hang out with our friends. Like it's going to be and, but AI is here. And if you think like people are like, oh, that's an AI person. I'm not connecting with that. Cause it's a person. Mother fuckers connecting with only fan girls. That are AI right now. Please do not live in delusion where people are just like, oh, you know, like, I just don't understand what people are thinking. Like it's here. Stop trying to come up with excuses. Don't go on some weird ideology and understand we're fucking here. And we'll get through this and people will adjust. And will people lose their jobs? People are losing their jobs right now. Is anyone paying attention? UPS, massive layoffs. Target, massive layoffs, Amazon, massive layoffs. And by the way, white collar. That's why this one's going to hurt. Nobody was crying when it's like, oh, like the entry level, you know, when we were like robots are going to suck, you know, service in McDonald's. I didn't see all the white collar people crying for the $18 an hour, $9 an hour, $15 an hour employee that I got no problem. All of a sudden, AI is coming for that 300K fucking manager. And all of a sudden it's a problem. Oh, oh, oh, now, now it's a problem. Motherfucker, it's war out here. The fuck do you think this is? It's called business. It's fucking war. The fuck do you think these fucking bags are in my eyes from? You think it's because I'm chilling and drinking pina coladas in Jamaica? It's fucking war out here. It's business. Nobody owes you shit. Figured the fuck out. Fucking late at night, last night at 1130, thinking about the things VaynerMedia has to do to compete with AI that makes content for nothing in a world where I make most of my money-making content. The shit's coming. The fuck are we doing? You know it's coming. Adjust if you're a designer at an agency or a company and you don't have ideas. You're entry-level. You're not an ideas person. You're a mason, not an architect. Erin's my boss. She comes to me, she's like, make a blue bird, shitting from a mountain, pooping and saying that felt good. Make that. If that's what I do for a living, I'm like, yes ma'am, and I start making that for two hours in Photoshop, I'm in trouble. Cause Erin's gonna fucking prompt that. One more time, read what he said. Okay, my theory is that AI content that replaces creative work that is supposed to evoke emotion or inspiration is going to fall flat. Yeah, stop. No, you're wrong. You're 100% wrong. And you guys know me, I don't do that, what I just did. You're 100,000 billion trillion percent wrong. AI fucking girls on OnlyFans are making trillions. Let me ask you a question. What the fuck do you think AI girls are doing? They're evoking emotion and directions. You can't get an erection without emotion. Rips, you can't. Can you get an erection without emotion? Courtney? No, right? I mean, I don't know, I'm not a fucking doctor or scientist, but I have a funny feeling you can't. Like it's, you know, look, look, what are we in fucking junior high? We're grownups in here. I said erection, I didn't say boner. You didn't need to laugh. I used to fucking medical term. Can we be grownups in here? Shit, you guys. Next question. When your product is yourself, how do you balance the need to push constant content and the need to have some space for yourself to just be you and not the product? I could see three initial downsides. I get sick of seeing slash hearing myself, close friends, family get sick of seeing, hearing myself, or I get pulled into an unhealthy narcissism. It's a very simple question, but it's very hard to achieve, which is you need to just be in it with yourself. Like, you're not like narcissism, like I don't think people understand narcissism. Let's start with that. I don't believe people understand it. Putting out content every day. What's your intent? Are you me, me, me? Or are you we, we, we? Right? Like, what am I doing right now? I'm trying to provide a show for free, by the way, that I hope brings people a lot of value. Why would I feel bad about that? And why the fuck would I care if my family, my family can consume or not consume me as much as they want? Go find AJ, said real quick. Watch this. We're gonna find AJ. Find AJ. And then getting sick of yourself, why? And by the way, if you're sick of yourself, don't post. This goes back to like, you're in full control. My friends, the number one thing that will change everyone's life is understanding they're in full control. Full control. You are in full control. No one has control over you. Not your boss, not your government, not your mayor, not your fucking governor, not your president, not your mama, not your daddy, not your wife, not your husband, not your boyfriend, girlfriend. Like, you are 100% in control. You just are. So, you know, like, that's it. Like, it's really easy. AJ, come in here real quick. Make sure you're on the screen. This is my brother, AJ. He's in my family. AJ. Yeah. Do you consume all of my content that I post on social media? I do not. Do you consume any of it? Yeah. How much? Real answer. 10 to 15%. Great. Thank you, AJ. You're welcome. What was the punchline there? Punchline's like, if I post a lot, I'm worried that my family will get sick of me. Your family's in control of what they consume. If AJ wants to consume me, great. If he doesn't, great. Am I offended by 10 or 15%? Absolutely not. I'm thrilled. You know, Connor Stiller says, Gary, what's it feel like being 5'4? I have no idea. Cause I'm not 5'4, motherfucker. 5'8 1 half and you're fucking dick. What, bitch? How tall are you, Connor? Motherfucker. I'm just kidding. I love you, Con. All right, let's keep it going. YoShot says, what happened to the NFT things you used to do? It's fucking crushing. It's called V-Friends. I'm completely dominating. I'm building the next Pokemon right in everybody's face and my NFTs are fucking doing incredibly well considering the market's incredibly soft. So I fucking love it. I'm building it. The notorious ninja, to the person that asked, notorious ninja, your grandkids are gonna be wearing a notorious ninja fucking hoodie and you're gonna be like that fucking Gary Vee got me. You know why? Cause I'm not gonna fucking lose. You know why? Cause I don't give up. You know why? Cause I'm fucking talented. You know why? Because I fucking work. You know why? Cause I've been doing it. Love it. All right, we're giving away this notorious ninja signed comic book right now for free, for free. Giving it away right now. Yeah, by the way, there's nothing wrong with 5-4-5-2-5-1. I got a great friend who's 4-11 fucking dominating. Fucking hooking up with baddies and making paper. 4-11. It's just true. It's just true. All right, this is live. Giving it away, giving it away, giving it away. Yeah. Yeah, how tall is Russ? Russ is definitely, not 5-4-8, killing it. Hey everybody, I'm not gonna keep you long, but I've gotta tell you about GaryVee.com slash Stan. Stan Store, an incredible tech stack for creator entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial creators, is literally the tech stack based on what I wrote in Crush It and Crushing It, and really the thing almost all of you are trying to build. So if you are one of those people, go to the GaryVee Challenge that I've partnered up with this investment I made in Stan Store. I believe in this. I believe in it for you. You'll see why I love it. GaryVee.com slash Stan. Go check it out. Now back to the video. All right, let's keep it going. This question is from Chandler. I'm a- Chandler? Like from Friends? Yeah. Could be. All right. I'm a 26-year-old entrepreneur and recent college grad. Throughout school, I built my own business and kept a side hustle to pay my way through college. Now that I'm entering the job market, I'm realizing employers don't always value that kind of experience because my resume isn't traditional. After years of you preaching hustle and self-starting, how can someone like me translate grind into real professional growth or career opportunities? So he's saying that because he was doing a lot of side hustles and businesses and entrepreneur stuff that he feels his resume is thin to get a job now? It's not traditional. Who gives a fuck? Chandler, how many fucking jobs have you applied to? VaynerMedia, I don't even know if VaynerMedia looks at resumes. I sure don't. I hire like SVPs and VPs. I did two interviews yesterday, by the way, at the airport. Literally, these are three to $700,000 a year jobs. I have no clue where any candidate worked or what college they went to. Rips and I are the two smartest people at V-Friends. He skipped college. I went to Mount Ida. Bro, how many fucking people did you interview with? Like, here's the thing. Let me give you the greatest advice in life. Judge the judge. Judge the judge. That is the greatest piece of advice of all time. Think about what this kid's saying. He's 26, he's modern, he's like a grinder, all the good stuff. And now he's sad because traditional businesses aren't taking him or don't think it's a good enough resume. Motherfucker, Chandler, you don't, let me raw sue you right now. You don't want that job, bro. You don't want the job that's judging you for being contemporary. You don't want the girl that doesn't want you because you don't have enough money. You don't want the guy who's just looking at the aesthetics. You don't want, you don't want, you don't want the people that are judging the wrong shit. Judge the judge. And then if that judge is great, take their feedback heavily. And you know when I'm giving feedback, that it's valuable. I value my mom's feedback. I value people that have done certain things that I admire in a way that is admirable. The fuck is Chandler worried about a fucking conservative job that's built from yesterday, not taking him? And you know what the funniest part is, Erin? I don't think Chandler applied to that many jobs. That's the other thing that's got me all fucked up. People have made, here's another fucking gem. I'm on fire, you know what? The office might be the right place. I feel like I'm cozy here. Like this is my, this is my place. Here's another one. People have made unlimited ironclad decisions based on two to three pieces of feedback. This dude got three nos, maybe 50 by the way. By the way, I know it's not 50 and 50 is nothing. He got 50 nos and just decides, people decide like, oh three people didn't buy my comic book. And they're like, well I shouldn't sell comic books. Three girls didn't want to go on a date with me. Oh, I'm not like good. Like, you know, I did a what not show and only sold six dollars, like twice. Oh, like it's not for me. Oh, here's my favorite one. I've posted 16 times on Instagram and I haven't gone viral. The algorithms fucked or I suck. People fucking take no data and make definitive forever lifetime decisions. Got it? I need like 76 trillions like nos in a row before I'm like, damn, maybe I need 76 trillion rips. Actually 67, 67 trillion, I need 67 trillion nos in a row before I'm like, hmm, maybe I'm not built for this. People out here fucking giving up. People out here like not even playing baseball court. People like get one strike and they go back to the bench and sit down and fucking pout, let alone three. Aaron, what do you got? We've grown from the basement of our house to 15 employees doing six million a year. But my wife and I are still key members of day-to-day operations. How do we scale growth as a small business and when's the right time to hire a manager to help with the data? They're doing six million top line. They should done a long time ago. They're being greedy and want the money from the business for whatever else they want. You need to invest back in your business, not buy nicer stuff. When six million top line revenue, the answer was a year ago. I did Vayner from two to 45 million and did not change my $80,000 base salary. That's real life. One more employee, one more office, one couple more bucks for T&E to fly out and see a client. Your business is your child. You need to feed your child. People want to be entrepreneurs to take the money out of the business to buy a Lambo. When you're a real fucking gangster in your building shit, you're putting it back into the business. The business is getting the money, not you. What? What just happened? What? Let me say it again slow for kids in the back. The business is getting the money, not you. Wait a minute, Gary. I thought I could be an entrepreneur on Instagram and buy a fucking Roli and fucking buy a Lambo. Everything's gotta be fucking like nicknames now and shit too. I want a Roli and a Lambo and a PJ. No, no, no. The money goes into the business. I'm not gonna buy a Lambo. I'm not gonna buy a Lambo. I'm not gonna buy a Lambo. The money goes into the business. You're doing $6 million in fucking top line and you're crying about not having a manager? Bro, the answer was a year ago. Next. Hi, Gary. I stayed at my company too long, promises never materialized, and then the company split and I've basically been demoted back to a role I hated. I've had a breakdown and feel unable to seek another job. It's pretty bad. What the fuck do I do? What's the last part? I have had a breakdown, what? I've had a breakdown and feel unable to seek another job. It's pretty bad. Have a breakup. Come up, boy. What do you mean, you had a little loss? Like what, a business lied to you? Mwah! Mwah! What's this versus name? Dermot. Dermot, you're a gangster. Get over it. You got this, Dermot. Bro, you got this. Dermot, you got this. Yeah, bro, I'm pissed too. Like I'm sad. I'm sad that the business did that to you, but you did it to yourself too. Like meaning like you picked that job. You believe them. Like it happens. Why did you have a breakdown? Because here's why. Expectations fuck people up. This is, we're getting nitty gritty this morning. You want something big? Get the fuck out of the expectations business. Sid, do you know why I'm so happy? I expect nothing from nobody ever. You know that, you know me very well. I've seen you roll that way for 10 years. Nothing, in fact, it's insane. Like it's a flaw. I actually am not, by the way, I don't even think I have it. I need to like actually fix it a little bit. But having no expectations from anybody ever ironically makes me happy. There's some people that heard that. They're like, yeah, me too, but they're a cynical fucking negative dark bitch. Rips, do not be a cynical negative dark bitch. Do not, Rips, I'm very worried about. It's very important that you do not become a cynical negative dark bitch. As a matter of fact, Rips, we're gonna make a bad guy and V-Friend's called the cynical negative dark bitch. That's gonna be a V-Friend and a half. The reason that Ptermaik got caught is he had expectations. Well, Gary, how do you not have expectations when someone tells you? By not believing, by understanding that something might change. Shit changes. We're having a good morning. We're getting to the nitty gritty this morning. Anybody having a breakthrough this morning? Let me know in the whatnot. Let me know if you're having a, it's so funny, somebody said Rips is Gary's punching bag. Blacked up the reverse. Rips is my fucking son. I fucking love him with all my heart. We're having breakthroughs this morning. All right, let's keep it going. I turn CEOs and coaches to creators by building their personal brand to grow their business. I also help them use AI in the process. I'm currently focusing on coaching and digital projects. My question is, you mentioned that livestreams is the biggest trend. How do you recommend me to scale digital product sales using livestreams? Go live. Say this is what I'm selling. Are you interested and see how it sells? What you'll learn is you want to probably provide more value. You go live and you learn. The livestream is incredible. Obviously there's a Twitch and the kick crew that's like living kind of Truman show. Then there's what I'm doing right now. I'm live. I'm live. I'm providing value. Then also I might have sold some hats. Oh, giveaway winner. Monica SCR. I'm live. I'm live. I'm providing value. And then also I might have sold some hats. Oh, giveaway winner. Monica SCR. Monica. Yeah, Monica. By the way, Instagram, you could not win this because you're not on whatnot. Everybody else on social, get over to GaryVee.com slash whatnot. Aaron, back to you. It sometimes feels like everyone on LinkedIn is already an expert. What kind of content would you recommend for young professionals like me who want to grow a niche tech freelance business, targeting large corporations, but don't yet feel fully legitimate or experienced enough to share advice with others? Don't share advice. If you don't have advice, share the journey. Think about what I did. I fucking came out. What did I do? I didn't share advice. I shared why knowledge, because I had why knowledge. She can fucking put out content about what it's like to be a young professional growing up in the game. You know who can't do that? I can't. I'm getting up there. I'm 50 in two weeks. Guys, I'm 50 in two weeks. 50. I just want to answer Wes RV. The NFTs are working out tremendous, brother. V Friends is going to be one of the five winning NFT projects. Go check us out. Go to GaryVee.com slash VF. VF. You'll be blown. Wes, you'll love this RV. $24 million worth of NFTs sold last week. I know where NFT brands are, but I'm also 50 soon. I also know that when the Wall Street Journal said the internet was dead, because internet stocks collapsed in 2001, you were still probably, you know, sperm in your dad's dick. And so like, you don't know the history, but I do. All right, let's go, Aaron. If I had to focus on three skills in 2026 to build an empire in three to six years, what should be my focus? AI, AI and AI, one, two and three. Thank you. Move on. Why do I stop giving my all after a little success? And why do I care about others' opinions? Because you're insecure, Karen. And I get it. Your name's Karen. It was a tough era. You know, it was a tough era for Karen's. Like I can't blame her. I'm kidding. Karen, it's because you're insecure and that's okay. I think therapy is a good idea. I think hanging out with more positive people. Like I think listening to more positive content. The thing I'm most proud of about this show that we do in the morning here is it gets people's day right in the right mindset, accountability and optimism. AO. Accountability and optimism. AO. I'm not making that my new fucking, that might be my new fucking sound bite. That might be my new audio tag. AO. AO. Accountability and optimism. One of the biggest things Karen can do is continue to consume positive optimism. And I spew it and many, many others do. She's insecure and that's okay. You know, it's okay. That's right. Like life circumstances, DNA, parenting, something that happened in life. People can build, I've watched people around me. Said you know this. One of the weirdest things about Team Gary, people that stayed for three, four years, especially like the people that are with me every minute and filming me, literally their self-esteem changes under my watch. Because I'm doing for D Rock and Dustin what my mom did for me. It's harder for Aaron or, you know, like the further, you know, like Team Gary's structure in different ways, but the closer you get. You know, especially those people who are fucking just long night traveling, all that stuff. Look at Train. Big old Train. He can't keep up with me yet. Right, Train? Train's tired and shit. Sweaty and tired. Sick. Ain't some raw chicken or something he said the other day. He can't keep up yet. There he is. Train, you can literally feed him. Train, you can literally feel yourself getting, like right, the grind is making you tougher. Exactly. It's fucking war out here. Karen needs to surround herself with positive people. Rips, have you learned things from me? Aaron? Sid? And I've learned things from you guys. If we rub off on each other, it's called being a human. So let me ask you a question. Sid, have you been around negative people in your life? And as you grew up older, especially, because we spent so much time together, you started to understand what that meant and you understood that that shit actually was either putting deposits in you or you realized what you did not want to do. My father taught me what I didn't want to do. I love my dad. Everybody knows that. But fuck, man, that motherfucker taught me a ton of shit I didn't want to do. He taught me things I wanted to do. Be an honorable man taught me the fuck out of that. But that motherfucker taught me not how to treat fucking employees, taught me how I did not want to do business with people, taught me how I did not want to see the world. I did not want to be cynical or negative or everything's a fucking conspiracy. You want to be less fucking negative and cynical? Stop watching CNN and Fox. Stop consuming political people on the internet that are trying to control you through scaring you and telling you they can help you. Oh, they're gonna help you. I'm telling you all right now, I can't help you. I'm telling you all right now, I can't help you. You got people out there posing as, they're not even telling you that they can help you but they're tricking you into thinking that you can't and they can help you but they're not saying it. I'm out here kind of saying I am helping you like Q and A, let me help you and I'm telling you I can't help you. Uh-oh. Uh-oh, we're getting into real shit right now. Oh, we're getting into, well, hold on. We're getting, now I'm kind of breaking the vortex right now. You got motherfuckers out here disguising themselves as politicians and they're secretly telling you I'm gonna scare the fuck out of you left and right, blue and red, I'm gonna scare you so that you think I can help you. I'm out here spitting fucking truth. Warmth, good. And I'm telling you I can't help you. You can help you. You can help you. You can help you. AO! This is not, you know what? I think I found something. AO! Accountability and optimism. AO! Remember hacks on Jim Duggan? AO! Get the big two by four, I'm gonna be the AO! I'm trying to help you every fucking day and I can't help you. Motherfuckers out here are trying to trick you and scare you into thinking they can help you. They're all the fucking same. I'm gonna scare the fuck out of you by based on whatever how you see the world. It might be this, it might be that, right? Might be corporations, it might be immigrants. I'm gonna scare you and you're gonna think I can help you. Bullshit! I'm out here telling you real truth of like fucking mental health and business black and white advice. And I'm telling you I can't help you. AO! I can't help you. I can't help you. You can help yourself, period, and the story cut the bullshit. Honestly, I'm not sure if I should ever make another piece of content in my life. Honestly, that might be it. I'm retiring. It was a good one. That's it, it's over. I don't know what else, that's it. I mean, I don't know if I can ever say anything better. That's it, it's a wrap. I think I ended it. That'd be some shit. I may be a shit. In fact, one could argue this is it. Because if I retired right now and that was it, and it's like, I already be retired. And I actually did, just like disappeared off the face of the earth. Just built my little V friends in the back, like an executive, you know, like I did with Wine Library for all those years. Like Gary was an out front, I'm a businessman. I'm a fucking businessman, I'm not fucking content creator. No, I love being a content creator. I'm a fucking businessman, I'm fucking business, man. You know, like, GGs, I said it, I said it all right there. They're all out there trying to fucking trick you, and tell you to be fucking scared, and guess who can help you? Them. For their power, for them. And I'm out here fucking, fucking trying to do the fucking good work. Fuck man, playing on the macro and the micro, the mental health and the fucking self esteem, and then the fucking black and white, like live shopping, like here it is. Here's the money, here's the money. And I'm telling you, I can't help you. For the last five years, I think it's over. Like all of it, you're out of a job, AI replaced you. We did it, we did it, we fucking got to the punch line. Like, took us, you know, 20 years we got there. Wow, weird, sorry, bye Instagram. Bye, I'm done. That's it. Yeah, I think that we're gonna make another piece of content. So I just don't know what, I think I said it. So they're not doing Gary and Eli in an hour? I don't know man, I just think it's over. Like we did it. You wanted to start a show called Anne, and that's the new show. I don't even know, like, that's it, like I just feel like, that's it. That's the actual answer, man. I don't know what people, they don't get it, man. Like every one of these politicians is doing the same thing. It's just so obvious, like, everyone's walking around with fear. It's literally my most liberal and my most conservative friends are literally the same exact human being. They've just scared us. That's sad, man, I'm upset. People are just scared for no reason. There's nothing different. Everything's different and nothing's different. And there's been more scary times. You know? And there's, people are so capable, but they fucking have given up their will to men and women that have very bad intent on both sides of the aisle. It's so funny, Connors, Gary's lost it. I fucking found it. It's the reverse con, man. I fucking found it. Just so much opportunity. You know, like, we literally live in a world that is so opportunistic right now. There's never been more opportunity for people. Literally, you've got Gen Z fully believing that they're fucked because of one post on Instagram that says, Gen Z's fucked. And they use math that they wanna paint a certain picture. There are more millionaire 19-year-olds created this week than there were when I was 19. Than there were. Train. There are more millionaire 19-year-olds. You know, like, we work with them at VaynerMedia. I know influencers that my company has paid, you know, 800,000 to this year, 600,000 to just us, little or less. There's never been more opportunity. And people out here like, oh, it's over. The biggest thing I believe in in life is you find what you're looking for. I believe it's literally the primary belief of my life. My complete North Star. If you are looking for negativity, I have great news. There's unlimited negativity. And it's everywhere. We decide which one we're gonna pay attention to at this moment. This issue, that issue. There's 9,700 issues. There's concentration camps in China for people of a certain religion. Where's the talk? There's genocide all over Africa. Where's the talk? Like, there's everywhere, everything. There's always things. But complaining about it and posting on social, how about contributing to it? Somebody said, Gary, do your part, join the Senate. The Senate? I can't do shit in the Senate. Couldn't do what I'm doing right now if I was a Senator. Fuck you talking about. This is the greatest era to be born ever into being a grown up AI, all of it. All the, like, there's, like, did everybody get an F in history? Was I the only one that got an A in history? Or me? There's so much opportunity. What we're also in is in the greatest era of finger pointing. That's the part that we're not discussing. Mommy's fault, daddy's fault, mayor's fault, governor's fault, president's fault, country's fault. As if we weren't enough hate around gender and race, we decided to do age brackets. That's my favorite new shit in the last 10, 15 years. Rips. As if we didn't find enough things to not like about each other because we're so fucking lost. Look at this room. There's only fucking five of us. Gender, race, religions, fucking love. Why would I, how could I possibly not like you? Because you believe in something different? Or you look different? Or you, like, what are we talking about? Oh wait. We don't have enough things to be mad at each other about. Let's bracket people into their age and be mad at each other. Let's get the Gen Zers to hate the boomers and the boomers to hate the Gen Zers. That'll be fun. They're weaponizing hate, y'all. And I promise you when you're all 80, you'll realize there are things to the left and the right that were right and wrong. It's just life. You're in control. You're in control. You're in control. You're in control. You're in control. You're fucking in control. No matter what you cry about right now, you're in control. Please start listening to more positive and optimistic things. Please lean into accountability and optimism. A-O! And your life will be better. Look at that. Tonight. No, no, I'm done. I'm retired. I'm out, bro. I'm fucking retired. I do not do content anymore. You can be on the, you'll be selling the Funkos tonight, right? Yeah. Everybody, if you wanna watch our Funko show, well not our, if you wanna watch Ripsy's Funko show tonight, there's a logo at the top left. V-Friends, follow us, click it. You can bookmark our shows. But Ripsy, I'll be behind the scenes. Ripsy, I built Wine Library behind the scenes. I'm gonna build V-Friends behind the scenes. You're now the face. Okay. All right? I'm just super interested to see if you're actually gonna go tonight. I have no idea. I don't know. I retired. I do know actually. What am I telling you? I'm retired. I got to the punchline. All the negative people in the world aren't saying it overtly, but they're tricking you into believing that you should be scared, but I can help you. Relinquish your self-will and power and belief. Give it to me, because I can help you. I'm selling hope and optimism tactics, financially and emotionally, and I'm telling you I can't help you. Huh. That's some shit. But you can help you. I'm really proud of that. I needed to get to that point. Yeah, that's a good point, Walter. Wonder if I can write a book called I Can't Help You. AO347 says, Jesus, did Gary Vee end up on drugs? Nope. I've been on a consistent drug called gratitude. And the other thing that I love to shoot in my fucking chest, accountability. Everything in my life is my fault, thus rendering me very happy. I'm good. Goodbye. See you soon.
