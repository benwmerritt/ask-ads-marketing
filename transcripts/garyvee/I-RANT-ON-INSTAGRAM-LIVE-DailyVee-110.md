## Transcript
What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? I'm trying to get next to you, I try to play it like you. I'm playing like you don't matter, but deep down I gotta have you. And since you're so shy after all, we can blame the alcohol. That's a good excuse to say I love you. I love coconuts. It's too late. Super live. Wish I could juggle. Can you juggle? I feel the co- Well no, this is two. You gotta do three to actually juggle, right? I don't know how to juggle. You know how to juggle? Phil? I know how to juggle the universe, but coconuts? Nope. Okay, court. Looking for a job, I'll work for free and start off doing anything, even cleaning toilets. Gary Vee, I promise to be an asset. Alright, Courtney. VaynerMedia, looking for a job, I'll work for free and start off doing anything, even cleaning toilets. Gary Vee, I promise to be an asset. Courtney, you've got a meeting. Show me. I put up my two fingers for them to take a screenshot. Did you see this? It's everywhere. Oh my God, look at this. Wow. I'm gonna go back on Facebook Live. Excuse me. Instagram Live, but I'm not gonna say a word. I'm just gonna do that. I wanna see how many people know what it is. Alright, I can't do that anymore. Only because the 1500 people, I can't assume they were in the last stream and I feel like a dick. Anyway, I don't know if you guys saw this earlier, but it's crazy. If you go look at people that tagged me on Instagram, can other people see that view? Because that's my view of people tag. Can you go ahead? Oh, you're going to search? I go to your profile. Got it. Anyway, earlier today, I just wanna give a big shout out to everybody that was part of my earlier stream where I said, put this up. It's so sad that I didn't go to... Can you go to my account and you can see it? Other people tagged. So check this out. If you go to my account after this, go to my account and then see the little part where you can see where you're tagged. And I guess you can see it on my account and see where I was tagged. So many of you, of the 2600 of you, tagged the photo of me doing this. So you screenshot this. And then you guys left comments in your... Then you posted it on your Instagram and you tagged me and then you said, you know, why you follow me and things that nature. And then obviously people did that in stories too and use the act Gary Vee. And I just want to say thank you. That was amazing. The earlier... You know what's sad about Instagram Live is it doesn't record or save to your camera roll. And so DRock wasn't there. That was my fault. And I went crazy. How many people were part of the last session? Just say, I'm not gonna go to the last session. Just say part of it. So other people can see it was crazy because I was so fired up about this. Obviously this last week, last 10 days have been a remarkable virality for me. So many of you. Actually, how many of you in here are new in the last two weeks? I also put that I'm curious. But I think it's just been a... It's been crazy. The momentum, enormous growth here on Instagram. Obviously the new features have worked out. The 62nd Club has worked out. The videos have been fired. Oh DRock, what about that minute 10 second video that I made yesterday? Absolutely. Yeah, they've got it already? Yeah. Like, love it. Anyway, just wanted to say thank you. The new Colin show, the Ask Gary V Colin show, the new format. I hope you've checked that out. Go check that out on YouTube and Facebook. But most of all, I just want to thank everybody because basically the whole conversation was King Newby. Look at all these Newbies. Will Press New, Sport J.A. New, Deshaun, Boyd New. Love it. The part of it, part of it. Love it. Anyway, I miss you too, Coby. Anyway, I just... I was basically going crazy earlier this morning and did this thing because I wanted people to share because I was explaining what I want to accomplish here, which is I'm on a mission. And I mean a real mission to change the current narrative of people that are trying to change their lives, get motivated and then start their businesses and become successful. And I want to make it a practical conversation and I want to destroy. And I mean destroy all these people that are bottom feeding and genuinely doing the wrong thing by creating content and selling it to you guys, $300 e-books, courses. You know, yes sir. Neemey. Anything else for these guys? Making life? We got about 25 minutes before we got a break. Not a whole whole lot. You got tricks for them. Yeah, we'll figure something out. Cool, I'll come back. Okay. Anyway, I just wanted to create clarity because there's so many new people in here and really I wanted to get people to understand why I'm so desperate to continue to build my audience because I basically want every single person on earth to pay attention to what I have to say because I'm very confident of two things. One, for me, I know that I'm not asking for your money. I went in this great rant. The Iraq, I can't force it now so it's a lost moment but I was like, I don't want your money. I was like, I don't want your money. I want you to keep your money in your pocket. I just want your attention so I can show you what to do so you don't go and spend on these bullshit things so you do understand there's no shortcuts. So I was just like, I want to keep your fucking money in your pocket. And so I'm just trying to set the course. And so trying to get people to pass me on because there's people bottom feeding, there's people doing the wrong thing, there's people that don't have the right intent and they're taking advantage of people when they're in a sad place or when they're nervous or insecure. And so automobile, exotica, there's a shout out. This has what's up, baby. I want to make people to know that I'm focused. I'm focused on getting all, all the attention. I love you back, Aaron. All of the attention so I can do a couple things. Number one, my number one goal for all 27, 100, 2800 of you is one, first and foremost, to build self-esteem. I want all of you to be more confident tomorrow than you were yesterday because you're spending time paying attention to my crap because it's very simple. My crap speaks to this. Stop worrying about what you're not and start focusing on who you are. We all suck at shit. Do you know how quickly I would be fired if I had Tyler's job? I just don't. Do you rock at my job? Yeah. And if you rock at my job, yeah, I mean we'd all be fired because that's not what we're about. What you're good at and where your strengths lie, then you will win. And I'm tired of your mom saying you're a loser or your boyfriend saying you can't or your older brother because he's insecure, not giving you love or self-esteem so that you can succeed. I'm tired of the people closest to you because of their insecurities and weaknesses, giving you feedback and putting you in a parative, in a path that keeps you suppressed because they've got their insecurities. Do you guys know why I don't have a process of charging you? Do you know why there's no rabbit hole for you to give me your money? It's actually quite simple. It's because I make my money elsewhere. Do you know why I give you my best advice and why I build you up? Because I genuinely think you can't beat me. That I think I'm better. That if you fully replicate everything that I do, I will still beat you because I'm hungrier. I'm a machine. Do you know why I fucking date you? Do you know why I went, I traveled, I flew from LA to Atlanta for a meeting and then flew back on Sunday. And do you know how unfazed I was? I know I had some dark under my eyes in DailyVee. Lighting wasn't great and I naturally had them and I was tired as fuck. I'm just stronger than you. I'm just better than you and believe it or not, that's not a negative. That's what gives me the ability to give you everything I've got. I'll give you everything. I will give you everything I have. I will give you the best advice. If you're really smart, you'll pay attention to what I do and you can leverage that. I will encourage you. I will shoot it to you straight when you suck some shit. I will do everything that's in your best interest because if I do everything in your best interest, you will love me more. That's why I have the best community. I don't have the biggest. I'm the biggest. I'm the best. The best because the quality of the 3,200 people in this room is higher and I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why it's higher. It's higher because the majority of you have figured out why I'm different than the rest of the market. You've figured it out. You've figured out. You have figured out. You guys have figured out that I'm different. That my, my, uh, hey Rupert. Rupert. Rupert. I, uh, what am I doing? I'm going to film and then him? Cool. Good to see you brother. How's your flight? It's alright. Cool man. I'll see you probably in like 30, 25. We'll have to move it around, right? I'm just telling my community why I'm giving them the best content in the world. That's it. I'm just better than everybody else and that allows me to give it to you more and better and cleaner and you'll wait for the other shoe to drop and cynicism will prevail and you'll be confused by others and a lot of you are following people that aren't bringing value but they're selling you what you want to hear. I'm selling you what you don't want to hear. I'm selling you it's going to take a long time. That you have to figure out your skills. That it's hard. That it's a grind. That it's not attractive. That you might not be doing it the right way. I'm telling you that all of you might not be talented enough. I'm telling you the hard stuff. So you guys like me, aka give me your attention which I'm so thankful for and I will never take for granted and the reason I engage with you guys is because I'm so thankful. And so all my friends ask me why I waste my time being GaryVee because they recognize that they recognize that I can make more money not spending time. Like there's a lot of money making I could do in this 17 minutes that I'm doing right here. What they don't realize is I've already made enough money meaning of course I want to buy the jets but love and community is the greatest. This is the craziest feeling of my life. The craziest. I'm coming. The craziest feeling of my life and I appreciate you guys and I will always give you my best and forever. And it's time that you guys start really paying attention. I implore you guys to really pay attention to who Dave Sweet Home says jets still suck too. That's alright Dave. Let me see Dave Sweet. This is where I get a little gangster. Dave Sweet Home says jets still suck though. I'm clicking on his face. Hide live from Dave. Boom. See you Dave. Yes. Dave no longer can see your live streams. Sorry Dave. I'll continue to consume my content on regular Instagram. Anyway the one place I'm emotional and not practical is the jets. Don't fuck with my jets. I will hang up on your ass like you saw on DailyVee and I will block you. By the way Dave is the first whom I've ever blocked. People have come on and said I'm a scam artist. I'm the worst. Fuck you. You've seen the comments. No block. I never hide any of my comments. You say the jets suck. You're fucking out. Anyway love you guys. Have a great day. I will talk to you soon and I appreciate your attention. I will never take it for granted and I wish you super duper duper well. Oh Kaplan Pud. Let me just put up Pud. I don't have to go to this meeting but there's Pud pin. This guy right here. Phil Kaplan. Beast. Internet beast. Internet beast. Beast. Beast. How can I say? So help me understand this. What do you want to do? Because I think right now you're looking for money which I love because cash is oxygen and I appreciate that. Now do you live at home? I do live at home. I lived at the dorms right now. I actually that's why I did my brownie hustle so I can pay to live at the dorms but right now I'm going to live with my mom. Good. So what I'm trying to figure out is like how grimy you can be meaning I want to give you the most patience that you can you know that's the big thing right. You know about my self awareness thing and that's awesome because that's good. How about the patience thing like are you buying into my patience thing or is that like hard to think about eating shit until you're 27 for the next seven years of your life. I like to think long term and I like to think I think long term but I feel like because I'm so young I want to do things right away. Before you sell self awareness I think the best thing to happen is for you to use your self awareness about you to become successful so that you have something to stand on when you talk about self awareness and or you have to go and get you know a degree and sit on the back of psychology and that whole you know world. Those are your only two options because nobody's going to give a shit about your opinion on self awareness as a 20 year old just saying I like self awareness. They're just not going to care. That's true. You know they'll take your opinion. Now there's a what's that? It kind of sucks Gary. Who the fuck are you talking to? I mean I know and or you deployed that skill set for you to be successful and then you attributed to that you documented that and then you sold on that. I think you should spend the next month or two thinking about the things you love the most music, food, fashion, art. I don't care and that you should find something to sell and then use your CPA skills, your social skills, your selling skills and try to build something you sell. Sell something. What? Right. So with my two grand what do you think I should do right now? Keep it and or spend it on the initial inventory of the products you need to sell. Alright I got to go. I'm filming something. I hate to I mean I've gone way over. I'm like enjoying this conversation. Listen to me. Okay. You're 20. Okay. Do you know that if you lived an entire another life like you died right now and became alive again and lived your whole life you'd still be one year younger than me? Yeah that's crazy to think about. I need you to think about that because you will be cut. I need you to understand one thing. If you decide to give me any more of your attention all I want you to hear is one word. Patience. Go work for your cousin and make $9 an hour in painting or $14 or whatever the fuck he's going to pay you because you respect him, trust him and he's been successful and what you're doing is you're getting paid to observe his behavior. I love that. Good. God Gary you get my blood flowing. I'm gonna cross paths kicking it with friends but never cross that line. I saw your eyes were watering. It's got me wondering too. So grab your drink let's run away where we can be alone. I think I just may confess my true feelings. I find you so appealing. I like that. So wait a minute let's go. We'll try to go home. Yeah give me one of those. Give me one of those. One, one, one. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, come on. Come on. That's why we're living what we're living. You know, you know. I mean, I didn't know of you before. Of course I get it. I get it. I started to follow you on the videos. I feel like also coming from nothing and working when you see someone who's passionate about that. And wants it for everybody else. No really this is so authentic. This is so authentic. That's what works to your point. If I do this there's gonna be no if I sell again you know what I really need from you for my own fucking like ego and competitive juices and you gave it to me with the. I need you know you're obviously trying you want to make this deal happen. I'm telling you this is gonna only fall apart if something crazy happens. Yeah, I want you know. And I don't mean just but I know what matters for you but like what would the market be like how the fuck did they sell that. What is that? Do you know? Yeah. Talk to you. All right. Time to go. Okay. I'll see you guys later. Bye. Bye. I'll see you guys later. Yeah and we're taking a separate car just cause it's easier in the morning. Okay so I'll see you guys later. See you later. Good day. Good meetings. I don't know what did you get today? Secret meetings. No. Little FaceTime. Little FaceTime. Just listen. I mean I'm working here. Like that's what I have to say. I'm working here. That's a good excuse. I'm working here. I'm working here. I'm working here. That's a good excuse. To say I love you. And if we drink this whole bottle, we'll pretend we don't recall. That's a good excuse. To say I love you. To say I love you.
