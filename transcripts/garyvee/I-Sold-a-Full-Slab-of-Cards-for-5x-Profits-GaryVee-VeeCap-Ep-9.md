The only people here want to be doing this full time, but the only reason they're not is because of the judgment that you do cards full time, but they would make more money and be 10 times happier. They do it a lot. But they're just worried about people's opinions. So they're staying being a lawyer that they hate. I'm gonna teach the art of the flip. Bought these Otanian trouts in really nice cases. Presentation matters. Pay a dollar. Gonna put a $5 ticket on it, and they're gonna sell. They're in great cases, right? $4 a piece. Yeah, but you can get like bulk packs of them. Single ones, four bucks. How much are these? Jason says four bucks. Is that true? Yeah. I got an idea. Now what I figured out is that the cases are worth more than the cards, so I'm just gonna buy them for the cases. My brother, thank you. Thank you again. Pleasure. Yeah. Payed a buck. What'd you get? I decided to buy every card he had for a dollar in these magnetic cases. Every card for a dollar. Oh, that's so smart. Cheaper. Guys, who do you think I got here with my looks? I love it. Then I went back once I realized all the slabs are $4 a piece, and I bought every slab. These were a dollar in the slab? Yes. Of no way. Yeah. Yo. Because you know, superstars and rookies for $5 each when the cases are $4 and a guy just kisses came up to them and bought it. It's unbelievable to me how much this excites me. I get it. Pleasure. Pleasure. Stay well. You too. All right. For the dollar, some Kevin Hart cards. Little remercenizing over here. Damn. Then I took garbage ones out and put that in. I couldn't say. Come on. They analyzed the posts by post. Some guy wanted to buy that full sleeve of atomic cards. OK. How much you want it? For the whole thing, it'd be at $4 a piece. So that one, you've got two real core groups. You've got the collectors and you've got the flippers. So a lot of people walk around trying to buy something, sell it for more somewhere else. And other people looking for that thing to add to their collection. So it brings a really fun energy. You look familiar. I've got that kind of face. All right. I got a plan. I'm going to win the $1 challenge. And I think the way I figured out how to do it is I found a booth that sells dollar cards that are not sports. So they're weirder. And I'm focused on Santa Claus. The plan is Santa Claus. When I start with Santa, this might be the one that most excites me. Big thing. What about a rare Reagan? A few moments later. Reagan? Tell me everything. Well, there's an older guy and his son comes around and it was like V-Friends stickers. His dad was V-Friends. So he starts telling them. And then that guy goes like, you know about Reagan? Greatest president? Yeah. He was like, would you tell him about Reagan? I don't have a tool. Mystery packs. Highest grade wins. Sure. 8.5. Nice. Son of a bitch. Yeah, I think you look at anything. You know, cars, watches, comic books, marbles, magnets, humans hoard, humans collect. It's in us. Art. Almost everybody collects something, believe it or not. Clothes, handbags. So I think it's tribal. I think it goes, I mean, we're going deep, deep. Humans love to congregate around things. Church, sports, collectibles just happen to be one of them. Ready to sign? Visually. I appeal. Things that are shiny or unusual or just a very big picture of him. Day one of the books. You know, V-Friends extending into the world. Team worked well. Saw a lot of great old friends. But most of all, just family vibes. That's all I got to say. The number one thing I want is for you to point to people to watch. Do you know what's going on on eBay? Pull it up on your eBay right now. Watch this video. We've got to get that into people's heads. Historically, I'd like to collect vintage basketball. Will Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson. Right now, I'm actually collecting fictional character rookie cards. Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Fred Flintstone. It doesn't make sense to me how underpriced they are and how popular they are and how few there are. So I see a little bit of an arbitrage. Even a shape, bro. You can still play. I like food so much. Santa, all people. Santa, five bucks. Five bucks. Guy paid with 100. I feel pretty good about myself this year. He's feeling good. He's feeling spicy. Feeling full. Whoa! Oh, let's go. Let's go. This song's expensive. A little bit in my opinion, but I want it for Trouty. A little bit. I think I might just to fucking, I love him. I'll pay your asking price. Just picked up this sensible Somalia, one of one, series one gold for 1100 bucks. And I'm going to give it to John Troutman, who works at Fee Friends, who's seriously into wine. I have a gift for you. Okay. Stop. I got it. I got it. For you. Stop it. Yep. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Wow. Give it up. Well, I gave it up because I gave him fucking cash. I know. Let's go! Congratulations. That's the card I'm looking at. I said there's no freaking way. And holy moly, I hit it. All right, everybody. It actually happened. This handsome gentleman right now, pulled the Jordan rookie out of a $25 Midstreet Treasures pack here at the V Friends booth. There it is. The big one. The Beckett H or I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Proud of you. Yeah, V Friends is my Pokemon meets Sesame Street. So Pokemon cards are also going to be very popular here. Non-sports cards are getting more and more popular. And I wanted to jump into that arena, but I didn't want it to just be about the collectibles. I wanted it to be about good traits. So gracious Grizzly or ambitious angel or fearless fairy. So I created a whole universe that has great traits of what I wish kids and humans were more about. You got duct tape? Gym tours are the only thing I collect. That's cool. How did you get on? They reached out and said, I have a pretty nice approach. Just an email. You got it. I wanted to smear those ones in your face. Rips. I told you I'm ready for these these weekend. All right, we'll sign this and give it away. You want to do that? Hell yeah. When I came to Cleveland last for 2018, there was no kids here. Now look at it. So I'm very happy about the feature of the hobby. I would do this in the backyard of somebody in Seattle if I had to. Brother, I'm spending four minutes with you. And it's black and white, what you'd rather do. So do it. Jumping is always the right answer. If you're not moving forward, you're actually moving backwards. Real fucking talk. Stop being scared of your dream. Just because your mom or dad or uncle doesn't say you can, or your cousin or your friend, just fucking move. You'll always regret not jumping. That's for you? That's for you bro? That's for you bro? Not you bro, what's up my man? What's up, how are you? That's for you. That's for you my brother. This is for you? This is for your, is that your brother? Give that to him. Hot shit hornet nine five. That's good. With the red ink, the red on red. Nice hit bro. And he's a cheat, look at the cheat, look at the fucking. Look at this. Yeah, it all works out. You know what the word conviction means? I want you to learn it. Your dab will teach you. It's a good word. Dream, passion, practicality. Next five years, dream. Craziest shit you could be. I'm gonna be the biggest dealer in cards, or I'm gonna be a fucking rapper. Next is passion. I love sports, I love music. Then practicality. Then when you're 29, you could start saying, let me be an accountant or a carpenter or something like that. Gambling, practicality. He's got a ghost pin. I'm not gonna be a carpenter. I'm not gonna be a carpenter. Get the fuck out of, this is about four, five hundred dollar pin. You're better off making a little bit less being happy, but the ironic thing that most people don't know is when you quit a fucking jail job, you actually end up making more. Bro, you gotta open this, I gotta see it. Holy shit, are you fucking kidding me? Happy to do it, what's up boys, what's up, what's up? What's up, what's up, what's up? Here we go, I'm gonna get you some fire. Death Curry rookie hunting. Nice Kobe. Set. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Curry, curry, curry. I'm shaking, bro. Wow. The Lamar, he pulled the Lamar to boom, let's go. It's got it, the Lamar to boom. You know how many people here want to be doing this full time, but the only reason they're not is because of the judgment that you do cards full time, but they would make more money and be 10 times happier. They do it with the most. They're just fucking worried about people's opinions. So they're staying being a lawyer that they hate.
