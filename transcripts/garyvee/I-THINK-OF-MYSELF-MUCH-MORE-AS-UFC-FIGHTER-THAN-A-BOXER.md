But I'm a true bread entrepreneur, and by my definition that means somebody who likes losing, meaning I think of myself much more as a UFC fighter than I think of a boxer. I like boxing more, even though that's not a popular thing to say, but I also think that in boxing, when you get a loss, it's like a scarlet letter, right? You like finish, and UFC everybody has losses that's just like part of the game, and I associate to that sport more as an entrepreneur. Like, there is no great entrepreneur that doesn't have losses. It's not even the cliche shit of like, you learn from your losses, fuck that. It's just that it meant that you didn't take chances. I'm not here to be like you learn from your losses. I'm here like, oh, you have no losses? You didn't take any risk. Which means you're on defense or you're in passive mode, which is even scarier, you're in the middle. And I almost wish you'd rather be defense than being stuck in the middle, so. I'm not here to be like you learn from your losses.
