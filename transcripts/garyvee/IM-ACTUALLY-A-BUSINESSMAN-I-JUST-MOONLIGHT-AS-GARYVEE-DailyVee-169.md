🎵 Macro, I'm from mom and casual 🎵 🎵 Got a lot of ground like gravel 🎵 🎵 Coming back around like lasso 🎵 🎵 Macro, Macro, like a visual boy 🎵 🎵 I see with clarity 🎵 🎵 I hustle like my name is Gary V 🎵 Sabahs, I've been telling you! 🎵 Accounts are sold by equity 🎵 🎵 I'm triple H giving the pedigree 🎵 🎵 That mean that I'm special, my specialty 🎵 🎵 I put in the work 🎵 🎵 Tell I'm dirty and the earth I'm moving 🎵 🎵 Furniture to heaven 🎵 I don't think people realize how much money I'm leaving on the table. For humanity. For my legacy. For the good stuff. You know, being an interesting human being is a thing. Yeah. And so like the biggest thing I think that people, the biggest downfall is lack of self-awareness. Like who wants to sit there and say, well I'm just not interesting, cute, smart, clever, you know, enough. Yeah. And we all have different paths, right? Like, you know, we all have different paths. So I think the mistake is lack of self-awareness. The next biggest mistake is lack of patience. And I think lack of patience manifests in a couple of places. So you have the horrible version of lack of patience which is like somebody's completely tone deaf. Yeah. They think they're Gary Vee or they think they're fucking Beyonce and they're just like, they're the people on American Idol who are like, not doing it for shtick. They like literally think that they're fucking unbelievable and then they sing and they're shit. Yeah. So there's that. But I actually think there's another version. Which I think a lot of people that actually follow me because I kind of suffocate the other crowd out pretty quickly. There's other places to go if you want to be completely tone deaf. Yeah. Which is the people that are actually slightly empathetic. And they realize they're trying to be an influencer and they realize there's some baggage along with that. And they're actually empathetic to what their friends are saying behind their back. And the problem is you don't go from zero to 100 in one day. Yeah. You have to be able to eat the shit of the voices. You have to be able to accept the voices. You have to be empathetic to your buddy who's like, who the fuck do you think you are? What the fuck are you doing? You have to be able to do that. That's what the early pioneers of reality TV did. That's what the Kardashians did. You have to be able to when everybody says you suck to know that you're not. And that's hard. Yeah. Especially when you have to go a year or two or three before you actually get to the place to prove them wrong. That sucks. Yeah. And that is my gift. I love being an underdog. I hate that I'm starting to have my moment. I liked it a year ago when it was still, I knew it was coming. And a lot less people knew it was coming. I think a lot of people are starting to know it's coming. Let's go. Intent is the north star of this entire conversation. The intent. Yes. The intent. You don't even, you don't need town now, but like when you post it. Yep. Thank you. Now for all the admiration of every like 24 year old that's coming my way, there's a big part of me that doesn't like it. Because I like being underestimated. I could never sell the things I make fun of. I feel like I'm not selling. I feel I'm documenting. I'm aware that it's leading to things. But it feels a lot better that the people that pay me are f**king f**king f**king f**king. You know, I don't feel good selling a $9,000 course. Any industry where the majority of the winners and players are doing things that are selfish for themselves and not for their client is a vulnerable industry. That was the high end wine business years ago. That's why I won there. That is the agency world today in marketing. That's why I'm winning there. And neither one of them combined is as bad as football agents are to their players. I mean it is. The part that people are fundamentally confused about me is for some reason they forgot that I spent 13 years building a humongous business and didn't say one word to anybody ever about anything. The answer is I'm actually a businessman. I moonlight as Gary Vee. That's it. Gary Vee's bad man. You know what I mean? Kind of thing. Like, you know, like, that's the confusion part about me. That's why I'm pushing the kids to build actual things and patients. If kids, how old are you? 33. You know what I'm about to say. We're perfect because I'm 41, you're 33, and they're 22. This is perfect. Can you believe how young you feel right now? Yeah. You would have never thought that at 22. I know. The end. Good news for you. You're going to feel the same at 41. Love it. That's it. Love it. That's the fucking game. Head of the Yankee Stadium. Portuguese wonder is here. How are you, man? Great. What's going on? Then I started doing anything. I see it works. This feels good. It's going to be cool. Like some 40 hours of that in something. And then I sent it. And I was like, OK, that's it. Maybe they won't reply. I don't know. Maybe it's real. But it's done. And then it was really completely above my expectations. And then it was funny. There was a couple of friends of mine. They were like, when you had the idea what you do, you send them an email asking if you wanted to do it. And I was like, fuck no, it did it. It took a chance. It's always the answers in the tower. More, more, more. Just do. Just do. Maybe you get something. Maybe you won't. That's right. But you will get something. You know what's funny? You probably never would have got an answer to the email. Of course. I wasn't expecting it. You know what I mean, though? But the fact that you took the way bigger risk you did, obviously you love doing it. So that makes it fun. It's always better when that's the case. It's cool, man. So what's happened? Have people pinged you? What's been happening? It is. The buzz that appeared at the time. I'm doing my own thing now. So hot. Video. I'm a D-Rock or Tyler. Yep. Or a Stefan in Portugal right now. Four people. For yourself? I am actually exporting the D-Rock. Yeah. Sorry, Tyler. It's it. Overseas, I'm just talking with influencers, Portuguese influencers, to tell them, I can do this for you. Nobody's doing it in Portugal. It isn't. Nobody's doing it. That's so crazy. You said that yesterday. Nobody's doing what we're doing. No. Nobody has a shadow. Maybe some people do vlog. Right. And when you vlog yourself, you have to be like, you don't have to be. But if you're like Casey, you're in the quality and entertainment is there. OK. But most aren't. It's just somebody speaking to the cameras. And by the way, most people aren't going to do well being shadowed either. You have to have the two. I think you hate here. Which is? Which is, I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Fuck you're gonna, right? But it is. Fuck you're gonna. I want to be with my personal brand. I want to be my own Andy. You can do both. I can do both. No, no. But that's what I'm talking about. I know that I need to vlog. I do both, right? I do marketing for myself. And we do market, you know? I do both. In a weird way. I've been sitting by the phone. I like that you peaked. No, you ain't calling. Because I said this was pure. But I've been back here often like, I don't need you really. Really, I've been checking voicemails when you leave them. Then delete them shallow reasons. I've been reading all these headlines. I get second page. Meeting all my deadlines a couple steps away. Calls, calls, calls. That's like more and more and more. The sun cast me right in in my summer home. Lifted like I'm coming home. You told me that you love it. I mean, I'm in so really good at a great chat. I'm still really excited about this man. I love how you invested off a second hand suggestions like it's just that. OK, cool. Great. Let me know. Right. I'll talk to you later. You my only audience. I was going to wait until the ATMs. If I could get 20 for two tens. 20 for two tens? Yeah. I want it from the ATM. Why? Because it's new. It's her gift. Crips. I don't want it like that or anything. I just took a bunch of 20s out of the ATM. Is that good? No. I'm not good at that one. OK, I don't want to do that. No, I don't want to do that. Sometimes you just got to go with your intuition. Around the right hand side, I think a lot of creations go to you in the beginning. And you're the reverse. You throw a fix in that hand. That's all he's been saying. Shoot for the fucking moon. Because the stars are better than if you've shot through the clouds. Because if you shoot for the clouds, you're going to end up on the moon. It's the words of wisdom from your uncle Gary. Here, grandpappy Gary. Older bro Gary. I know there's some old timers watching. I got you. Your buddy Gary. In Jersey, I'm super close to Edison. New Jersey right now makes me happy. Feeling those Jersey vibes. Well, I don't think Dolmora's coming. I'm a rocket like a hundred plus a hundred plus a thousand. Man, that's all I ever wanted. That's the sweetest thing I know. Sweetest thing I've ever known. That's the sweetest thing I know. Wake up crying all this time. One of the biggest things is managing efficiencies. One of the advantages to your point, and I've been thinking about this, one of the advantages that team Gary has is if you're not doing something, which is almost never. But if you're not, I'll lose my shit. If you're not, make me a fucking animated gift, motherfucker. I don't give a, like if Steven Spielberg worked on team Gary, I'd be like, where's my fucking Instagram tweet? When I volunteer, that'll get you buzzing. They gon' click it if you bait it. They keep on coming back. It's something different when it's- We need people to be like fashion. High, low. The number one thing happening in fashion right now, that's been happening for a while, is women, mainly, but men too. Like they'll wear a $1,700 pair of jeans and a $1 t-shirt, right? And the handbag's seven bucks, and the glasses are 17,000. We need that. That is what I have. It's not that Babin and D-Rock are so special. It's that that's the religion. You might make an animated movie. You might make an animated gift. And that's that. And so as long as the animators, as long as the animator with downtime is like, fuck it, I'll just make some, I'll make 17 animated things today, and then we can put it out on social. Like, I know what to do, and I've got to change a lot of rules, but I want you to be bought into the religion. Everybody's, you see where I'm going? We're fixing the airplane while we fly it. By the way, by the way, by not taking a stop in Providence, Rhode Island to fix something, and then Kansas City, Missouri, we've lapped the world 15 times, while everybody's still fixing their brakes and fucking Wichita. Oh, the snow, mom. It'll have to appear a while now. Let me speak, mom. This is a series of meetings. All right, as a lot of you guys know, we bought PureWow, women's publishing company, modern media company. Very excited about the acquisition of the team. Ryan Harwood, the CEO, unbelievable, Mary Kay. Eddard Sheep, unbelievable. Really excited about the strategies we're putting in place. Life is good there. It was a good, big purchase. But it's going to continue the process of winning. I like winning. It's always a ying and a yang. The great promise of the world that I saw isn't going to happen because people don't have the self-esteem to put themselves out there to have a real conversation. That's how you're on the same team. You need to be part of the and the edged world, and that's that team. We're also going to produce a lot more content. I've got something weirdly figured out. We can't lose twice. If we're going to put people in these slots, the output has to show. I really, there's something I'm seeing that I'm excited about. Let's just produce a shitload more content. And how do we get paid for it? Of course, of course. If we produce it, I know what I'm, right now we're losing on both fronts. I define it as emotional intelligence, self-awareness, empathy, gratitude are absolutely the three things that emerge immediately to me when I think about them. And I think it manifests in the environment and the workplace more than people realize. I think it's the game. Honestly, I think it's the whole thing. I just think it's the whole thing in life, let alone fucking work. So, I mean, if you're empath, so I think it's why I'm able to be me. If I wasn't empathetic, people that troll me and don't believe in me and think I'm the bad version of the good version that I am, would have stopped me from doing. I love how you invested off a second hand. Just had two great meetings with the PureWOW team on two major different objectives. Now we're gonna have dinner together as a team, continue to bond. When you make these integrations, you have to massively overindex in the beginning of any important integration. When you buy a company of the size of PureWOW, which is the sizable business, the biggest business I've ever bought, you gotta triple down. And so you gotta do 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. dinners. You gotta do them often and early and with passion and focus. And so time to put the beanie on, because that's when I get serious. Good day. Just fucking doing it, you know? Guys doing it. And like, love you for your comments, enjoy it. And I love you guys back. When I say I'm an anomaly, I'm empathetic to what people may think about that, but to me it's a bigger sense of responsibility to make sure that people that are looking at me don't become crippled or try to replicate it if they don't have, I mean, I have natural energy out my ass. Right. Pure passion for what you do. Pure fucking passion, man. Just really, just knew how it was gonna play out, you know? Yeah. That's the nicest way to say it. Yeah. It ain't tricking if you made it. I'm just on my phone checking metrics from my followers on baby number two, taking wifey to her follow ups. This is.
