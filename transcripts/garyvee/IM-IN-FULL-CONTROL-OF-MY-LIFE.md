## Transcript
What's been the hardest lesson for you to learn in your life? That I can't do everything. What are things you would love to be doing that you're not doing? Nothing. You would rather be doing nothing? Or there's nothing that you don't? Correct, there's nothing. I'm in full control of my life. If there's something I want to do, then I can go do it. We make our beds, so I sleep in it. What do you think about your employees? Do you think they all share the same ideology that you do about doing everything that it is they want to be doing? Absolutely not. Why do you think that is? Because I think people are wired differently. And I think I have to, and I don't even want, all I want to do is react to what they want and how they aspire to be or what they're interested in. I have no interest in them being like me or not being like me. I'm in the reaction business. And so I just think people are hardwired. I don't think everybody was as lucky to have a mother that told them that they could do anything and actually make them believe it. And that's unfortunate. And I hope through example and content, I'm able to inspire that. But I think practicality is grossly underrated. And for all my sizzle, I'm obsessed with the steak. That's all for this video. I hope you enjoyed it. I'll see you in the next video. Bye.
