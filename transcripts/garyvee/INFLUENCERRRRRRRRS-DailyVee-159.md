Working for free on your terms versus getting paid dick to pay your dooms on not terms, it's not even close. Yeah, let's do it. Macro, I'm from mom and casual. Got a lot of ground like gravel. Coming back around like a lasso. Macro, like a vision boy, I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Garry V. Sob, as I've been telling you. Accountants will talk about equity. I'm trippin' like giving a pedigree. They mean it on special, my specialty. I puttin' the work, tellin' them dirty, gettin' to earth, move it, burn it, turn it, leather. Center, it's 10 to 10. Morning guys. Morning. This is a cool piece of this good tweet. Morning. Morning, morning. I'm super happy for her. I love her. What is she doing? That's what's going through my mind. I'm gonna try to figure that out over the next 30, 60, 75 days here. This big city. But here's what I would say. To just triple reinforce so we're getting it through the system. Steve, jump in when I'm done. If you want to add anything to this. I'm very, very excited that I think pushing through the system, we get a brief and we go to our version of the 30 second spot, which is a Facebook commercial and an influencer marketing campaign. Both, by the way, for that. That to me feels as right as anything we've done since. It's $20,000 a month, 240. You get Twitter pictures, you get Facebook comment. It's the most scalable, winnable. It feels very right to me and I want to continue to push the organization in that way. Okay, thanks guys. Awesome. My choice, yeah, I still hurt the pressure. Been hearing her voice and that vision, I got back. She just stopped waiting to get it. What I mean by that is I love trying these things and I will give my attention to it 100% right at the moment and I will kind of dissect it how I will put my brain power into it and then I kind of move on to the next thing because it's like, okay, so the new squirrel almost in a sense. Are you able to compare, so I think I'm like that? Yeah. But what I think has made me successful is I've always had one big pillar. It's kind of like eating a burger, but always having different compliments to it. Right. I think a lot of people just eat the potato or the pickle or the onion or the mayonnaise or the mayonnaise and mayo or the ketchup or the jalapeno, but they never eat the burger. Right. Like I have the burger, Wine Library, VaynerMedia, my personal brand. Hi everybody, this is Gary VaynerChuk and this is episode 241 of the Ask Gary Vee Show. Investing. Those are my burgers, but I do a million things. Do you know how many people think this, I mean, he's covering for this. This is insane. I have no time. For me to be spending 49 minutes on this is so fucking crazy. It makes zero sense, but it sits in the Gary Vee brand pillar. I believe in it, but it is me being ADD'd out. What I think you need to figure out is you've got to create at least one burger. I've got four, right? You need to have one. If you feel you don't. I don't know yet, but that's the analogy. So I would say I don't necessarily have a burger. Right. Because what the burger does is allows you to create the wealth creation or the financial stability that allows you to go flirt. I don't think people realize is by documenting and communicating on a daily basis. As you build an audience that is just interested in people, reality TV at scale, it opens up business development opportunities. You never know when you're going to write something or say something in a video. Six years from now that unlocks the leader that wants to see you. I'm one of the most important, one of the great stars of the last 20 years team in here a couple hours ago. They came to me off of the documenting and creating. People think I'm pulling it off. I'm not pulling it off. Like I'm leaving millions of dollars on the table each year by being me. Now I'm getting some too, but it's a real like most unless you work for yourself and you're playing the longest game of all time. It's not recommended. But even that approach though, the long game, like once I turn that out in my mind, changes everything. Everything changes. What did you? Yes, director doing the social media stuff, using a lot of your strategies to help up this thing. And you trying to go reaching the audience? Yeah, it's time for him. And this is as much for you as everybody's watching because I think this is a new thought I have. My thing is a lot of D rocks. Like I think a lot of people see D rock and they know I pay him and they're like, well, shit, I can't do that. I have to do this. I actually don't think that's true. I actually think there are thousands of people that are watching this right now. And even if you didn't have the serendipity and luck of being here and now naturally come to you in the comments of DailyVee, you're going to get this. I think that there's just like if I were you and more importantly the 10,000 people watching right now for their advice, they should go to YouTube. They should spend a month, find 5959, 437 people making video content who have very few subscriptions. D rock could have been had. Somebody could email them and said, I think believe in your talent. Come and be my partner. Come and document me. I'm going to be like that. Believe in me. I think you can sell people on that. I would believe you, let alone 500 people who just want to be artists and who just want to do it and who want to be nomads too. So that's another thing to think about, man. If you can't afford it, I just generally, you understand, it's a supply and demand game. When people get mad about working for free, they don't understand. It's all supply and demand. Like no hardcore amazing computer developer works for free anymore because it's demand. When there are unlimited kids filming in a court, listen, if you're Steven Spielberg, go get, like, go. But like before you're that, there's, I mean, where do you think, you know, it's so funny working for free, working for free on your terms versus getting paid dick to pay your dooms on not terms. It's not even close. You mean this? When D-Recco's casing? It's for you, right? Nice to meet you. I do like branding, marketing, sustainability services and all that stuff. So it's getting really hard to maintain both and balance both. So I'm Mr. Goodlife. Yeah, Mr. Goodlife is my main page. It's my public figure 1.4 million verified country pages of Portuguese, like it's being world. So that's where I do most of my mind. and someone you want to be a real science report with. Yeah, I mean, listen, I think you're in a great place, right? Instagram is what I care about right now. You're in a space that I care about. We're doing a ton of influencer marketing. I think that this is exactly why doing the right thing is the right thing. You know, there's a billion people that are emailing us every day to meet with me. I'm not meeting with kids, I'm not meeting with you for kicks and giggles. I'm meeting you because you're handsome. Meeting you because you've done something right in a space that I care about. What's up, brother? Good to see you, bro. There he is, man. Hey, James, nice to see you. James, how are you? Love you, fucking. Thanks, man. The fox is fucking awesome. You just have to be mentally prepared. You meet, like right now you should be building your business to pay 20% big to the platform. Now, what you can also do, depending on what your strategy is, is start building outside of the platform. There's two moves. You're more, it's more important that you're just not at the mercy of fucking Instagram. Like, Instagram and Facebook are the beasts of the world, but I don't know, look, look what happens Snapchat. You know, who the fuck knows? VR, you just never want to be at the mercy of, everybody who's ever been at the mercy of being organic, SCM first result on Google or email, or you just never want to be at the mercy of anything. Shit's about to hit the fan, and I think it's gonna happen this year. So this is the right time to move. That's exactly what I told myself yesterday. This is the right time to move. Real, like $80 billion into television commercials. Where do you think that money's going? It's going to you. So I think the question becomes, what business do you want to build? Awesome. Good to see you again, man. ["I'm Real Like You"] How are you, my man? How you doing? Real pleasure. How are you? Jacob. Jacob, how are you? Real pleasure. How you guys doing? Very good. Good. Picture coming in. Tuning out your world. Yeah, so, what, I've just recently, in the last, like, three and a half, four years, kind of just been involved in the whole social media world. Kind of got fun to be in, like, a different influencer. How to act in the background. Born and raised in Florida. Moved to LA when I was like 17 to chase the whole dream of becoming an actor. YouTube and I've found that you're an influencer yourself. Yep. So it's like, you know, you hear the term a lot, the coach's player. Like, the most coaches are the ones that play the game. Yes. You know, so they know how to make to their players the best. Yes, that's exactly, that's a good analogy. And the influencer who, you know, been authorized on that became an entrepreneur, business man, et cetera, like, you understand. Very much. When you see it, when you're somewhere at an early stage, when you kind of tap the switch. It's funny, I had Rudy, Nicholas, Jerome, Brittany, all of them, and I said, none of you know what's gonna happen in a year. And they were like, so funny about it. And it was because I lived it with YouTube and Twitter the generations before. They're just, I get it. For sure, that makes a lot of sense. So if I was like your brother and partner, I'd be like, man, listen to me. Like, you know, I've been right since we were kids about where the world's going. Let's write a TV show, let's do it on Facebook, and let's stay the course. So like, I don't want CAA or Propagate or Endemol to have control over you. You actually have a lot of leverage. So the question becomes, how do you underwrite it? So as long as you can sell a brand or an investor, you're good. And then you just gotta be patient. You've lived it. You've lived building more fame in that world that has parlayed into, like, you know, they play together. You can be agnostic, and in one world you have leverage, and another world you don't. So for me, it's like quadruple down on the leverage to get you maybe, you know, you know this man? Do you know this, do you know this man? You better know. You better know. Co-signed, me Gary. Co-signed. Co-signed. Oh, you're welcome. Hi, how are you? I'm Brittany. Such a pleasure, Brittany. Anthony. Anthony, how are you, man? Good. Real pleasure. When I was curious, the like, social media influencers, I mean influencers in general, where do you see that going, you know, this year and, you know, three, four years online? Are brands utilizing them more? Yes. Okay. But it's a supply and demand issue. There'll be more money in. There'll be more competition. Yeah. So it's a marketplace. So it's gonna be a really competitive marketplace, but it's gonna be a huge marketplace. So like Google AdWords, the people that were winning in 2001, 2003, when I would give them the advice that more people were coming, they got scared, but I'm like, no, no, you don't get it. It's gonna go from a hundred million dollar market to a four billion dollar market. And as long as you're good, as long as you guys keep crushing your content, you'll be fine. Like it's the people that are in early. So it's like buying beats from property and building a shitty house. Like will that be worth as much you're still on the beach, right? So it's still worth money, but your neighbor built a much nicer house. So that will go for eight million years. We'll go for four million. Got it? That's right. All right. And then you can get it. Jack it. Awesome. Cool. Thank you. Thank you for coming. So we're asking everything. You can't have something to eat you. Take me anytime. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Where we do the investing and buying and creating brands and putting up influencers. No. Let's go through all the seven figure stuff. That, that at all. Okay. All right. Let me know. See you later. See you tomorrow. 10 o' nine at night. Trying to find my drinks meeting right now. Tex and Tyler, my friend Constantine. Meeting, they're gonna business meeting. He says he's here. I don't see him. Good day. Busy, huh? Today was intense. Only guy I go to two bars for. Hey brother. Sorry man. I would like auto piloting. How's everything at home? Everything's great. Crazy, right? Oh, it's. What's your main piece of advice overall regardless if someone's in social media or trying to start a real business? Reverse engineer your truth. It's all self-awareness and then putting yourself in a position to succeed. Too many people wish there's something instead of realizing what they are. So less dreaming, more practicality, but more dreaming in the context of practicality. Right? So you don't have to be the prettiest or the smartest or the best tech or the best singer. Like it's about understanding. Like I was an entrepreneur always. I didn't know that social media was gonna come along and like entrepreneurship was gonna be cool and people wanted to take selfies. I was who I was and the world came to me. You can't force yourself to be an influencer. You can't force yourself to be a fashionista. You can't force yourself to be a food critic. You gotta actually figure out what you are and what you love and then go all in on that and then they will come to you. Everybody's trying to go to where it's going instead of, you know, then you're just a flash in the pan. Love your towel. Congrats with everything at home. All right, get up. You caught the context there? Oh yeah, I was making up. All right, you got me. All right, thanks.
