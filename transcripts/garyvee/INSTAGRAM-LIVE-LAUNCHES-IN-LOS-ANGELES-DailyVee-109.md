I was trying to be sneaky I looked for you and I was like Shit, there was a reason I was coming on here Fuck, I forgot What the fuck did I want to talk about? Oh, let's show them This is a proof So this is... Right, so the Ask Gary Vee show No, no, I don't want to go live Not going live now Take that middle out What I want to do is post A number on Instagram and then I go to this And we film the show I don't want to do it live I want to do it as a call-in show recorded Like, what we did in episode 106 It's actually gonna be the Ask Gary Vee show It's gonna be the Ask Gary Vee show Somebody give me their number right now Is this the thing not calling? Oh, there we go Hello, this is Jessica Hey Jessica, it's Gary Vaynerchuk Hey Gary, how are you? I'm well, how are you? Good, good, this is cool, I'm glad it worked It did work, so you're on the Ask Gary Vee show Like, what's your question? So, I have a question about selling Okay I have a moment of product That we make for Mindful Living in Medi-Diction Okay And it's just... It's difficult to take the leap to get people to buy I do a pretty good job Of building relationships With my customers over social media And I am selling a bit But I just want to tell that That it was a little sort of Popped into buying Are you in a weird spot? You chopped on me a little bit, I couldn't fully hear that Okay, can you hear me okay now? Yeah, it's better. What was the last part? I'm selling a little bit, but... But I just like to see what I can do To really amp up the motivation To buy the product I don't think I'm doing a good job at that You mean converting the social audience At a higher level? Yes So, do you have a sense if you're converting At a good level to begin with? Like, do you know how you're doing compared to people With similar sized audiences That are trying to sell them something? I think I'm doing pretty well From all of the research that I've been doing I generally do about like one to two percent Or something like that So that's pretty high But I need you to answer the truth Or you're not going to get to the place you want to be Which is Are you building an audience On social because you then want to sell to them? Or like Basically the key, right? And the reason I've done so well Is I think people have not interpreted Jab, jab, jab, right hook well enough Jab, jab, jab, right hook means Give, give, give And then ask Versus give, give, give And I think Why? If you're just saying And I don't think there's anything wrong With you building an audience With the expectation of them buying something I just think that when you're giving away Free content or all the other stuff you're doing Before you do a post where you're actually Sending them to buy If the energy and the soul and the seed And the intent of that free content Is really quite In a place where it's just there As a proxy because what you really want to do Is sell them something you will not be as successful The reason Everybody that follows me buys my books Or not everybody The reason I do well In selling my books once every two years Is because outside of sharing my content I don't ask for anything in return I You know even with Wine Library TV I never cared if anybody bought the wine I don't care if anybody buys my book Right? I have a business called Vayner Media Right? That is running and making my money Speaking Investing My money is not predicated on just monetizing my social network And everybody feels that So when I go on The reason I have the community I have The reason when I do 60 second club And things of that nature The reason I'm over indexing Is because I'm not expecting anything in return I don't care at all If Tiger Won NYC I don't care if Sasha Ever buys anything for me Right? I'm not creating content For the purpose Of making Ryan A&C Or Wayne a barber I don't want any of these people I don't feel like I'm doing it Where I think I'm the reverse of the market I think people are putting out content But what they're really waiting for is the sale And so then their jabs or their other content Has less oomph against it And where they put all their real energy and heart Is against the sale I'm the reverse I put so much oomph on bringing value to the community Around the subject matter And then sure When I want to sell something I'm in book promotion world Fine Sure, do I want everybody who's watching me on Instagram live right now The 2100 people to screen shoot it And post it And tell their community about me so I can pick up one more person Typing And seeing what the u So I'm talking a lot about the shelf I see what you're saying And so I think if Do else You see where I'm going If you're actually trying to help you but I don't need them to buy my book or anything else. I don't need anything from them. And then they trust me more and then they have a bigger impact and so what happens is, do you know how frustrating it is that I give away all my free stuff and then they go buy somebody's bullshit course for like 700 bucks? Because we're missing the point, right? They're looking for another way to not do. All I'm about is doing. So what I would tell you is, do me a favor. Try to go the next month putting out content, doing live, putting out white papers, doing Q and A's, doing giving, giving, giving, giving. Don't ask for anything and then ask and feel proud about that and see what happens. Okay, I will. Thank you Gary. You're welcome. Have a great day and thanks for calling the Ask Gary Vee show. All right, that's what I wanna do. We'll film that and I'll be the show. It's a call in radio show, right? Instead of a live stream. All right, what did you guys think about that? Give me the feedback. Give me some feedback. Are you guys looking for me? Is probably not the apps looking for me. Not sure. Yeah, I'm gonna do a whole new thing. So I'm gonna go with kind of, this would be really cool for DailyVee, right? Like to see my thought process. It's gonna be like, hey guys, I just posted on Instagram to get your phone number. This is live, Ask Gary Vee, right? And then I'll explain it and then we'll go into it. Hey everybody, I just posted an Instagram post for your phone number.
