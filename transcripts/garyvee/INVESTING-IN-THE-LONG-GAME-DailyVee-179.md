Great meetings all day long. You know, trying to create some meetingness to this episode Tyler. Otherwise you're going to have a tough time editing it. Macro. I'm from mom and casual. Got a lot of ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro. Like a vision boy. I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Gary V. Sobbs, I've been telling you. Accounts are talking about equity. I'm trippin' like giving a pedigree. That mean that I'm special, my specialty. I'm putting the work, tell them dirt and the earth. I'm moving furniture to heaven. Good morning Instagram. It's me Gary. Instead of a motivational quote or some sort of clip. Just want to go camera to face. Just tell you how much I appreciate all of you guys. Your attention is the world to me. I'm humbled by the thousands of emails and dms and tweets and comments on YouTube. The value that I'm giving to you. Your feedback is the value that you bring to me. I'm just so thankful. So thankful for everything that's going on. Wish you guys the best week. Happy Monday. It's going to be the best week of your life. Especially if you take it from the world by the horns. Just fucking take control. Take it. This is something I've spent a lot of time on. Because I was going to go right after it as a media company. And this was, it's such a natural for this company. So anyway, we should win this. It'd be stupid not to. And honestly I think that's the punchline of this episode. Which is like look. I think the thing that is really fascinating about this vlog and about being an executive at this scale is. There are some days that are enormously predicated on conversations that I can't share with the world. But I can give you some themes. I think the thing that people need to remember is. If you're running a business, you're going to either be financially based or in the short term or the long term. I think one of the themes for me today as being an executive is. I continue to be proud of the fact that I make decisions for the long term. Because unless I'm looking to sell my business, which I'm not. They're always going to be long term games, right? So why make decisions? So many of you are going to run into money for the first time this year. And you're going to make 130,000 instead of 60,000 for the first time. And what you're going to do is go buy stuff. You've been waiting so long. This is a good way to cut in the Ask Gary V with Eric today, right? Hey everybody, it's Gary Vay-ner-chuk. And this is episode 243 of the Ask Gary V with Eric. Eric Wall, welcome to the show. Thrilled to see you, my man. He talks about getting used to patience. I've learned more patience in the last 12 months than I've had to endure my... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Before we go into this phone call, I'm sorry there. In the last 12 months. Should I get comfy on the couch? Yeah. You would treat me before we... Yeah, tell me that. Or his struggle with loving every part of the journey. Or I've put in so much work. Don't I deserve now to cash in? The answer is sure. I thought my brand was going to launch. I thought that I've done the 10, 12 years of leaving away doing 100 shows a year. Logging 250,000 miles in your place. That as soon as you went out, wordly, and did the videos and all this. Dude, shit man. Fuck, you can cash in anytime you want. The problem is when you cash in, you cash in. And what do I mean by that? I mean that the second you cash in, you're taking money out of the kitty that can be in investing and you're converting it into something short term. Which is your prerogative. Like do you. But one of the missions I have here is to teach people how to build big things. Honey empire. And the way you build big things is continue to invest in those things. And so today's themes were very, very heavy on how do I and why do I continue to invest in divisions, agendas, people. Stay the course. Stay the course. Like it's all that and right? But then being somebody who's scaled so much in his life, it's about the unscalable scalable. Totally. Strategies, infrastructure, departments. I mean today was a full day of not being and you know it's funny you caught any of the film of me and Alan, the CFO from afar. Perfect. That meeting in the middle or the beginning day is very much short term. Here are the financial realities you're dealing with. You know, can you afford to invest in everything? And the answer is yes and no. And so I think the balance of where you're going and what you want in the short term versus the long term is a difficult one for all of us. But I do implore all of you that are watching. I implore all of you that are watching. The more you can invest in the long term, the more you will win. You know, very, you know, do a recall a little bit to Tony Robbins's quote from Ask Gary Vee about the market here. 80% of those corrections never become a bear market. They all correct back just like last year. But if you sold, you lived. Of course. But then let's look at the crash. Crash has happened every five years on average. We've gone eight without one. That's why we're due for one and you're right to be somewhat prepared. But while you're preparing, there's opportunity that's happening because first of all, every bear market lasts on average a year, goes down 33%. But you don't lose 33 unless you sell it. That's right. That's the one thing I want people to hear. In two centuries of American business, every single bear market was followed by a bull market. So you remember 2008, people lost 50%. This is where about this one. 69%. This is where, you know, if you take the money out of the market over the long term, you tend to lose. If you decide to make more profit in your business this year because you want to buy something, those are dollars you can't use to build your foundation. And I think a lot of you are building very small businesses or smaller than your ambition is because you need too much in the short term. You're taking too much out in the short term. And so I continue to be very passionate and very, very focused on investing in the long term at the expense of some of the short term luxuries. Maybe I can't have some of the things that I want. But you know, I've noticed some of you say like Gary Vee, like it's cool to see you take an economy seat in a plane or it's super funny to not see you be fancy. It's because I'm investing in my future. You know, if I go private jet for 15,000 instead of economy for 500, that's 15,000 that I can invest in the longer term. And so instead of having a private jet, I end up with the New York Jets. And so what's really important about you guys following this journey, I hope. What I hope my legacy is, is that, you know, not only am I talking in this rant about long term investment, but you'll be able to actually physically watch this over the next 5 to 10, 15 years of what long term investment means in relationships like my man, Babin here. In strategies of a lot of the behind the closed door meetings where today I made decisions that are not in my best interest short term. And really in just the way I live my life financially, professionally, and as a dude. Really speaks to why I don't charge you guys for stuff. I don't want your short term dollars. I want your season tickets to the New York Jets one day. Thank you.
