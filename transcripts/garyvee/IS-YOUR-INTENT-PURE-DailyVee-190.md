Everybody's got shit and nobody cares about your shit. They care about their shit because everybody's got shit So nobody cares about your fucking complaining go fucking do something and that's it I've been telling you When you talked to an upcoming entrepreneur and say they want to build their brand How do they effectively break through the overwhelming amount of information and distortion that exists out there talent and effort? There's just nothing else by the way, there's nothing else than anything. How do I become a professional hockey player? talent and effort How do I become a tremendous top 1% lawyer? Talented effort. How do I become a phenomenal mother? Talented effort. It's talent and effort and what what I love about effort and why I love hustle and now that it's become so cliche You see me saying the word work a little bit more now because I just want people to get it. It's controllable You know like it's controllable like you know It's controllable and I'm obsessed with it because the other parts not like I wasn't born six foot seven and can run like a cheetah I mean that's just a punchline. You've got to it's a game of poker. You get a hand Nobody's gonna cry for you about your hand. Nobody's gonna say oh It's terrible that you're not fast or tall or gorgeous or tally or or can sing It is what it is and now the only thing that can happen is You can figure out how to navigate it many have won in poker with not the best hand And that's how I think about it And so I was given the things I was given and I'm trying to maximize them and that's why I talk a lot about self-awareness I could wish I was something or I can realize I am something and try to maximize on that And that's I think I think what I've done extremely well and why I preach it immensely because it's quite practical is I Deployed enormous amounts of humility and self-awareness and said this is what I am I'm not gonna play for the jets, but maybe I can own them and I honed those skills and that's you They let's do it For the 20 year old advice what I took from is like you gotta do the hustle and the six-year-old advice was it's not too late So we're in the middle there. What would you tell us? It's not too late clearly And you've got to work your ass off and you've got it like you know It's crazy is when I give patients advice to 20 year olds it you know They've got their whole life in front of them But they're but it's hard because they want to prove and they're impatient that did it When I give a 40 year old patients advice, which is the answer. I'm giving you It's not as fun because you're like wait a minute though like you know, I've already been through a couple chapters Like I don't want to be patient. I've been patient, you know And by the way What did you say I gave the advice to six year olds? It's not too late. Yeah, guess what that means Patience like the the fundamental thing is this Nothing good has ever been built from scratch without hard work in patients nothing and I don't you know I think people are confused about a Snapchat or an Instagram or Facebook or a child star or an NBA athlete at 18. Yes point zero zero zero one percent of us have this miraculous event that creates all-time life impact and Income impact in a very short period of time, but for the ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the rest of us There's one formula Hard work patience talent in that arena and then your outcome is the mix of how good you are at those three things So, you know, that's it. I mean like what else is there like show me show me the other formula Show me the quick spam. Show me the eight week course that did it for you like show me show me the examples It's actually called strategy. Here's the finish line. I actually mean it like I actually mean that's the finish line Like that's actually what I want to happen And I'm gonna do my behaviors every single day of my life because this is actually what I want I think I'm good Good morning, but then I got a little bit of stomach thing which felt weird Hey, man. Good to see you. Hey, man. How you been? Telling it yeah hanging in hanging. I like the pure wow. Yes. Let's do it. Yeah, my stomach was bothering me But I think I'm gonna make it Yeah, yeah It's become real life. Hello everyone. Hello. I think you have to execute against your truth people can smell things You know, I was there early on with Tom shoes and Met Blake and like he actually meant it like he actually went there He's an entrepreneur. He's a hustler, but he actually felt like he wanted to do that But then every single entrepreneur in 2013 and 14 pitching me Gary. I want to change the world So here's how I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna raise a ton of money I'm gonna build a business. I'm gonna make a ton of money on but I'm gonna give a granola bar to every single kid every time Somebody buys a granola bar, which I doubled the price up so I can still keep my margin. Yeah, like this is my favorite I'm a businessman. I love when people like Gary. I'm starting a granola bar company But really I'm also one of these new age millennials and I give a crap about the world. I'm like, okay, keep going Pat and he goes Yeah, so here's my theory. I'm gonna sell this granola bar. It's delicious I got the best chef ever this granola bar and I'm gonna then donate a granola bar to the kids in Africa because they're hungry Okay, Pat keep going now. Da da da da da then I'm like Pat. I'm looking at your business Why is your granola bar twice the price of every granola bar? Oh, I know why Pat because you want to keep all the money from the first granola bar And the only way you can give the other granola bars if you double the price and subsidize your donation You're full of shit Pat Pat lost I've seen a million Pat's lose when it comes from a true place You win and when it doesn't you don't and by the way Are there one or two Pat's a generation that sneaks through the system and scam it all the way through of course But do you want to be Pat laying on your yacht in the Caribbean one out of a trillion? The other trillion or looked as assholes fuck faces not respected bad humans But one Pat out of a trillion Do you actually want to lay there and sleep at night and realize what kind of dude you are? Chick you are because he's Pat because he could be both So, you know, I mean that's just a stupid game 99 9999% of you are gonna be deemed as a not good one in a good drillian gets through and you still got to sleep at night stupid Yeah, I agree. I agree man. Well, it's an honor to have you. Thank you, man. Thanks for having me Guys, thank you so much you guys aren't coming out Thanks, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, you know what that's that's the best that's why it works That's why I love doing Q&A like people don't do Q&A because they don't know their shit, right? And they're scared of questions. I'm not scared of any question like ask it like What people don't understand is it's unfortunate Then I only like I stay in a very narrow lane But I love when somebody asks me a question I say I don't know you want to really build Trust say I don't know Especially because I have so much bravado and what I like in my world. I really know so then when I get to say I don't that's why Q&A so great either I crush it or I say I don't know which are both wins Honest is the game in this game time So what you were doing actually was your intent was to look like a good person But still make as much money every dollar that you would have if you didn't have the bullshit model that you were donating something And so what you were were completely full of fucking shit So if you want to actually accomplish the thesis of this conference You need to make sure that your intent is pure Your intent the way you make your money The way you make your money is something you're proud of don't be full of shit because you're tricking the 90% That don't matter and you're losing equity with the 10% that do number two do you've got to work You feel super inspired from this weekend. You can't wait. What happens next Thursday? What happens next month you have to actually work a lot You know zero people zero People that have built something big that haven't put in a ridiculous amount of work and the bigger it is the more they work So many of you have your mouth way ahead of your actions Really, you're gonna own an island and you fucking go to Coachella fuck you You mean people here want to be a millionaire, you know rare bet is have you run the math? You have this enormous audacity You have this enormous audacity Yet you're not putting in the work to get you there because you think somehow you've been tricked by yourself or somebody else That there's some system That there's some fucking shortcut. There's no fucking shortcut You've got to put in the work Lots of it and that comes at the expense of golfing all the time And that comes at the expense of going to every goddamn event And it definitely comes at the expense of watching one more motivational video and three more books and seven more You have to do the way to win is as old as time Do the right thing and put in the fucking work. Thank you I Speed wins everything speed wins everything speed is absolutely one of my two or three religions in business speed fast Everybody's too precious. You're overthinking your content. You're overthinking your decisions You're better off doing 16 times and being right three times than not doing anything at all You're pondering you lack the confidence because you're worried about what people say. I like losing That's why this is all so easy. I don't give a fuck if you said I lost I True it's an important thing, bro. I love your beard But beard dude there is reacting to the right thing and I'll tell you why By not worrying about what other people think it allows you to do things by doing things you either win or you learn from your loss and Create speed it's the absolute mental difference between the people that are executing winning versus the people that aren't It's the fear of others. I don't want to lose, but I'm definitely more disappointed than your opinion in your blog post about my loss Go Thank you Thank you I Mean You can only teach people Fuck it, let's go Sure Thank you so much you're welcome so much thanks for coming Same and we're gonna like each other, but it's against a human will like what are you gonna do like like how are you gonna play? Like how are you gonna actually force the unwilling but force the ones that are capable because there's hard work You're stuck doing the wrong job sure so just start it Like like you understand the unwilling come to the market Like you don't need permission from anybody to do it Yeah, yeah, you can't sit and dwell and say you know me companies want to market to 12 to 18 year olds a shitload You just need to go ask every one of them to give you money When I started my when I started VaynerMedia nobody wanted to do social media marketing So I got and I had a big name and I had a million followers on Twitter and I built a big business I had street cred and no no no no no no no no no no yes But for a number but for a number that I hated but I had to take it I had to take it for $5,000 a month from These are biggest big companies and they want to pay me less than they do for like the stupidest shit on earth But I had a ticket it doesn't matter what you want it matters what they want You just need to not dwell on it and just ask everybody I have Family so that's why I'm being like pretty I want to be fair and say no But I'm giving away my time in my community like that's how I'm doing it So like whether it's 62nd Club or randomly just asking an email it could happen especially in today's environment where? So many people living there like it's way better for you to like take the seven people that you want to be like or admire and Watch what they're doing then read their book. It's way smarter to watch what I do every single day than it is to read my book You know like we're so lucky we get to watch people's actions in public It's so powerful like there's a reason I wanted you guys on my Instagram story today to like hit the Notification bell on YouTube you should understand what that means. Why did I do that? Why do I care that way more than me talking about it 14 months from now of why I did it fresh thing everybody like Don't listen to what I'm saying watch what I'm doing watch what I'm doing watch what I'm doing like you know and so and so You're not you know, what do you think you're gonna do like there's there's nothing there's unlimited motivation of speakers I'm not a motivational speaker. I'm gonna say it every single time. I understand I come off that way But it's what I'm doing. That's so much more important. Yeah There's a lot of motivational speakers that are in a business to just make money off people that don't want to do They're bottom-feeding. I don't want anybody that doesn't want to do notice how I'm saying things that nobody says like don't watch my content They all want you to watch their content so you can buy their course What do you think's happening? Like what's the matter with you guys like so so I don't know What do you think you're gonna do for your friends that want to come to you like like if they're just your friend If you have a business that you want to sell to them to motivate them Well, that's a different story, but if you're just trying to be something I could turn that into as well I'm gonna tell you something right now. It is the worst business in the world Selling to unmotivated people because you're bottom-feeding Okay, that's why I don't do it So I give the right answers and then I hope you do something about it, but that's not where I'm making my money I'm not making my money on you Everybody else is making their money on you. I'm not I don't like that business People are selling to the bottom 10% That's what I make all their money the people that will never do and will continue to buy every course because they think some new person came along and They've unlocked it. They have You know that they've they figured it out Okay, I will never sell to somebody who's not fixable You know Welcome, I just want to say you're a ledger. Thank you. Thank you. My snapchat. Yes, stop bullshitting. You're all fucking foolish Okay, I just want to say thank you in person for answering my family business question I meant the world to me. Can I just get a quick picture? Yes How do you talk a lot about like self-awareness and stuff? How do you get your team to be on that same level as you by giving them everything they need? You work for your team Yeah How many how many are on your team right now 15 and trying to get to 25 great How many times have you sat down with the 15 one by one for three hours and asked them? What do they care about in life and how do you help them? That's important. Yeah, I get that's the answer bro. Like how do you get your team to care care for them first? You know You're worried about 15 and 25 without getting 15 giving them everything you got reason Vayner got so big Is those first 50 I gave them everything at 800 gets harder Yeah, you gave so much to to pick up the pieces got it. Yes, sir You're you're 15 to 25 to 25 to 80 is gonna be irrelevant if you don't make these 15 Feel like they fucking mean the world to you and you actually do for them what matters to them at your own peril You should leave Yeah So fucking young learn something else You're in a bad spot you're in the same spot I was with Wine Library Dude it's the worst but I'm telling you right now the quicker you move and let the poison out and start forgiving Otherwise you're gonna be stuck forever Well, that's right, but then you like then then you've got it you ever say it's binary That's what's so crazy about these hard-life decisions. There's no half pregnant Right either you're either you're stuck just because that happened in the beginning and you thought it would work out like so many of those Things have gone wrong for me. I can't even family this I get it man So like so like if your brother has control you've got a problem Well, my dad started he had to sell or give it to him okay because the government okay And then now he's the boss which he should be a boss with bigger company, okay? And he didn't mean my dad worked awesome understood, but he's a fucking douche, okay? Like just walk away or I want to still sell my shed. Okay? I'm the one in the world. I know it's the best. That's a good start like if you got like I'm the on the face of the company Well, that's you're in a great spot So what do you sell? Air conditioning great. Can you grow? Great so like maybe you do you have a non-compete? No sounds like you can start a business my problems seem far less silly now I got problems. I don't want to be here on a Saturday when my family's not here I got problems, but guess what? I made my bed. I'm making my choices. I got my reality Every single person here has shit all of you you all have shit. Do the white dudes have it better? Yes, guess what? They still have shit everybody's got shit and nobody cares about your shit They care about their shit because everybody's got shit. So nobody cares about your fucking complaining go fucking do something and that's it Go Google conferences and email that you'll speak for free. That's it Like what you think somebody's gonna come along be like, oh, we're so sorry here. We'll put you on stage. They don't care You got it. That's it Good luck on draft day Gary.

They had to take the swim. You still have to break up that you don't that's your reality You just do it. You know what I mean like like I don't care that I didn't have that I have it now How do I do it now like like you make choices? I don't come on weekends to anything, but I did today.

Yeah, and learn learn different things meet different people. You'll stuff along what you want to do you graduated college Ain't you did what you supposed to cause your mama spent you? See all them weapons earn the title belt on the world champion, but no one else knows Yeah, been this way just been going through it lately. I want this art is my career, but it's not paying me daily Ain't it's great for a car payment for a There's damn near a thousand I came to Ford to be lazy and I just lost my kid That's how we got there. We believe in what I believe which is there's no silver bullet one restaurant at a time Tartt is not at heart Building big business and should be fun. I agree like why shouldn't it be hard? You understand? Yeah, that's what's so interesting to me people like it's hard We we spend so much time on what we don't have Versus focusing on what we have and so I'm energetic because I'm grateful and I'm happy and when you're happy like Everything clicks and so I think I get my energy from natural chemicals for sure But other than that I would say gratitude is my biggest driver for energy Not everybody needs to build a trillion dollar business like maybe you're at a place where you're like hmm It'd be cool to sell create some stability get some cash in I'll eat shit for a year or two and stay at the company That buys me I've got other dreams other ambitions other businesses. I want to build that's a sense I'm getting that's you're debating and I think that's cool I think when you see consolidation there's two things one winners massive consolidation There's opportunity because a lot of the people that compete with you are gonna get eaten up and then suck because they're part of big Things so this is your time to grow you might also be tired bored or intrigued by something else So this may be the time for you to set Hi, I'm right. How are you? Good? I have a question Do you think it's possible to have a full-time job in still the potential business? It's hard, but yes I think you can start the foundation to a successful business Yeah, you can't Like successful like half so I built my story business for five years did that full-time? I'm a practicing attorney though went back to practicing law and now what I would do is Decide what you want to do. Do you want to run the jewelry business? So what I want more Right, so do the attorney thing save live more humbling like how much are these? Got it. That's your only way talking your actions. So if you really want to do I get it. So if you want more, but you want to do the jewelry thing what you have to give up I know what you want to do so you have to give up the fucking shit you're buying between them I'm out On a serious note Shit's good man hustling driving reacting living Appreciate you guys being part of this journey. So crazy
