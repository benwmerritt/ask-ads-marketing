It's almost 15 a.m. Do rock and I Hotel That's how we do it I've been I haven't seen anything yet. I need her where's your chin what? Let's go guys. It's one o'clock. Yeah, I need you again. I need him. You got to find him We're just preparing so he saw us. What's this in your favorite app? What happened first? Well, what would have you heard first Gary? Appreciate that you're here. What do I open up? I don't even know what I open up Happy New Year to everybody hope everybody everybody have a good Break So I'm sure at this point you've seen The acquisition of PureWow And I'm sure you've done your homework if you knew it or you didn't this is an acquisition This is a another media conglom like the way Hearst owns seven things now We have the gallery we own PureWow and we may start a Knicks media company that you're gonna want to be a part of Pirates Bummed it up the Knicks too any other questions Jesus Christ Loomis you couldn't be further away You're literally the single furthest away fucking person. Oh No Justin got it if that's Justin. I can't even see that fucking part. All right, go ahead Great question so the question is like how is this different than a holding company? Obviously we're beholden to me at the highest level and how is this different? This is a great opportunity This is why Q&A is the best. This is why we're gonna do a lot more of this. Let me explain what that means the structure of A holding company is not bad You're more than welcome to own multiple businesses. That's just smart and fine And the problem is when you're only giving advice to your clients in your own financial vested interest The way we're different is if the dove team wants to get 48 million dollars to refinery 29 mazel top It doesn't bother me and that's it. I don't know what else to tell you Just simple as that. It's not super complicated I think the difference is is that holding companies are at the highest level publicly traded companies on Wall Street that have to hit a margin So the stock price goes to a certain value so that the executives making the decision get paid They don't own their company Even the top top leader I do and I'm holding it forever and so that's the distinction It's not so much that we don't have different things It's it's the religion and the actions that you preach You know and then and so many people here have been in holding company environments and understand how many decisions are made for that reason So that's that's how I see it that it's different, you know And so if our media department now started telling everybody don't buy anything but banner ads on Purewell That's bad But if we get unbelievable deals and work together tremendously well and that's a good deal for them then great But there's no reason if you're targeting 13 to 17 year old dudes that you should even worry about what's going on at Purewell Gonna work Town hall the best part about that. That's why I took it there. We have to be town hall start talking town hall. We will win Perfect, right? Great color where'd you go? Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah Good stuff Mark I Was that I didn't appreciate what does the rest of the you excited man. You must be freaking out We guys playing sealers at Pittsburgh tough game. Hey, yeah, good luck And that's my fault, so let's make it happen. Yeah, totally just get up the tie guy do that. Yes, that's all I could do She's still live she just works on she just works on different things now You Know the answer to that right Anytime you put the camera down there's brilliance spewing directly out of my fucking mouth every minute Andy That's right. I'm editing this. I'm editing this eBay video. Yes amazing. This comes I talked to Andy I give him something great. No, you've got camera fucking Sitting down like I don't understand what the strategy is here Yeah, bring him in here Did anybody say hello say hello to anybody with their name tags Go to cafeteria right now follow him. Do you rock? That's it. That's what's happening. And that's it. That's what's happening right now I That's true some people I think so. Yeah, I usually go to Facebook in the morning news. It's got updates It's so much time on Facebook. I just never really consume anything for my like Yeah, oh you mean for work. Yeah, like yeah work What's up When I see In Italy yeah, they started talking to me text to me around 2 a.m. Over there is a Okay Our thanks good good Guess I do remember that actually Welcome We get into Dynamics of fear right mom and pop mom and pop right? I don't know if you guys want to zoom in and I don't know how you guys want to edit this video But you should really really like just zoom in on this son Yeah, you know this thing right here because my mom and pop. I know you're I'm sure that's why you asked the question Right my friends. I have good news. I'm just like you my dad had a you know 3.6 million dollar a year revenue liquor store one store unit in New Jersey I came to this country with nothing my dad did I was a four-year-old child. He made two bucks an hour You know, I worked as a 13 year old in his small store in Springfield learned the business plenty of you watching I've really learned your space. That's why I love you guys so much. That's why I want to do this You grew up at your grandpappy shop, you know, you bought into the business or you Grinded saved all your money for 18 years and bought your own dealership. I know what you're dealing with It's why I'm so passionate that I'm right There's a reason I grew my dad's mom and pop store from a three to a sixty million dollar business in five years This isn't about me writing books This is about I did it right and I did it for 15 years and then after I did it I started talking So yes, I'm much more the people in this conference than the fancy conferences I speak at that are marketers as corporate environment Executives, right? I'm more like you where every dollar matters I'm telling you this because I don't want you to waste money You think this is scary and you're gonna waste money because it might not work I know that what you're spending money on right now is not working as well as you think it is So yeah, I think that one of the reasons I've done quite well in this environment is Shit if my dad didn't have a liquor store and had a car dealership I would have been the car dealership guy like this is very much my domain This is about selling and marketing and and and I'm very empathetic my first marketing budget for Wine Library I built that business from three to sixty million with a eight thousand dollar marketing budget as the first year's budget I know money So when you have no money when you guys are spending twenty thousand dollars a year or eight thousand dollars a month You can't waste it right and the only way not to waste it is to buy something that people don't think is valuable You're overpaying for radio billboard local commercials because it's established You're under buying an influencer who's taking a selfie at your car lot for fifty eight dollars or two hundred ninety dollars or four thousand dollars But it's worth eighty thousand because eight hundred fifty seven thousand people follow them on Instagram This is basic. How do you get to take that leap of faith? I do it aggressively as you're seeing in this interview. I punched them in the face. I give them no wiggle room I don't pander to them. I tell them they're big fucking boys and girls like this is what's up And I don't give a shit if they do it or not, right? I'll come into Atlanta to bring it right and then I don't kid. You're not my mom I don't give a crap if any of them do it, right? How do I get them to do it by giving it my all on the field and if they don't do it? That's their loss and then when I see them in four years that I see these people too that come up to me and says I wish I started four years ago when you told them I go I told you I don't make them feel good about it I do when somebody comes up to me says damn it. I saw you four years ago in Vegas at this conference We're just doing it now. It's working, but my competitor did it and crushed us. I wish I listened to you I do not say it's not too late. I said you deserve to lose Yeah I Love it good energy, right last time That part One great. I hope you have a great day. I'm so glad we got to meet Talk to you Yeah Yeah, anything I can answer for you Just I guess it's been about six months now. So do you have any advice or the biggest thing for me is I want feedback and We're not the greatest organization for that. I think feedback from my standpoint is Being industry smart. So if I gave you a real good piece of feedback, I would read an hour a day on what's going on with e-com and discovering so just even like searching hashtags on Instagram finding Emerging luxury brand clicking see like what I the reason I think I'm the best strategist is because I'm always living it Like nothing trumps going to e-commerce websites for 20 minutes a day Like you know much smarter you would be if every day. How do you get to work? I take the subway perfect like if you spend 10 minutes and Like first of all, maybe you spend three or four hours to figure out the right strategy to be efficient That allows you to go to seven websites every single day. Yeah, do you know cool? That is? It's the work It's always the work For me though, it's so natural because I shop online But but but as you know you shop for you well, yes got it right so one week you should go to 59 sports product sites or like baby care I'm really into that So how's it going overall good you join the culture everything Culture is fantastic good come into 315 Wednesday Good and what are you working on right now? Thank you very much that makes me very happy to hear you say that sentence Tell me about yourself. I I spent about 12 years doing films. Oh you guys know each other That's so cool. I Know how you roll that's really neat. I'm so happy. Thank you. You're welcome. Awesome. Have a great day Nice meeting you That's so fun Thank you Good Good, I thought it was really important what you said about if it's right for your brand. It's right for your brand It's not right for your brand. It's not right for your brand. It's the game changer. Yeah, it's why we're gonna win Yeah, there's nothing else a lot of big agency worlds where like part of the reason that I came to an independent and you know That doesn't have a holding company is because I see all the politics that go into what you need to deliver for your clients based on Your interests Yep, good awesome. Take care. You too. And so the culture's been great. Everything's been great You didn't know what you were walking into I didn't I was like You came home you like, you know, you're like they're my piece of yeah, well, yeah, when's the other shoe gonna drop? Yeah, but everybody's just awesome. Good. What are you working on right now? I Pleasure Hey, did you guys see I bought a media company the first piece of editorial I'm creating is the 10 best-looking people in agency world and all three of you made the list One of you's eight one of you's nine one of you's ten. I'll let you guys debate But did you capture to all hands on today we showed the Wall Street Journal part Put buying a media company buying a media publishing company cuz media. Yeah. Yeah, what is it? The greatest As the best Insane right As like a personal Influencer, I can't tell them anything real. I can say hey like Yeah, this many likes and questions like the fact that Instagram gives us Those like shitty in nature in metrics like it's not a blog at this point Like it's like that was like something great and even that doesn't really tell you anything Well, ironically ironically it tells you just as much as television commercials tell you the problem is these marketers Because they don't understand it want to believe it or understand how to understand it Wanted to do something they don't ask the other media platforms to do for them the end What's TV telling you you think TV is telling them how many bottles of Captain Morgan or so that the wine library It's something that it's accepted and it's worse data than what you have right now So the answer to your question on the fucking first day you get to spend time with me is this It's just a matter of time Because when your contemporaries are the decision makers this will be your norm Of course because it's actually happening Can you give me four seconds Actually, can you give me two seconds? Yeah, I have to do this call. I'm sorry you to you to D-Rex. Sorry. Give me one second so I want to run a Division for small business that looks like original Like you know the story right I was a stuttered out by the Uber driver picked up Alex the missus train and He told me how he works for you and I just went crazy in the Tennessee like wallows driving like it was funny And it's so insane right like Alex missing his train Is why you work at VaynerMedia for guy that you like liked and respected and it was crazy I was watching the video on when you guys first moved into office that the same day I was just Life is so nuts. It makes me so happy like I live I live for that story I Like giving people at bats some things work out and some don't but you're doing good work, man. Like I you know You know one thing a lot of people You know how I always talk about college not being you know one thing people like to razz me about like hey VaynerMedia Like I'm like we do plenty of rogue ass shit Including like Alex DeSimmons Uber driver, let's give them a chance and then you know what's great about the way I think I play is as being somebody like who doesn't have a Harvard degree hanging You know, I don't give a shit where anybody comes from what it looks like by the way you might have went to fucking, Columbia I have no idea what the fuck like I don't know. I don't really know your background. Here's what I know I know that I love that we can fucking hire Uber drivers And they can dominate and do the kind of creative that you're doing and that excites the shit out of me And I assume you're learning a lot. Oh, yeah I'm glad to be around the team that's like smarter than me more creative Of course I need to work harder and like where are you from? I'm from Queens, but I live in I have that long island So, yeah, it's crazy I don't even know I definitely wanted to get this one. I want to get a coin in I feel like we've been warming up to each other anyway Yeah, come in my pleasure Roddy, I'm a big fan of that I think a lot of people, you know, I haven't talked about this in my content the last couple years but back in the day you should talk a lot about like Get a nine to five, you know, obviously be nice if it you liked it But get a nine to five that you have a lot of flexibility with that pays your bills, right? And allows you to then hustle, you know, what back with crush at 7 p.m. to 2 in the morning, you know So I'm not I think that's exactly right. It's practical. It's right. Where do you work? I'm working at AT&T right now in sales There we go Oh my god, I cannot believe it Oh my god I'm very good my friend. How are you? I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm here in Luxembourg. Very nice. Thanks for staying up for so late I have a few projects next to my school because I'm really like I am entrepreneur spirit Good. Also when no one to my family has it, but I know from where it got it And I'm also involved in the national marketing also beside it goes really good But yeah, but my big thing is really like to change something this world to inspire the world in a good way And to find a big problem and find a solution for it. Good for you. Listen I don't know where to go. I don't know where to go. That's it So here's what I would say let it come to you and realize you have a long way to go You're a young man like you don't if you're look, you know There's all those cliche sayings right like the teacher comes when you're ready for it all that stuff like if you're trying to find The world's problem. You're usually blinding yourself from it live your life and react to where you see there's pain or issue And that's the best way to find it You care if I'm honest you want me on this? You know the truth is it's gonna be a non-conversation because I don't have everything figured out That's a tough way to That's a tough way to Jeez that's not Poor guy's like what? If I'm the best I'll be in that That's okay I'll be in there too. You should worry about you I'll worry about me Okay Alright? Yeah I might also go directly asleep and then you'll have to worry about me tomorrow But it's a good mess Off to the races Exactly A lot of this stuff is flop off Today was a unique day I've heard that Yeah, it's a nice and travel bag The Abcocks are huge They're from Boulder right? I think they're Boulder Denver, yeah All-American made Handmade I don't like American made You don't like American made? Why's that? Overpriced Overpriced? The fact that I literally don't think I know where Anything I have in the world is being Zero Zero knowledge of medicine When they say American made I mean they usually like tell me Yeah, but I don't pay attention Where's Abbie? So what do you want if I said to you go backwards What would be the ideal thing? What would you like to look like? Um, I really don't know I think that's it First of all, I like that answer Because I just want the truth, right? There's nothing wrong with that But I do think that that's super important And not that you have to make one decision And then you stick to it forever Let me say something here That I actually thought for the first time the other day It was interesting to me that it was crossing my mind The other day As you know, because you can follow me from some time base Don't know what you just said There's a lot more going on with me Over the last six months of this year Than there was before, right? So, so You know, crossed my mind the other day I'm like, wow, will I freak out In like three years And just want to spend one year with my whole family And be like, hey, am I wrong? Like, I thought there was like this really powerful Piece of content that ran through my mind I love hustling, I'm 24-7 I want to buy the jets and this and that But right now what I really want to do Is spend one year every minute with Misha and Xander While they're 10 and 7 And I'm going to go do that, see ya And like how much that would be very much on my That would be the most macro version Of what I've always been saying Which is like, when you know what you want to do Go do it, and that's like the only thing And so there's nothing wrong with you not knowing Exactly what you want to do But I do think it's important to always I don't think there's anything wrong with changing What you want to do, but I do think at every moment If you have the ability to understand what you want to do That's important So the reason I'm going crazy And 24-7 and all this insanity is I have this insane ambition So professionally 114 in the morning Big day Inbox Exploded So should we explode it Big announcement Pure wow Just get back in the grind Tons of new business New world New world New world New world New world New business New Orleans here for 12 hours Speech in the morning Heading out to CES Vegas Where DailyVee started Third episode But we had the big episode Excited about that And We were living the dream 15am Rock and I Hotel That's how we do it 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 You can put your money down on it Yeah, you can count on it 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 And if you're feeling like it sounds legit Then you should bounce it in
