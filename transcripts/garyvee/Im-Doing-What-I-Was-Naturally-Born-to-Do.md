how scary about being an entrepreneur? You know the truth is Ali, like I don't even know how to fully answer that because I don't, that's like asking me what's the best thing about being a human being or what's the greatest part of breathing oxygen, right? Like, you know, I, I mean the best part for me is that I'm doing what I think I naturally was born to do. It was kind of like what was the worst part of my life between six and 18 years old and that was, I was forced to do school in a world where that was like ripping my eye directly out of my head, right? Like, to me the best part is it's my natural being, it's who I am and I love entrepreneurship and meritocracy and capitalism and market behavior so much. I even like them more than my own well-being. Like, I secretly think that if I deserve to go out of business that that would excite me because I think I deserve it, right? Like, I love the game so much that I, I'm often, you know, for example right now we're in a very political climate and I'm yelling at all my old white dude rich friends in their 60s and 70s who think they're capitalist sale because they want a Republican president to protect their money and I'm like, you're a goddamn loser because you, you think that just because you made the money, you're entitled to save it, nobody, nobody is keeping IBM or Google or AT&T or BMW alive, that's the market and nobody should keep an individual alive. This is capitalism, this is business and you should grind forever and if you, if you take the foot off the pedal in your 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s, you should lose upside, you should lose and so I just love the game of business and entrepreneurship and to me that excites me and that's the best part. Thank you.
