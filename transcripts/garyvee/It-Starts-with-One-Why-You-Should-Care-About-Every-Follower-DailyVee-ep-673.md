You will stay in your single digits 812 in the morning Headed to Ohio Me and DRock in the airport Nostalgic feelings heavy I didn't bring the hoodie and the sweatshirt DRock's much more professional these days He was more willing to meet for me to do both back in the day and bad lighting bad audio He's going Hollywood on the Hollywood David Super excited. This should be a big one Ryan. This is full circle Ryan was sitting in his cubicle at a job He didn't like listening to the podcast watching daily V got the courage to jump and go into the card world Then he teamed up with Lou and Tyler to do card talk Earliness career show some edit here DRock maybe a clip from that Tyler's got the receipts and then when that shutdown has gone on to become one of the five to ten most influential creators in the card hobby and has a meaningful store in Ohio does this great thing for the kids and families Called card night and we're doing it today and I have a good feeling DRock's gonna be pumped because the visuals are gonna be strong and And we're gonna keep building the brand one, you know in the next six to twelve hours here 14 more people are gonna give deep about V friends I would say like 38% of our content with airport and backseat That's where we dominate We dominate that you know I have followed the content for so long Changed the trajectory for my life. I'm very open about that What would you say to somebody that it's you know 15 16 17 years old somebody that's like hey I want to do this. I want to be on that podcast one day. I want to talk to Gary one day What advice would you give that person by understanding who to look up to and who not to look up to and by understanding that Peep the bigger Ryan gets the more he'll start living the life I live which is people are gonna make up shit people gonna say shit It comes with the territory when you have a gift there's a curse that comes along with it and Envy and jealousy is an incredibly negative energy in our society But what I would say to them is spend time to be thoughtful of who you try to pattern yourself after and Really try to figure out what makes you tick. I walked into this office right now and I said I wish I could live here I want to live here You get all this real estate I can afford to real estate in New York Hey, how are you? Regina such a pleasure. Oh Tyler Tyler's on the podcast. Oh, right. Right. Make sense that reinforced what I'm feeling right now I'm 49 years old and I'm trying to sell myself right now on living my full passion Which is to spend all my time my be friends. I've got responsibilities. I got obligations I got a ton of shit going on so I've got a pattern it out But I felt this with Wine Library. There was a day that came this out. You know what? I can't build this for my dad anymore I've done my due I've paid my dues. I gave back to my parents But I'm 34 and I built a humongous business for my dad. I don't own it. I haven't been paid shit I got to go on my own and build something for myself and my brother's about to graduate college. This is the time right What what you need to do is you need to know yourself. I'm in that same place right now I'm putting this out publicly to put pressure on myself. I now know that V friends has to be what I built I Just have a lot to still do with Vayner X Vater sports other things Vayner what it goes on and on but I'm pressuring myself to go full-time on this if you follow your passion and what makes you tick and Not where do you think the money is if you're 15 year old right now and be like oh, it's crypto Oh, it's cannabis. Oh, it's trading cards. Oh, it's whatever. It's gonna pop next if you're chasing the dollars You're gonna get caught But if you do it about the thing you like you'll work the 15 hours a day because you would do it for free I would be Gary be doing exactly what I'm doing if it paid 40,000 a year because I like it too much and so that Yes, that's advice. Let's go meet a million people Today I want to say thank you. It took me out of the dark place I watched your video every year and a half ago I was down on my luck homeless and In a better place and I just wanted to come here and say thank you. I'm not with all this card stuff But I really wanted to see you and I want to say thank you and I really appreciate every thing you say every day I'm happy to do it Thank you. In fact, that's probably why V friends is so fun for me because All of you are underestimating it 99% of you Gary V fans aren't on board yet Why do you think I like it so much? That's the preference. I Love the underestimation. I love that. I can't see it. I love the being written off. I love the ONFTs were fab That's the one thing Gary V was wrong about we'll see I Hope that makes it an actual You like that You're high Guy yo your wallet, I'm gonna throw it to him D Rock watch this yo In the next 6 to 12 hours here 14 more people are gonna give deep fucks about V friends and that's how we're gonna do it one by one by one by one by one by one by one by one And that's the mistake so many of you make you're not excited about one subscriber or one like or one comment You're thinking millions and I'm thinking single digits think about that I'm fucking 49 with fucking an empire no bullshit And I'm still thinking single digits and you don't fucking take those single digit comments likes and shares and follows As a good thing if you take them for fucking granted because you're not grateful and you're not patient You're not a gorilla or a pig or a panda like in v friends And I am that's the difference and as soon as you get here with me You will get to the millions and as long as you sit and Pray and hope and be entitled that you deserve millions you will stay in your single fucking digits I Really need to make more quit your fucking job I mean just so you all know like quit your fucking job like like if that actually lands with you It means you should actually do it because 90% of you that watches right now You feel nothing and that's good. You shouldn't quit your job But the fucking 2% of you that just felt something you motherfuckers need to jump
