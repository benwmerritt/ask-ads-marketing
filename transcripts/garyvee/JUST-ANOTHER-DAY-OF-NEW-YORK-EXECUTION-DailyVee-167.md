## Transcript
But if this little commercial break from the episode does anything, please understand, the only person you need permission from is yourself. Macro, I'm from mom and casual. Got it like ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro, like a vision boy, I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Garry V. Sob, I've been telling you. Accountants are talking about equity. I'm trippin' like giving a pedigree. They mean that I'm special, my specialty. I puttin' the work, tellin' I'm dirtin' the earth, I'm movin' furniture to bevin'. Tuesday morning, back on the grind after nice weekend. I haven't taken a Monday, President's Day, my entire career, so it was fun. But as the kids get older, wanna sneak in more time, hacking, always adjust. You know, that has been the absolute pillar of my success, which is if I decide tomorrow that I'm anti-hustle and it's all about laying on the beach and zenning out mentally, I'll own it. I'm not scared, not scared to change my tune. Obviously, there's a big difference between changing and breaking your word. We talked about that in yesterday's episode. But excited. The weather looks good this week. Looks pretty cool. Should be a nice grinding week. Tastes a hectic day. I'm on my way to go see David Levy, President Turner broadcasting. Incredible guy, one of my favorite executives. Really one of the more entrepreneurial senior executives that I've come across, just willing to do stuff. And that's why he's had a great career. Salesman at heart, that always speaks to me. One thing we need to expand on more in daily via salesmanship. One of the biggest reasons I'm pushing 2017 flip challenges, I genuinely believe that whether you're 60 or 16 or 90 or 19, that learning how to sell is one of the incredible advantages in running a business in your whole life. So much of my career has been being so great at sales that I was able to wait for the market to come to me. A lot of the strategies and things I believe in are futuristic, are three to five years away. What do you do before everybody wants to spend on Facebook? What do you do before everybody wants to spend on social media? What do you do before everybody wants to drink Spanish and Australian wines? What do you do? What you do is you find a few people that are actually out there willing to buy. One of the things I talk a lot about is not selling to the unsellable, right? If somebody's not willing to buy, you've got no shot. And so, these are some of the patterns. So I find myself always attracted to salespeople. Abbie, nobody's around. Everybody's still off today? Yeah, school's out. Got it. But the city seems quiet. And then, just to have us all lined, me, you and the one or two people or three, whatever's in the trenches, and then we can go. And then we can have kind of a weekly kind of 10-minute call meeting in the office, 10, 15 minutes, just to keep me somewhat abreast to it. That's the real problem when people want to figure it out. Yeah, he's got it. That's sitting in the world. What is that? What's up, man? How are you? Yeah, my name is Mohamed. Mohamed, nice to meet you. I'm trying to show you some samples. Thank you, my friend. And check it out. I will. Thank you, man. I really appreciate it. Let me get a card. A card? And one question that I have is, how did you make the transition? I know you were selling wine. And how did you make that transition from selling physical product to like a service? Being a personal? Yeah. It just takes time. Everybody sees me now. Yeah. But in 1999, 1998, how old are you? 25. Just keep doing it for five years. You'll be a young man and you'll be there. Patience. I mean it when I say patience. 100%. I believe that. Nice to meet you. Take a picture. Yeah, let's do it. Always trying. All right, my man. Real pleasure. Take care. Thank you. Thank you, my miss. No, it's all right. Hey. Morning. Supra. Split ends. Always. What's up, Kenny? Yo. You giving me my first customer for my beanie company? I'm doing it. I'm definitely doing it. I'm going to launch a beanie brand. 100%. 100%. I'm a fan of... I just feel like I love wearing them so much. I want to have like summer ones too, like that are thinner. A lot of them strategists, I'm like, now I'm just like over-strategized. I don't even... You have left... You're over everyone's head. You're over all of culture's head. It's just kind of there. Yeah. So, I need someone who is... A culture hacker? Yeah, that's a great way to put it. It's like, man, that person just gets culture or understands... I mean, that's what I'm doing. Like great time. Like that's what I'm winning on. I'm hanging out with rappers who are two years away from being famous. I'm put... And when I see blood in the water like Instagram, I go all in and then everybody's like, how do you get so much more famous in three months? It's because I have that moment. Like a truck along, a truck along, a truck along and then I have a moment. It's kind of how I think about the influencer Facebook thing. Get me three names ASAP. That's her. Hey guys. Hey. Hello. Hello. Hey. Hi. Real life form? I feel like I'm dreaming right now. Do you believe the term fake it till you make it? I think it's an interesting term. It's funny that you brought that up. It's starting to hit my radar. It's been asked about a lot more lately. I think it's a good one. I think that I hate fake it till you make it in the way that it's happening now, which is people are just talking shit on social and trying to make it. They're just talking shit on social and truly faking it. Like there's dudes that legitimately rent everything from watches, cars, vacation house and girls to paint a picture to the outside world on their social. I hate that. You're strategizing your next step. So while they think you're listening to Kanye, you are taking the next move. I think faking it till you're making it inside of your own head, which is you're constantly pushing yourself and you believe in yourself and you're realistic about where you are. That's why I brought up document over creating. If you guys are like, hey, we're too young entrepreneurs. We're hustling. We're just starting the journey of this podcast, of this blog, of this thing. It's way cooler than you guys saying like, we're doing it. Like that's what everybody's doing. Like the second they put CEO or entrepreneur in their Instagram, they start trying to act it. And they think taking a selfie with like one of the sharks on Shark Tank proves it. I think it's important for people to know that even at my level, like to spend a second and just say thank you. And I just really appreciate it. You're crushing. Thank you. I've been here for like six months and like before Lauren left, like she was my mentor so she taught me so much. I just think it's your work ethic as well. Thank you. That's just really impressive to me. It's such a big thing for me. Anyway, I just really genuinely wanted to steal a minute of your time and let you know it's on my radar. It's on the organization's radar. And if there's anything I can ever do for you or answer for you, I'm here. I know you've been talking about patience. Yes. Do you think this is like a millennial issue? Sometimes we tend to work on it for like one or two months. Yes. It's not most regressive. Sure. But good news. It's only a millennial thing because millennial is already a young generation now. It was a Gen X thing. It was a baby boomer thing. When you're young, you're impatient. Patience is always my model. Like if you guys actually, all four of you fuckers, understood how young you guys were and how much time you actually had. The new thing that I've said this once or twice is if I could let all four of you feel how I feel right now, like how young I feel, how much more time I have, like where I'm going, like the youth I feel in my soul, you guys would change everything you do. I don't know a bit about it. You know, if you guys knew how much, like it would change everything because then you would get really fucking patient. You'd be really calculated. You'd really built real good building blocks for something serious. How are you? Really good, man. It's a real pleasure. How's it going so far? Yeah, it's good. Good. Yeah, it's busy. How long you been here now? August started. Good. Yeah. You enjoying it? Yeah, it is. It's really interesting. That's a whole different thing. Yeah, that goes. But I thought that was really cool and interesting. Yeah. Yeah, and you should use this meeting as a permission to ping me anytime. Yeah. I want to interact with the company often. So I'm always here. Yeah. Ad hoc on email like, hey, why is this happening? Or like this for five, 10 minutes? Or hey, can I once a year get a drink with you for 40 minutes? The answer is yes to all. Yeah, I love that. No, it's cool. I will say it is nice. I mean, I know it's obviously a big thing. The stress of the culture first coming in, but it's cool. It's nice. I understand how important EQ and culture is being thrown around like entrepreneurship. Right. Well, that's hot now. Correct. Correct. No news. Correct. So for me, I take both very seriously, and I think that's why we're getting the results on both fronts. Yeah, awesome. I really appreciate it. My pleasure, buddy. Have a great day. All right. I'll talk to you soon. Yeah. Because my wife now watches it. My son Luke watches it. So you're going to make a big cameo. You already made a quick little one the other day in our dinner. I've yet to watch it daily. I watched it about once a week. I'll take it. Thank you for the look. Okay, it's a start. It's a real start. I say to myself, oh my God, is he signing more books? We're looking at all these logos and emblems. You guys like. There we go. How are you, man? That's exactly right. And not only that, the reason I replied because I would never waste your time is I genuinely believe that meditation is the next enormous consumer space. But in the same way that Starbucks took over coffee and the same way that SoulCycle, Equinox, just kind of like the physical health revolution back to what you and I talked about over the last 20, 30 years, that in 10 years every single American is spending real money on mental fitness. So I think a lot of the creative is out of our hands until those are out and we have some dollars left over for the amplification and the micro moments and the cutting room floor. That's where I think the Vayner proper LA can have a little say. Got it? Have insights to the names of the alternatives of the names they gave us so it's creatively on par. We should leave next week with a good idea creatively of what we're doing with my main video and who are the top 10 targets to be the other four faces of the brand. Yeah, I don't want it out so this is where it needs to die. Obviously some other people know. So if Juliette, whatever, make sure nobody talks about it. Okay, thanks guys. Thank you. VaynerNation, both my posts today. Like I can't get off this kick. I'm just ranting right now talking straight to camera. Who the fuck's permission are you looking for? Like it's either your parents, your brother. I can't believe how many of you are to me. Like everybody's just looking for a nudge. Like you need to figure that out within yourself. Like this is literally, literally like jumping in the pool and swimming for the first time or like skydiving for the first time or kissing a boy for the first time. This is all the same shit. Like having sex for the first time. Like proposing. Like having a child. Living the life that you want for yourself is the biggest version of all those things. And it is my dream that my content creates that for you. But I'm scared that I'm not going to get to most of you. I'm scared that I'm not going to get to most of you and I'm scared that even the ones that are giving me their attention right now, I haven't been able to penetrate yet because I have to talk in generalities because I don't know you. I won't get the serendipity of being in front of you. But if this little commercial break from the episode does anything, please understand. The only person you need permission from is yourself. Great day going with my boys now at AJ and Matt Higgins. Heading on this helicopter. I'm sure you'll get a really cool shot. Couple of little bit of secret business meeting. Got to keep something secret my friends. Good day of hustle. I feel really good. The electricity of the action keeps me going forever. I wish on you the love of the game that I have for my game. And I hope you guys have a great night.
