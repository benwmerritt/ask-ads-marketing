Please listen to your intuition yourself. Your gut is more powerful than your brain. So many of you talked yourself out of your inner voice, out of what society, your parents, and what you think is the right thing to do, and don't. I'm telling you don't. We do not understand intuition right now. One day we will. And I believe intuition might be the most underrated energy of the human spirit. And I believe in 100 years we'll understand how meaningful it is. When you execute on your intuition, you start to collect admiration. And admiration is a very nice feeling. You know, hey, if you get that gut feeling, you know, don't go around that corner, it's probably right. And 90% of the time it is right. How do you differentiate? And I would argue it's 100% right because even if it's a mitigated disaster, you have no regret. Yeah. Whereas what's killing people, Kev, is they're walking around with regret because they didn't follow their intuition. And then they live life a little bit. And inevitably, because it's how it all works, they're faced with seeing that they made the wrong call to not jump. It's kind of like love. A lot of people don't marry the love of their life or intuitively feel it because they over rationalize it. They're gonna be a good provider. They're super attractive. They have a good family. Whatever, there's 800 reasons why people marry someone that they know deep down it's not. And I think about it in relationships and I think about it professionally. I just don't think people follow intuition enough. Got it. Now how do you differentiate intuition and fear? Cause sometimes they feel like the same thing but they're not, right? Like fear of the unknown. Yeah, no, I think it's a good question. I don't think, to your point, I don't think people are confusing them. I think fear is what's stopping people from following intuition. Damn, okay. That's a great way to put it. Yeah, yeah. It's fear that's the counter. And I believe that almost everybody would be jumping into their intuition if they were more fearless. Yeah. There's a v-friend called Fearless Ferry. Yeah. I'm telling you, I'm desperate to make her as popular as Minnie Mouse. Because if I do, I'm gonna help a lot of children create a different relationship with fear and can be a counterpoint to the fear that parents and the world instills in them. Fear is the fucking kryptonite to the Superman that is intuition. If you could say one thing to your childhood self, what would that be? I'm talking like eight to 10 years old. Are you sure you wanna be a Jets fan instead of a Giants fan? Cause you're gonna miss out on four Super Bowls and it's gonna be a misery. It's funny, eight to 10 is an interesting range. Eight year old me and 10 year old me were two different humans. Let me explain. 10 year old me is the year I realized school didn't matter for me. And I actually believed it. And I would argue that one of the reasons I'm a unique person and I believe I'm unique. And I don't say that in a good or bad way to be frank. It's because I don't think that is a very common thing to happen in 1985. That a 10 year old just wakes up which is what happened to me and said, uh oh, school means nothing to me. And I don't even, I can't even comprehend why. This is what makes me believe in like prior lives and like psychic, like it, I lived it and I kind of half believe it. So if I was talking to 10 year old me, I'd be like, I'm like, follow your intuition. You're very self aware, you little guy. And you've really are way too wise for your years. And stay close to your mom like you were doing. Keep extracting and then fuck man, I would really tell my 10 year old self like you're about to really enjoy this, enjoy it. My eight year old self, it was so young. Like, you know, like it'd be a little bit, it would be a little different version of that because I hadn't gotten to that epiphany. And you know, I don't really know what I would say other than like probably similar stuff. But the 10 year old me is a very interesting person. Like I really went from getting A's and B's to getting D's and F's by fourth grade. Like it was like a hard transition. And I'm not so sold that it was just my epiphany. I would argue what probably started happening was school was getting harder for me because now I've come in my older age to understand I had some reading comprehension issues. And so I don't think it was like I woke up at 10 and said, oh, school doesn't matter. I think I was reacting to school starting to shift on me. And it was probably my, I have a really incredible coping mechanism slash internal framework that makes me take every negative and immediately move it to a hyper positive. So if I'm really psychoanalyzing, what I think happened was I'm like, uh-oh, why is this starting to become hard when it was so easy? And very quickly instead of saying, let me get tutors, let me work hard at this, I probably manipulated myself to saying, hey, you're already making money on lemonade and shoveling snow and you're that guy. Like I don't know what happened, but it was staggering. And instead of being some weird three minutes that brings nobody value on this podcast, let me convert it into value. My friends, please listen to your intuition and yourself. So many of you talked yourself out of your inner voice, out of what society, your parents, and what you think is the right thing to do. And don't, I'm telling you don't. We do not understand intuition right now. One day we will. And I believe intuition might be the most underrated energy of the human spirit currently. And I believe in a hundred years, we'll understand how meaningful it is. And I think your gut is more powerful than your brain. And my 10 year old self started that journey. This business that I just launched is called the Content Factory San Diego. And it's a podcast and video studio that people can rent out, give you kind of a view of one of the sets. So people just show up, we have all nice equipment cameras and engineer that runs everything and pushes out all the stuff for you. So you show up, shoot your content and leave with the raw footage. Looking at that business model and looking where content is going with AI and other things, what are your thoughts on that? How can this business model be successful? I feel I can say this humbly. I think I'm one of the pioneers of high output creative for social. You know, and obviously clipping agencies and AI and all like nobody who's listening right now is confused of what happened, which was go make long form content and then clip it in perpetuity to the best of your ability on as many social media platforms to create a flywheel. I literally put out a deck. That went super viral, that was free, breaking this down 10 years ago, seven years ago, whatever, six years ago, I don't remember when I did the 84, six, seven. So what do I think? I think it's great. I think it makes sense. And I think what you're trying, I assume, this is the first time I'm hearing, I assume what you're doing is you're eliminating the friction that so many people have. I get 4,000 people a day asking me like, how do I do this? Well, it sounds like you're like, hey, give me money and you just walk right in, do your fucking thing and we will send you out. Like we'll take care of all the production in a beautiful environment here. And I think it's great. I think the next part is the imperative part, which is are you then good at post producing it to maximize reach in the seven social networks? And so those are the two things that matter the most. One, capturing the content, which is what you're doing. And then two, the next evolution is be great at post producing it to create organic reach in the channels that matter to maximize your exposure and brand building. Sure. So my thought behind it has always been that we wanna focus on one thing, like one variable. I don't really wanna get into the editing side of things. We just partnered with an editing agency. I think that's right, brother. I think, to your point, I answered what everyone who's listening needs to do. I don't think that that's what you need to offer. Sure. You're more than welcome to offer it. You're more than welcome to do what I just heard you're doing. Team up with somebody else to do it. If someone says, I don't want just part one, I want part two. But it is the parts of the current marketplace. And so heck, you don't even, you could have not even done the engineering and the initial piece of content. You could have decided to be in the real estate business and just offer podcast studios. Like everybody's allowed to pick what part of the factory line they wanna be in. You've chosen one of the most significant parts. The other most significant parts is creative excellence in post production. For bigger brands, it then is after the content is in social, the analytics and the strategic thinking to analyze everything that happened to then do more campaigns and build on top of the insights. So like this thing fucking plays forever. And then for me, step four is like, after those campaigns have hit analyzing that and fly wheeling the whole thing. So we all have different pieces of the assembly line. And I think you've picked one of the viable ones. Yeah, great, cool. Yeah, I think, and I think for me, focusing on the one aspect of it is gonna help us scale a little bit. Cause I'd like to open up multiple studios, but this one's going, I mean, we only opened in April and we're already doing pretty good. So I wish I had the time to explain how much it changed my life, but you already know, you hear it every day. Gary, thank you so much for showing up. Guys, everybody go get Gary's new book, Day Trading Attention. I ordered a bunch of copies and I've been handing them out to people that I think won't waste them. Gary, thank you so much, brother. Love you brother, stay well.
