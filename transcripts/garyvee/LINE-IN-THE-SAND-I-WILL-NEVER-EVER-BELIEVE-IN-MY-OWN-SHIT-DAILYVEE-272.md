Tuesday thoughts as I go up the escalator get this lighting right. I just can't believe how many of you don't realize you're fundamentally in charge. Like completely and utterly in charge. People dwelling and thinking other people are controlling their lives. It's fucking excuses to not do. You are 100% in charge and in control of your circumstance. You just got to break the vortex if you're not happy. You just got to break the game you're in. You got to break the box that you're stuck in. You've got to break shit because you're in control. Nobody else. So if you see something we're doing you should email us and be like hey why did DRock do that? Why'd you make a Alexa briefing? You can feel super comfortable in that all. Out of all the things Alexa turn off. Jesus fucking Christ. I have to agree deeply on two fronts. Do I believe in the entrepreneur? Two, do I believe in the thesis? I've learned recently that I can't waver. I need to be 100 on both. That's when I've won and anytime I haven't been 100 on both I've lost. My intuition on pure intuition is there's not a lot of people that know me, care about me and that we know that are more wired into India. So I'd really like for you two to build a relationship. I'd like to go to India in late February. Okay, cool. Okay, thank you so much for your time Gary. Such a pleasure meeting you man. I really enjoyed it. Hi man, how you been? Yeah man, you been well? It's good to see you. Strategy number one is sheer will. The most important part of the strategy is the part that nobody talks about which is how fun is it to lay in bed from 11.30 p.m. to 2 in the morning and type shit by yourself one by one and I'm very aware of Superphone. I'm about to do it. I mean I looked at it two years ago now. I'm about to play with it as well a little bit. Strategy is super simple. Here's the punchline. I wrote about it in 2011. It's real simple. I think you should say hello to every single fucking person who's ever listened to your song. Last time looking at the 800,000 and it's hard. It's really wild. I just genuinely think it's about depth and width and everybody only thinks about width. So when I have somebody DM me and be like you're the fucking best when I fucking, a lot of times I'll hard it, they lose their mind. But sometimes I'm in the mood of like thanks Karen. In video reply which takes like four seconds that I don't have. Right? Well then she fucking is a fan for life. Intuitively. And I was like it'll be fun for him to come and like spend 20 minutes and educate me. I'm like Gary no no. The reason I think YouTube is good or why I think Nielsen's has a conversation. Like the things that I want to get to next. I'm very as you can tell hands off for like I like people calibrating, auditing. I don't like putting them into like my vision. I like them to be independent thinkers and taste and learn. I mean the best part is you know we can't show shit but in like 10 years we'll show it all. And it's gonna bring people so much value. I'm leaving if my dad don't ever save me. I won't ever waste my time complaining. It's all over I'll be fine. It's all alright. No need to mind. It's all alright. If your phone just got it. It's all alright. You can walk out. A lot of people ask is like when they're starting to network in their teenager. Like would you say now that we live in a world where like you can access social media through like Facebook groups and that kind of stuff. Would you say target that or would you say try and go to as many like in person meetups as possible. Oh I would use technology. I mean fuck. Between the fact that technology is now so respected that a 39 year old, 52 year old, 70 year old will actually respect you. Like when I was a kid there's no 19 year old that had any respect about business from anybody on earth period ever, anytime ever. Yeah. So for entrepreneurs today they have such an incredible situation. One, they have the luxury that somebody might think you get it. Because everyone's looking for their Mark Zuckerberg. And number two, you can get to anybody. What the fuck are we doing here? Yeah. Like right? So like this is not happening. This is not happening you know 20 years ago. You just wouldn't have been able to get to me. I wouldn't you know like it's just not how the world worked. So no I think everybody should I think whether you're 19 or 91 everybody should use technology as a gateway drug. To scale. To meet. I think everybody should spend. I think every single person that's eight that is an entrepreneur under 20 that wants to be successful should hit their DM limit every day. DMing entrepreneurs or people that they're interested in saying I'd love to meet you. What can I do for you? Yeah. My big advice to young people is to not try to convince people to take them serious. I think the best thing you could do is when you're having that conversation is tell them that if you don't want to work with me then you don't have to work with me. Yeah. True. Saying no for the other person a lot of times is the quickest way for the other person to say yes. Yeah. That's true. I'm trying to make all this money in abundance. I'm talking about 20s and 50s and hundreds. I make it after it. I know that it's coming. I bet it's right. Start with the way I've been running. I know that I'm destined for greatness. Everyone always be hating. Everyone want to be famous. Nobody want to be hated. I'm sick and tired of seeing these two faces where nobody's saying shit. I've been the one that's been playing shit. I'm starved by them famous and she watched from behind where all of the players said another give it to know that I'm making it. Why no one's saying shit? Why do I feel like I'm faking it? Don't even know how to fuck them debate in this. This is all a part of the show. Tell me it is. I don't know. They don't know. They don't really know. They don't know. They don't really know. They don't really know. They don't really know. They don't really know. This is what you came for. This is what you paid. They don't really know. They don't really know. They don't really know. They don't really know. They don't really know. What the fuck you starved is what you paid for. There's so much that's happening through serendipity of learning. I do think that leaders take way too much Onus on let me fabricate these learnings when we are moving fast I mean nobody even realizes what they're learning here until they're like almost out of it because we're such an abort text Like people don't realize we're at the forefront. It's such a meaningful way This is what you are Bye, thank you I Don't think that I'm a predictor I think I'm a fast mover and so I don't predict I have intuitive understanding of consumer behavior And then I watch what people are doing and I move quickly on it in a world where it's only 24 hours and Everybody has you know one of the reasons I will break out in this era on one-on-one marketing is I have more energy than everybody else Like you know, it's something that it's why I don't get so gassed on myself like I have natural energy like I can go Hard Forever like you know and so like I think that that's not replicable for some people like people take naps people need eight hours Leave people get tired like you know, but I'm so grateful and I'm so hungry that it just fucking makes me go through So I think I think one of the things is the biggest thing is if you're you know You think about it like steps if you're like on that next step now these guys is there, you know Then you'll have some sort of you'll probably put out some song that will be the song that takes it to the next level, right? It's about being as hungry when you're getting 300,000 racks for a show And it's super hard and it's like one of the people who's like been able to get hungrier as he's gotten richer and more successful It's obvious to me watching all my other homies fall off when they get to that place So what's really interesting is I don't know if I can it's not about so many different tactics It's about like having a religious conversation Like there's certain things in people's lives that they will never do I think the question becomes what are your lines in the sand? You know like start really digging deep into them. It's about self-awareness It's about how much do you appreciate it? How hungry are you at it? What comes natural? What doesn't? It's the framework for me. I will never line in the sand. I will never ever believe in my own shit I'm in 22 p.m Just another grinding day Super hustle lots of results lots of meetings. It was a fast-paced day Like very few days have happened the last year where I haven't posted anything. I didn't scream all day That's when you know like I didn't even have a fucking second Just really enjoying the process I'm obsessed with it. I love it. I enjoy it. I Hope you do too There's just nothing like it when you're in that zone Excuse me when you're in that perfect zone
