## Transcript
Nothing like JFK. Love it. New York City. Macro. I'm from mom and casual. Got a lot of ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro. Like a visual boy. I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Gary V. Sob, I've been telling you. Accounts were stolen by equity. I'm triple H giving the pedigree. That mean that I'm special, my specialty. I'm putting the work till I'm dirty in the earth. I'm moving furniture to heaven. It's been a long week. Time to take a good hot shower. But I'll say this. It's going to be a short Friday episode. But I'll say this. Because of all the travel, it gave me an opportunity to get into the comments. Dig in. Spend time with you guys. I feel incredibly sharp and ready for next week's content strategy, execution, topics. And I just am stunned that we're 10 years in and people don't realize the number one. The number one. I couldn't even say it. The number one way to win in this game of personal brand, brands that are marketing and building and selling and engaging and navigating through the social mobile web is to read every comment. Is to answer everybody. Have you answered everybody's comments on your Instagram? I said a lot of times in Ireland and Belgium, don't listen to what I say. Watch what I do. I'm not doing 60 second club for kicks and giggles. I'm not aggressively using stories on Instagram for swipe ups, for fun. I haven't re-engaged hardcore on Snapchat this week because it's good for my health. These are fucking strategies. So I guess what I'm saying is I'm really enjoying getting to know all of you. The things you react to. All those little hearts I'm giving you on Instagram. All those replies I'm giving you on Twitter. All this stuff. I'm listening. I'm listening. Everybody thinks I'm talking. I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm listening.
