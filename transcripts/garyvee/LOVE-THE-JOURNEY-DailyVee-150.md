But Sob. I've been telling you Early morning workout in Houston, Saturday at the Super Bowl. Got some meetings. Cops broke up my meetup last night. Everyone, out of the street now, go that way. It's crazy. Thanks for the Houston police for keeping me safe. Jordan, what's going on my shoulder? What are we doing? So I'm working right now on building up the overall strength and endurance of it. But beforehand, you had a slight tear. So basically everything we're doing is to work around the slight tear while building up the strength and endurance. Rare situation where the left is stronger than the right. Somebody just DMed me about the Joe Rogan podcast. He said, great observation, great guy. Very nice note. He said, Yin Yang, you've got the yang. You're competitive. But the thing that Joe was talking about with your daughter and the basketball on this was maybe you need to look at the Yin Yang Yang. You've got to look at both sides. I don't think people understand. I think I look at both sides quite a bit. I live both sides quite a bit. I'm pulling for both sides quite a bit. But here's the difference. When I'm on the field, I'm all in one way. Like everybody wants a micro Yin Yang Yang. But that's not how it works. It's a macro Yin Yang Yang. And the big picture, super balanced. But when I'm on fucking the field competing, you have to go 100. Jordan, how do I work out? 100% every time. That's it. And I fucking hate working out. But that's the part. You can't be 50-50 working out. 50-50 in your relationships. 50-50 in your escapism. 50-50 in the way you play. That's why everybody's average. You have to be macro Yin Yang. Micro all in one way or the other. Right here is good, man. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. Got it? Got it? Man. 10 Palawtis 10 outdoor 11.30pm at night heading to another meeting right now, Early Days of Bain or Sports Super Bowl. Some ups, some downs, real life stuff. But I love it.
