But I was in it early, like in terms of just being comfortable with it. You know, I didn't you didn't think it was going to fuck your money up. No, I didn't. But you know, at one point, at one point, the record companies did gas me up, you know, they did gas me up. And I was down there in front of Congress like, yo, I'm not sure. Like, like, like, because I was gasping, you know, understanding that, that, that, that they were just trying to hold on to some shit that was going to go away. Anyway. The Gary Vee audio experience. All right, everybody, as many of you know, listening to this podcast, I've been thinking about doing more interviews. And when I was thinking it through and thinking about who do I want to get on? Who, who have I not been able to really chop with? Because, you know, two planes in the night, everyone's moving fast. This man came first to mind. I hit him on DM. He said, let's chop it up. And a couple of weeks later, we are here recording on a Saturday. The legend that is really the only thing that comes to mind when I get to say truly, you know, I think these days, you know, kid has one good game in high school and they call him the goat and I laugh. But, you know, those hyperbole's get thrown around. But, you know, being 45, growing up in Jersey. For me, LL Cool J is on a different status. It's exciting to kind of grow up in life when you're in the same general age and reach of age, because you get to watch the whole manifesto. Thank you so much for doing the podcast. How are you? How's your family, first of all, before we get into a bunch of different shit? My family's well, you know, healthy, thankfully. Having a weird Thanksgiving here to call some close friends and tell them not, not this, not this year. We had to break with tradition, which wasn't fun, but I think it was the right thing to do. And, you know, we're good. You know what I mean? How's yours? Everybody good on your end? Everybody's good. Let's go. Everyone's good. Let's go right into it, because we don't have a lot of time and I want, I want to get into a bunch of stuff. So I was born in the Soviet Union. And when I moved to America, we moved to Rego Park, Queens. You know, those are old stomping grounds for you. What did what when you think about your childhood? Forget about parenting dynamics, family dynamics, which are obviously number one, two and three for most people. But I spend a lot of time thinking about environment. When I go there, when I say like things that weren't, you know, obviously your parents, your grandparents, those are life situations, but the person your neighbors with, the first kid that you connect with in second grade, when I think about, when you think about your childhood, the neighborhood, the activities of the neighborhood or the serendipity of classmates or teachers. What comes to mind outside of immediate family of things that shaped you? Well, what I think about my neighborhood in the way I grew up, it's a combination of a few things. It is, this is a really complicated answer. I'm going to give you the real. You could tell I want to go like different stuff that I think might bring different people value because there's so much on a wax and video of you. And we'll go into that stuff. But I like think about random shit. I was thinking about this morning. I was like, I'm just curious. Like I think about Robbie Ternick, Eric Godfrey. I think about like, you know, Jersey culture was like very like, you know, just out to be outside. It was like the 80s, right? Like it wasn't video games yet. It wasn't, you know, computers and things that I just always think about how that shaped me, the randomness of my neighborhood friends. I love those stories. Yeah. My neighborhood was was really built around. There was only one dad on the whole, my whole block. Well, there was two. There was only really two fathers in the households, which was and my grandfather, which was that was one dynamic. The other dynamic was a lot of guys coming home from jail and shit. Right. Like so the come home from jail thing. The fathers come from jail. No, not fathers, but kids like maybe maybe my age or a few years older. Coming home from jail was a lot of people. Oh, like that was a big growing up. People will always come, which which incredibly enough made me want to be physically fit. You see guys coming home. Jacked, jacked benches in the yard. You know, so there was that, right? Then there was the there was the the hustlers. You know, there was the the idea of now, mind you, I grew up in a book. I mean, a house full of books, right? And my grandfather came over from Barbados and, you know, he, you know, he was a member of a Masonic lodge. He was a he was a really kind of evolved guy. But, you know, then you go outside and it's kind of like thoughtful, like a thoughtful, very, very thoughtful, very, you know, kind of knew how to give you and he knew how to give you. It's like giving a cow enough pasture. You give somebody so much freedom that they can't hurt themselves. It's like, if you have enough land, you can let your dog run wild, right? You can let your cow just go crazy because if it's safe, there's not. So he would give me a lot of intellectual and psychological freedom. He didn't put a lot of, you know, they didn't like handcuff me mentally. You know what I mean? Which so that made me curious and it made me want to search. You know, I've always had a searching personality because curiosity can be passive, it could turn into wonder or you could turn in, it could become searching. Did you fear to let him down? No, no, I didn't. You know, it's funny. You know, my grandfather, when I was when I was a kid, he used to call me a genius all the time. You say, you're a genius. He's a genius. This kid's a genius all the time. He's a genius. Huh? I don't know if I ever really believed it, but you definitely want to live up to those standards, right? It's a lot better than being heard. You're a fucking loser. 100%. You know, and we both know people that grew up in those environments and I'm listening right now. People know. And I think a lot about, you know, parenting of how like tearing down buildings or building up buildings. And then the question is, where's the line of delusion and, and do parents or grandparents create ramifications when you don't do genius shit? Well, I think, I think with that part of it, the key is that, that, that. You can, you can, you can have great aspirations, great visions, great dreams, great goals, but you also have to think strategically, but then you also have to think about tactically what you're going to do to get there. And a lot of times the reason why people have that, that, that big chasm that they can't get across is because they're not thinking about how they're going to. Now, look, you know, there's an old saying, plans get, get shipwrecked, shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods, right? But a lot of times people don't have that. They don't, they don't take that step. They don't take, you know, the steps necessary to get to the greatness, to get to the high level of success, which has a lot of pain, a lot of frustration. There's fear. There's, there's hecticness. There's nervousness. There's anxiety. You know what I mean? A lot of times people don't, they don't deal with that. Right? Yes. I mean, people, people want all the accolades. They don't want the shit that comes along with it, which is why they don't get there because they don't have the stomach for it. 100%. 100%. And so, like, so my grandmother and grandfather, you always tell me, if a task is once begun, never leave it till it's done, be thy labor, create a small, do it well or not at all. So what that did was it gave me the spirit of completion and, and intestinal fortitude and stick to it. It's nice. You know what I mean? Like sticking to shit. How old were you when you thought you had a shot to do something different, different? Eight. Great answer. Why do you remember? I just was walking around. I was just, I remember just walking in front of my house and saying, you know, just I'm eight years old and I could, I could do anything. And I believed it. Who'd you look up to at that point outside of your family, your great, let's see, whether grandfather or something, like something out there, like, was music already on the radar? Oh, yeah, I know this, right? Your grandfather had some music, jazz or something, right? Yeah, music. I know this. He was a jazz musician and he played a lot of jazz records, you know, even more than he would play. Music was always around. But did you look up, was it, was sports on a pedestal, acting, anybody in culture? Yeah, you know, Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee. That's a good one. I mean, that makes sense. That makes your age, your age group. That makes a lot of sense. He was huge. It was huge. He was the man. And it was like, you know, quite frankly, he was the only guy he wasn't white. So I could kind of relate to him. Like, oh, right, right. He's not black, but he ain't white. So at least something, something. He's a little ten. I can kind of go with this. I can make this work. You know what I mean? A lot of people don't realize how big those kung fu and movies were because there wasn't that there wasn't cable and those movies would play. I even remember early, early 80s. How old are you? I'm 52. So 45, so seven years old. Yeah. So I, yeah. So you were 14, 13, 14, 15. If I'm thinking about the year when I, when it hit my radar, but I'm sure it was playing before then. Yeah. Like they would play on like Saturday at 11 a.m. on Channel 5, you know what I mean? Yeah. When I'm eight, nine from from age around eight, nine, 10, all the way up to maybe 15, that was all martial arts during that era. That was all like, you know, from the early 70s on up to like, you know, that was all I was a little babe, like a baby boy. And that was all that martial art. It was like martial arts craze. It was like, you know, everybody was kung fu fighting. Yeah. It was songs out. It was. Oh, it really. But the thing about it is getting into martial arts, like my grandfather put me in martial arts. I took Seido karate and I years later, I took some E. Tuan and I took a little wing chung and I were you good at it. A little bit, a little bit. Yeah. Growing up, my grandfather got me into it because they wanted me to, they wanted, they wanted it for discipline. But the real reason is because I wanted to play football and my grandmother thought football was too dangerous. So I could have a physical outlet. But not be getting my brains like shook. Is that why you needed to act? Play a football player in a movie? You needed to get that. You needed to get that off. Without a doubt. Without a doubt. 100%. I had to live that. I had to live that out. I had to. I got to play in Dallas stadium. I know what it feels like. I had, I got to, I got to be out. Did you grow up a football fan? Oh, 100%. I grew up, you know, I grew up a Dallas Cowboys fan. Yeah. Because they were always on TV too. I grew up a Dallas Cowboys fan. And, you know, but, but then obviously as I got, as I matured, I became a Giants fan. You know what I'm saying? Once I got like it at that point where I could kind of make my own decisions because my grandfather kind of guided me to the Cowboys. He was real funny too. Because this is a guy who came from the Bronx. He's in Queens, but he likes the Yankees. So I'm watching the Yankees and everybody in my neighborhood is like match fans and shit. But then, you know what I mean? But then like, and they're like jets and they're jets fans. And I'm like in the Giants. It was crazy. You know what I mean? The jets and Giants, neither team made the playoffs in the 70s. So there's a lot of New York, you know, people that kind of like gravitated towards the Cowboys, the Steelers, the Raiders during that era. Yeah. Which I never understand because I love rooting for bad teams because I love loyalty. I love neighborhood. I love eating shit. But a lot of people don't want their sports frustrating them, which I understand. Like if sports is an outlet for your life, who the fuck needs more headaches? You know, you're trying to escape your headaches. You're absolutely right, Gary. And I understand the Lord loyalty. I really do, but it's just hard to be loyal to. Yeah. Like probably. That's a problem. The jet's oppressing me right now. Yeah, I'm tired of having you. It's oppressing me. So let's talk about music. When does when does that even hit your radar as I'm going to do music? When I was I started writing when I was around 11 or around 12, 11, 12. So at about 10, 11, there's all the martial arts stuff we talked about. And then there's the music, right? And hip hop is flooding the street. Do you remember the first time you understood there was a different thing? What was it? Was it the first time you heard it? It was a hip hop. Did they use the term rap? Did they what was the term in that? Well, that's an interesting question. Initially, I mean, it was hip hop, but but we didn't really call it that. Like it was more about rap music and rhyming. You know, I'm saying like, B-Box. I remember B-Boxing. That's a human B-Boxing. But it was like rap. It was like rap, you know, saying? Yeah, rapping. Yeah. Rapping and then rhyming as well as we got more sophisticated because, you know, the guys, you know, like guys that I got with, we all thought about like the couplets, the content, the cadence, the, you know, all of that. And that's when it came more about rhyming. What was the first hip hop song that hit you hard? Well, it wasn't even. Well, it was, it was some of the Cold Crush brother routines. You know, it wasn't even on wax. The tapes, I was actually, because I used to go between Queens and North Babylon. You know, I'm saying every year, like I lived in Queens, I lived in North Babylon, Long Island, Queens, North Babylon, Queens, North Babylon. Because you were going between what? My mother and my grandmothers. Understood. And so, you know, so I would, you know, but there was a lot of foster kids in the house next door to me in Long Island. You go back and forth or you would spend the summer or how did you do it? No, no, no, I would literally all of the above. I would go to school back and forth and summers back and forth and be back and forth during the summer and like hard or hard, like, like literally every other year, like, you know, and was that hard and was that was hard for you? Or do you think you or at the time hard and now you're like, oh, that's why I can adjust the shit. Was it kind of just it's all you knew and it just that's what it is and didn't really think twice. No, it was. Did you enjoy it? Did you like like coming back and like kind of even that company? It was just up to life. No, Todd's a pain in the ass. So he's going to go to Long Island this year. Okay, he's good. He's good. Oh, he's been a pain in the ass. Now let's set him back to Queens. Oh, any any time that you would move into like dangerous zone, they thought a reset reset. Hit me with the reset. Do you think now do you think now that enabled like what if I said you what did you gain out of that? Maybe there's nothing. Maybe there's a ton. A lot. Yeah, I believe in I think at first it was about. Well, it gave me exposure, right? Because the first time I walked in a classroom in Long Island, you know, you got to remember I'm going from a school that I would say 99.99 percent black, you know, other than, you know, like, and other than my my friend Richie, who's Jewish, who was like my who was like who was like eight, nine years old, who's my Jewish friend. Everybody's black, right? I got one Jewish friend and everybody's black and Richie has to go to my school. Richie doesn't go to my school. Richie is my family friend because my aunt is a school teacher and her best friend and Lynn, you know, and so me and Richie are cool. So other than Richie is all about. But then when I go to Long Island, I walk in the classroom. It's the exact opposite, right? Or the inverse. It's everybody's white and I'm like the one. There's one black kid and I walk in and I'm the. I'm the black kid, you know, and maybe there's another one. And it was like, I remember my eyes like, you know, jumping out of my head. But what it did was it exposed me to different people, right? Because, you know, you know, you go, you go to quit, you go to Long Island. At that time, you had a lot of Italians coming from Brooklyn, moving to Long Island. You know what I'm saying? So you're you're you're you're meeting. So I had like a Italian friend and then you kind of find out also just Irish friends. But then you find out about the racial dynamics that I didn't know existed when I was in Queens, you know what I mean? So that was did it come at you hard in Long Island or did it come in medium or you would say subtle because people are cool. Like subtle, you come, you know, it's subtle, you know, two kids would be talking and you're walking on them and they'll be saying something they shouldn't be saying and they know what they'll be saying. You catch them saying something they should be saying. And they get quiet, you know, but it wasn't it wasn't like atrocious. No, it wasn't atrocious, man, because New York is. Because it wasn't. Yeah, I agree. Well, New York is funny in the sense that, you know, in Jersey, for that matter, too, right, in the sense that, yes, there's a lot of. There's racism, but it's so. There's also jokes. There's also a rivalry and a fund. There's a it's different in New York. You know what I mean? Like, I know exactly what you mean. I'm 45 to do like things weren't as politically correct. So there was exactly. I remember like people would make racial jokes across the board. I mean, I. I caught a very weird time because I was Russian when the USSR was the evil enemy. So I got real heat because we were in the Cold War, kind of like kids after 911. Right. We're from the Middle East. Like I like Russia shot down a plane in third grade, shot down a commercial plane. And literally my class just decided not to talk to me for the week. Wow. Like we were the enemy. And so I don't talk about it a whole lot because it's like out of context now. People don't understand. But like 1982, 83, 84, that, you know, that go watch Rocky. Like Russia was like the enemy and people. I mean, people call me spy every day. You know, like, like every day. They're like, you're spying on us, you know, like people. Funny people fought a lot. I think about fighting a lot. I think fighting has like is different now. Like I feel like it's extremes. It's either no fighting going on in the suburbs or that exactly or extreme shit. And every weekday on my Instagram, seeing something that breaks my heart. But like when I, I mean, I was in, I was in a lot of fights. Kids were always fighting. There was a lot of fight. Well, I definitely grew up. I grew up, you know, in the knuckle game heavy. Like, you know, that's all I did growing up. Like a lot of knuckle games. You liked it. No, I didn't like it per se. But, you know, when I was younger, you know, I was slim and I had that kind of face that, you know, you want to try to test. I don't know pretty, but, you know, like they just feel pretty. I wasn't like, you know, I had that that look. So they were scary. So they thought they could come up on you. Yeah. Yeah. So I used to have to put some of this on them. You know what I mean? But you remember, you remember what it let's call it from six to 16. The best feeling in the fight and the work. Let's talk about stories that people don't know. Like, like I'll give you mine. In second grade, there was a kid named Odette Winestock who came from Israel and just decided that we were rivals. We fought three times between second and sixth grade. And it culminated after school with literally a hundred people watching because he caught me earlier in the day, pushed me into the locker and like got on top of me. And that was it. They broke it up. We went to the detention. But at lunch, I just heard the whole lunch room in sixth grade saying, oh, that beat up Gary. And I was like, man, I can't this. I can't. This can't be my reputation. We just got the junior high and I walked up to him literally like fucking 80s movie shit and was like, let's fight at Marco's house. Because that was the hill. Big shout out to Marcos. If you're watching, please email me. Marcos's house where the ice cream truck was and literally there was hundreds of people we fought and he was actually winning. And I would argue that I got lucky. Slash, I just refused to go down like that. He was on top of me kind of ready to like win the fight. And I kept rocking and I got him off. And as we were both on the ground, I had the leverage and I kicked him so hard in the face, his face exploded, bleeding everywhere. He kind of both stood up off the kick and he just started crying and ran away. And for the next 48 hours was the greatest moment in my life. They like, you know, but like earlier that morning was probably the because of that micro, I'll call it a micro loss because some bullshit. We didn't even get into it, but he was definitely pushed me from behind and some suck of shit. And then he sat on top of me and they broke it up and I didn't really have any offense. So what about for you? Six to 16 best moment in a fight? Worst moment because I've never had. Yeah. Worst moment. Worst, worst moment would probably be. Let's give someone have a good moment. You're going to call them out and be like, oh, this dude, I had a fight with this dude, Mark and Mark's last name. I don't know his last name. Damn, he come back. You know what I love about the world now? If you knew his last name and you shout him out is like his nephew. Yeah. I had a fight with Mark and he liked the girl that I was friends with. I liked her too, but I was really a friend, but I did like her. The worst thing he was the worst thing about it. Me and him, and this is the honest of God, truth. Me and him were in high school. I was a freshman. We fought in the basement by ourselves. Like you listen, I kicked his ass, but got a mark on my face and everybody thought he would my ass. And I mean, like I really punish this guy. Listen, explain to me how you guys fought solo in the basement of a house. It's something. No, no, in the basement of the high school. In a high school, I saw him. That's some real shit. I saw him and like, you know, we was talking something happened. One thing and we like went down a back step and like we was just down somewhere in the high school where there was people. And, you know, we got into a fight, you know, and I was kicking him in the stomach and like I got him like it was a good fight. Like I tighten them up real nice. But how, how it, how ever it worked out, it was like I was punching him in his head. I didn't get how it worked out is he kind of crashed me. I had a wealth because I'm a little fast. So I had a little wealth. And then after we sitting in the principal's office to security, broke it up. We did in the principal's office. I'm like, yeah, yeah. And then a dude walks in. He's like, yes, some other guy walks in. He's like, yo, what's up? You said, I said, yeah, man, I just had to work. He said, you look at you. You the one with the marks on your face and walk away. I'm like, oh, no. So the whole neighborhood, like it was crazy. That was a, that was the craziest one. Um, what was the best? The best one, the best one had to be like, this is kind of a long story. And it's going to sound a little crazy. But I was, um, I was, uh, I was in red lobster with my friends. Right. Yeah, we was eating and this guy kept staring at me. So he stared at me for so long that finally I walked over his table and said, yo, you got to get out of the restaurant. How old were you? I must have been, I might have been a little older than 16. I had to be a little older than 16, but it was, you were ready to wait, you already were in your music. Yeah, I was already making music because remember, I made my first song is 16. Well, that's why I know. So, so with the guy with Mark, I was 14. I was about 14 with Mark. This one, I was a little older. I want to say 18. I want to say 18. So you were ready. I mean, because you hit fast and hard. So you remember, there's no social media. It's a little different. I remember. You know what I mean? So, so, you know, so I said, you got to leave the, you know, driving me crazy. So, you know, and maybe I was a little foul for that. So he left, he left it. I actually kicked him out of the restaurant and went back and finished my food. So then we, me and my friends, we drive it down to, we drive it down to block towards my house and a guy comes and he's like trying to pull us up, get over and get over and get over and he finally, like, you know, we pull over and he's like, yo, you know, you try to rob my friend. I'm like, Rob, your friend, you know what I do? Rob your friend. You think I try to rub? We ended up getting into the fight. I said, what you want to fight? So, you know, he thought he was going to, he thought he was going to take up for his man and he ended up getting the ass whipping. All right, let's, let's say. So that was a funny moment. Well, how do you think you would have done in this modern music world? SoundCloud, Instagram, knowing your personality, you know, you know, obviously you had tenacity because I would have done phenomenal. I believe that. Phenomenal. I'm just curious how you, you know, because obviously I would, I would have just, you know, if that was my thing, I would have just been rapping on every Instagram page and every sound cloud, like every moment, every time you turn on the camera, you would see me doing something. You know, it's funny because I believe in volume and I talk a lot about putting out a lot of stuff and I know, I know a lot about your career because you were so in my pocket. You sent, you sent your, your, your demo everywhere, right? Def Jam was like, right? Like, I sent it to Sugar Hill. I sent it to enjoy. I sent it to Tommy Boy. Um, the demo I sent to, to Def Jam Productions because it wasn't a label yet. I got a, the BC boys heard it. He played it for Rick and that's how I got my break. And then Def Jam, the label was formed after, after, I know that you, you and, and BC boys gave them that cloud to get to the next level. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. That's true. And Rick Rubin's talent, Russell's vision. I mean, yeah, that was gonna happen anyway. You just too happen to, yeah. So how does it feel? I think, you know, it's funny. I know that, I know that it's, it happened for me later. It was different timing, but I know when I'm 70, there'll be documentaries. There'll be things that talk about social media's early days and I'm, I know I'm going to get flavor from that, you know, because I've been, you know, and so that's going to happen for me later. Hip hop, you were very young, you were early and you're still an extremely young man now, but, you know, you're getting Kennedy awards, you're in the hall of fame, you're real OG and it's like, it's incredible to live and be a hall of famer in something that you were there early. Mm hmm. And, and, and it's at the scale that it's at now, right? You know, you think, I think about the NBA, like, you know, it's not that old of a league and there's, you know, I think about Bill Russell thinking about like not sold out stadiums, you know, and that like no TV and now like what it is, like, how does it feel to be at such a pedestal as an OG in something that is one of the most important thing, the hip hop's one of the most important things in the world? Well, it feels, I look, I feel amazing because I, um, bought a grace of God and hard work and the grace of God, I figured out how to keep doing what I love, right? So I didn't have to sit, I didn't have to get off the train and watch it drive away or what, you know, watch it. You also evolved. Yeah. And that, so that makes a big difference, right? It's not like, you're not sitting on the couch and saying back at 84, this is, you know, you mean, you mean it's enjoyable, but it's almost like you can't even smell that rose because you're still so active. I'm so active and I've expanded my life to an extent that I'm still like so on the grind and so heavy and so deep in what I'm doing. You know, look, there's a thing called the Lindy effect, you know, and the Lindy effect is basically things that have been around will be around. So it's like Shakespeare, like, you know, eating with a knife and fork, wearing a pair of pants, a baseball cap. These things have been around for a long, long, long time and that bodes well for the future. So, you know, you know, when I was a little kid, I always called it stretching the bubblegum and then putting another piece of bubblegum directly in the center before it before it pops, you know. And so I just keep going after my dreams. I feel good seeing what's going on. Um, but I feel like I'm in a position where I could, if I decide, yo, LL Cool J is coming out with an album. I know it's going to get a look. I don't, I can't tell you it's going to be a commercial success. I can't tell, you know, I can't make those kinds of predictions. I can't talk tough, but I can tell you if I say, yo, um, if I drop an album tomorrow, people are going to listen to it. And I mean, that's the best thing you could do for yourself as an author. Have you ever been in your life in the last 15 years? Cause again, you've been doing incredible things in Hollywood and acting. And I'm sure a million other things we can get into. I always wonder this at any point, cause listen, I love how you answer that. You're aware that you're not in the white hot moment of, I'm going to put out an album and it's young boy, NBA numbers, you know, like, you know, you know, I know where I'm at. Do you ever have you ever in the last 12 or 15 years? I'm going to just use that timeframe said, have you wanted that feeling again of being in the white hottest of the hot moment, or you feel like you're fulfilled or you weren't fulfilled. You went and put that attention elsewhere. And now once in a while you're like, yo, let me grab one of these fucking hot kids and do a collab with them just for one more take. And by the way, I talk about this a lot. I talked to a lot of youngsters and I'm like, yo, you should do something. You know, you never, they're like, I was talking about OGs. I'm like, you should do something with Diana Ross. You should do something with Stevie Wonder. And I'm like in the south side of Atlanta in a studio and they don't even know what they're like, what the fuck are you talking about? Like, you never know when one of the greats is just sitting in their mansion saying, you know what, fuck it. For six more months, I just want to taste again. What I tasted in 89, what I tasted in 74, what I tasted in 62. I think about that shit. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. I've never asked the OG. I always tell the kids, I'm like, yo, cool that you've got some heat right now, but do something that's just going to make your grandmother smile. Because I always think an OG, a legend is, you know, if you ask 30 of them, one's ready to do it and they're just cool to have. But I've never asked the legend on the other side. Have you in the last decade said, man, I might really want to go uncomfortably contemporary and I might want to do something with the baby or Megastallion to do that. Or does that just never cross your mind? You know what? Like the reality is I would definitely consider working with a young act and with a new act. I don't see any reason to remove myself from that. I'm not like one of these OGs that sits around mad about. And for me, and for me, and I'm sorry to interrupt, and for me and for a lot of people listening, like if I woke up and saw a young boy in LL did a track, I'd loop my brain would break. I think that that that comp those kind of combos like Gaga and Tony Bennett made me smile. Yeah. Yeah. I think, look, look, man, like, you know, there's acts, you know, like, you know, there's all kind of cool acts out there, right? And if it's organic and if we can find something that like we feel great about that, that we that we write together or somebody writes a chorus that we feel is in a track that really brings it out and makes it special. Why not? Like, I don't need to, like, I'm not like, I'm not like allergic to the to the new shit. I'm not like allergic to what's happening contemporary, which contemporary. I'm not like, like, that's not a problem for me. Like, I enjoy listening to listening to new acts and young, young artists and, you know, like, and listen to them bridge the gap. You know what I'm saying? Like, like a prime example, like Meek Mill just dropped that record with a little dirt. I'm playing that on my channel, Rock the Bells, because I think it's dope. And it's got a lot of melody in it. You know what I'm saying? It's not even like Meek is doing his normal spitting, you know, rapid fire spitting. It's real melodic, but I like the video. I like the song. I'm putting it in breaking bells, you know, a person, you know, so it's like, for me, whether it's, you know, from, from, from a Billy Eilish all the way to, uh, you know, to, to, to a baby, to a little baby, like with the moment of truth. Like I pay attention. I love the record he did about the protest. I thought that shit was hot. I like the baby's performance when he was on, on the awards, when, you know, he was performing with the knee on his neck. Like I, I pay attention to what's going on in the world and what was going on in our culture. Like I'm not a guy that's just like sitting up in the big house. Um, you know, Sam, Ben, this disinterested or not. And, you know, let's talk about that on the culture. Let's talk about the technology side. When did the internet, when did you get excited or when did they hit your radar going way back to, you know, AOL or my space? When did you first kind of not necessarily know about it, but when, maybe even Napster, given your career, like, like, what's some early internet LL stories of like, I, I thought it was bullshit. I didn't like it. I was mad at Napster. I got excited about Napster. My space was popping. Like I didn't take it serious until Twitter. Like talk to me about your last 20 years on the tech culture game. Yeah. Well, you know, the first, if for me, it was, um, you know, Quincy Jones gave me a book, The Road Ahead by Bill Gates when that came out. And I guess that was in the late nineties, maybe almost right before 2000. Like in that, that window, right? Somewhere in there. Um, and so that kind of piqued my interest. Um, I thought Lime Wire, you know, you know, when Lime Wire came out, I was like, I thought I was really curious about that and was like kind of trying to figure out searching for music. Um, I actually, I actually adopted and kind of adapted to the internet pretty quickly. Um, in terms of the idea of it, I didn't necessarily dive in from, like as a, a, a user, but I was in it early, like in terms of just being comfortable with it. You know, I didn't figure it. You didn't think it was going to fuck your money up. No, I didn't. But you know, at one point, at one point, the record companies did gas me up. You know, they did gas me up and I was down there in front of Congress like, yo, I'm not sure. Like, like, like, because I was gasped up and, you know, understanding that, that, that, that they were just trying to hold on to some shit that was going to go away anyway. They was trying to hold on to a business model that was no longer viable. You know what I'm saying? Um, and I'm gonna go through it. Yeah. So I get it. But, but, but really quickly, I was like all the way in. And then, you know, I had a MySpace page, you know what I'm saying? I had a little MySpace page. I was into that. Um, you know, was there early for Instagram, didn't jump on it in terms of use, but was right when Instagram started, I was there. Are you on TikTok right now? Um, I do have a TikTok, but I only watch it. I don't really, I haven't done anything. It's entertaining, right? It's, come on, man. It's unbelievable. I know you got a TikTok. I often come down and check yours out as well. And I'm going on TikTok, people dancing. I saw, I saw a mother and a daughter, um, um, climbing up, climbing a door, what doorframe exercise into is tricky by Run DMC. Did you see that? I did. You know what I mean? Like, so yeah, I'm on TikTok, um, which I need to get more active on it. I'm, I'm, look, I'm all about, like I was on, um, for the five minutes it was out. Um, what was the one Periscope was it? I was on that one that for five minutes that was out. Um, you know, all of them, all of them, um, Facebook, I'm on Facebook. I'm on, you know, talk to me about, talk to me about jumping around a little bit. So you, you break at 16. Talk to me in those first 24 months, because there's a lot of people listening right now who are destined and are going to be big influencers. Cause the way the world works now, you know, everyone's got at least 15 fans and the hell of a lot more now because the long tail of fame is just like the music industry was trying to hold on. The fame game is everybody's in play. Everybody, you know, but it's, it's funny, but you know, everybody's in play, but then it's about your contribution. Period. Oh, talent and the content is the punchline. Yeah. The creative is the variable of success, but everybody's got a shot in a different way now, but I was curious. I was just sitting here listening to you. I'm like, let me, what do I want to be selfish? Who was the person that was real famous that you met? Let's say in the first two years of your fame building, cause you hit that record came out, boom, you know, like you got some juice. You were like one of those first 15, 20 faces. Like that really mattered in when the MTV era, you know, kind of really got going. You know, yo MTV rap early days did it. Like that, that pocket you were in, those 15 names for sure. Who was the person you met maybe at the first award show or in studio? That really like was like, oh shit, like a Michael Jackson. No, no, I mean, it was Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. It was them. Like, I mean, Diana Ross was the first person to put me on television. Is that right? Yeah. Diana Ross had a TV special on ABC and she gave me my first break to perform on TV. That story. How did you find out you were going to do that show? Who called you? You know, it was, you remember? I think I think I seen her somewhere or something like that. And she was like, oh, I want you to do my show. I want you to come on and perform. And I was like, OK. And then she, you know, somehow she got with the record company and I ended up doing it. And so I did you have management at that point? I'm you know, here's the funny thing about my career. I've had a couple of managers here and there. But the reality is like, you know, Russell managed me for five minutes. Leo managed me for 10 minutes. My dad managed me for 15 minutes. This guy Charles managed me for maybe 16 minutes. But, you know, throughout that whole time, I ended up self managing myself because because for that period growing up in hip hop, because there was nobody who had done it before. All of the managers were either former rock managers or this type of manager or plus you had it in you. Yeah. So I just kind of took the real like you like you have like it's how I think about myself. Early on people like, how are you getting on? Who's doing your PR? I'm like me. Yeah, like, like knowing you enough, your entrepreneurial tendencies, the way you move. It just makes sense to me. You were capable of managing yourself. You probably secretly liked it because you liked the business side of it. And there you are. And then, you know, ultimately then I got with Chris Lighty at Violator and Claudine was my day to day. But Chris was my manager. But we acted more like partners, maybe rest in peace. We were more like it wasn't like I was calling it like Chris, what should I do? It was more like this is what I'm thinking, what you thinking? You know, so yeah, I've been, you know, I kind of been running my own show for, you know, my whole career, you know what I mean? Being at halftime in your life. Because I think that's what people are very confused. Right. Like we've got a long way to go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What what's at this exact second? What's the thing that's been really running through your head in the last call it six months to a year that you're like, I really want to do this? I mean, just this rock the bells platform, man, like building this rock the bells platform, because this rock the bells platform is something that. You know, one day the youngest kid right now will be somebody that will play on rock the bells like, you know, rock the bells radio and the rock the bells.com platform is not just a place for guys who started when I started in our my age now. It is it will keep growing. You know, we will support the little way. You know, one day, you know, you know, everybody that you named will be playing on rock the bells. So it's like I just like for me, just giving people a true rendition and an OG presenting the classic hip hop space to the world in a way that is not bitter, is not corny. We know what year it is. We're not fucking delusional. I'm just saying this is some cool shit. I want you to check it out. It's like basically I'm taking you through my record collection and my photo album and my, you know, all the things I've been through in my life and showing, giving you some game. You know what I mean? That's what rock the bells is like. So that's really the thing that I've been focusing on. And then, you know, doing shows. What about some random shit? Like, yeah, like you're doing that. I'm excited about that. I'm glad people are hearing about that. I'm talking like an astronaut owning a baseball team, winning an Academy Awards thing in your pocket. Like some random ass shit. You know, one of the things that I try to really get across to people is I know who's listening right now is you're 31. You fucking idiot. I say it without with all love. You think you're wrapped up. LL, you know this. People think they're done at 31. Like, that's fucking funny. That's why I'm glad that you like I love. Please, everybody understand that reaction. People think at 31 like because they have a kid, they have a job they don't like. Like they have a mortgage like I'm done. Like people are confused out here about age. So, you know, just knowing how alive you are at 52, to me, what I'm curious about is, you know, what's some real shit that you like think about? Like, for example, for me, ironically, you do the same thing. I know, I don't even think I know that I'm going to make a big ass dent in film and television for making shows. You know, I don't think I'm going to act, though. I'm not fucking scared, but, you know, like, but I just know it. I genuinely think I'm going to have the number one OTT called Netflix, Who Loves Amazon show going. I can feel it. It's been written. I can taste that shit in my mouth. Yeah, that's not something I'm showing a whole lot yet. Well, it'd be like and I'm being totally honest, Gary. You know, like, you know, see, you know, when I talk about Rock the Bell, see, for most of the time, when people talk about what they're doing, they're either like a fucking shill or they're just they're promo and or they're selling or like. But you got to remember like this business that I'm talking about is the same thing that I did when I was nine and started writing when I was 12. And I'm really in this. And so for me, it's like the idea that I can build something that two, three, four hundred years from now will have the narrative of hip hop doc be right will be right two, three, four, five hundred years from now. That's what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about just making a bunch of money. I do other things. I can make money in a lot of different ways. You know, and I say that with humility, I can make money. But it's true. It's not it's not only about making money. It's about building something that that means something. You know what I'm saying? Let's stay on this on this topic because I want to I want to enjoy this. I want to I want to educate some kids. How underrated is MC Light? Tell him. Oh my God. MC Light educate, educate. Well, MC Light, MC Light was so good. The first time I heard on the radio, I just turned the shit off because I didn't make you like five. Me uncomfortable. And I was like, that's a girl and she shouldn't sound that good. And I just had to turn it off. You know, you know, it was like I just, you know, it made me like uncomfortable because she's so good. I ended up writing like her rhyme on of self destruction. We did a song, the self destruction. Scotch tape with a razor blade tape to your collar. You know, um, um, funky first restaurant press ready to party. I wrote that for her. Like it was like she was she is like her voice, her her approach. Like people should definitely dig into MC Light's catalog. Let's keep playing this because I think it's getting people pumped about rock the bells and honestly, I'm just now having fun like we were just like we're just hanging out. Give me give me the same. We're doing 90 seconds with LL here. We're going to play a little game. What about heavy D in the boys? Heavy D unbelievable. The history lesson, like any story or why it's related or how it impacted play with me here. The funniest shit about I have. Look, I love having a he resting piece. He was one of the smoothest and the best ever. The thing would have is don't say a rhyme around have because you might hear some shit that sounds similar next week. Is that what is that true? Is that not what I need from you? That's what I tell you this, yo, and I was the best. Have was like, you know, have yo, I remember going to have his house in Mount Vernon. He's still in this house. He like the way he flipped his basement when he after he came out with his salt of Mr. Big Stuff and all that, his basement looked like James Bond should live there. It was like D heavy D. You want down to basement? You're like, what the it was like a like he took his his basement to a home. Oh, my God. But have was a really good thing. But it was like my man have and my man flash Gordon them too. Don't say nothing around them. It might show up in the next one. It ain't going to be what you said, but there's going to be like it's going to be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What about mob? Yo, Prodigy, one of my favorite, you know, MCs and in having mob unbelievable. You know what I'm saying? What do they when you when they the T shirt that Prodigy's wearing in the quiet storm, I think it's the quiet storm video with Kim. I want to say it's that one. I gave him that T shirt as a gift just because I was just just loved them. You know what I'm saying? And I just I have a lot of respect for Bob. I think the way they read they represented Queens was unbelievable, the way they do represent Queens. We did a song on my goat album called called Queen killer Queens. You know, saying in the Queens got the vets. It was it was dope. And, um, yo, I just the way he wrote, the way he would make things rhyme and then not rhyme, the way he would the way he would play with language, play with words. Queens get the money, long time, low cash. You know what I mean? Like, I mean, he he was just, I remember when I was like, this guy's clever. I remember using that word clever, but like, but he had a way of sounding authentically tough. That's not easy to that's not easy to come across. You could sound angry on a record. That's one thing you could sound angry. You could sound aggressive, but to be able to to talk to be calm and really sound authentically tough. The only two people to me that really sound like that are Prodigy and rock him. Where the person is not they're not yelling, but they sound aggressive and tough. Let's keep this rock the bell. You know what I mean? Kind of like little fun game. I'm joining this a little bit for my own self. What about EPMD? These are things that I just think the youngsters don't know. Yeah. And an all time classic talk. We're talking all time classic talk right now. But I would argue underrated, which is why I love this. But I don't. EPMD is a group that the kids, the kids should check out. You know, at first when they first came out, people used to tease them and say they sounded like rock him, sounded like Eric Rockham. But you know, the beat selection that Eric Sermon would make me and Parish would always get into conversations about money and real estate and shit and be sitting around on my real estate. We did a record together called Rampage. It's a record called Rampage. The kids should check out EPMD Rampage, featuring LL Cool J. It's one of both of ours, our best classics. It's dope. And they just like they came from Long Island. EPMD is from Long Island. So, you know, in Long Island, you know, and Rock Kim is from Long Island as well. He's from Wine Dance, which is right down the block from North Babylon. Like you can literally walk down his neighborhood from where I lived in North Babylon. So it's like it was a vibe. It was a vibe. EPMD just was so official. So what about what about something that was like a hot minute that like just had a fever pitch to it? I'd love to get your perspective. You're in a different part of your career at this point. What about Foxy Brown's moment? Well, I launched Foxy Brown, right? Like, you know, the eyeshadow record I put, you know, we put Foxy. Well, Chris and the track masters put Foxy on the record. And when I heard it, I didn't object. I was like, yeah, let it let us stay. Let us stay. They didn't do it. They didn't ask. They just say, yo, listen to this. And I heard it and I said, go ahead. Let it let her rock. And she she was fired. That that you're like, it just was like fever pitch with her. Solid. Definitely solid. Definitely dope voice. Definitely like, you know, like Tom Boyish, but but feminine. It was like she had a good she was she was magic. You know, she is no very talented act. You know, they yeah, you know what I'm saying? But there's a lot of talented acts out there now. Like, you know, you think about a Kendrick and you think about, you know, the way he plays with rhythms when he with his voice, even somebody made rest a piece like Nipsey, you know, so intelligent, you know, I'm saying so smart, so brilliant. I know you were close with him. I saw different times you spoke with him. I mean, so that's like kind of like that mid generation. He was very, very special. Um, what the baby's doing now is very, very clever. You know, the way he just understands the world. Talk to me about talk to me not to cut off because I want I could talk about the baby for a hot minute, but talk to me about I like what you said about emcee light and I don't want to run out of time without asking you on that same kick. What was what was the track? The record that you heard that literally was the biggest quantum jump for you. From your, you know, one man's point of view, like you heard it and you were like, oh, my God, did anything stop you in your no, no, yeah, my Uzi weighs a ton by public enemy. Hmm. My Uzi weighs a ton by public and do you remember actually 100 percent? I remember I remember shit. I'm you know, I'm in the parking lot of white castle with the jeep with the seat leaned back with my man and that she came on a fucking one of the mixes or radio or something and that's it. He said he said, you know, you know, my Uzi weighs a ton. Hold it. Now. Get up again. Yeah, that's it was like my Uzi weighs a ton. I mean, that shit was like, you know, me and my man was like, what the fuck? And here's the funny shit. Rick Rubin had just asked me a few months later, yo, I got this group and public enemy of, you know, I'm thinking about putting out. If I could buy a song from them, would you want to perform it? Now, I was like, I write my own shit. And I still stand by that, but I kind of should have took that. That motherfucker was so cold. Yo, when I heard my Uzi weighs a ton, that shit was like shape shifting. I haven't felt that yet. Like that shit was like because the wave, the bomb squad, Heng Shockley and Eric Sadler, the way him, the chuck and all in the way they worked with that and the way they played with technology because that was the first time that somebody really took advantage of technology. Well, took it to another level. Mali did it in a different way with the sampling, but they took it to a whole other level, you know, Mali kind of when he was doing some of those Bismarck records, those were moments to like make the music with your mouth and and run with the bit like something will make the music with your mouth. And the other record, yes, y'all and to nobody beats the biz. Those were kind of like quantum. They moved it. The needle like maybe three, three deaths, three men, you know, three points up. But fucking public enemy was like a hundred. You know, that shit was like it just it was out of control. And I think that, um, look, that's what you want to do with art, right? That's what you want to do with music. That's what you want to do in your business. Like it's just like the dude who made the 10 X book, right? About 10 X. That's what that's what they did. They 10 Xed the creative, the sonics. They 10 X. Yes, when you think about when you think about success. You've been around a lot of success in your life now, you know, a lot of different genres, business, Hollywood, music, hip, New York, LA, the world, you know, and then all the successful people that you know that nobody knows of, whether a real estate or a lawyer or right for the kids that are listening and the kids, I mean, a 62 year old who might have got a motive and said, you know what, I do have 30 more years to do something. I'm going to go do this thing. What are the now that you know, you've always been a wise kid because your grandpa passed it on, you know, you probably just, you know, had that in you. What's like a wise thought around the common bonds of success? Like what are the themes that you see? Well, first, they really stand out for you when I set up that question. Well, first, the first thing I have to think is, you know, for that 62 year old, dreams don't have deadlines. They got to understand that. You know, you know, Colonel Sanders started Kentucky Fried Chicken when he was 65. Cornelius Vanderbilt started his railroad company at 80. Right. Sid Sidney Frank, Sidney Frank, who started Grey Goose was in the 70s. OK, so you feel me? And there's a million like that. You feel you are fucking convinced. I feel like I'm going to do a fucking I'm going to drop a fucking bomb in my 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s, a new bomb. I feel that's how I feel. You know, I'm going to take the world and kick it in the ass and then give it a nice pat on the butt on the back like you did that kid in the in the in the in the base of the school. But you know what? Just like that fight you had, there's going to be a scar on your face. Well, that you know, that comes with the territory. But what I would say the common themes of success, the common themes of success are the things that you do in the valley, get you to the peak and the things that you do in the peak can either extend the peak or take you back to the valley. Right. So, you know, you know, the peaks and valley part of it. It's very important to understand that part of it. The other thing I think is really important is being able to manage your moods. Hmm. Mood management is very important because your mood a lot of times is going to dictate not only how you feel about what you're trying to do, but how you feel about yourself. Do you feel that you stay in the middle? Because I because that's the goal. That's what I think. People see my energy and they're confused. I'm fucking Zen is fuck out here. Yeah, yeah. But well, enthusiasm is enthusiasm is not is misunderstood. Like what do they call there's the stock deal paradox, right? You I'm sure you know about the stock deal paradox from good. Actually, I don't know. I don't know the paradox basically says you're going to be you're going to be be completely optimistic, but while confronting the brutal facts. Yes, that's how I feel. I'm practically what I call myself is I'm I'm practically optimistic. Like I know exactly what's happening, but I'm out here and I'm not delusional. They're like Gary, you're too optimistic. I'm like, what the fuck does that mean? Well, well, I can make it easy to confuse out here. Well, we can make it easy for the youngsters as listen, I make it even easier. Gary, it's just like playing a basketball game. It because you down by seven don't mean you ain't enjoying yourself and into the game and playing hard. I watched I watched. I mean, bro, I watched Reggie Miller make me fucking cry. When he did that, when he did the game is over. But it wasn't over and I don't understand how people don't understand how that is. And I can't get people out of this. I'm fighting out here like crazy. LL people 18, 20, 30, 34, confused as fuck. Well, the reason they're confused is because one they're doing they're comparing themselves to other people too much. Yes. Yes. You cannot. You know, you got, you know, you know, life, life is an odd thing. But you can't treat it like it's a tournament. It's your life and the metrics for success are different. You know, in the Bible, there's that parable of the talents, right? So one guy got one talent, one guy got a couple of talents, one guy got, you know, four talent. Do you think the world is abundant that like nobody else's winnings comes from you? 100 percent. Because it's the one people. It's not a zero sum game. See, that's the other part. That's why I root for winners. 100 percent. That's what I was telling you. Yeah. That's what I was telling you. I can't. So it's like, yeah, there is abundance, but you got to see it that way. Right. Like, like you got to believe that it's out there for you. But it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because when you believe it's out there for you, you go out there and get it. 100 percent. Like I was in the hood. I mean, when I was in the hood, like just growing up, you know, that was I would tell dudes like, yo, I'm going to be running them as out or I'm going to get and they be like, come on, man, nothing out here for look where they at, man. Look where we at. Fuck that. Yeah. The game. Listen, if you think it's over, it is actually over. It is real. You think it's over because your older brother or sister aren't winning. And they told you or your parents or the neighborhood or your cousin or somebody on the Internet, if you think it's over, I got some real news for you. It actually is over. And you know what to really make it really make it simple. The bottom line is you have to believe in yourself and believe in the beauty of your dreams and you have to take a deep breath, take a deep breath and go for it. Have you seen people who had the unfortunate situation of not believing in themselves because their parents got 100 percent out and start to say, but you know what, you know, like that's a matter of getting out of your comfort zone. Right. If you if your comfort zone, unfortunately, if you're, you know, if the word is unlucky or whatever words you want to use, if you if your comfort zone is, I would say, a place where your default setting is a place of failure, then you have to be able to get out of that, that comfort zone. Do you think spending time with people that are cheering for you can make that happen? I think I think I think that can be part of it. But the other part of it is you have to be you have to be doing the work that makes that cheering realistic. You know what I mean? Like you could cheer for me like I could be stretching my legs standing next to you saying, Bo and you could be cheering for me all you want, Gary. But the reality is he's going to smoke my ass when we get on that track. Oh, 100. You know what I mean? So so one, it's about being realistic about what you're trying to accomplish. And then two, yes, you want to be surrounded by people who aren't downers. Like, you know, I remember when my you know, when when Simone was she was going through her, she was she had a bout with cancer and a leg and she was she needed to beat the cancer. A lady came to our house right to visit and she was I just brought Simone home from the hospital. Lady came to my house and she walks in my for you. She's crying and she I said, you got to go. Get the fuck out of here. You got to go. She was. She was like. This is all the lady like. You know, you got to go. I surround offense. So so so offense. You know what I mean? So I know I'm crying with all that. That ain't that's not helping all that boohoo shit. You know, that harbors other kinds of emotions. You full of shit. Go ahead. Like, you know, you got to deal with your shit. You know what I mean? Yeah, you're bringing that on. Yeah. So I would tell people, look, just stay encouraged and believe in yourself. Damn. And if you look, Michael Jordan, make every shot. LeBron didn't make every shot. Look how many championships LeBron didn't win, but he didn't stop trying. And that's why he's phenomenal now. That's why he's a man that we can respect and a guy that we can look at as an icon because he didn't give up and change the script. I you know, we're using somebody who's iconic and you know, what about just looking at life differently? Maybe you're not destined to be a tremendous accumulator of money, but maybe you can be a tremendous human beings to others. Can I say something to that guy? Of course you can. People got to understand is that what it really is about is knowing your value. It's not about money only, right? Like everybody has their place. You know, you know, Madonna didn't make the same money that Zuckerberg did. She still made a contribution to the world through her art. You know, you and I grew up around neighborhoods where the the old man on the block was the wise one who helped a lot of kids not get into dumb shit, who only made twenty seven thousand a year. But their contribution was genuinely helped. Twenty seven hundred people have a better life. And to you know, and to me, that's where people get fucked up. They look at the one percent of the one percent of the one percent of the one percent of the one percent and then they're like confused out here. Like because they get because like see the thing I think with people, what people don't understand is that if you really know your value and if you always look to make a contribution, you can't you know, success is going to come. It's going to come. And and however they comes, you know, look, I always tease like a lot of my rich friends. And when I say rich friends, people hear me say that and they're like, well, what's rich, but I'm like, God, that await like a hundred X times richer than me. It's like, dude. A lazy boy, what can you really do beyond your chair and your remote? Like you ain't doing shit. Only difference is you got a plane. But other than that, you got you got the remote and you're doing this and you got the lazy boy and you eating. So let's it's not that complicated. People shouldn't get caught up in only money, money, money, money. You're a valuable human being, regardless of that. What's the impact you're making? Make exactly what's the impact and what makes you and what makes you happy? Like, bro, I swear to God, I literally today because it's Saturday, what said, man, I can't wait to go garage sailing. Yeah, I know that you're into that. I love that. You know what I do? You know what my my pastime is books, right? I love that, which is like so foreign to me because I don't I realize I don't have reading comprehension. I love books. Good for you. Like you can read a fucking book. Like I read like, dude, that's all I do. Like when I work out, I play audio books and have music underneath it. Like, damn, like I'm like a book guy. Like every house I have, every spot like this books everywhere. Like I'm just always into books. Like books is like I like my idea of an unbelievable day is just to have a hoodie on low key and just be fucking walking around a Barnes and Noble, like just staring at books, even though I got audio books and I got a Kindle and I got all that shit, but I'm just saying like I like books. Like I'm actually like like I name myself L.O. Cool J. Because I'm a fucking nerd. Mm hmm. You know what I mean? Like books is the thing that books is the thing that turns me on. Like that's my that's incredible way to end this because I got to run. I apologize. Thank you so much, El, for your time. Love. If you did not listen to that last minute and understand everything can be wrapped up in it, if you understand yourself and you have self-awareness and you don't understand that there's a million ways to play it out here. This man, this man right here, winning, impacting, happiness. This man probably read more books in the last week than I've read in my life. There's a lot of money, but I read a lot though. Bro, I've read like eight books in my life. But you know what? I also do Larry, I'll take one book and read it over and over for two or three years. Yes, he was like getting a black belt in the book. I get it. Every book. Listen, everybody does a different. Here's the bottom line. Figure your shit out how you do it. There's a million ways to slice it. You and I slice it different. We have commonalities. We have differences. Just love yourself and then you can love everybody else. El, thank you so much, bro. Peace, faith in God. Love you, man. Love you, J. Peace.
