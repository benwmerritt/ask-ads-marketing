Hi Andy, how are you? When I say my team, I mean, even this, the blog that I do, the content I put out, I also come from the wine business, and so some of the stuff we do to drive results happens that world, so I just wanted him to sit in because if he doesn't, I'm not capable of follow up. Okay, no problem at all. Alex is the same, he does business development on my team. I have a real decent balance. Since I'm giving Andy so much, he might not be able to follow up soon, so. Nice to meet you. Cool, so tell us about the biz. So the concept of the eighth evolved from me actually shopping in Barney's and Berkdorf Men's, looking for a really cool, sexy high end underwear from my husband. He started Golden Tree Asset Management, which has 12 billion assets under management. He's a Wall Street guy, but he likes to look pretty hot and all that, so I was seeing nothing for the Christmas time at the time. I thought there'd be something kind of cool because Victoria's Secret always had like a million dollar bra, something very hot and sexy. So I didn't see anything there, and then I went back for Valentine's Day, I said I'll get him something very hot and sexy for Valentine's Day. And we're talking boxers. I was looking for boxers. Yeah, boxers, but maybe some silk, maybe some art work. Something cool. So nothing. And I said, hi, I wanna figure out if there's a business here because it seems like there's a need in the market. There's probably a need for a business. Yeah, always. So I met Jason and Annabette's not here, she apologizes. No worries. But she was a former fashion editor at Vogue and she was at Seventeen Magazine. She had the whole fashion photography background. Got it. Jason did private label. He's a designer. He can make anything. If you need something now, they'll probably go back and get it for you. So he's unbelievable. I meant it twice. Yeah. So I- Not like a pumpkin pie? No. Okay, good. We can't cook. We can't cook. Collectively, as a unit. Okay. No, we're good eaters. We're good eaters. We're not good cook. Okay. So anyway, so I researched it. I researched Calvin Klein basically had some, 97% of the market share for men's underwear at the time when I was looking at what the market was. Revenues unbelievable worldwide. This is a premium boxering category. You would put it as why Calvin had such a big percentage. Like mid tier. Mid tier, but they were really dominating the entire market. So we talked about things like, I believe, I wear a lot of Laura Piana and all of that. So we looked at the Laura Piana cashmere, which Jason was able to source. We retained the commissioned artists like Richard Phillips, Jim Torrock, people who do twahl. So we have twahl, you would like this. One twahl, I don't know if you can find it, but famous athletes in compromising positions like Derek Jeter being found caught in bed. We have Larry Bird who was on the cover of Sports Illustrated. And by accident, it looks like two cheerleaders giving him a blow job, which they retracted at one point. Muhammad Ali. So Muhammad Ali, we did a special because of his passing, but we have the number eight buried all around. So anyway, so we came up with some really cool things. I don't know if you have the cashmere. We also came up with compression shorts that Equinox voted number one in the country for the best compression short while you're working out. Yep, that's cool. So this is picked up by Gorsuch, which is the number one store in Aspen and Vale. Their catalog has a three million, right, it's like a baby's touch. That's what. Anyway, Gorsuch has a three million reader subscription for their catalog and all that, and Gorsuch is in Vale. What's the price point? High. Of course, well that's what you went out to do. Right, so we do a lot with the eight. So this is 800, we sell out every time. He can't get it in. We sell out all the time at 800. These are 78, these are 68. Yeah, the opening price point is about $48 for something solid and team up. Something like that. Yep. We have the selfie, we have the selfie. So if you take a selfie of yourself in it, which we hope people will, put it on Instagram, which they have. This comes this way and then flips over. So we have kind of very cute and clever ideas that our designers came up with. We were at Art Basel, we were featured at Art Basel. How long has the company been around? Well, a year and a half that we've launched. We were in concept and together, incorporated it's been about three. Took him about 18 months to get the market. Yeah. So we had a launch party at the church street boxing gym with Travis Scott, who's a rapper, so we see him on the ropes, standing up with his waistband. So we've had some really great, great press, GQ magazine, Vanity Fair. And the business is selling mainly through retail or direct to consumer? We're really good with website. Got it. Website is on fire. So this is a weed. So what percentage of your business is... We're not gonna be able to show you guys weed, but maybe if we were in Colorado. But anyway, Richard Phillips did weed. Well, unless we don't smoke, okay, we're fine. Yeah, we're not even smoking. No, we're not. But anyway, this is a Richard Phillips. This was featured at Art Basel. That's cool. And if you're high, because your eyes get a certain retina, whatever, he told me, you see this, the weed pops out, well, if you're high, whatever. I wouldn't know. So they say. What percentage of the business is direct to consumer versus direct to consumer? That's been our focus really. Of course. Keep the margin. And also engage the customer. We can go to any, you know, burgers want something like this, but then, you know, they may not necessarily go to this or they go into the cashier. Then you kind of dilute the bread. Of course. So, you know, we like being able to. And how are you driving sales to .com? Press, mainly, so far? In the beginning, it was sort of organic press with a little bit of reach out to different publications, sort of the whole school method. Yep. We also are featured in many, I have a big movie background, so they're featured in movies, you know, Alec Baldwin, De Niro, in various movies that have come out and premiered. So we try to use various product placement projects and all of that. We have some SEO and some online, you know, research and all that that we target. SEO or SEM? SEM. SEM. And any Facebook? Facebook, it's not as active. Yeah, absolutely. But you're not running Facebook ads? They were, yeah. The SEO agency. Got it. And Instagram or influencers on Instagram? We have, yeah. All of that. Instagram is a pretty good choice. Yeah. But neither one, you don't have an internal asset that understands digital marketing. So you have the mercy of what? That's where we're at right now, sort of trying to say, you know, this has been a good place for us and now that we're established, we know what our best sellers are, we know how we want to build the product going forward, you know, what's next. And, you know, I think we've created a vocabulary for the brand, sort of a culture of what we do and how we do things. It's not typical of other brands out there right now. So, what we can present to kind of move forward with the brand? You need to have an internal resource for digital marketing if you're gonna be a direct-to-consumer brand. First and foremost, like from like a religion over tactics, that's the first religious thing you have to do. Otherwise, you're at the mercy of an SEO firm that is probably doing Facebook terribly wrong, even though Facebook, SEO is easier to show black and white and is a 20-year practice. So anybody can do SEO kind of thing versus most people can't do Facebook, but all the action is on Facebook and Instagram, especially for a visual brand. Your visual brand. Google finds somebody searches boxers or what have you and you can win that game, but it's blue letters. Like if you really understood, if you really gave a shit enough to really understand what's happening in Google, it's completely the antithesis of what you're building. It's completely commoditized branding. That's interesting. Sure, whereas Instagram and Facebook are visual. Absolutely. Your blue letters are the same as blue letters of like private label, the least expensive boxers in the world, look exactly like you on Google. Google blue letters. That's interesting. So not only is there ways to do it better, it's also a detriment to your positioning and all the efforts you're putting into it. To most of, and then think about 80% of your business is done online. And I have to assume an unbelievable proportion of the traffic coming in outside of like a good article in a search term is gonna be the SEM. So that's super important to me. And so I think the follow up to this is gonna be how much do you wanna pay for somebody? And then I'll try to help get you the best possible person for the lowest possible kind of thing. So I'll give that some thought. I think that's the big, big, big take away. So what do you guys want to happen that, like obviously you wanna build the biggest brand in the world. And you view that as happening through your direct to consumer world? Are you guys thinking long term of having your own retail experiences? Like how are you thinking about distribution? I think our own retail experience. Got it. Sort of the same world that the Trey Seeker was able to create with that. Would that be in New York, the first store? I'm asking a pretty specific reason because I wanna give you the strategy against the creative socials. Like if the answer is yes, and because you're not gonna spend a million dollars a year on Facebook ads, or maybe you are, but I'm making some assumptions, I wanna localize the strategy against the place that you're most likely gonna open the store. I guess because we're in New York. The eighth came from eighth avenue, that's where we started. So it would be kind of a proposal to start in New York. On eighth avenue. Maybe. So I would think so. Right? Absolutely. Okay. What else going into, I mean obviously I had just only met your husband, so I don't know how much context. Was there anything that you guys had coming in mentally into this meeting questions or thoughts or anything you wanted me to talk about? I guess what we were thinking about is, whether we should, and this is just a question that I have. Do we stay and do more of the same because it's good? Do we start expanding? And it's weird because we have a lot of women who are wearing this, we have a lot of women, we care only to men. Right. If you go on our website, it's men, but we have a lot of women. I don't know if we're supposed to. How much revenue do you guys have? I have to look that up. I'm not the money person. No worries. But it's new. It's not that crazy yet. Yeah, it's not crazy. But we're always looking to see what we expand. The reason I ask that question off of your rant is my intuition is, it's a common thing, this is one man's point of view, you'll get some different points of view on this. I think people go too wide too early. Let's say it's a good thing you're saying or? I mean, look, you guys are a team of quality and taste. You haven't even begun to go down the path of sales and conversion. Right? Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses. Right? I think you guys are a game of quality and taste. And the reality is that makes you an artist. And what makes you a business is sales and conversion. And the cool thing is you outsource that. Now, who's the agency you guys went with? For the SEO? Spray ads? I don't know who that is, but do you have a relationship with them or you guys met with a bunch of people or how did you come about? It was a contact with the industry. Got it. Yeah, I mean, that's to me, how much are you spending with them? They're fuser. I believe they were 10,000 a month, but they didn't have to pay for the advertising. It's gonna be like 20,000 a month for advertising. Yeah, I mean, if you're truly spending 30,000 a month, I have some great news. You can do some real damage. Like you can... I like that I've not spent 30,000 a month and still do damage, but right. Well, of course. I mean, look, by the way, you can do damage with $1. It's not gonna be the greatest damage in the world. Right, except no, I'm just saying, you know. Here's the good part. You're already spending enough money to see meaningful results. And I don't know if you are or not. Do you have any feel of what you're doing in revenue per month? Through the Ecom channel? I mean, I would have the little bit of cash. I would go through the account. No, the answer is like... I wasn't prepared for that, sorry. That's okay, that's okay. But to that point, are you guys... I mean, I still think that that brings some interesting intrigue to the conversation around art and science. Like if somebody's gotta be grounded in that shit. Right. And it can't be your accountant. Somebody's gotta be running the business. Right, I'm basically running the business. And by the way, I run the business? I run this business? It's a hundred million dollar business? I don't know shit about numbers. I have people do it, but I'm grounded in them. Because you have to have them for strategy. Right, right. You know what I mean? Yeah, I'm focusing on going forward. By the way, you should focus on what you do best. Right, that's what I'm focusing on. I'm not really retrospective to see how much are we making, how much are we making. It's more like, where could we go? What could we do? How could we do better? I'm less worried about how much you're making. I'm worried about what your money's being spent on to make what you want to happen. Gotcha. When you're spending $360,000 a year in advertising, I could have all of Manhattan giving a fuck. Right, right. And you don't have that? No, for sure not. Correct. So what I think you have is 2004 digital marketers who are making a margin on you. And if nobody- That's why I stopped them. I stopped them as a vlogist, I believe. Got it. I said, bye bye. That's what we're talking about. Thanks, but not that, you know, bye bye. Because it's a tremendous amount of money. And it's just not yielding the results of, I know it could possibly in the future, but you gotta justify every month. So the answer is, I stopped that. Got it. I am looking for a way, like you're saying, what makes sense dollar-wise to get this going. I think it's Instagram. I think it's Snapchat. I think it's Facebook. I think it's YouTube. I think it's where the consumers' attention is. So you're saying that not a specific comment. You're saying someone in our, to hire somebody to sit in our- My intuition is it ends up being both. But think about it. It's like me paying for art. It's not what I do. And if I'm the decision maker, I need you to be my partner to be like, is he right? I want you guys, at least on paper, I want you to have somebody to know if we're the best, if Rick's the best, if Sally's the best. You guys don't have the background for Judge and Jordan. You have a taste. You know if this is a good, if you asked me to know what the fuck this should cost, I'd be dead. You know that in your sleep. Right. I want you to have that asset on your team. So when all the characters like me come around. Asset about that. Well, the abbreviations, yeah. They know what the hell they're talking about. So yes. I think that's important. And I think the other thing that's running through my mind is a lot of people that work for me want to work in small companies and they come here for training. And so I might be able to help with somebody who's young, which will cost you less, but skill above their age and can do it all, creative and you know. No, I mean that would be ideal. Can I ask you a crazy question? Have you thought about building your brand? Have I thought of it? Of course. I dream about it. I think that is the biggest wild card. So I think you should do all that. But if you ask me how it becomes big, it's because you became big. And in the same way what he's doing right now, like there's a new way to become big. I actually think. I don't know that. I'm not from that. I'm aware. I'm too old for that. I understand. And by the way, this is not an age thing. What we're inventing. But just so you know. No, no, no, no. They can all attest to this. All the 20 year olds in the world don't understand what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the modern day human production company around a person. There's no 20 year old running around this. They understand how to take a selfie. They understand that Snapchat's important. They don't understand the science that the 15 people sitting out here that all work on just my brand understand. What do you do? I do and so do they. And they'll go on to either crush with me or like. It will be known. Because once somebody figures something out, the world will know. But I sure do. Basically what I know right now is we're sitting on a capability that is what reality TV was in 2000. And once in a while you come across a person who actually can play. It still takes talent. My early intuition on you is that you have that thing and you need to debate it. Right, I feel like I have the talent. I'm not the talent. But they're the talent. And I feel like they have the product and they have the quality. And then I feel like it's my job and my wish to get it out there. I think the way I kind of think about it is if tomorrow Bravo came to you guys and said, do you want to do a show about your journey in building this company? You would seriously consider it. And I don't know how you go wired like fuck that or that's great. But you would seriously consider it for the exposure of what it would do to your business. And I think you would do really well in that show. And I think when I see that, they need to like, you need to get grounded in what vlogging is and all this stuff. It could vlogging, video blogging. Okay. It's basically a reality TV show. Like I'm not joking when I tell you that if you ask me, push comes to shove to be historically correct on the thing that made your business big, it would be a human being following you around with a camera every day. Huh. Okay, that's interesting. Yeah, I'm so interested in it that we've been spending the last six months. In about three months, we're going to launch something called Vayner Talent. So I've been talking like Tyra Banks and like Curtis Martin, football player, like a bunch of different people. We have figured out something for me in the last six months and I've been on social media and producing content for a decade. But in the last six months, we've really, last year, we've really figured it out. And now we're trying to figure out if we can scale it as a, it's just, it's funny to me that that $20,000 a month charging somebody for something like this would bring them a lot more business than what we do best in the world here on Facebook and Instagram, creative and ads. It's cool. It's just how the world works. I think it's unbelievable. So something you should sleep on. I don't necessarily need you as a client, but I can show you how it's done. You could hire it internally, but it's obviously a very personal decision. Like I'm not joking. I mean a reality show. Like there is a man or a woman, for that matter, that follows you around. And it's you yelling at Leon. It's you shopping. It's your meetings. It's you having business meetings. Like it's a show. And it airs on Facebook and YouTube. And I believe it would be the biggest gateway drug to the growth of your business. Wow. Everybody wants to see your fans. But you know. And but I think it's a very easy thing to understand today. If you think about Skinny Girl, or if you think about the Kardashian phenomenon, or the fact that DJ Khaled's gonna make 30 to 40 million dollars. What is it? People want to get a sneak peek of what you're doing. No, people. The psychological punchline? Yes. Rubbernecking. It's just a deep inherent human thing. It's called Yenta syndrome. Yenta syndrome. Got it? It's who we are. It's what people are. We're genuinely interested in people. And the people. Do they want to see catastrophes? No. They just want to see the truth. Want to see the truth. Got it? That's why what I'm doing is gonna beat reality TV. Cause reality TV is just more of the truth of TV. But this is way more of truth than reality TV. Distribution? Facebook and YouTube. But then think about what you do. What people don't know is, so now we take $1,000 and we run the ads. We run, so we run, nobody knows who the fuck you are. Here's episode one of you. No one gives a shit. But Facebook is the best ad product in the world. So you post it. And then we run $1,000 worth of ads against the employees of Saks Fifth Avenue, Barney's and Nordstrom's. So now if I'm Sally on the Upper West Side and I work at Nordstrom's, when I'm going through my Facebook feed and seeing my friend's daughter, I'm gonna see episode one of your show. In my feed. 94 out of 100. Gonna be like, I don't give a fuck. But six are gonna watch it. Day after day after day. Depending on how interesting and clever and how well it's edited and how well the ads are targeted, you build. That's it. And how long are they these little episodes? They run the gamut. DRock's laughing because we're airing on Monday an hour and 30 minute version of it. But normally ours runs, mine runs 10 to 25. We've got our first beta outside of me, a graffiti artist and motivational speaker. How long have those been? 20 minutes. And so do you have your own Facebook page? Yes. You would have. You would have that for the video? We would have to have. Yes. Or it's everything under your business. That's a very good point. In the first meeting. I'm wearing the wrong underwear. Clearly. I gotta pull your shirt out. I got it. I'm getting upset. I'm sorry. I'm gonna send him some underwear. So the punchline is, we would, I know you are. But I love being respectful. We have a strategy session at first. There's a very good debate to either be your page or the company's page and we would talk. You'll see in the deck we're making for people, it's the first thing it says is we're reverse engineering you. You can be the most famous person in the world and be an introvert. Means we're not working together. You may be so famous that you don't want to do it. Like you've gotta be the right person. I have no time. Like time is a factor. I don't show my children. Just a decision my wife and I made. I wish I did. Because it'd be even more viral. But that's something important to us. So all we do. Right which is huge. Family kills. Like I'm leaving millions of views on the table. Especially with my two characters. This kid's probably puppies. Yeah I mean everybody plays their own thing. As you can imagine I do a lot of business. So a lot of the stuff never makes it. Cause I'm having, I'm firing somebody. I'm talking about somebody's salary. We're negotiating things that TV shows that are six months away that nobody can know about. So you live life. You know what I mean? Is he always filming you? Yes. Yeah I mean some people ask for him not to. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable in a scenario. Do I stay at home? No. So it's just here. Yeah it's my business life. It's not just here. It's in Finland and it's Orlando. Well I mean while you're at work. You should come and focus on that. That's right. It's a business show. It's my entrepreneurial life. I reference my family. But I just have a funny feeling you've got some upside in that and it's something you should, two minutes. And you should sleep on it. Okay. You're right about that. Your intuition was right. I mean it's a really good character but. I think so. Like it's just so, it's so black. Like I almost feel like I see life in a different lens. Like when I see it I just know. And the truth is unlike learning the craft of how much does this cost, learning the craft of what these 800 people do, what's so great about it and you're gonna know this, you just do you. That's easy. You do me all the time. It's the easiest thing to do in life. So something to think about. Something to think about. So would you be that the person would be in the office or following him home? No, you. By the way, by the way, by the way. It could be only about you and you're a side character. It could be the show about the whole business and there could be four, it could be cheers. It could be, you know. Sector of the city. That's right. It could be anything you want it to be because here's what's better than signing a deal with Bravo. You're in control of the final at it. Right. That's good. Yeah, that's where it gets real good. Now the thing is I would recommend that if you try to micromanage too much and not listen to what we know, which is you have to show vulnerability. You have to show real humanity. Like you have to show this shit you don't want to show. Otherwise nobody gives a fuck because you're back to television. Got it? Something to be. So I think those are the two things you should be sleeping on. A, you know, a real digital strategy for 2017, not for 2006. And just, and B, a real conversation amongst yourselves of like is this the right model? And this is a model that literally exists only with people that film themselves, vloggers on YouTube that have transcended. I'm not good at that. So I made my own version of it, which is this. But it's real. We know that. And then shoot this. Is Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, are they all equally powerful? They're all? They're all? I do them all. You put the same content on everything. Nope. Because no. No. Because most people you social media to blast out, you have to create for it. So content that works on Snapchat, Snapchat is me, first person always. Whereas YouTube and Facebook is the distribution of the show. Got it? Instagram is me, but I use that for motivational quotes mainly. You know, so, all strategy. Like the thing that people don't understand is this is the world, this is the actual world of communication and there's real skill and everybody thinks it's just like, oh, it's social media. It's exponentially harder than print. Like if your lovely partner was here, I would absolutely make her feel inferior to her. The skill that she deployed against print because it was easier. Right, right. Yeah, it's antiquated. I mean, right, no question. It's just easier. You know, it's not her fault. It's just the truth. Like this is very complex, nuanced and detailed, which is why everybody thinks it's, first of all, everybody doesn't think it's a big deal. And then when they spend on it and they aren't successful, they don't think it works. You didn't know what to do with it. You know how much money I would make playing a piano? You know what I mean? But Billy Joel makes fucking billions. You have to know what the fuck you're doing. So, all right, good. Yeah, send me an email. Let me know if there's anything I can help with. Yeah, real pleasure, take care. Thanks for hanging guys. But you could really out, like going cliche and I don't know you, but I'm just giving you, like you could win the housewife sex in the city thing in a real way. I'm telling you right now you could. You have to think about it. Right, and would you help with that? I don't want to, I don't, here's what I can promise you. I can promise you you can come in here and sit with me and Lindsay and I'll walk you through what VaynerTalon is. I'm still work, you know what makes a great salesperson? Somebody that really believes in their shit. I know we've got it. I really believe in it. I'm scared of two things. One, that's why I'm beta testing with this one person. I really want a triple check. Cause I want everybody talking about me behind my back the best. Because I make five times $20,000 a month to give a speech. I'll do that. It's not about the money. I want to build something eventually that could be worth billions cause that's what production companies are. And two, I need to know you better because I have a lot of empathy for what it takes. What they'll tell you is for all my intensity I let the creators do their thing. I don't control the message. And I've been in this for 10 years understanding this world. Here, I just threw a whole new thing for you to think about. You never thought about it. Now you're gonna think about it. And even if you say yes 100%, I have so much empathy for you wanting to be very in control of the final output. And in that is a lack of speed which is the ROI of the whole thing. So I need you to be in the no business, not the yes business. What I mean by that is you sit down, you watch for 23 minutes and you're like, no, that one thing I can't, my sister will kill me. Not, I've been thinking about that. Not. Leah will kill me, my daughter will kill me. Right, right, right. Not, not, not, oh I don't like that angle. Right. You're just gonna lose. No, that's not it. Yeah. Most of all, yourself. Yeah. Because by the way, getting into a place where people are stopping you, I'm getting stopped 10, 15 times a day in the street, it's changing my life. With my daughter and fans are yelling out, she's like, daddy, you know, and by the way, people like you and I, we want it. We want it. But you gotta be careful with the kids. And you're in a different place. Yeah, you're in a much, yeah, you're in a much, that's correct, you're in a different place. But I will tell you this, you will sell shit. I built a hundred million dollar business on my brand. You will sell shit. Right. That's the bottom line. Sales are the bottom line. You will get an email from QVC saying, do you wanna work with us? You will get an email from an unbelievable shop in Naples, Florida that has four locations that says we love you, we watch you every day, we want your product, when you come to the store, you'll get an email from Harper Collins, offering you $100,000 to write a book. It will happen. That fucking 30,000 a month deployed against this for one year, that $360,000 will pay you back millions. This is the new world. I love that, I love that. Cool, take care. Yeah, stay well, bye bye. You really think this is right for her, huh? I'm going off your vibe now. I'm saying, but even with like, just being able to create for you, just from whatever woman's conversation, that's not, that's what makes it.
