You know, one could argue that they don't like fake news. I could argue is the world better if two or three old white dudes dictate the entire conversation in media and where we go. There's a pro and con to all this. All the people that find love and great relationships that never would have because of this technology. All the people that are on this trip right now that can FaceTime their family and have that connection that we could have never done before. This is a net positive. The world has never been better. Yet we continue to look at the negatives. It's what happens. It's what happens as we get older. But the technology changes and the social changes have just begun. The upside is enormous. Enormous. One could say virtual reality sounds scary and not fun. I could argue like what's wrong with living your life and then living in a nicer place and lowering the cost of where we live because that becomes commoditized and live healthier and who's gonna be able to balance getting off of it? We're living in a virtual reality world now. There are people that spend seven, eight, 12, 13, 14 hours of their day in a screen now. This is the way it is. And so either we can cry about it and put our head in the sand and think it's a negative or we can grab it and understand all the great changes. My brother left my business because he has Crohn's disease. There's been no way that I could impact changing that disease the way I am now because of these devices and technologies 10 or 15 or 20 years ago. The impact was this big compared to this big because of the amplification and the messaging that can be done. And so you as an individual person here are gonna decide that all of this is a negative or all of this is a positive. I've chosen this to be a massive positive. It is good. There's so much opportunity. There's so many great things we're doing for so many people. And if you look at the data, if you like data, the world is better than it's ever been across the board. Now what we have to do is make this micro and bring it home. I am so passionate for everybody to understand that before you critique or judge the generations below you, take a look under the hood and really understand it. Go look at studies like the average 14 year old girl 20 years ago claimed to have 1.4 best friends and now claims to have six. That because if you didn't have the serendipity of being in a school where people were nice to you and maybe you didn't have any outlet and you were gonna get bullied, you now can go online and find your actual friends and spend time with. So I think we spend a lot of time on the negatives and we don't talk about the positives. What I would implore you to do is think about the benefits of positive versus negative. I would implore you, especially if you care, if it's underneath you, to start getting on the offense around things like self-esteem because that's where it comes from instead of looking at the other way. Every family therapist says that you should have screw-free zones in your home. And dinner, everybody puts your device down. Or a couple's therapist would say, put your phones down and have one hour together if you're not looking at your phones. I'm curious about your family dynamic. Do you all have phones at your dinner table? So a couple things, we run the gamut. First and foremost, I think we all know this. There's a couple places, I'm talking in general terms if you've noticed, to me the least interesting thing in the world is to tell people how to parent their children. I mean, there's so many individual contexts here in this room, everybody's got their own dynamics. I think it's a lazy and convenient thing. Now, here's what I believe. There's a great Russian saying, so hara shokarov meri. I believe everything is best when it's balanced. Anything, you know, balance is great. But I also think you have to understand so many variables. And I think that therapists, if you look at the history of the feedback of therapists over the last 100 years, the consensus has been wrong plenty of times because therapists are collectively poor at predicting what happens next, as are most people. We make a lot of decisions without understanding what happens next. And so, you know, my family, first of all, I'm a workaholic. Monday through Friday, I barely see my family. That's just true. So on the weekends, it's extreme the other way. We take seven weeks vacation, all in phones, locked up because I'm playing such extremes. I'm so politically not correct on the current state of parenting on just the framework of where I am with them Monday through Friday, let alone am I sitting there with a phone or not during dinner time, right? Here's my big thing. Parents always think they're protecting kids. The amount of parents over the last 20 years who took their kids away from making $15 million a year being an e-sports superstar who's now making $81,000 a year in middle management and wants to kill himself is enormous. So, there's been more parenting books written in the last seven years than prior of the beginning of mankind to those seven years ago. America is very good at one very interesting thing. Telling people and selling on fear and telling them what they're not good at. And the current state of parenting has completely gone into that direction. I have no interest in the collective, you know, current politically correct POV on parenting. What I'm interested in is reverse engineering my kids. I don't need them to be entrepreneurs. I don't care what they want to do. I just want to pay attention to their behavior at scale and reverse engineer that and instill so much self-esteem into them that they're borderline delirious because that is the drug that stops them from the dumb shit that we all fear. But no eighth place trophies because that shit has fucked us up. Like... Thank you. Education. If you're a friend of these guys, you're like, drop that at college. It's already me. Yeah, but a lot of my... I was a bad student. Let's remember the famous drop that at college, 98% of them, not me, but 98% of them are dropping out of Stanford and Harvard. You know, like the whole drop that at college thing has been very romanticized. These are really smart individuals. But do you still value a formal education? I don't. I do not. I'm super comfortable. So first of all, I speak at all these top universities. I'm teaching a class at Stanford. This and that. The lack of practicality that is being taught in our universities to the reality of the world is staggering. It's a bigger version of what I said here with the kids. What world do you think they're going to live in? Now, if you want to do a certain profession, I understand the practicality of having to own a diploma that gives you the at-bat. I spent a lot of my time in the business entrepreneurial world. There's zero mapping for that. The MBA or the business school mapping to the reality of success has been completely blown out of the water. And the other thing that we don't talk enough about is how this debt destroys individuals. They don't get out of it sometimes until they're 40s in a proper way. Do you think these online school programs are end up? Here's where I'm going. I think the thing that has not been talked about that is probably more interesting than things I just said is colleges are built on brand. The biggest thing that they're doing right now is they're creating these online courses that are diluting their brand. Penn and Stanford and Harvard have these online courses. And if you look at the way the people that are taking them are positioning their certification from these courses, they're not giving it the proper... They're just saying, I want to Harvard. And so I think the biggest universities in the world right now for short-term income, because they're getting scale of $18,000 online courses that are four weeks and they're bringing in revenue, are actually diluting their brand so much. And I don't think that Harvard and Stanford actually understand that they're only trading on brand only. Because the education has been commoditized because the professors have that and they're putting out their content online for free. You can see it for free when they're giving a TED talk or doing four interviews. So the actual education, the words, what I did up there, that's commoditized, that's zero. The only thing these big universities are working on is brand equity, because you grew up believing in it, so you're forcing your kids to believe in it. And that's very close to the newspaper revenue model of collapsing, so I think they only have 30 to 40 years left. ["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"] I mean, don't forget, don't forget. Lost in history is like when we definitely felt like, you know what, should we just sell Vayner for a million dollars? We had that discussion. You were out and I was like, I don't know. Like, you know, like it was there, you know? I wish fucking DailyVee was there for that scene before that speech at Techstars, you know? That'd be funny to look at. So like, I mean, I think, you know, I think, there's a million things to go through. And we, you know, it's always fun to, I think this is a perfect example of like, not my first rodeo, right? Isn't it fun for you to like, have all that context, right? The ability for us to do a commercial, a two-minute, like, and now I'm also creating this whole Facebook commercial thing, I think we're going to be able to do some really good deals where fuck Detroit and he's doing it for the 7-location pizza shop and we send Stefan and make a two-minute video for Facebook. That's why they're going to want to do it. Every single day, people should wake up, open the explore feature on Twitter, look at the hashtags, click the trending hashtags and make a piece of content that if this was, if I had more time, I would be doing that every two hours. It is an absolute way to build up on Twitter. Nobody's really paying attention as much to Twitter. The word's Instagram and Facebook and Snapchat are rolling out of it. But just even looking at my own dynamics when I leverage a trending hashtag, it's just exponential. And I'm on this real kick for this video. This, the positivity video. This one. When I think about our capabilities to eliminate each other, I'm being serious. I know it's kind of a weird place to go, but like the fact that we're still here, we are hardwired in a way that allows us to protect each other in a net game. Yet, the mainstream media and the way we hear, all you hear is negativity. All that mainstream media does is tell us about the .0001% worst of us. I think we as humans are going to have some level of a sense of responsibility that if you're in a good place, it might be good to tweet or Instagram or Snapchat about that versus what we default into, which is there are people's Twitter feeds that are basically every seven or 10 days when they're complaining about an airline or venting about work. Like the volume of negativity is just way too high in reality of what's going on. Every empire falls when the silent majority of happy isn't loud enough and they lose the branding game. We love the third wall. You rock, that third wall. Yo, I just pulled up. Where do I go? Alright, right to the left here. Right, that first building, like right, by the baseball stadium, the sports complex. So the football field, the field house. Excited to go see Alvin Kamar right now. Beast, some bunch of you watching this right now. He's about to be your favorite football player. So crazy to watch this in a year, right? See you. Who's this? Who's that? Tell me, Gary. Real pleasure. How are you? Good man. Real good, real good. How you feeling? Yes, look at this. Look at this, look at this. Gates, he's about to roll up that way too. Is there just a mix of people working out here? Nice to meet you. Don't freak out. No, I'm comfortable. I love it, man. I fucking love team sports, man. Oh, God. I wish I was dramatically faster and dramatically stronger. I'd give up all the business riches. You know what is the competition? That's the reason I love business so much, because I can replicate it a little bit, because I'm trying to put people out of fucking business. You were there, definitely. When I was like, listen to me, motherfucker, you can win or you can go, like, or you're going to lose. One of the others. That's the problem when you're doing sports and music. It's, there's just not a lot in the middle. So what's on your mind? Like, what's important to you? Anything? Like, how are you thinking? Working. Just focused on, right? You still got a black, can we change this logo? I don't know what it's saying to do. Your fucking face. You got a pretty face. Why are you scared? Still a black, I'm still in the basement. I don't know what it's saying. I'm still in the basement. Change it to a jet's logo. I don't know about the fucking basement. Change it to a jet's logo. It's funny how I feel about gyms now. Now that I actually work out, I like it. Ty, you could do some pull-ups? Show me. Go ahead. Yeah, do some pull-ups. I want to see your pull-ups. Too good. Ty, you can do pull-ups? What? I want to see how many Ty can do. That's six. That's good. Let's go, Ty. I'm impressed. Get that tenth, baby. One more. Let's go. That's going to be some good finish for the block. That's the first thing I've done since fucking... Oh, my God. Alvin, Tyler should be dead. I got hit by a car in New York City. Hit. Should be dead. Straight up. I'm dead fucking serious. I got a good idea. I'm going to go Facebook Live. I'm going to make people try to get Alvin to go on their team. This alarm. What is that? Fucking parts. Yo, yo, yo. Instagram. All right, football fans. It's time to make your pleader case. So the best running back in the fucking draft. Alvin wants... Who wants Alvin on their team? Show me. Tell Alvin what team he needs to be drafted by. I'll start first. The Jets. The Jets. What up, Shemin? Legendaries there. Let's see. One of you is about to be real happy. One of you is about to buy a jersey of this man. Okay, there's Ravens' first. Big fans. Yes, mister. There you go. Let me save that one. Sure, by the way, I think the Packers actually... Yeah, that could be interesting. Garners? Nalus? I've been here in Nalus the past couple days. I've been with the Packers. See you, Ox. Oh, Kevin Rose. K-Rose. K-Rose, if you guys draft this man, it's going to be the greatest day of your life. This guy's a superstar. Hall of Famer. Get ready. Tell him. Guys, imagine if your career was predicated. On two random days in Indianapolis, where like millions of dollars are in stake for hundreds of a second. Running and jumping. Running and jumping. K-Rose, imagine you had a right code for an hour and that predicted if you were going to be good or I had 40 minutes, four minutes on the liquor store floor and however much wine I sold, they predicted my whole career on that. Crazy. Anyway, I felt as if Alan's got to get to work. He's still in a dungeon. That's why his profile is still all black. This guy. All right, let's talk to you guys later. I was impressed with those chin-ups, Ty. And they weren't bullshit ones, too. You would try to do them proper. Come on. You know I'm starting boxing in a year and a half. A year and a half? Yeah, when Jordan's done, I'm doing three years of boxing. I'm going to box every morning. I'm going to do boxing. I'm going to go in the ring at 45 and knock D-Rock out. How do you think about it? I would have dreamed of playing a little football. It's his hit now. It's like right there, right? Right. I started playing when I was four. And from the get you were like, this is what I want to do. Yeah. At a gate about this high, I would cross the street from my house and I would just talk. I used to kick the ball over the fence from a little angle. Kick the ball, throw the ball. Try to jump over it. Go get it. Everything. I was small back then. My mother didn't trust the process. She used to tell me, look, you ain't putting your hand on the field. You're going to get hurt? Yeah, basically. So my grandmother, she snuck me on the field when she dropped my mother off at work. So she said he got those clothes on and he brought that from like Walmart or something. My mama go to Walmart and pick up the same clothes and bring me to practice and change me up back in those clothes. I love that. She'll call you and she'll be like, you know what I'm saying? I know exactly. You know what's so funny? I was just reading about that Uzi Vert up in Philly. How his mom wouldn't let it, like how nobody believed him as grandma. Got him that Mike Jones album and she's like, keep going, keep going. You need somebody. You got to have somebody. You know? Yeah, I'm watching that too. Wake up. Get your lens. 12 month of your sport. That's why these kids play longer. Gary, Gary, West Moss, some big fan of yours. Thank you, man. I appreciate the love. Thanks for everything you do. Thank you, man. You're on your shit. How long you in town for? I just came to see Alvin and I'm heading back to New York in a second. A little bit? Yeah. Thanks for coming down. Of course, man. I'm the assistant vice president here. I oversee our academic units. Fantastic. So I saw you come in and they come by and say hi. I'm glad you did, my man. You need it? No, I'm in great shape. Thank you. Real pleasure. Thank you for saying hello. Can I get a picture with you? Thanks, man. Love it, man. Thanks for the love. Thank you very much. Talk to you soon. Continue success here. How you doing? Is that your iPhone? Yeah. Yeah, there you go. Let's get the 225 eventually. Yeah, he'll fuck around and test us like Randy will be in the middle of work. I'll be like, all right, Bert. Really? You're on the wind. I don't want to get so fucking used to like, it's like the combo and that pressure. When y'all do that, he's like, it's not going to be no pressure. Well, that's exactly right. Y'all ran through it so many times. Like, did you guys hear that they're doing fans for the first time, but they can't say shit? That's going to be the weirdest shit. There's going to be like, there's going to be like a thousand fans watching, but they can't say a word. Fucking death penalty. Yeah, the whole thing's so weird. A lot of times actually happen in the comments section around the creative where then we can go in and business developed and we start with leverage because it's people reaching out to us that want to be involved with. This is an extraordinarily big difference between the way marketing has been done for the last 70 years where we as marketers and business people sit in a silo and try to create the business development instead of letting the lead creative become the platform that creates those opportunities. For my personal brand and for the startups I'm working with, so much of the extension of campaigns have happened in the comments section of the creative once deployed. LA, stand up. 6pm Wednesday, 15 of you, right? Because I'm taking 10. 15 of you are going to be able to be part of something remarkable. Intimate access. I got to do this crazy fucking thing and I'm going to do a random contest for 15 of you to come and join and be a part of it.

Red eye time for me and DRock. I'm that dude right there. Almost left.
