## Transcript
There's nothing more fun than loving people. Loving people is an imperpatuity game of happiness. Yeah! You got your perspective. Yeah! Yeah! I just want to be happy. Don't you want to be happy? An actual live interview, which is really exciting to me, and we come strong with an incredible guest with a new book and someone that I don't think needs much of an introduction, but I'm going to allow him to say hello and who he is, and then we're going to get into the book and then we're going to shoot the shit about a bunch of things, maybe a little football wine and definitely a lot of what the book is about and why. And so Matthew, it is a pleasure to introduce you to the show. Please tell everybody who you are and what the book is about. There we go. Good to be here with you Gary Vee. Good to be here. I'm going to come back here. I went away to the desert for 52 days in solitary confinement and walked out of there with a book. I spent 36 years of diary's I've been keeping. It's called Green Lights and it's stories, people, places, prescribes, poems, prayers, and a whole lot of bumper stickers. Sort of based on a 50 years of chronological narrative of my life and it's interspersed sort of with flashbacks and flash forwards of those prescribes, poems and prayers that come in and either call back to the story you just got out of or propel you into the next story that you're going into. It's ways of seeing is what it really is that. Perspective. Perspective very much. It's an approach book and a playbook, been a memoir. And the name is it, is it, does it allude to, you know, going forward like yes, culture like, you know, because when I heard the name, I like that. You know, I got a little bit pissed, you know, when my Jets love affair, I always talk about green. I was like, shit, I could have definitely gone with that kind of. He's a red light now in chief. So is that a little bit of like where you went with it? Well, so here we go. What I ended up with is believing that every red and yellow light turns green eventually in life. All right. So we love green lights. Yes. They are far away. Go. We don't like yellows and reds. They slow us down or stop us. But I found out that a lot of the yellow and reds, when is it that we noticed that there's a green light within the yellow and the red? Meaning right now, there's no green light with Levy on Belle leaving your chest. But what is something? But I apologize because you get me fired up. My green light with the Jets is actually my macro professional mission, which is like, okay, well, this sucks, but good news. I'm going to buy them. And when I do, I'm going to win fucking Super Bowls. So that's my green light within the red. Okay. That one is a marathon versus a sprint. But to your point, I'm definitely picking up what you're putting down because sometimes I see the green and I mean, I see the green and the fucking yellow every time. The green and a red is a little bit more of thinking sometimes an hour, sometimes a year, sometimes a decade. Sometimes on a deathbed, sometimes maybe a great, great grandkids figure it out. I don't know. Some of them. But when is it that we notice? And I think the tool that I've talked about in the book is when faced with the inevitable, get relative. So one thing is when do you deem the situation inevitable? Yeah. And then the other art is when and how do you get relative with that situation? Do you either persist through it? Because you want to get what you want or you pivot or you hold up the white flag and go, no, I'm fighting another day for something else. How much is self-esteem a layer, a piece, a framework of even making any of this possible? Well, I guess you never thought about it, but it has to be a large part of it. Right. Because it's funny, right? Notice where I went, right? And I like that you paused and gave it some feel like to me, I'm listening and I'm already hyped and I knew this would have plenty of energy. I'm just obsessed with self-esteem because I think I just think that people fall in love with yellow and red because of insecurity. And I think people front the green because they're putting up fake bravado and ego because of insecurity. And I think a lot about the foundation of self-esteem allowing the triple green light in this situation. Sure. I mean, absolutely. How about self-esteem and the ego? If you don't mind me parlaying those two and both. How do you have judgment? How do you have any identity? Yeah. I mean, self-confidence, self-esteem, self-reliance, awareness of self. You got to have all those to handle the yellow and the reds and not, again, lay down and wallow in them. And so I love it over here. Because what everything you just talked about, I was giving you some room because I'm going to get bombarded for cutting you off because that's how I roll. So I'm trying to be better, evolve in my older age. All that leads to accountability. Right? When you talk about all that self-work, I'm like, right. And then that parlay's into accountability. And accountability actually makes you really fucking happy instead of the reverse. Hey, I'm sitting down at the same dinner with you, man. I mean, it's this idea, part of this choice about how to find green lights and create green lights, which obviously we can create green lights tomorrow for us by our choices today. So this idea that sometimes we say it's a responsibility and freedom or a contradiction, which they're not. There is a responsibility to freedom and there is a freedom in responsibility. Yes. Relay gratification is what I'm talking. I'm a big fan of. I'm a team in myself being cool to my future self, whether it's the simple thing of putting the coffee in the damn filter tonight or tomorrow morning when I'm groggy, all I got to do is push the button. Ah, nice play, McConaughey. Way to be cool. You know, or whether it is how I choose to be a husband to my wife or father to my children or how they speak about you behind your back in 21 years. Yeah. And you know, the end of the end of. Delay gratification, which I can tell you, you. I'm obsessed. I mean, because I'm obsessed with the journey. I like the game way more than the fucking trophy. The trophy doesn't really exist though. No, we're just achieving on the way to unachievable the whole way as well. The way I see it. I mean, one of the reasons I bring up the death of very iconic people, Prince, I use a lot others is I try to use that to paint the picture to people of like, you can have a trillion trophies and then it just all over. Like you get 24 hours in social media, you get a little hashtag trend. People play their favorite clip. They quote a couple of your favorite things. And literally it's a week later and everyone's fucking on their life. So what the fuck are you chasing trophy for? Don't get yet the result process, process, process. So I bring this up. I say I'm a fan of doing this a lot too. I like to before doing a movie say sit down with the producers and directors. Hey, what's the poster look like? Yeah, I love it. I love it. I love what you're saying. That's right. That's right. So still listen to this. Let's all ask yourself, what's our eulogy, which is going to forever introduce us after we're gone? Well, that's inevitable. The relative part is this resume of living we got going right now, which is going to write that story that's going to introduce us fucking ever when we're gone. So let me since since it's I mean, this is talk about sharing the same meal. Take me take me to a couple of different places because we'll get back to this. You know, so much is made so much makes sense to me about my my observations and interactions with you right now. Now that we've gone to this place, talk to me about the book from a different way because I have a we have a big audience on this and there's a lot of different people and now I'm going to focus on the people that are thinking about books. Sure. Did you always want to write one? Is it as simple as you went for this because I was aware of that little, you know, adventure you took. Did it really hit there? What would you like to happen because of it? How much around legacy and and and you know, like what's the what's the poster? Like what would you like to happen? Like give me the selfless and selfish, you know, altruistic and like personal makeup. Absolutely. Blend of this for you. Absolutely. And we'll get into selfless yourself less later on those two are those two are you like that one, right? Yeah, I'm about that. Yeah, I get it. You'll redefining it to the world. So listen, I kept diaries for 36 years in my life. Just because I'm going to double click because this is fun and we got a little time. What why did you start day one? What happened? Well, 14 years old probably started it because, you know, Gretchen Donnelly broke up with me and my diary. Like most people go to a diary or journal, whatever you want to call it. So I went to a diary for my first years of when I was lost. I figured out, oh, heartbroken. I figure this out. Why do I got pimples? What's going on? What's this? What's this pubic hair coming in? Where? Why won't mine come in sooner? But you know, stuff like that. So then it started off with going there to figure out, figure things out. And I get my 20s. I got some great relationships going, schools cranking. I got a job. I'm rolling, catching green lights. I remember saying, hey, you better keep writing in your diary right now. Why are you succeeding? Why are you rolling? You're catching. My hunch was you're going to be you're going to get in a rut again and you're going to need something to look back on to get to recalibrate. I mean, you're enough. I found a rut as we all do. I was able to go back to those diaries and go, what were your habits when you were rolling, when you were catching green lights? Where were you hanging out with? What time you going to bed? Where were you eating? Where were you going? What were your morning rituals? Oh, you spent a little more time with yourself before you engaged with the world. Oh, I got you. You took that little walk. Okay. And I went, it got me recalibrated. I was going to get back on the rails and it helped me get out of certain rut and find green lights again, find my frequency again. So kept those diaries, looked at them all. Seven or eight categories came out that I mentioned early from the people, places, prescribes, poems, prayers, and a whole lot of bumper stickers. And then the theme of green light started to emerge out of those categories. I noticed how I've engineered green lights in my life with certain choices I'd made. I'd teed myself up for more Saturdays in my future, given myself no more reasons to look over my proverbial shoulder to see what I'd left behind, which gave me less stress moving forward and gave me more presence in green lights. So dwelling, dwelling, the elimination of dwelling. Well, I'm fascinated. I'm fascinated on people's inability to understand that there is no time machine. This notion of I wish, you know, it's imperative to learn from pattern recognition mistakes, strength, imperative. Yes. Dwelling, looking back and dwelling and spending all of that prevent defense using football because they love it. That's something I'm desperate to push on people. Like it's your, I know, I know you made you made the wrong decision. Good news. Right. There's absolutely zero chance you're going to go into a time machine. So take the learning and just go on fucking offense and and and eat shit for another six years to give yourself a chance to get to that same fucking road. And this time make the fucking right call. I think it's all offense. I think every every step is affirmative, even if it's considered going backwards. Look, going back and looking at 30, 50 years of my diaries was an intimidating idea. I said, oh, I'm going to be embarrassed. I'm going to be shamed. I'm going to feel guilty. I'm going to be arrogant prick at this time. And I felt all those things, but mostly ended up laughing at some of the. You just, I was going to say, I'm curious the first time you just laughed your ass off. Well, I mean, I was like, oh, God, I looked at stuff I was ashamed for. I was like, oh, you kind of already forgave yourself for that. You moved on, you know. And so a lot of the book is about me going off into solitude at times, which I think is a good practice for everyone to do. And the reason I bring that up is because it's attached to the word dwell, but it's it's not. And it plays into this example. You just said six years, go to hell and get out of it. Every time I go away on my own, my backpack on my own, the first 12 days are hell. I do not like the company. How many how many times have you done that? Six to eight, 10. And are you saying that the pre-requisite to you doing that is often the fact that you know, you need it and what you're doing is reconciling with yourself in that early part? Well, I need memory to catch up. I'm in a world where I'm getting too much frequency. I've got no demarcation between events. I'm kind of playing on autopilot and I'm doing OK. But my head and my heart do not have an auto bond between them. There's a bit of a dirt road and I got to clean that up. I got to feel my feet on the ground spiritually. Maybe I feel a little. And so I need to go off and I need to let memory catch up. I need to go listen to myself and find some discernment into my own judgment. What do I want from me? What's going on in the world? What's the reverb here? What am I giving to it? What's it giving back to me? Get some clarity there. Happens, you know, especially when things are rolling. This is usually coming out of major green lights where I need to go away to go. Is that green light plugged into a battery? Or have you learned that off those epic green lights that if you don't go do that, you crash from the energy and it puts you into like you were off of this high. It was rolling. This was so delicious. And then in that in between, which is completely always natural for all of us, that the drop off is it doesn't feel great. So instead of doing that, you're going to go on this offense and go take that backpack trip. And it's going to make a productive time instead of kind of coming down from the project or thing. Yeah. Well, the come down will be when you look up and you go, oh, all the affluence that you noticed all the so half the green lights were plugged into, you know, two volt batteries and they weren't. They were never going to last very long. And it's going away to get rid of the ones that are plugged into the toy batteries and going to the ones that oh, that's solar power. That's so that's going to burn forever. That's burning after I'm gone, which takes you back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what I hope comes out of the book, man, I hope it can help the people get find the free. I hope you hope you're going to I think we're going to laugh their ass off. It's killer stories. I did find that that the stories. Did you work with a ghost writer? I work with a ghost writer for my books because I'm very conscious stream and it needs to be structured for me. Or were you able to get there? No, I was so low. I had a good start at the beginning. Stephen Krut, he was from the New York Times. He had written a cool article on me. I reached out to him. We started to get together one time. New York Times pulled him off the project, which then me and my wife, I looked in the mirror and I was like, that's something best gift I could have been given. And she goes, yeah, get your ass out of here. Take your journals. Don't go back to your house. So packed up stakes and bourbon and headed out. And so what I hope, man, people get out. I think I think people are going to see some killer stories. I am a pretty good storyteller. Now, the thing I did learn is that I thought telling I've performed a lot of these stories. And I thought if I just transcribed my best performance to the page, that'd be the best written word on the page. It was not. It need to be about 30 percent shorter. You got to pick a word out. You don't get the lilt of my voice going up to tea. Up here comes the punch line. You don't get any of that. So I think you're going to be we're going to find some wisdom bombs in here. I picked up a lot along the way. I think there's a lot of bumper stickers. What was to make to make this fun? Because I know the process of book and it's really, really fun. Who any story you can share with us they haven't shared yet or you have of somebody reading it for the first time, your inner circles, the first 15, 20, 30 people and and anything that like either collectively they latched on to and or an interesting observation from someone that was fun for you. You were like happy, your cousin or your best friend or your wife. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anything cool like that in the first. Well, I mean, I got I got I got a call yesterday from from Don Phillips. And he's a he's a character in the story. He's the casting director. I introduced myself in Austin, Texas in the summer of 1992, who later on at three a.m. after we got kicked out of a bar and we're smoking a joint in the way home in a cab. He says, you ever done any acting? And I come to this address tomorrow morning and there's three lines in this character, which ended up being three weeks working a film called Days Confused. And I moved in to it slept on his couch when I moved out to LA. And he's the guy who after about a month where I'm down to about eight hundred dollars from my pocket and I'm telling him, hey, man, I need to get an agent. And he snapped at me and gave me one of the best lessons I've ever learned. He goes, this town smells you needy. You're fucking done. He goes, what you need to do is get the hell out of here and go off and get lost somewhere, go to Europe, go ride a goddamn motorcycle, something. But quit thinking about making it in Hollywood because this place smells you needy. You're done. He was right. That was another. That was one of the guys who actually a ride a passes of a guy pushing me out of wanting something so bad and he's right. I come in needy. So I had an average motor. You come in needy. You give up the leverage. I showed him a month later. I'm not even thinking about getting an agent. Well, now it's time to go get an agent because I'm like, I just came from somewhere, man. You know, and so I. My Hollywood like my knowledge in sports, uncomfortably deep, I'm much weaker in like movie culture and like acting culture. I obsessed with Dazed and Confused, like one of my favorite, favorite movies. And I'm not even a big movie guy. There were so many, so many of you in that film. I love those coming of age movies to begin with. Did that this is probably a very basic question. I'm sure people like booing at me right now as they're listening to this. Did you get instant acclaim from that? And that was huge leverage. Was it a slow burn? Was it instant? Like what happened? Like movie comes out. You got me in the door. Gotcha. Got me in the door. It got me. Got people curious. Got people curious, right? Yeah. Well, it gave me something from a resume. You know, the agents, I could take a meeting with you. But it wasn't like you like it wasn't like tons of people reaching out and said, okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It was similar. It wasn't an explosion. I had to find one agent and three said no. Okay. You know what that was? I thought you were fucking killer. I mean, the yeah, I mean, that same same age line is like one of the great fucking lines. It's what I call that a launchpad line. That's fucking in three weeks. But now I worked off a base because Richard Lincoln wrote that line. Oh, is that true? That was the line. That's the line. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I mean, who looks that guy? There's an encyclopedia on that guy. If he believes that he loves about high school girls, he gets old. Maybe that that guy's there's a huge, very thick book on him. Yes, for sure. But anyway, I get a call from Don Phillips yesterday and he's in the book and mind you, he's in the book where I show and how often you talk to Don in real life now, like it could run hot and cold. Every couple of months we check in. Every couple of months and we met back in 92. But he's in the story. You know, I mean, about I show up at his house when I'm first pulled out to Hollywood on the 26 hour drive from Texas and I show up and he doesn't answer the door and I keep beating on the door with the with the boner. And basically like, Hey, can you come back later? I'm like, no, dude, I just drove 26 hours. So there were things in the book and I called them before them being in the book. I said, look, I'm going to tell the truth of our stories. He's like, okay, we read the book and I don't know. He's older. Sometimes people get older in their life and they look back and I'm like, I didn't do that. Don't talk about me like that. Well, he didn't. He loved it. He goes, man, the book is so humble. It's so true. It's, um, and it's people this, I've had a lot of people tell me this. It's a Hollywood in my celebrity. Yeah. Do I tell stories about some of Hollywood? Yeah. But a lot of people have told me this. One of the favorite things about the book is what it is not. I love it. I'm not a disher. I don't dish on people. I don't tell bedroom stories. And I always say this, that's why there's doors on the bedroom. It's only a business. It wouldn't be decent. There are people that I that I could have named them in the story and would have thrown mud in their face, but I don't have a problem with them. That was who they were. We've forgiven each other. We moved on. I'm not going to, I don't, I didn't play the big stories. No names, but, but you create the story. Have any of those people reached out? Uh, yes. That's cool. Yeah. They have in a, in a, in a, in a cool, in a cool way. Cool way. Yeah. Um, cause the more, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, there's people, like I said, there's people, there's places, everyone's not, I don't dish. I don't dish on anybody. I didn't feel like that. That didn't want it to be when I, when I first with, to write the book, like I understand I got some equity as an actor. Somebody's going to buy the book because McConnay wrote it. Some people won't buy it just because McConnay wrote it. Either way, I remember saying this. Hey, can you put, go put words on a page that are worthy of being signed by anonymous, but at the same time be only, only you could have written it. That's cool. The idea of where I was, where I was head. How, how is it, I actually have a great question that I'm curious about. How is promoting a book like doing this show? I've seen some other stuff on social. How is it, is it, or how is it different than promoting a movie? You know, any, any, any, any tidbit there that's kind of funny, anything you kind of picked up on? Here's my favorite thing is this is, I wrote this one. I directed it. I produced it. I don't have to prepare. Look, I've gone out and, and I'm, and I'm honored with what I was able to put out. I've had, I've gone chosen to sell movies before where maybe I didn't love the movie and it wasn't getting a great reaction. And I can tell if you saw it, you go, yeah, interesting stuff. It was cool. So anyway, McConaughey, you've got it. You've got to be a professional. Right. You know, I got to pick out two things that I'm saying that are, that are, that are wrote down into my positive sort of go to things to say about the movie. But now I don't have to prepare for any of this. I wrote it. I actually have a fun question. The movie that when you read it, and this might be a tough question. I don't even, I, again, I truly don't have a good sense of Hollywood culture enough to know if this is a tough question or not, but I'm going to ask it because I'm just genuinely curious because I, some of it, you know, as a businessman, some of the ideas I have in my head to then see how I executed it. I'm like, how this sucks. And I control a lot of that as an actor. You don't literally, you thought everything was going to be epic and then it just didn't post well, you know, like the post production. You're like, really? What would be, yeah, what movie were you most hyped about? And then you were like, fuck, man, that didn't go. And then in reverse, what movie, what movie were you and by the way, it might be something you thought was going to be a plus, plus, plus, plus and was a B minor. I'm not talking A and F. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then in reverse, what movie were like you most like you were most and whether it was your age and what's the reverse. So yeah, which one did you come in the hottest and we're like, and which one were you coming in with the most like I don't know. And like, holy fuck. Well, let me answer this. All right, I could say this man for for the second half. The Alice Fires Club is a movie we made for $4.9 million and 25 days. I remember that movie that almost like never got made. And we willed that into existence by now. I ask permission. That movie and that movie again, I claim I don't know a lot, but for some because it was such an epic one and you were fucking insane and it was so epic. That movie was bouncing around as a story for a while, right? Yeah, I had I was attached to it for about five, six years before, but no one would make it with me. No one. I'm making it again. My lack enough just putting up the money to do it. I'm going to pay for the money period. Period piece. Age drama with McConaughey in the lead. No, no, no, he's romcom shirtless guy. That doesn't make any sense. No way. Right. Right. Right. Because you were coming off of that. Yeah. In the back. Yeah. You were in that place. And by the way, as an actor, is that important? Like, are you sitting there and saying, fuck? I like it. If I don't show some other side, I'm romcom to the end. We'll check this out. And it's you'll see when you when you check out this part of the book and it's part of those affirmative ways to not to go into a pennant to get out the other time. I looked up and notice I'm romcom romantic comedy guy. And I'm owning this because I'm like, you damn right. Those romcoms are paying for the house that I'm renting on the beach that I'm going shirtless on. So, but I did notice, well, I want to do some other thing. No, no, no, no, you can't do that. And I noticed I was like, oh, the industry and the public are nothing other than romcom shirtless guy on the beach. That's when I went, okay. Well, if I can't do what I want to do, I got to quit doing what I've been doing. And I went off back down to Texas and hit out and called my agent and money people and everybody said, I'm not doing those anymore. 20 months, nothing. No, 20 months. I'm back. 20 months. And are, and are peeps getting antsy around you like, hey, motherfucker, do one. I call, no, I called it early on. I mean, I call, I believe I dropped, dropped, dropped tears to make the decision because I was like, I even thought about, I'm going to change careers. Now mind you this, I at that time, this is when Hollywood really got the message about six months into that sabbatical saying, I'm not doing those. An offer comes in for a script at eight million bucks. I said, no, thank you. They come back to 10 million. I say, no, thank you. They come back at 12.5 million. They come back at 14.5 million. I say, let me read that script again. I read the script, Gary. Guess what? And that was the exact same words as the original offer, but I read that script again and it was better written. It was. The 14.5 million dollars, well, better. The 14.5 million. You did it? I said, no. You said, no. Said, no. Was that. Wait, real quick for fun. I love this shit. Was that movie made? No. No. Did not make it. They did not make it. Hey, by the way, on that note, one of my other favorite things about Hollywood that I don't know the story is the way I know sports. Anything that you passed on that went on to slay and the actor fucking crushed any of the you have any of those in your. I got there. I was offered a role in LA confidential. And I don't remember if it was the. I don't remember the co-roller or the guy role, but I loved that movie. And that was a really good one. I was off timing. Was it money? Was it you weren't in? Like what? What did I have around the time when a time to kill was coming out? So all of a sudden I go from a weekend, I go from a Friday before time to kill comes out, which is the movie that came out that sort of I was the lead in it was a big studio film. The Friday before that comes out, I'm wanting to do any 100 100 of these scripts you're offering, but you're telling me Hollywood's telling me 99 times no one of them you can do. Well, Monday, 60 something hours later, it inverted 99 out of these hundreds. You can do. Yes. And so it was. It was that. It was that. Whoa. Wait a minute. I what am I supposed to do with all these yeses? How do I get some discernment and discrimination in these yeses? I don't I don't know. Three days ago, I would have done any of these. Now you're telling me I can do all of them. I need 24 hours in a day and they're not giving it. So I said I passed because I just wasn't sure. I wasn't sure a lot of stuff that at that time. So yeah, movie. Here's the thing with me on movies. I haven't. They. I've never done or been a part of a piece of art that actually met my expectations. Do you think you ideologically decided it will never happen? Because of the way the machine works? Like I kind of weirdly understand what you just said, which is why I'm going to where I'm going with this question. Do you believe that's because you were observant enough to understand the macro and thus immediately deemed it will never happen? No, I think I think we may be saying the same thing. What I'm saying is earlier when I said there's no such thing as a trophy. I think I don't ever. I've done look some things have been different and better than I thought they would be. But nothing has ever been nor has any performance I've ever done gone. Ah, perfection. Now, what about you? What about you watching someone else? You know, in the in the cocoon of the industry, because I'm sure your relationship with the industry ebbs and flows. It's like me with wine. But in it, in it, and when you were really observing, did you ever watch a performance that say and said, my Jesus, fuck, like what the fuck was that? Yeah, yeah. I mean, but really, really, really, there's those incredible performances. I know that. But like from your perspective, because it's subjective, curious, curious what hit your radar is like, fuck. Yeah. Um, you know, let me just say this. I like making movies more than I like watching them. Um, and I haven't even seen all the ones I've been in. And it's not because of any. I just, I just, we were talking earlier about that gap between what we want to do and what we actually get done. All right. There's a gap between what I want to do, what we do in a raw performance and what's actually getting recorded on the camera. Then there's a gap between what's recorded in the camera and what's. And then there's a gap to his editing. What's in the final picture? That's right. Tie back to you. Like what's different about the book door? What I, the example I just said is four filters away from the raw expression. Where is the this? This is one filter away because it's just, it's a written word. You and I right now is the filter list. Stand up comedy is the filter list. I love it so much. That's why even the way I give keynotes has nuances of it because it's the most fucking unfiltered. That's it. That's the nectar. That's the really straight one on one without a filter translation. Have you ever, have you ever cried when your favorite sports team lost a game? For real? No. What's the most pain you ever felt in a loss in sports? The most pain I ever felt in a loss. While you're thinking about it, a few seconds, I cried multiple times in like like six to 12 times a year in sports up until 22 years old and then just stopped. I cried when Garrison Hurst broke off a 98 yard run against Jetson overtime in 1998 in week one of the NFL season. And I think, and that was the last time, by the way, and I wonder if, if I realized somewhere in that moment that I'm 23 years old, it's a week one. It's a week one. Oh my God. You must be crying a lot. Oh man, it's real rough right now. But honestly, I, you know, it's funny that this might really strike you. I'm a huge sports fan. The Rangers in 94 and then the New York Rangers in 94 and the Yankees in 96 became my first two championships. You know, I started in 82 with all four teams and literally, literally the second they both won their championships, I basically have not watched a single game. I think I've watched a little bit here and I've never watched. I don't think I've watched a complete game of either team since their champion journey journey, all journey, all journey hurt, which, which is why that shit, you know, it's one thing to be like kind of passive after a championship. Most people double down after a championship completely like, and I don't say it was a badge of honor. I'm just fascinated by how real that is to me. Well, what's warm, you know, I think I understand what you're talking about. I mean, what's the trophy, the championship is the noun. It's static. It's got a period at the end of it. The verb, the, the, the, the, the getting to it is the verb. Oh, it's the bad, by the way, is well, you know, what's why? Why do you think I, why do you think I like the jet so much? It's so fun to be this shit. You may have, I'm the happiest. You got good job security with enjoying this jet. I mean, that's true. Talk to me about wine a little bit. I know that, you know, we've, through the years and talked about that, like, where are you in that journey? Like you like it. You know, obviously bourbon, you talk a lot about it. You love that. Like where do you, where do you sit with wine? If I'm, red guy, I'm, I'm intermediate guy. I've been introduced. I've got friends that know a whole lot more about wine than I do that turn me on to you. And you like a lot of others enjoy that six guy, 10 people together. Like that wine night is like a fun night for you. Like, yeah. Yeah. And like I said, I liked to, you know, I'm also a fan of, uh, little bourbon and some tequila as well. Um, but no, come on. In a, in a, in a finals match, bourbon versus tequila. Is it bourbon wins or tequila? Oh, I don't know. That one, that's a good one. I like that. You know, that other question you had meant to go. Please. 2010 University of Texas national championship game against Alabama. Yes. Our quarterback gets dinged, uh, on the goal line early in there, like the opening drive and he's out. We get beat. Ooh, we didn't have our starting quarterback for the rest of the game. What would have happened? That was a, that was a what if hurt. Ah, you know, so what about UT basketball? You have, have you ever historically gotten hardcore about that or is it only been football getting more hardcore? Yeah. Cause I'm, cause I'm getting to be a, a, a friends with our coach, Chuck smart. I've got to know some of the young men on the team and you're starting to get in more and we're building an arena, which I'm, which I'm part of culture. And over there, the new arena where they, where the men and women are going to play basketball. I love that. What about, um, startup culture? I know that, you know, a lot of my friends in startup culture have nice relationships with you, the Silicon Valley, the app culture. Like, where do you sit with technology? Um, I'm leaning and learning into it more now than I was for friends of our guy, oh, Siri, introducing me to things and, and, and learning a new vernacular is what I'm actually, you know, um, there are a lot of startups in Austin that I'm, um, some of them I'm reaching out to that I like their product. And they're in Austin and we could have some part and parcel partnership in between, in between the two of us and a business that I'm starting there in Austin with the ministry of culture work. Um, uh, so I'm learning more about it. Um, it's a flirting more in that arena. I'm definitely flirting more and understanding it. It's a new, and if I asked you entrepreneurial spirit, where do you sit today at 50, where you eliminate stand kid, did you hustle that way? Was it more art and storytelling? Has it grown? Like, I'm more entrepreneur now than I ever was at 50. And it's, it's part to go back to another word you mentioned, or it's legacy choices now. So what are the choices that I can, that I can create? Like this ministry of culture is a category that I actually, I assumed and created, um, a lot of people think it's political. I'm like, no, no, no, it's in the slipstream. It's, it's, it's about values and it's bipartisan and non-denominational. And it can still also be a business. Um, so at 50, I'm going, what choices can I make that I'm going to hand off to my kids and they can hand off to their kids. That's going to be my shadow that goes on. Um, you know, and I don't know if I'll do, I'll do more movies, but movies are capsized, they're little pieces of time. I'm trying to challenge myself to go, Hey, the big show is life. It's live. Uh, the recorder's always, but it's awesome that you like that you're, I think a lot of, I watch a lot of people in all arenas just kind of completely walk away from a thing that was the major stepping stone. I've always liked the idea of like, you know, I'll go back to movies. You know, to me, like I started a wine brand last year. I've sold it recently, but like I always kind of knew, even though I really needed to walk away from wine, cause it was all I did that, um, that I would come back to it, but at that time, you know, call it 2011 to 2019, I just didn't want to as much and like, you know, and, and even now I'm like, and I will again in 17 years or, you know, like, I think, I think, I think people close doors that are their, that are usually their first step, almost out of ideology or out of not realizing that, yeah, cool. You're burnt out now, but don't put a final nail in the coffin. You don't have any clue where you might be in a decade mentally about that thing. Right. Well, so like you just, you sold your wine, you were into it. It was, it was, it was a, it was a, it was an old obsession. You told it. Was that like the, your, your Yankees went in the championship that you put it away or is it you have it sitting? Actually that was a little bit, that was a little sweeter. I started only 18 months ago. So this is the winery, not my dad's wine store, which he still owns and operates my family business. I started a winery 18 months ago. That one has a much more warm feeling in my soul. I had two partners in that business, Nate Schroeder and John Troutman. They started as interns for me a decade ago. Okay. So the, the story of like, it just like the, the thought that the, the collateral of my skill set could put these two young men who I adore like younger brothers in a position that changes the course of their lives, at least financially, which is only a piece of it, but a piece of it was too romantic to say no when the opportunity came. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That drove me, that drove me remarkably in a very serious way. That's what drove that decision. Well, so that door is always open. That, that, that there's no final trophy on that. Cause those two young men, you're going to, you're going to enjoy watching where they go and how they do it. Even more fun back to leadership and coaching. I've got a thousand employees right now that I have at least 60 of my people in that ecosystem of like wanting to rep. So yeah, that, that there's nothing more fun than loving people. Loving people is a imperpatuity game of happiness. Like, you know, I, I often make jokes about not liking, liking animals. Cause A, I probably skew under most people with like dogs and other things, but it's, I really believe it's because of my love affair with humans. Like walking down the street, I have a warmth towards people and I really recognize that most people don't go there. Let's lean into this to where we are right now, where we're heading. All right. I got to ask this the other day, where do you lie on trust? My God. Hey, and I'm like, hadn't thought about it. Uh, and, and the person asked me and I said, look, I go into, I'm talking to you right now, you have a hundred percent of my trust until you don't. Same. You every, I don't think enough of us are looking at the world that way right now. I agree. I need your distrust and major disbelief and you come in with a hero until you earn it. I hate that shit. Every percent. I hate that shit. I hate that. Who the fuck are you? Why are you so fucking audacious? Who the fuck made you special enough that another human has to earn it? Fuck you. Where's your humility? I'm a hundred percent trust. As a matter of fact, I fight a lot of times. I'm, I need to work on myself to try like when trust is broken. I'm still trying to come up with empathetic scenarios for the other person. I would be very bad at baseball. I think I'm seven strikes and you're out like three strikes don't even fucking register for me. And that's something. Now, what that's done is also created a subconscious resentment that I've had to become as I continue to go through my process. I'm like, Oh, right. I think that it's seven strikes and you're out. But what's happening is with each strike, there's a little bit of like, you know, fluid going into that bucket of resentment. I might be able to eat it because I'm strong and I don't. But I'm building it. So I have to be more thoughtful of having candorous conversations with people I care about so I don't get there. Yeah. That's my tweet. I hear you. I don't, I can't allow seven strikes. That's a resilience. You're going, no, I can handle it. I can handle it. I can handle it. I really believe that. If someone does scar me, um, and on the, on the role of forgiveness and moving on. Man, if I see real, a real sense of retribution and on there and one guy, I bobed, I screwed up. I'm sorry. I'm very quick. I love you for that. I'm quicker than I forgive myself. Brother, I love you for that. And that leads to foundational happiness. It just does real quick. Cause I know you have to run. Yeah. Curious you and social media. Do you use anything? Do you have a burner accounts that say, McConaughey is actually awesome. Like, how do you, how do you, how do you roll with social? Like, which one? I started leaning in. I started, I started, um, Instagram, uh, just think about a year ago. Okay. And, you know, I've been flirting with the idea four years. Okay. Downs with me is I was going like, ah, the rabbit hole of that conversation. I've got three kids, man. I got a family. It's like, they're, you know, they offer me, they always come, come on, play fantasy football. I'm like, I don't need another hobby. I got, I really don't like it and I want to do it. And the whole Instagram thing, I was like, I'm afraid I'm going to like it a lot. And I'm going to do it too much. So I came out and I remember my opening at, look, it's going to be a monologue guys. Yes. It's a one way street. Well, I don't, I don't go, I don't want, I don't want to dive into late night looking at a comment on every single thing I said, because I'll feel it. Um, and I want to engage in it and give that a conversation. So I'm choosing about where I have the conversation. Nice work, Dustin. Um, do you find yourself following certain people or certain accounts and getting a little bit of like escapism value from it? Uh, a little bit. Or is it mainly, I'm in the mood to say something. Uh, and I'm going to just say it and it's a monologue and I'm out. It's mainly, I'm in the mood to share something. Hey, this is a pulse. I'm feeling, uh, out there in the world right now. This is a pulse I'm feeling in, in, in America or something that's going on in my life. I like to share this. I will then re-engage with certain people that I will follow or listen to, um, and check in with. But, but, but I don't have it. I'm not ready to have that in order to know if I ever will be to have that on my proverbial. Good morning. Now let me go sit down with my IG world because like I said, I got three kids and a wife and a job and I like my own solitude and I'd rather, I'd rather, as much as I can live here as I can. October 20th. Yep. That's the date. That's the date. Green lights. And that's the idea, man. Let's, how can we create more than for ourselves and others? As you said, be selfish and selfless at the same time. Those are not contradictions. What we can make the choice is that are best for the I that are also best for the we. The second you get best for the I, your ability to be a champion of we exponentially grows. Boom. Boom. And where, where are we misinformed on that? I don't know where along the way people. Missing things. There's so many. You listen. It, this is why communication videos, books, monologues or somebody like me that posts and spends eight hours engaging like this is why we need all different versions. One sentence in that book can change the way someone looks at it. VaynerNation, I know that I have a lot of pride in this. I, a lot of my friends are just people that have randomly emailed me. The book PR community very much knows this has been a show that is a substantial driver and it's because you're curious. And I think if you, if you re-listen the first 10 minutes, clearly if you're getting value out of me, it's, I have some serious confidence that you're going to get value out of this book. So green lights, October 20th. Make sure you pick it up. McConaughey, thank you so fucking much for being on the show. I enjoyed it. Gary, look forward to the next time. But can't wait. Take care of yourself. But hey, everybody on YouTube. First of all, thank you so much. So humbled for your time. I don't want to watch, but time is the biggest asset. So thank you for watching that video. If, if you got some value out of that, there's plenty more where that came from. Feel free to check it out.
