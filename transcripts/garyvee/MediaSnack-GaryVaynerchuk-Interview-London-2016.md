## Transcript
It's now episode 17. So this week we're doing a special, the legendary Gary Vaynerchuk has dropped in to say hello. Hello. And what brings you to London, Gary? So I'm on my book tour. I have a book called Ask Gary Vee. So I'm on tour. We're on the verge of officially opening our London office. So I'm with Eric and Rice and the crew. So taking business meetings. Today's really all business kind of day and then tomorrow I have a book event yesterday I was in Dublin and off to Los Angeles, which is a nice little schlep from London on Thursday morning. So just coming through. Have you just been at South by Southwest as well? Yep. Just gave a keynote at South by Southwest. That was a lot of fun. When are you going home? One day. One day. One day when it's all over. I'll be home Saturday morning, actually Miami, but you know, so I'm with the family. Yeah, so the family. Yes. Good. So I was in New York a couple of weeks ago as we talked about on the last episode and I had the opportunity to go in and meet the team. And so they explained to me, I'd heard of Vayner. Yep. In the US. I think people understood it as a social shock when you started out. Yes, 100%. But I was really impressed with the team that I met there and obviously the London team that you've got here because the scope has broadened a lot. Yes. And so what is a proposition to London then as an agency? What are you bringing here? You know, I think, you know, in our core we're reverse engineers who care about attention and then trying to tell the proper story to create a result once you have that attention. Yeah. So, you know, I think currently, and you could see with the kind of body language that I bring to this statement currently we're positioned as a social first digital shop. I mean, at the end of the day, we want to execute strategies and creative execution and paid amplification in places that we think actually help whomever we work with, whether that's a nonprofit trying to raise money, whether that's a sporting team trying to sell tickets, whether that's a, you know, beverage trying to sell in vending machines and C stores in Tesco. We want to help people spend their money in a place that we think is a valuable place to spend their money. And there are so many places that we think clients are spending that are not as valuable. Whether that be programmatic banner, whether that be television, we think that there's some places that- Is that just instinctively or are you analyzing? It's instinctively at first. And then it's normally proven through actual sales. You know, I come from a retail background. So, as I've gotten into the agency and creative world, I've found that I have a very big advantage because my instincts are to actually sell something. And that helps versus headlines and awards and reporting. Yeah. And just basic media metrics. You know, just buying range of coverage and pricing and things like that. So you're challenging- People are obsessed with WIF. We don't debate the quality of an impression. And so, yeah, I mean, as I've become educated over the last seven years, but more specifically the last five on what we're doing here, but you know, who those characters are, Ogilvy's, these kind of names. I've become fascinated by the lack of practicality and practitionership in the collective agency and client side. Now, by the way, there's plenty of things that people do. For example, I believe in real life activations. I believe if done right, it's incredible to activate at Bonnaroo or Coachella or the World Cup. I think there's a lot of places to get attention, not just digital. And I think the places I'm obsessed with, whether it's Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat, in five years, will be disrupted as well. But I like day trading attention. I like doing it for the moment. When Seinfeld's the number one show on television, you buy commercials on it. So I don't care where Snapchat or Instagram are going. I care that they're underpriced right now. And we referred in last week's episode to you as being, as I was saying earlier, as being part of this disruption. Is that something you're very conscious of? Are you talking about the needs and the desire for VaynerMedia to be disruptive? Because it is gonna disrupt the traditional agency model. Like you're growing phenomenally fast and expanding internationally. Yeah, I think when people, I mean look, I'm thankful that I was smiling when you said you had heard of us in the US. I was thankful because outside of a couple of adage references, I've been very quiet. I don't think people really realize the scope of what 650 employees and $100 million revenue, and run rate business, we're a big company now. And much bigger than most people in advertising world think of us or know us as. You know, I've said this a lot. I don't think I'm disruptive. I actually think I'm practical. I think the market is disruptive. I think when you're, for example, we have a lot of clients, and you may as well and others do, that try to sell to people that are under 25 years old. I think running television commercials is disruptive for a 22 year old to buy your bubble gum or your sneakers. So I think I'm quite practical. I recognize why people think we're disruptive. I do think that we have the potential to change the conversation. I do think that we are not passionate about media metrics or awards or headlines the way a lot of our contemporaries are. I have empathy for why people have been because that's how they get business. That's not how we get business. And we get business in a very funny way. We get business because I get us business from my history of selling stuff and people knowing it intimately, not what they read in Fast Company. And then our results. When we grow sour patches business through the roof, when we grow a lot of our ABI clients business, when we actually grow our business, most of my business right now is word of mouth of brand managers and CMOs going to other places and desperately wanting to bring us along because we did something. Yeah. And I asked this question to Eric and Jeff and the team in New York. Are they, are the big agencies reacting in a bad way to that? Because you must be stealing, I asked them, like, where are you taking scope from? They reacted. I still think that the big agencies, as you refer to them, are putting us in two buckets. One, oh, that's just little social. It doesn't mean anything. And oh, that's just Gary. He's one of these bullshit gurus and there's probably a bunch of interns that he's paying no money to. They just don't look under the hood. In the same way that they read headlines on PR week and make their assumptions on Snapchat and Facebook, I think they're doing the same thing with VaynerMedia. And that's a nice way to operate. I'd rather be like that. I mean, look, that's the market. Underestimated. Oh. Then you can over deliver to the actual clients. If you go look and it's fun to have Rebecca here who handles our comms, if you go look at how much has been communicated about me as a human versus the agency in the last 24 months, it's 90% me. I'm surprised because you're so shy. And you know, it's funny. One could say it's narcissistic, it's ego, it's things of that nature. To me, it's been quite calculated. Like I've enjoyed people being naive and underestimating what we're doing to the market. I have no problem surprising people. Look, if they've been respecting it or if they've been naive to it, it would have been regardless because we're gonna execute. We know how to sell stuff. And at the end of the day, the Unilevers and the Proctors and the Cokes and the Pepsi's and the BMW's, they care about selling at the end of the day. Somewhere. Maybe not your brand manager. Maybe not the CMO that needs a headline to get the next CMO job. But somewhere. Somewhere. Somebody cares. And the ironic thing is usually somebody that's important. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Okay, so Vayner coming in July. Yes. You were at the ANA Masters of Media. I was. So I hear first off that you scored the highest of all presenters. Is that true? That makes sense. I'm a big time speaker. I also heard that you asked me for a fee and they said no. That's true. I don't like to speak for free. But. Promised my wife. It went down very well. So that was a new thing. Was it going to speak to the marketers at that kind of platform? I'm starting to cut, look, I'm doing this show. I'm starting to come out into this world and it's going well because honestly, look, and I already recognize I'm self aware. When you come with, I'm very competitive. Let's start with that. And so that's gonna come through on a speech or in video right now. Like yes, I wanna beat your agency. That's real. I'm sorry. But I don't wanna do it at your expense. I want anybody who's good to win. I really do. I love meritocracy. I love capitalism. I like the market. I think it's coming across well because I'm speaking the truth. Meaning in the same way that I'll be the first person, as I am now, who's saying Twitter's broken. Twitter's a problem. Don't spend money on Twitter. After, if I was sitting here in 36 months, Twitter would be the only thing out of my mouth. I think that I have enough of a track record now that people are starting to realize that what I'm obsessed with is being historically correct, not where I'm making my money at the moment. Like, you know, I invested a lot of money into Meerkat. I mean, I heard a word from me about Meerkat for the last year. You know why? Because it's not gonna win. Like, I'm not pushing agenda. I'm pushing conversation that benefits us all. If marketing was better, if media planning wasn't so broad, if all of us tried to sell more products, a lot of us would do better. The industry would be in a better place. And so, I want everybody to win. Do I wanna build the biggest building in town? Yes. How do I wanna do that? By building the biggest building. Not by tearing everybody's building down. So I think what I did in that meeting was I said, look, you're acting one way as a human, which means you're not looking at commercials. You're not clicking banner ads. But you're marketing all your money in a different way. And you're doing that because the whole machine is built on that. And I thought it went well, and it was interesting, because you know, when you give that talk, the first 15 minutes is awkward. When you go into a room and say, look, I think. Because you're not the kind of person normally they get to see it. Because it's relatively conservative, isn't it? As an environment. You know better than I do. You know, I'm just starting to, I mean, I think everything's conservative. So probably. Yeah, I mean, look, look, there's not a lot of people in Madison Avenue today that had the narrative that I had, which was I first built a $65 million business on the backbone of what was considered radical marketing. E-com in 96, email marketing in 97, Google AdWords the day it started. A YouTube show a couple months after YouTube came out. My career is built on what I sell. So most people come up through the world. They become a great account person or a great creative. They team up with a partner and they start a shop. I came from such a different angle, and I've got such a different point of view that it's going well, and it's got its pluses, it's got its minuses, but we're talking along. One of the, I wasn't able to come to that. I'm going to the next A&A conference in a month or so. One of the areas that the A&A are really focusing on, as you may or may not be aware, and they've commissioned an external company to do an assessment of the potential media rebate market in the US. Right, there was a guy who gave a talk. At that conference the previous year at John Vendell. Right, who really caused some ruffles. I saw those headlines. That makes sense to me. And the A&A then created a task force to look into that, and then they've hired K2 Intelligence in New York, which is this. Let me save everybody a lot of time. Yeah. Like, who doesn't know that that's going on? I don't even know the industry, and I knew that was going on. Not because I knew that was going on in this industry, it's what goes on in every industry. I come from a liquor business. It goes on there. Anytime there's big dollars being rewarded on a human to human level, the human that's deciding big dollars is getting rewarded by the human that's trying to get them in many forms. Bottles of Dom P, getting their kid into Harvard, taking them to the Super Bowl. What is, of course. Because that's just incentivizing. It's human beings. It's in human beings now when you've got only three or four big holding companies that drive everything, it becomes even more intense. So you can see it, obviously, as you say, like across industry, it's the liquor business. But now you're in the media business. Can you rub up against that? We're still small. You know, like, I think- You create a policy at a principle that- 100%. There's none of, I mean, that is, there's, I am a meritocratist even at my own expense. The end. Yep. Okay. The end. If we're gonna lose a media pitch because, I'll use different letters, the XYZ agency girl takes the decision maker to the strip club, then I'd rather lose the business. Yep. I don't know. I mean, that's, that, when you're better, you don't have to play that game. Well, that's good. And that's what I liked about the narrative that we were hearing from the agency when we went to New York. I hope you continue that in Europe. That's a slightly different market. Is there any nuance to the European market? I mean, look, I mean, there's the cliche stereotypes that, you know, that I'm to US, even for US, so the personality may rub some people the wrong way. Here's what I know. Look, I was born in Eastern Europe. I grew up in the wine business. I've spent an enormous amount of time in Italy and France and other parts of the world. People are people, meaning like, I don't think, yes, do I think there's some cultural differences? Of course. But do I think the decision maker at Unilever UK Market or Toyota UK Market or Nestle UK Market doesn't want to do, deep, deep down, doesn't want to do the right thing for their business because maybe it was too aggressive? Well, that's fine. I mean, like, they all know it. They all, I mean, they all really know it. If we lose on something that shouldn't be important, then that's fine by us. So, look, I think every market, marketing, is a tactic to help a transaction happen. We do that extremely well. And I think that it's gonna go over extremely well in this market. I'll tell you what really is most fascinating to me about the London and general kind of Western Europe market. There's a stunning lack of respect for how well modern digital is doing in this market. When you look at the metrics of Instagram and Facebook and Snapchat in the UK market, it's like kind of weirdly more exciting than the US market. I mean, the penetration is at full scale. The behavior is quite aged up. I think there's some real big opportunities. I do, I think because the US has so many of the startups start there, there's also that six to 12 month pause. You know, London's an incredible market, so maybe it's a three to six month pause, but look, I day trade. So I'm fast in the US. Having an extra six or 12 months for a UK market or a Dublin market or a Berlin market is really attractive for me. Yeah, good. So, finally, before you go. Yes. The other thing you're legendary for is to be, is being a Jets fan. We did, back in beginning February, we did a Super Bowl special in here. And bear in mind, you've met David and I, and we know nothing about American football. Yes. And we made some terribly bad predictions at the time. If you look at the episode, I don't know if you saw it, but we had a Jets shirt, which was a small homage to you. Thank you. Thank you for the inspiration for this show. By the way, I had an amazing trip here. You know, the Jets played here this last season. And Wembley, which I had an amazing time. I came best. Good. So we've got, so what do you know about football? European English Premier? No, just football. American or football? Your stuff? Yeah. Not that much. I mean, I watched the World Cup aggressively. It's amazing. The English Premier League has gotten a lot of play in the U.S. over the last 36 months. You know, I always say that I should've never left Europe because I'm a crazy Jets fan. Like, my respect level for European football, proper football fans is much higher. Like, I like that people potentially can die in the stands. Like, this is something I respect as a fan. So what do I know? I know that, I know more than I did 24 months ago, but I don't know a whole lot. But I know that a lot of American businessmen are trying to buy teams. I know that a lot more kids are running around the U.S. with messy jerseys and things of that nature, which I know is more Spanish stuff. And you've got Miami franchise. That comes from Miami franchise kicking off, I guess. It's kind of a disproves football. And one of my business partners runs the ICC, which is a soccer tournament that has English Premier League toward the U.S. So I'm a little dangerous. So we've got to, the one thing I wanted to ask you was just to make some predictions. Cause we made some terrible, Oh good, let's do it. Let's do it. So this we can. Yes. Our international games. So we don't have league games this, but we have some internationals. So we have a big rivalry, as you probably know, between Germany and England. Yes, of course. Okay. So we've got a couple of World Wars, you know, no big deal. It's still a lot, there's still a lot going on there. There should be. So Germany, England. That's intense shit. What do you reckon? What do you reckon? Germany. I think Germany will win. Give me a score. Two to one. Two to one. Okay. We'll hold you to that. And I'm just going to look up actually, cause Belarus will be like. That was tough to say. You know, talk about wanting to be historical. That was harder for me to tell than to tell an entire room of marketers that they're all crooks, that they're all full of shit. That was harder to say. Two to one, Germany. I'm sorry. And then the other one, that makes me sad. I was going to ask you. I'll be rooting for England. And that is not even close by the way. Belarus. Belarus will lose. Belarus. In everything since it's the last dictatorship. Away Armenia. Armenia is going to win six nothing. You reckon? I reckon only, you know Belarus is the last dictatorship in all of Europe. Really? Unless you want to count Russia. Yeah. Yeah. That is Russia. I'm for you. Yeah. So thank you for that. Good luck. Good luck. Best of luck with the book. I think we might see you tomorrow night at the lodge. Oh, it'll be awesome. Thank you. Good luck with the agency. Thanks for having me. Cheers. Cheers. All right, great. It's going to be tough to open up a Russia office after that kind of comment. What do you want to do? That's it? Oh, that's it. No, that's fine. That's it for this week. That's it for this week? No, it's too early. No worries. Do your thing. Okay, that's it for this week. Thank you for watching. Please subscribe to the channel. And have a great weekend.
