Hey vlog, did you capture that footage? Whenever you capture, just run it. Vlog, I just tore my ACL, I think. ["The Biggest Book I Wrote"] So, but yeah, it's the fifth book. I'm excited about it. The first crush it was, the biggest book I wrote. Because it's the first one. So this is the follow up to it. After the windboat. Yeah, exactly. This is the follow up to it. And it's just super relevant. Like, it's basically like the first several, the first kind of part of it. Part one is like, just complete mindset. Like, fuck man, like, do you understand that if you have $413,000 in college debt, like, come from alcoholic parents and like, work at like, Saks Fifth Avenue, that's still, still at 730 when you get home from your fucking hour and a half commute. Still, you can take your fucking phone out and do damage for five hours. And over the course of six years, turn around that ridiculously impossible narrative that you're stuck in. The fact that that's true is batshit crazy. When I wrote the first one, people were like, what, go on YouTube, make a living? Wait, what, be the king of honey? I'm gonna make 90,000 a year instead of making 72. Like, I think you and I are anomalies. I do not think that somebody in Cincinnati right now who makes 47K working retail can't make 51 being the biggest expert on Star Trek. Like, I don't think people understand the long tail. Like, that's a big fucking deal. The variable difference of happiness, of making 81K in upper management and something that makes you miserable versus making 64 talking about whiffable all day is a big deal. To me, it's just about happiness. And I just think that a lot of people don't realize how much they know about a very narrow niche that also has a ton of other people that are into it. And if they understand how to use Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and podcasting, like, they just can't understand how much money there is. Yeah. Well, let's see what happens next. So, for those of you who know How즈 now, just click here. You can watch our big video where you get to know how XE is going with an Instagram account. You can find thoseutable examples in the front function or audience section that you can watch Instagram. Or you can watch how XE client today goes freelancing first off. What about Samsung's home- Directonder center? They peddled that they're in for multi-:「 Motion to a viewing style ! » So we're now heading upstairs to a meeting. It's always fun when you have a client or potential client within your own building. I think I need to kind of figure out that world I wanted to go into is so huge and it's getting really cluttered and it's getting really like, inauthentic. Can I give you a quick piece of advice? Please. Every world is like that. Yeah. Don't let that cripple you. Yeah. And go narrow to what makes you pop. Right. Motivational speakers are my most hated people. Yet. By other people? I hate them. Yet I get categorized in that world all the time. Right. But I'm not crippled because I know that I'm not trying to do the wrong thing. Right. Right. Or you're not trying to do whatever. The wrong thing. This is buying, forget about that. Yeah. If you don't ever look for the white space, it doesn't exist. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Just like make it. Do what the fuck you know. Like if you know yoga. Right. Yoga's plenty fucking cataclysm. You know? Yeah. Being the cream rises to the top business, not in the I'm gonna see something nobody else sees business. So all the people that are doing the wrong thing, crowded, not authentic, it just has nothing to do with you. I'm not crippled by other agencies sucking at giving a fuck about people. Yeah. And if you were, you wouldn't be where you are. That's the thing you need to do. Well, a lot of people are like, you know what you're doing? It's like, you know, it's kind of risky. And I'm like, I don't know. Risky for what? I just don't believe in this whole notion of like, okay, you graduate, then you work. You can pick up back from, come back, work here. You're the same spot. Yeah. I also just don't think. I actually think it's the other way's risky. Me too, because I think it's really easy to become complacent. And I don't know. I don't think it's deviating from a path because I don't think that there is a path. There's way too much respect for anybody who thinks what you're doing is risky. Yeah. I mean, I've literally gotten that response from like one person, but like my family is like, yes, 100%. It's awesome. And they're so. And the person that's saying that is, you know, respects a certain narrative and that's awesome too. And that's great for them. It may be great for them forever. Yeah, maybe. Going with Ryan Harwood right here, CEO of PureWow. Very smart and handsome. Going to see a potential client for PureWow. VaynerX, baby. Let's rock it. Alex, I'm sending an email to the company asking who's an Eagles fan. And they're gonna email you that they're an Eagles fan, put it in a folder, okay? Matt, how can he say an Eagle fan? Just, yeah. It's the best email. If you're a real Philadelphia Eagles fan and work at VaynerMedia, please email Alexandria, that you are. Please email Alexandria Acheb. She's CC'd here. And then the body, don't lie. Sent. I love everybody to be like, what about? Patriot fans. Not sending any fucking Patriot fans to Super Bowl, but four Eagle fans from VaynerMedia are going. Andy, placing some ads, getting back to your roots and doing something. Of course. I'm a freaking stranger. You wanna give me a copy of IG copy for the crushing it video signing? Start in book and then in the closer. Start in book and then in the closer. I don't even know what I'm doing. I'm like, what is this machine? Known as the computer. That's simple. There. My guy. How you doing, man? I've been looking forward to this, man. I've been looking forward to it. What's up, man? Number one in LA. I fuck with you, heavy as fuck. I'm putting, I think you guys know. I'm putting you on black. I'm on the record of who I think is next and it's you. Because I have that, I know my ear, which is like, I don't think I'm anything. I don't even like to talk to music people about music, but I know me and I know, I just know. Kind of honestly, I'm a very serious no man. I really, really, really think you've got the absolute exact right thing for what's about to happen. I just think you need to, my big thing is collaborations and volume. Like you guys do you, that's always my thing. Like to me, I just want you to do more shit. Like, artists always, it's always tricky with my advice to artists, because I want more volume and artists can run, they don't want to dilute it, they want it to be like, I have empathy, but I know it's right. Because here's what people don't understand with volume. They remember the hits, they forget the other shit. You don't have the potential to suck. You understand that, right? Like if I was like, hey, do you understand what I mean? Like if I was like, yo, you have to put out a hundred songs in a row, your weakest one of those hundred, in my opinion, isn't gonna be weak enough to fuck you up. And the upside of a hundred fucking at bats, I believe in that shit. And then collaborations, like, fuck, I think I was just listening to one of yours for a fucking week just now, let me see. This would be great. Yep, this is literally what I'm listening to. Yeah, like right, like this, like, as many of those as possible. I can't say it enough, man, it's just how music, like you guys are in it and you know it better than me. I just know what humans do. That's why I'm gonna do my thing. It's just at bats, people don't get it. It's just tomorrow's song that changes everything. I think people will wanna know, all this music is so personal and so motivational. I get, that's why I like it. That's why you like it. That's why I like Russ because he's competitive and chip on the shoulder. Like it's all based on versions of my own personality. You're talking truth. And you're not scared to go into territories that don't look the part. That's it? And not. And then like, I'd be speaking like third person. I got a song called Money Don't Change You on CD3. And it's like, I hope the money don't change you and I'm talking to like nobody else but myself. You know what's funny about that? One of my favorite things I say ever, and I say a lot of shit, is money doesn't change you, it just exposes you. I said this to Chris, I'm not like a real music guy. The reason I fuck with you is what you're saying. I like the story. I like that you're going to places that I think are vulnerable and truth because that guy and that girl will always win. That's what people wanna stand about, Pock and Biggie. Go, actually go back and listen to Pock and Biggie. They were talking about, you guys are youngsters, you don't understand. Brenna's got a baby, that was ridiculous. Like that was shit, like Biggie. That made people crack. Like, and just like storytelling, right? Like Biggie's funny. Like I got a story to tell you, it was funny. Like that was different. This was when hip hop was like, I'm hardcore, like I'm tough and you're not simple. Binary, there was no other story. So they're vulnerable, like people don't get why. They broke out for a million reasons, but nobody, I mean I watch every documentary, I read everything and I'm waiting for somebody to say, those guys broke out, they say storytellers, they'll compare them to KRS One and things like that's fine. It's the vulnerability. My advice, go into cocoon. Meaning like go out, do live like, but like mentally, be in a cocoon. Like anything that veers you from completely dominating, be out. You can go out every night. But don't get caught up in anything that veers, like you need to be obsessed. Cause gifts are fucking rare man. My guy. Yeah man, I'm really rooting for you. Good to see you. Neil, pleasure man. Good to see you bro. Don't ever wear that jersey again. All right let's go. Okay. I love it, thank you. See ya. Yeah. Oh my God I feel so good. Hey vlog, did you capture that footage? Whenever you capture just run it. Vlog I just tore my ACL I think. The elevator just destroyed my knee. But that's what you have to do when you fucking hustle. Stick your leg in the elevator to save that 28 seconds. It might count.
