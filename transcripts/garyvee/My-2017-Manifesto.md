Sitting here listening to my music list and I'm starting to find a little clarity Starting to understand why this thing is so hard This game of entrepreneurship shit this game of life It's because the real answer is really found when you're pulling from opposite directions Sitting here laying saying why why why am I so blessed? Why is all this good stuff happening? And it's because I'm a contradiction Because I'm I've got this funny checks position where I'm pulling from opposite directions I don't give a fuck what any of you think about me yet I'll read every comment and I'll listen to everything all of you say about me because I listen I talk a fuckload I'm always talking. I'm cutting people off. I'm talking, but I'm listening. I'm listening 24-7 I'm always patient. I'm playing the long game, but I'm always quitting things every day Try and testing not crippled by stop and starting. How do I figure that out? How do I understand when it's time to give up on something or when it's time to persevere? But how do I understand and how do I feel and how do I decide? When to listen to somebody's feedback or to know when they're trolling or don't give a fuck or only certain same service level How how is this happening? How am I working 24-7? 365 yet. It doesn't feel like I'm working how am I always? Constantly putting out content and building my brand yet never thinking about it and just living my life how my Document it instead of creating. Where is this? Where is this Zen coming from? Where is this call to action coming from? Why is this plan working so well and how how do I get all you youngsters? And when I say youngsters, I mean the 59 year old who hasn't grown up yet Who hasn't been willing to look at the world and it comes from this It comes from the most macro. It's clear enough for me. I'm starting to see it It's understanding that nobody gives a fuck and that that's okay. And that's the way it should be I live on empathy. You shouldn't give a fuck. You've got you to worry about. I'm empathetic to that That's the game and we're all dealt with different cards. We've all got strengths and weaknesses We've got the advantages and the disadvantages Plenty see white privilege. So do I I see privilege in being from the streets and having zero and being hungrier There's so many different ways and of course some are better than others at the most macro But I don't even spend the time to figure that out because by the time you figure out if it was fair You're fucking finished and so instead of doing that I do and I do and I do and I'm always planning and I'm not planning And I've always got a game plan and strategy and I've always not got one I'm just going off the hip from intuition from learn behavior from pattern recognition because I've been doing this from the get When I was 12 13 14 15 I knew I did it's why I got those shit grades Shout out to everybody who saw that report card on Instagram You know, it's what I do and so as I sit here lay and look and think and debate Look out at the auction and listen to this music. It's becoming clearer 2017 gonna be a great year not just for me but for you because as I find clarity I'm gonna suffocate negativity I'm gonna suffocate excuses if you're gonna be in my community You're gonna give up and leave if you want to believe in those things because I'm gonna pound it push it press it Harder than I ever had before because the truth is I'm thankful. I'm grateful. I'm working on myself 24-7 my goals my ambitions and I'm working on your goals and your ambitions 24-7 That's pulling from opposite directions. That's what I do That's what I do harder stronger better than anybody honey empire bitches build the biggest building of all time The biggest best business of all time like a fucking tortoise like a slow fucking tortoise Chip away every day Underestimated all along the way got my fans who are delusional I got the rest of the majority of the market that doesn't think I can get it That doesn't see the behavior because they're thinking 2017.
