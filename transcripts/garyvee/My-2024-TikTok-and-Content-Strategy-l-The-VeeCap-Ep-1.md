## Transcript
Vlog, what is up? We are rebranding DailyVee and WeeklyVee. We finally have a real concept. We call it the V-CAP. We're basically gonna film, but as you know, I'm in 10, 15 hour meetings in my office these days on V-Friends and VaynerX. Obviously, it's not the most interesting shit for the entrepreneurs out there, but when we do have compelling stuff, we're gonna put out that vlog and we're gonna get the V-CAP, the recap of Since You Last Saw Me. So sometimes episodes are gonna come out day by day because they're interesting. It could be like four weeks later, it'll be a V-CAP. I don't wanna do four weeks later. Let's keep it at least every five, seven, 10 days. And we'll just continue from where I was to where I am. So excited about the new brand, the V-CAP. Hope you're enjoying it. It's been a busy day, a bunch of internal VaynerMedia and V-Friends meetings. A lot on the V-Friends collectible side and some new technology for the NFL stuff. Gary Vee Audio Experience with Guy Cowzatzki making his book, finance meeting, hangout hawks. Cock, cock, cock, cock. WineTexTV launched episode one. That was so fun, just so nostalgic, emotional with Brandon here. Also, I'm live on Twitch all the time. Twitch.tv slash GaryVee or GaryVee.com slash Twitch. Come and hang and we'll be talking. Watch what happens, this is actually literally happening. I believe that this is the conversation we need to be having for my TikTok. For my TikTok to become much more native, I think it's green screening and duetting, things that are happening, cause that stuff works. The way I'm gonna win TikTok is shows, overrated, underrated, WineTexTV and what we're talking about now. I'm relaunching Wine Labry TV today. Oh my God. I'm doing WineTexTV. The point of WineTexTV is like, if you knew what Fallen Gina and Bordicchio and all these epic Italian white wines that people don't know what America were, there's 999 versions of those wines. Do you gonna text me then, those three? I might? Yeah. We started late here, don't take away their time. Go ahead. Today is the 18th anniversary of my first episode of Wine Library TV. And I did that show every day for five years. We didn't have this instant wealth, instant fame ecosystem. Literally a kid today will post something and overnight amass 100,000 followers and start on a journey of being known and that level of speed. And it's kind of like people that win lottery tickets, they lose all their money. There's less obsession with building something sustainable. People are no question struggling with being patient. All right, TikTok. 4 p.m. I'm going live on every platform. I got a big announcement. I'm doing something pretty rad. I am on Twitch Live every day. Come work with me. It's like ASMR for entrepreneurs where we work together during the whole day. There's Dustin, he helps us through this. Get over here and join 130 people that are over here. There's 511 of you here. What's up all of you? There we go. A bunch of people are buying gifted subs. Balzi 3301 is in the building. Giving out subs. Get your S's over here. I will see y'all later. All right, Twitch. I am now on with the hangout hawks from VFRIENDS. Go to OpenSea or Blur or your favorite place. I'm gonna have to mute this. This is one-on-one with just the hawks. But if you get a hangout hawk, you can join it. Love you, see ya. 4 p.m., don't forget. GBR Sun is 5 this year. We don't wanna put it into the system, but we also don't wanna homeschool in full time. What might your approach be? Parenting is a very individual game. I think the real answer to life is self-esteem versus insecurity. Many people have done extremely well because of homeschooling. Many have not. Many have done very well in the standard school system. Many have not. There is no clear cut. This is what works. The only thing that is clear to me of what has worked is the parents who've been obsessed with trying to understand a child's confidence to insecure ratio. I don't know if I'm gonna build a YouTube White Text TV or if I'm gonna put on Gary Vee, but what I definitely know is we're gonna make a three or four minute version of White Text TV for social. Okay. Horizontal, horizontal for TikTok and Instagram. Because it's coming. This is my horizontal play. Here we go. I'm really excited to be doing this show. And it's a very special show because 18 years ago today, I started my internet journey. It was the first time I ever made a piece of content for the internet ever. We went out and found two models of the three models that were on the first episode of Wine Library TV. I literally tasted these exact wines, these exact vintages, the Verte 2001s. Thank you for the opportunity to be back. And I hope I see you soon. Thank you, love you. Have a great day. Fuck. All right. Awesome. Thanks. You have the right to ask me to call. Ha ha ha ha. Thanks, guys. Great job. Thanks, man. Great, great, great job. You're welcome. Thank you. Yeah. Very impressive battery. Very professional. Very professional. Thanks, man. Love you. What a day. How did everybody like Wine Text TV? Would love to know. Let me know what you thought. I'm ready for... Yeah, cool. Honestly, the reason I hit you guys up is like my favorite thing in the world is to see the obvious to me. I am deeply enjoying this in the meta because I know I'm literally gonna watch this in 36 months and be like, these fuckers were in the office. Like, it's so insane to see what you guys are up to. When there are things to celebrate, we don't take for granted the journey that got us here. And it was very sort of like special to see your message. You worded it in such a beautiful way. Like, you didn't say anything like, bullshit, you were just like, we see you, keep going. And we're gonna take that with us. You don't even know how flattering this. Let's take a quick photo. Yeah, please. I'd love to have it. Vlog, what is up? Let me give you the 401-1. About to go to dinner with a fashion client. Then I have a buffer. Then I have a meeting with the new head of retail media. Kind of running ads at Walmart and all that stuff. He's up from Atlanta. Big Vayner X hire for us. Huge for that world. Then there's a 10 minute buffer. Then a drinks with my own old friend, Bonn and Bao, and somebody's bringing along. So that's how this is ending. Also, if you wanna ASMR with us day to day, I live on Twitch all the time. Come and hang. I am mute, we talk. It's kind of cool. Just like this. Watch this, watch what happens. This actually literally happens. All right, Twitch. You're in the vlog. And I'm going to give you a free card right here on the spot. This is the versatile Viking. It's a badass character in a 10. And I'm gonna give this to Terry Hesticle, second. Terry Hesticle, second. Who else do you think of it? You're gonna give it to Terry Hesticles. You got some Terry Hesticles in the house.
