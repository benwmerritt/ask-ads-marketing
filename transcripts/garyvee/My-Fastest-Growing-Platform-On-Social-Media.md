## Transcript
The reality is using social networks to drive awareness really works because it's free. Maybe you wanna start doing TikTok live, because TikTok live is growing. LinkedIn I think is a great place for you brother. Starting a podcast and having people on it. Building awareness and brand is by getting in front of people. Attention is the number one asset. How about we start with some Discord questions? Does that sound good? That sounds amazing, but first can I just say hi to everybody? Everybody tell me where you're at. At work. Where you're physically at. Aiden, great to see you. Laptop Laura, always amazing. We've gotta start with the call. Do it with me, Jacqueline. I mean like, of course, so here we go. One, two, three. Call! Call! There you go, Dust. Dust is in the mix. All right, Hangout Hawks. Hey Twitch, we're on the Hangout Hawk now. This is exclusive for them, so I'm gonna have to mute you, but I love you. All right, what are we doing? We're gonna get started with some of our favorite Discord questions. We gathered from last week and this week. All right, so Manny1027 asks, question on your back end development of Rezi. I am working on a similar concept but creating loyalty slash reward programs for B2B customers who need help. Within the B2B space, there is so much integration that needs to happen with CRM, CPQ, marketing sales, to et cetera. So, okay, he's building something like Rezi on the back end. So, he basically asked, what tools, types of development teams did you leverage to help integrate Rezi with the many different systems and tools you would encounter with the target customer? We built, we had a 35 person tech team and built custom tech to work with the APIs of every single POS product in every restaurant. It was hand to hand combat. Like when you're innovating and you've got different systems around the world for something as fragmented as the restaurant industry, we had to build an API and custom tech to work with the leaders of all the different softwares and SaaS companies and POS and it was a nightmare. It was also a decade ago. So, it's been a while now, but yeah, I mean, that's what you have to do. Right, great, thank you. Our next question is from Aiden, ADV. At my agency, we leverage AI for content writing ideas and concepts. I just discovered that a couple employees are using it to completely fulfill their work, SEO rich blog articles. They're being paid a full-time salary and quietly completing output in roughly an hour a day while padding hours. I've had a suspicion of this and have asked several times. Each time I was told the only use for it is ideation. Regardless of whether AI content for this type of cast is good or bad, how would you handle this situation? PS, yes, we're building systems to spot these types of KPIs early. You know, I think that's a fireable offense. You know, if you're, you know, don't forget, they've also put Aiden's agency in a vulnerable spot. Right. You know, I mean, when people are lying, you know, as tough as that may be. Look, Aiden, you get to decide what you wanna do with that. You know, but, you know, I would say, I'm pretty hardcore about not firing. And when something, when I hear something like that, if it passed the mustard of the things I would fire for at Vayner, you know, how do you have relationships if you have no trust, break the law potentially? Don't forget, you sign contracts with clients that you're not doing that. You know, so, yeah, Aiden, I think, I think especially, because you did the right thing. If you had suspicion and you asked people and they lied to your face and put the organization in litigation vulnerability, like, you know, yeah, I would probably sit down and be like, let's use Dustin, who I adore, his family. Like Dustin, you just crossed a line that's like, I'm not sure where I can go with this. I even asked you and you lied to my face, not to mention, you know, I love you and I'll help you get another job because we work so close and travel the world together. But if I don't let you go for something as egregious and illegal as this, then I've created a huge vulnerability for the rest of the organization. So it would be a shitty sitch. It's kind of like, I had a fire, someone who was like, my real friend at Wine Library, because they were stealing. Stealing. And I was, like, as a friend, I was okay with it. Like, I felt bad, I was trying to figure out why, but I still had to fire them because, you know, you just lose such a level of credibility that you can really aid in this entire agency's on the line. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. That's tough. Our last and final question is from Emil Japan. He says, Yeah, I mean, I think this, you know, that's, you know, and I love him and so, but like, I think that's the whole purpose of the job, right? Meaning like, like every interviewer is different. Like I like to get into like real questions. Like I did podcasts with friends today. How many people watch podcasts with friends today? I say I did in the chat because then I'll use it as a reference. Yeah, so, you know, like you saw there was that one moment with that hip hop artist where I like pushed him to be more vulnerable. So I think there's a lot of ways to be an interviewer. Some people do incredible depths of homework and like watch 15 podcasts with that person if they're famous and like try to ask them a question that's never been asked before. I'm a little bit more improv. I'm more SNL. I'm more like, want to know in the moment what I'm feeling, which is what I think the audience is feeling. And so I ask that. So I think there's no right way. I think what you want to do is know your body of work as a podcast as a whole, right? And so what you want to do is create a scenario where you're making it interesting for the audience in context. If he asks the same question to 19 guests in a row and the answers are going to be in a similar place, that podcast is not going to be interesting. I think one of the reasons so many people tune in to a lot of what I do is it can really go anywhere. Even though I've got my pillars, you know I'm going to talk about kindness and patience and like you don't have to be from who you are. So I think there's a lot of ways to do it. But I think, you know, if you're worried about the quality of the guest, remember, so you want them to prep, remember, that's really your responsibility as the interviewer. And so like for me, one of the reasons I struggle as a podcast host is I can get excited and interrupt a lot. It's also because I'm doing such hyper listening, I get excited and want to ask or add to it or, you know, I'm a jammer, you know? And so, you know, those are all the variables that go into something like that. That's great, thank you. Thanks guys for all of your questions. Can we let everybody on and like hand raise and go to town? And also can you two try to focus on people who have historically not asked questions? If you can notice when we get into that. I'm going to start with Anthony M. If you want to lower your hand on you. Can you guys hear me? We can. Yes. Hey Gary, hey everyone. First of all, I wanted to just say thank you for that awesome experience we have for the last thing I'll call. I mean, I think I can speak for everyone that was there. That was a really great experience to see how you operate in your like home base. It was really, really cool. So thanks a lot for that. I feel like we should run that back. I feel a lot of people didn't get to the office. Feel like we, you know, Jack, of course, so let's make sure we chat that up. I might want to run it back one more time. I feel the extra energy of the people in the room was a lot of fun. And obviously it's a lot of fun for people to hang out. So something to think about. We'll talk that through. No day. Awesome. And then, you know, I can't miss the opportunity to just say thank you. So I came across to Gary, I don't know, like six, seven years ago. I had that nine to five as an IT guy. I started investing in real estate that led to meeting a property manager. I couldn't find a good one. Started a property management company and now I have a full service brokerage during the pandemic. I got my broker's license and, you know, and it's funny. I did all that until 2021. And then I started using your marketing advice. So before that, it was just on the business advice. And then the past three years, my business has done a lot better since I've been doing both the business and the marketing advice. So I just wanna say thank you for that. I really, it's been life changing. So thank you. You can't even imagine what that feels like as a human being. Thank you, brother. Yeah, yeah. So one of the other tokens, I mean, this community is great, but I do have a fly fish token as well. And I don't know how comfortable you are, but I would like to ask if there's any updates on that. I know the guys have been doing a good job of updating us. But I know we're getting close. Working close. It's in full, I mean, they're in full construction. Like I'm visiting in a couple of weeks here. Like my guess is spring for, I mean, spring for short. It will be before the summer. It's rock and roll time. Like we're gonna, it's gonna get really fun, Anthony. Like I'm pretty damn excited, especially with like, you know, the New York scene with zero bonds, easy clubs. Like I think there's this really sweet spot that fly fish club is gonna find. Cause some of this stuff is like outlandishly expensive, you know, membership and the amount of money we put into the place and just the food. I don't know if all of you know this, but we've opened a restaurant in BCR group called Little Maven. It just opened. It's in New York City. And like I'm blown away by the feedback. We're one weekend and the feedback on the food and you know, full disclosure, fly fish food is gonna be an elevated experience from Maven and I'm getting like, you know, I grew up in the wine business. So a lot of people in the wine business in the New York wine scene have already visited Maven. Cause you know, in the New York wine scene, you're in the New York wine and food scene. And I could, for everybody who's in New York or if you're visiting New York for the holidays, please go check out Little Maven. It's, it's pretty exciting. So anyway, Anthony, they were in full construction. A construction always scares me. We were like two years late on building out Wine Library. But you know, like I'm always scared of construction timelines, but we're very far along. Nothing's in our way from executing. And so I think we're, you know, barring an atrocity. I think the spring is very real. Call it April, May is my gut. And then I will see a lot of you there quite a bit cause I will live there on the back after this year. I'm definitely using this token to get at the biggest table we can get and do a hangout hawk. I think that's a great idea. Thanks, we love it. By the way, that's, that's, you know, this goes back to maybe on the last hangout hawk section. Maybe we'll have a bunch of people here. If the timing works, then maybe when's our last Jack, when's our last hangout hawk? I'll double check that for you. Thank you. Yeah, maybe, maybe we do the last hangout hawk with a good amount of people in the office with me and on Zoom and on meets, be friends. And then maybe that night a bunch of us will hang out at Blythe Fish. So we'll work on it. Like, look, I think, I think this group especially that's on right now probably knows what I'm, what I'm about to say is incredibly real, which is like, I'm uncomfortably busy. Yet I'm always fighting for ways to interact with all of you to the best of my ability. And, you know, so while respecting the access tokens. And so, yeah, I think that could be fun. April 23rd, by the way, is the last hangout hawk. I wonder if we could, like when I hear that date, I wonder if it's kind of thing where it's like, maybe we do it there as like a first look because it's not fully gonna be done. Or like it'll be, it'll be pretty, that's interesting. Well, we'll talk, Jack. We'll come up, we'll give people plenty of time if we decide to lock something in. Sounds great. Awesome. Thanks, Gary. Yep. All right, cool. Next question, Jaden Leavitt. Do you wanna lower your hand and unmute? Right. Can you guys hear me? Yes. Oh, brilliant. Gary, we met in London, you and a half ago, I'd never wrote a thing on the internet. Now I'm a full-time writer because of you. It's been a journey for sure. I've been sat at this table, punching myself in the head as a new writer. But it's taken off. I started writing on Medium just about crypto NFTs. In fact, it was after getting into Vif trends, I tweeted about it, went viral, thought I'd do some longer form stuff on Medium. It's blown up. I've got about 15,000 followers and I've got some crazy Americans following me. It's mental. Nobody took, sorry, I didn't mean to offend anyone. As someone who's trying to improve my writing, I'm gonna go really narrow and selfish. Please, that's what this is for. Someone trying to improve my writing and grow. I've sort of pivoted into sub-stack. Yes. And I won't talk about the plateau, but I'm in the grimes and I'm trying to build it. What advice do you have? I think the biggest issue, yeah. I mean, are you talking about driving awareness to your sub-stack? Yes. Yeah, I think, look, the fact that you even said other than TikTok makes me laugh because you know where I'm going. Like, you can't make up stuff that isn't true. The reality is using social networks to drive awareness to things really works because it's free. I mean, here's some news. You can run Google AdWords around your topics and you could pay three to $7 a click or 50 cents to $15 a click and they can go there and a bunch of them won't convert and you'll spend $900 and you'll get one subscriber and you'll be like, why the fuck did Gary tell me to do that? Like, social media content is free distribution. Now, even hearing you talk, maybe you wanna start doing TikTok live. So I'm not telling you TikTok, I'm telling you TikTok live because TikTok live is growing. LinkedIn I think is a great place for you brother. Organically, you know, LinkedIn is starting a podcast and having people on it. Like, building awareness and brand is by getting in front of people. You know, so, you know, the reason I love social networks is because, I mean, look at me now, look what I'm doing. I'm constantly eating my own dog food. I'm literally fucking streaming myself now in an ASMR capacity on Twitch today. Alpha testing it today. Another thing. Another thing we put a lot of hours in, strategize if it's gonna be right, affecting my life where I have to hit mute on the mic and not on the mic and like, you know, like all this kind of stuff, right? Like, so, you know, LinkedIn newsletter is a great opportunity. I totally agree, Tyler. Like, there's just a lot of tactics, but it's about more content. In the same way a year and a half ago, I told you to write and put it on the internet. Now I'm telling you to micro write and micro video and micro audio to get to your longer form. Like, why am I gonna sell a crap load of books called Day Trading Attention next? Because I built up awareness through all the activities and then you push it towards it. Okay. Thank you very much. Cheers. Reggie. Thank you. Chat, Osterman, do you wanna go next and lower your hand? Yes, hello. Hey, chat. Can you hear me? Of course, brother. Hey, Gary. Nice to see you. Great to see you. So I think I've told you this before. I have an immersive events business and I really wanna scale this business. I'm finding a challenging thing to get good profit from my custom made events with ticket sales. And what I really need is wealthy clients or businesses who can pay large sums of money for our services. And I wanna know how I can pivot my business model to attract higher paying clients. And I'm willing to DM people, post things. I'm just not sure where to go because I'm used to people buying tickets for $20, $25. I'm willing like 30 to 50K per event. Here it is, do it. So pitch me the whole thing through. So okay, you've sold events to immersive events. Now you want someone to underwrite it, right? In theory? Yeah. I mean, are you asking, because each event is a very different unique theme. Well, let's talk it through. Like, you know, like, you know, if I'm gonna answer you and they're all custom, what I'm gonna do is reverse engineer who the fuck would wanna pay $30,000 to $50,000 to underwrite your event. So as you can imagine, I'm at the mercy of the creative execution because if you're doing something around space, well then you go to companies that want that audience versus if you're doing something around gnomes or hobbits or race cars. So, you know, in reality, what you've gotta do is reverse engineer, you know, the reason I'm good at building things is because the only question I ever ask is why? Why Chad would somebody give you 30 to $50,000? So I mean, I guess my question is how, why are they gonna, if I've never done a space event before, I could do a space event, but if I've never done one before, going to space companies, you know, I mean, I guess that's my issue. People don't can't see what I can do because... Well, have you done things? Yeah, so I've done six or seven events and they're all vastly wildly different. Do you have video on all of it? Yeah, I do. So make a fucking 90 second video sizzle reel and then you walk in and people know you have done shit. Okay, so then I send it, do I DM people with that reel? Well, I mean, it depends on like, you know, how you wanna attack this. So again, let's start from the top. Like what event do you wanna do? So, I mean, I have so many, I just got an inflatable 360 projector dome where I wanna do an event called Eat Like an Alien where it's like a five star dining event. That's cool. Where I can do different planets. Good, so like that, I think you go to people that care about the restaurant industry. Like again, are you telling me instead of selling tickets where you might spend 38K and you then go start selling tickets and if you only sell $1,000 worth of tickets, you've lost 37K, right? That's what you're trying to eliminate, right? Yes, exactly. Well, what I think, so yeah, so what you're looking for is sponsors. Yeah, I don't know how to get those. Well, maybe you should go and get someone to be a salesman who does know how to do that and give her or him commission. Mm-mm. Right, so there's unlimited people who have titles of like sponsorship sales in their titles on LinkedIn. And if you hit them up and say, I throw epic fucking events, but I don't know how to sell sponsorship, I'll give you 25% of any sponsor you bring to my event. Would you wanna take this on? If you ask 100 of them, then you're more likely to get someone who can actually do it versus you. What you're trying to do is you're trying to do sponsorship sales and you're a creative. You're not a salesman. Exactly, yes. So you either need to get a partner who does sales or you need to reach out to people who do sponsorship sales and ask them if they wanna side hustle or a freelance gig and give them a part of the action. Okay. Off the part of the action. And I mean, I'm assuming I'd have to pay them upfront. Not necessarily. If you find the right person who believe, like when I, by the way, right off the top, you got my attention. The fact that you just pinched me, you wanna do a pop-up event that is based on eating like an alien, that's fucking clever. Thank you. Right? So like, you know, if I'm a sponsorship sales person who's pretty accomplished and has a big role at X and I happen to hear that pitch and I'm like, wait a minute, I got a perfect bunch of people, I might just take the two, I might counter you and say, give me 33% instead of 25% of the action. You're gonna say yes, then I'm gonna go sell it $100,000 sponsorship and keep 33,000 just because I know the one person, because that's what I do. So, you know, you may not have to pay someone upfront. There's plenty of people that work on commission only, you just gotta find them. That's what you need to be messaging on LinkedIn, not trying to come up with brand. You're like, that's like asking a salesman to come up with the creative idea of eat like an alien. No, exactly, no, 100%. Okay, thank you. Reach out to sponsorship people. That's awesome. Appreciate you. Sponsorship sales people. Sponsorship sales people, thank you. Amazing. Monica Wilkins, do you wanna go next? Do you wanna unmute him lower hand? Hello, Gary. We can. Yes. Hi, Gary. Hi, Monica. Not all the whole box. Come. Okay. Good bye to everyone. I have a small business, I mean, I have a business services company that basically caters to small businesses. So, I kind of fill in the gap or if you don't need a full-time employee. I do any type of work if you need bookkeeping for or if you need, no matter what you need. You always talk about niche, having to find in your niche. Do you have to have a niche or is small business good enough? Because I don't want, like I just buy small, small, small, I absolutely hate that. Yeah, small business is enough of a niche. So, okay. So, because I actually lack all different aspects of business. Me too. I have like 1700 companies because I like it all. Okay. So, but I was always struggling when you say to find your niche and I'm like, I'm not, you know what's so, you know what's so, you know what's so funny? Show me the clip where I've said to find your niche. Gary, I don't know. I'm sure it's there. Ask Corso. No, no, no, no, no. Be careful. There's a Gary V search engine. Go type in to find your niche. Go find it. Go show me. There's a lot of crazy hardcore Gary V fans here. I have a very funny feeling that a lot of you are gonna back me up on this. I am not a big define your niche. I'm a, you are your niche guy. Like I'm dumb. I'm, I'm. You've had these talks. So all of you people shaking your head. I mean, I mean. Ain't that it. Don't do that to me. Cause I'm fed to stuff. Okay. So that's good. Because that, that is kind of my niche. And I don't, I love to help the people that are, you know, I don't even, I actually don't even understand what you're saying. Meaning it sounds like you're happy and you're building. Why would, what, what do you? I don't want to focus solely on bookkeeping. I don't want to solely focus on business management or like branding or like social media. I just want it to be broad for the. You want to do small business consulting and you will come and by the way, let me give you a business model. I will come and audit your business to tell you what you should do with me. So you're going to pay me $5,000 just for my time to understand everything. And then I'll tell you pricing on all these other things I feel I can help you with. Exactly. That is perfect. Yes. I, cause I love the full range of services and I've already scaled as far as the things that are taking me, you know, too much time that of course I can do because I want to be able to do everything in the business. Not just, I don't want to do. I can't do myself. I get it. So I'm hired people for different things like that. So I just want to make sure that I'm on the rep page there. And then the only other thing, as far as scaling and then using people out of the country, my good friend, Robert had that is on here has looked to me up with some different people that I can use. Do I just hide the fact that I'm using someone out of the country because a lot of people are not comfortable with that. Yeah. I mean, I personally, I'm betting the person for a few months before. Honestly, I, yeah, I genuinely, yeah, I genuinely think that that's a personal decision. Right? Like, you know, at the end of the day, if you are, if anyone asks you directly if you're using subcontractors, you have to answer honestly. As far as, as far as do you need to lead with that? I'm not necessarily sure you have to. I think there's a very strong argument that I've heard from both sides of the equation on this. And I think you're allowed to decide what works for you, Monica. I don't think that's, I don't think there's a right or wrong to that. You know, Robert says, I would say no. You know, like, you don't have to do that, Monica. Other people I've talked to feel very passionate that you should. I'm, I'm agnostic on this one. I don't, I think this is more of, when it starts blurring into like, does one think this is a moral issue or not? That's where it gets a little complicated. And so I think I'm incredibly comfortable with you deciding what's right for you. And, and there is no right answer on that. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Michelle, would you like to go? Okay. There we go. Ah, man. Can you hear me? I can, Michelle. Okay. Great. Thank you, Harry. So I'm super excited to be here. My friend, my friend, Benny Fisher, gifted me his seat today. Very nice. And I want to thank you. I want to thank you, Michelle, because if Benny was here, he would be disruptive and eating up the oxygen. And so I can, I can say this for all the Hawks. We are ecstatic that you are here, Michelle. Let's all clap it up for Michelle. Ha, ha! All right. This is preparation. You want to suck up the air in the room. Get to the point, right? So, okay. You're trained well. So listen, my question today is around kindness. So for the last 20 years, my teens and I have adopted families at Christmas. This is the perfect time for me to have a guest seat with you. About five years ago, I wanted to move away from just buying Christmas presents and supporting families. Like we adopt families from domestic violent shelters and really move into other seasons. Like they need help, if they need help at Christmas, they need summer clothes, they need back to school clothes. And I wanted to know how I could do that with more impact. So just, you know, thinking about like, how can I do this with more impact? I had an idea and I started collecting Coles Cash and Old Navy Cash. You know, the cash that we get, but we never remember that it's in our wallet and it literally doesn't get used. For example, Old Navy, they will give you super cash and spend $25, get $10 back, right? And then it goes unused. So I had this idea that my team and I would collect the fake cash and the rewards from our client base, from my entrepreneur communities. And we would go out and actually use that cash to buy more goods, to do more good in the world. So I've been doing that for the last eight years. I know the impact has made a huge difference in not just picking a family and their wish list at Christmas, but really amplified what we're doing throughout the year. And now I wanna share the idea, the why, the what, the how, with others across the country, so we can actually amplify the giving, right? And what's so beautiful about it is that no one has to write a check. Like you could literally just develop a team in your community, your school, your wherever you are, and somebody can just simply activate the campaign, somebody can do the shopping, and other people, it's time-treasure talents. Right, you can show everybody how to do the blueprint of it. Yeah, yeah, so I wanna call it like cashback heroes or something like that. And really, I'd love to hear whether you have any advice on how to take this from where it is today, which is me and my team, not a nonprofit or anything like that at this point. And to a larger scale, much like what Tony Robbins did with the basketball days. I mean, Tony spent 30 years of building a reputation and have a platform so he was able to amplify it. Yeah. I mean, this is all the same game, you know? Michelle, it's like, how do you build awareness? It's like, you know, I was at the Charity Water Gala the other night, like, it's all storytelling. What's up, Emil? Emil, going to sleep? You're waving? You're going to sleep? You know, Michelle, I think, look, it's hand-to-hand combat. It's hand-to-hand combat. Like, everyone's looking for this, especially when they're doing things for good. I always, I talk to a lot of nonprofits. It's something that I am passionate about. You know, I sit on multiple boards, but I take a lot of meetings and do a lot of spec work and consulting. And the issue with people that are doing good is this is a very, very, very, very distinct sentence that I'm about to say. Because they're doing something remarkable, they're audacious in their expectation of others and they lack empathy that people have different things that they want to support. And just because you're doing something good doesn't mean that you're supposed to give their attention and or money to someone. Yeah. Yeah, I get that. Yeah, and I see it a lot. Like, it really fucks with good people like yourself. It's like, they don't realize they're judging people without knowing people. You know, there are multiple people here on this. Like, when I hear what you're saying, it strikes me right down the center. You're like, wonderful. It's amazing. Yet. It's pretty cool, right? It's very cool. You know, meanwhile, my parents are driving my brother home right now from a colonoscopy because AJ has Crohn's disease. And my parents are still driving him, I'm like, 40, at 37 years old to his colonoscopy because it's incredibly emotional to them. And they want to take their energy, time, and money and support that, right? And then everyone here has all sorts of shit going on. Right? And I'm sure, you know, there's just so much. And so, you know, I think the first thing you have to do is first make sure that you know that you have to battle for attention and awareness just like everyone else. And every celebrity and every entity that you go to, they get asked 4,000 times. I was asked to give money in donation 1,700 times in the month of November in direct email, not even DMs. Yeah, that's huge. Just think about what that means, right? Like I'm just trying to put it into perspective of the asks. And I'm not the most famous guy. So just the- Hell yeah, you are. So what I'm saying is, you know, couple things. You need to build a communications infrastructure, you know, and you need to figure, like the reason I love TikTok is you make one video with one feel good story and it gets 39 million views. The good morning America can't do that for you. Oprah tweeting can't do that for you. Like people don't understand, it's a social media strategy world. Social media content gets free distribution. Do you know what I'm saying that is? The first 15 years of social media, these companies that I invested in, Facebook and Twitter and all that, that was more like email. You would have to amass followers for a long period of time, then you would post and a percentage of them would see it. The social media we live in now with these AI algorithms is you make one good piece of content and your life changes. So you have to become remarkable at making content. Challenge accepted. Love you. Thank you, my friend. Thank you back. Thank you, Michelle. Joven, do you want to go next? Yes, I'm here. Good afternoon, Gary. Happy Tuesday, everyone. Happy Tuesday. First and foremost, I want to thank John for giving me the opportunity of his spot today to be able to talk to you, Gary. So I'm the Chief Entertainment Officer at Premium Shops. And what we do is we deliver memorable, immersive photo, video related experiences for corporate and social events. We've been honored to work with some big names in sports like the Golden State Warriors, NBA 2K, the 49ers, and even my hometown heroes and Sacramento Kings. It's crazy how my journey began at V-Con last year in Minnesota. Were you inspired me to resign from my 21-year government job last August to pursue my business full-time that I started back in 2017? Thank you so much, Gary, and I've been very truly grateful for this opportunity to listen to you and inspire me to take the leap of faith, to do what I love for my family. Thank you, brother. And I've been working to build relationships to the Web3 space. It would be such an honor to be able to work with the feature owner of the New York Jets and the awesome VaynerX crew to provide an epic photo activation for V-Con 2024. John, I can just jump in. Feel free to send me an email as you can imagine. I see it, I see the card. We're happy to look at it. We're looking at everything. No different than the 1700, I actually have my admins do it, the 1700 nonprofit requests. I don't know if there's a day that doesn't go by that we don't get 25 to 50 vendor requests to activate at V-Con. So I don't have enough details to know who mouse in the community, other vendors, other things that are going on. But if you send me an email personally to Gary at V-Friends and put its Javon from the Hangout Hawk session with all your information, I will absolutely get it looked at and analyzed in comparison to the other things we're doing. Yes sir, I appreciate your time here. Of course my man. Thank you man. Super humbled by the emotion and the kind words that you display just now. Appreciate that. How are we feeling about the Kings this year? You guys got a pretty real squad. We do. It's like I said, I provide multiple activations for the Kings during the playoffs this year for all seven games and that led me to working with the Universal Pictures. We're providing experience for all their movies, red carpet premier events. So it's truly humbled with opportunity to be able to work with such big brands. I can't wait to dig under the hood, bro. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jovan. Dr. Malachi, wanna un-gift? There we go, doc. I got it. I got it. It was me. So Gary, let me just say first, had I had the chance to play in basketball at Chuck E. Cheese, I would have beat you. I doubt that very much, doc. Okay. Hey, you've interviewed so many, I disagree, but even you had to do so many. Doc, doc, I disagree back. I hear your disagreement and I match it with greater disagreement. I then take that disagreement and dismantle it with my disagreement. I put all my chips on the table and say, V-Con, pick anything you want, I'll beat you at it. I will do that and we will live stream it and after I beat you, I will physically hurt you. And I will live stream that and... Sue me. All right, go ahead, doc. Yeah, okay. So obviously you've interviewed amazing people, proximity is amazing. I guess this is a two-fold question, answer it if you want. Is there something amazing that you've seen as a commonality amongst the amazing people you've interviewed? And then number two, because I'm also a major Tony Robbins fan and he's had a major influence in my life, is there something about Tony that maybe six out of two, because he's the best of the best at what he does, you've done stuff with him that six out of two, like are there things of people that you aspire, not just motivate you, but aspire? I'll do the Tony part first. I mean, I think Tony has achieved what I see in a lot of people as well, which is I think Tony does what Tony was supposed to do. Do you know what I mean? Like this goes back to why I'm obsessed with self-awareness and obviously there's examples of like Tony and Kobe and all other people, but then I also, my mom is that person. My mom was meant to be a mother and like no bullshit. There's no one who's done it better. It may not get the headlines, it may not get the public awards. Many people may not know it. Obviously I've been a loud advocate for her and so many more people know it, but I love seeing people when they're doing what they're supposed to do. And that's what stands out for Tony. As far as, yeah, I have a very, very distinct answer for you brother. The people that you're referring to in question one have all gotten to their place in the world based on one of two extremes. Deep, deep, deep. It's a wild ass thing for me at 48 to see how clear this is. The people that achieve outsized results that then allow the masses to look at them. It's fucking Star Wars doc. It's literally Jedi's and Sith lords. It's like the good and the bad at extreme levels. But just like Star Wars, like it's not sustainable when you're on the dark side. It's why so many famous and successful and with late people have such dramatic burnouts. Deaths, suicides, like these supernovas. Like think about all the, my friends, think about all the most famous artists and comedians that pass away at such young ages. It was the dark side that got them there. This is why I talk about we can't put money on a pedestal. Too many people get to money through jealousy, envy, and negativity. Yeah, doc, I'll tell you the thing that completely binds everybody that I've ever interviewed or anybody I've ever seen up close and I've seen a lot of them. Of wealth and fame. It's either light or dark and fucking bad news. Most of it's dark. I think it's why I'm so compelled to communicate about the things that I'm talking about. It takes more time and it's more challenging to let you, that's not true. Let me say it differently. It's just unfortunate that it takes super fuel to get you to the top. That's not unfortunate, it makes sense. It's just unfortunate that most people's super fuel is coming from a place of resentment or a chip on a shoulder. I'll show you, mom, dad, you know, like girlfriend, boyfriend, husband. It's unfortunate. You know what, it's funny. I made this analogy to a friend a couple years ago. I haven't thought about this since and this is the only time I've ever said it publicly. Something happened to me where I understood my fuel was weird and different than all the other people in my 20s and 30s and I compared it to going to the gas station where there was the weird diesel fuel pump and everybody else had the normal shit and I was like, I'm the diesel fuel. I feel like I'm getting here on a different energy length and yeah, I'd want more people to get to the top through gratitude and kindness and empathy and compassion and civility and patience and that's why V-Friends exists because I know I can't scale it by myself. Great, and thanks for everything because you are rare in your willingness to just interact and be accessible and be encouraging and be authentic when you do. So my hat's off to you and thank you. And again, be con will be the end for you. Ha ha ha ha. Doc, it was really nice to see you at Chuck E. Cheese, especially because we've been interacting for so long. Thank you, Dr. Malachi. Vinit, would you like to go next? Yes, hi. Hi, Gary. Hi, Vinit. How are you? I'm good, Gary. How are you? I'm quite well, my friend. Okay, so my question is, so I believe my first interaction with you was, I went vegan and you asked me, are you doing okay? And that was the, I hope you remember that. So it's been three and a half years and I've still continued doing the same. I've progressed in my fitness journey too. I wanted to do 75 Heart Challenge. I'm sure you've heard about it. Oh yeah, have you? Yes, I have. Okay, so regarding like Monica spoke about some niches and I know that one should not believe in them, but I personally feel I do have some, like not many Indians are vegans. Second, in India, people don't know how to get protein from even vegetarian foods, but I do know being a vegan, you can have enough protein. Also like, so you know, by the way, Benit, real quick, just while I've got you, and we're talking, I'm not saying that people shouldn't be niche and things of that nature. I'm saying that it's not the only way so many people think they have to be and sometimes your niche is you. Like, you know, many people, most people are successful because they're known for something or have gone deep in something. But there's people like Monica and I that want to do a potpourri of things, but going niche is incredibly powerful, as you know. It's the majority of everyone who accomplishes something. Got it. So if you have them, use them? Yeah, especially the way you are talking about this. This is like a passion of yours. True. This goes back to what I just said earlier, like how people get there. Passion is one way. Like, if you like it, this is the fucked up thing about the world. People don't want work ethic to be part of the equation. It's hard for people to accept the amount of hours it takes to build something meaningful in parenting, in business, in the world. It's daunting for many. But it is fully, fully a part of it. And the way I think most people are able to achieve the work ethic to do something special is they like it so it doesn't feel like work. Right? Yeah, it just, you know, so. When you say that I resonated with it because my wife was thinking, wouldn't it be too difficult for you to do 75 hard? And I'm on the other hand thinking, no, like that would be the, I really want to do that because I've noticed myself being disciplined with my diet and workouts. So yeah, so my question is, I was thinking about YouTube shots and the same thing on Instagram as well. And I wanted to use Hindi, the Indian language. Yes, I know what. Because in India, like the masses, and they will be able to relate with me better. So even though I'm in the US, I was thinking I'll choose the four. I love it. I think that's right. So anything else apart from this that you would like me to try doing? Yeah, I mean, it's why I'm writing the new book. It's best practices. I want you to think about your titles. I want you to think about your thumbnail. I want you to think about the first three seconds of your video. I want you to think about mixing English and Hindi in the same video. We see that Spanglish crushes. So when people speak half Spanish, half English, I want you to think about what time you post the copy that you're using to support the post. This is a fucking science. Right. So the platforms would be like YouTube shots, same thing on Instagram and TikTok. You know, the reality is any platform can work. Do you know what, team, guess in the comments my fastest growing platform right now. And you know that these are all not like, it's a small platform and like, you know, I only have 30 people and now I have 80 people. I'm at scale on all of them. What is my fastest growing platform? LinkedIn. So a lot of LinkedIn answers TikTok, the answer to the question and it's not even close. Facebook. Crushing. Gaining thousands and thousands of followers a week. Best practices. I'm using the default type and we're putting quotes in with the default type posts and like, it just so fucking obvious that it's an everyday, this is why I'm writing the book. Day trading. Vinny, the answer is, whichever platform most works for you. Like, I can't push all of you enough towards TikTok Live. I can't push you all enough towards YouTube. But meanwhile, like, it might be Facebook. It might be LinkedIn. It might be TwitterX. Like, all of you are gonna be better at certain platforms than others. Some come more native to each of us than others. Camp, Camp, I'm using, Camp, Camp just asked, I'm sorry, Vinny, one second. Camp, Camp just asked, how am I using Facebook? I'm posting on my Facebook page. But because my team is constantly and I were constantly trying different things, you know, we try video and pictures and written word. I mean, written only is crushing, crushing, written only. Literally transcribing words out of my mouth and typing them out, hitting post. So you gotta try different shit. Okay, thanks Gary. By the way, look what, of course my brother, look what a pack leader dog said. I post the same shit on all platforms currently, time issue, I totally get it. I'm thrilled that you realize that's not best practices. And he goes, and Facebook has grown most by far. You know why? There's still a trillion people. This is how day trading attention works. There's still millions of people on Facebook, but almost every contemporary modern creator is not making content on Facebook. Supply and demand. Perfect, thank you Vinny. And John, do you wanna go next? Thank you, Zekler. Of course. Bye Gary, what's up? Good to see you John. So I'm starting a new position, working as a financial role at a real estate developer. And I'm wondering how can I respect the confidentially stuff and also not jeopardizing the brand of the company, but also developing my own personal brand maybe also the brand of the company. So how can I use maybe LinkedIn while still respecting the brand? Am I clear? You're very clear. It's a question I get asked all the time. The way you do that is by asking the organization for rules of how you can do it. What you're trying to do is very smart. I see it every day, I get asked this all the time. You're completely at the mercy of your employer. So you have to ask your employer for clear guidelines on what you're allowed to do on LinkedIn and explain to them that you're trying to build it to help the business. And then you'll get a real answer from the employer to see if they wanna suppress you and not let you build your own brand. Thank you, thank you. You're welcome. Let's get, I agree with Mohi, before I get out of here, let's grab him. Also, Jack on the next Hangout Hawks. I'm gonna speak it a little bit more, but because of my technical difficulties, I wanna add 10 minutes to the next one, please. Well, there. What are we getting here, brother? I'm here. Yes! Hey. Let's all call it up for our MMO. Call! Call! How are you, J.A.? Good, brother. I miss you, how are you? What? I'm very good, thank you. Starting to hear about AJ, I didn't know that. Yeah. It's the reason that I'm doing like four, it's the- That you're a factory, which I never did until like two years ago. So I'm really sorry to hear that. Thank you, brother. As a matter of fact, I don't know if you've heard this. The reason AJ left VaynerMedia to start VaynerSports with me was because he was too stressed doing VaynerMedia, it was too much HR, he didn't like it. And so he wanted to do something he liked and that's how VaynerSports got born. Oh, wow. Yeah. Cool. Tomorrow is SHIV's birthday and he couldn't be on the call today, so I wanted to present him this question. Why is SHIV not rich yet? Ha ha ha ha! Let me rephrase. So I guess people that put in, let's say a million dollars in refrains, they're like, well, fuck, the market is booming. Even the NFTs are crushing it. And we understand the long-term vision, but I wanna be able to buy a car or the house. Yeah. What do you think is going on? Look, I think, you know, I think there's a, everybody's got a different strategy of how they want to build their projects. And obviously, SHIV, you, anybody else, you can imagine it's an undercurrent every day, but I feel very confident in the way I'm building this brand. And obviously, when you wanna create demand for a digital collectible, I saw your comment yesterday of less users. I think about this every day, I read everything. I feel very confident in the bricks that I'm putting down. And I think every IP, whether it's artist or intellectual property, are gonna have different news cycles and different moments in time. And I'm incredibly scared to compromise the way I'm building this brand and feel very confident the way that I'm doing it. And obviously, I stress if SHIV's upset or you're upset or anybody's upset, and I work on it daily, but I can only navigate the IP and the demand creation, the way that I see fit. And, you know, I think it's incredibly challenging to predict market dynamics. It is my responsibility to create affinity, which will create demand. And I feel like I'm on that journey. But, you know, predicting the market's moments and things of that nature, I think there's a lot of things that go into different pricing and a lot of different ways to play it. And I'm playing it the best that I can. That's awesome. Thank you. I appreciate it, my brother. I wish you a really healthy, happy holiday. Me too. Thank you. Everybody, I'm gonna run. It's great to be with all of you. I can't wait to see all of you again soon. Come and hang out on Twitch. You can see what I'm doing behind the scenes. I'm gonna start building that up. I'll see a bunch of you on Fanatics tonight. And I'm excited for a bunch of announcements that are about to come. We're gonna have a really active January as well. So I love you. We'll talk to you soon. Cock, cock, cock. Thank you. Thanks guys. Cheers. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
