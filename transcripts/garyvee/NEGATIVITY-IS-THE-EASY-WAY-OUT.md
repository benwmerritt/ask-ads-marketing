We're doing well. Say hello to Gary Vee and what are your thoughts so far? Hey Joe. What did the last girl say on the radio sound? We can hear it on the... The last call in from Joe was I was driving and Gary was making me super uncomfortable because he was saying, stop complaining, but I love complaining and I live my life complaining and it just hit me. Joe, I love you so much. You don't understand. This is the biggest thing for me. Like I've already made my thing. I'm gonna buy the New York Jets and it'll be a movie and it's gonna be great. At this point, Joe, this phone call means the world to me. You have to understand why this matters. If you actually believe what you just said, if this is not a fleeting moment of the energy of this show and you're able to maintain that feeling, you cannot imagine how much better your life is gonna be. It's easy to complain. Complaining is the easy way out. Negativity is the easy way out. You're lucky if you are gorgeous, but if you break up, if you eat like crap and don't take care of yourself and do drugs and drink alcohol, you'll not look gorgeous. You're lucky if you're six foot 11 and can sprint like a gazelle, but if you don't work on your craft and you work on your outside jumper, if you don't work on your intensity and your endurance, you won't be an NBA player. So yes, I got lucky that I can win the game of life in entrepreneurship, but I put in the work for the last 25 years minimally and maybe even longer to be the best version of myself at this thing.
