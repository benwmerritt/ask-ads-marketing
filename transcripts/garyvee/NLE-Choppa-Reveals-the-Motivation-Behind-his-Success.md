The only thing that can fuck someone up with the kind of level of talent you have is lack of patience and lack of patience Just comes from insecurity that means doing it for someone else Gary my god, what's good?

How old were you when you went to Chicago? Oh Two months oh really? But um Because I told my aunt when I was five years old sitting in her kitchen table Not gonna work for anybody I'm gonna work for myself Just by watching all the different things that I grew up seeing and how difficult it was for them to be able to You know have children raise children and do all those types of things It's still having to work for other people to weigh in which they treated you and all those types of stuff. So I basically Formatting myself to make sure that I stayed on the path And I own several businesses and work for myself. I love it and the same thing I'm trying to teach him and the rest of our crew Thank you, my dude Thank you my guy The feelings mutual man you got real talent and I see how you're moving makes a lot more sense.

I was like, I'm fucking I know exact and I did I built businesses I was killing it, but then when I was 30, I was like damn 2025 meeting no shit and like when I sit here at 40 like I love hearing that and it's true You're gonna annihilate this year. You already are you're off. You're off to a great start Accomplish Gradually I love it And let me tell you something right now. I love that that bro on some real shit It's a blessing when you don't check off some of those at the exact age Because that pressure of like I got to do this by this. It's good. There's ambition in it. It's always great to have a plan That's always right But giving yourself that grace when you don't hit this thing and you hit it three years later or seven The only thing that can fuck someone up with the kind of level of talent you have and now I understand like the real support system The framework is lack of patience You know and lack of patience just comes from insecurity that means doing it for someone else Right like who you proven to besides yourself when you're with yourself you got your whole life to do it and And what's crazy is what you when we were growing up. It seemed like what you're doing was a young man's game He got fuckers out here 50 years old still making shit happen We pay attention to battling each other and shit. So you got crazy time You know, it's funny too cuz like, you know Planning planning always like me. I've never been the best plan like I could plan But you know, sometimes things just go out He's got the actual plan Like I made a promise to myself, you know, and I was under over the most high I was pretty much saying like where I wanted to be in five years by the time I'm 20 I was at I was at the time of my life where I knew I was 15 and I knew like, okay If I don't get my shit together now, I may be leaned down a road. It's not, you know, best for me And you know, it was a lot of days. I feel I wasn't being the best child to get my mom with a best piece Of course. So, you know, I sat down that's part of the 15 year old journey though. Yeah, there's a part of that I sat down myself. I didn't tell anybody this. I just made like a plan with myself. I'm like, you know what? I'm a bit on me in five years I'm gonna see where it can take me and she cannot, you know, relieve her of all the stress and tears I've already gave her when I was there. Yeah, give her happy tears now instead and I made a five year plan at 15 And you know, I I crushed I crushed it and then some in a year You know, so, you know that next year when I turn 16, I know blowing up and stuff Bro, I've seen it, you know, obviously we watch we're moving the way we're moving. It's been a joy to watch you build You got real talent. You got real talent What are you all thinking about now Anything top line me the shoes gonna go crazy. That's already done. You've already done the work But that shit's gonna go crazy Also, you also even a video we just did yesterday I'm super excited about that. Yeah, it's gonna be fire The bigger picture Like The good news is that's exactly right. It's always people I would say this first me Tyler boy like we're 24-7 available a DMD yesterday and say what's up like you can hit us up anytime like for real. That's how we roll to What I'm always gonna want to know is what you would like to happen and why Too many people don't ask the why We want to do this that makes sense Like I know the 30 things you might be thinking about they're all the things we all know Well, great, then then you need to keep doing exactly what you're doing keep making content at scale Because you're a good fucking kid, but you're cool as fuck to all of them And it's just like what I try to do like once I realize I'm like, oh fuck People fuck with me like that like let me pump real good shit in these kids while they stink You know what I mean, and you you have such a voice and such an opportunity that's just you communicating I agree and by the way, that's the selfless part of you and I love you for that And you should like every other human have the selfish part. You're trying to build shit and as those come along You know, I'm in a very fortunate spot and you'll meet others that are as well like Happy to point you in the right direction introduce you to the right people But the thing I'm gonna want to know is like why do you want to do your own beverage? Why do you want to be in real estate? Like, you know, like there's always money. There's building. I like that. I'm an entrepreneur to me It's like sports, right business like sports like why I don't know Why would you play basketball and not try to score 80 points in a game? You know like you know like why not but I think where you will win is when you really like love it enough that you like force it through Too many people try to diversify or build up or build their empire But they're doing it because they think it's the right thing to do Love it I saw that Love it's beautiful That that stuff I've been seeing from afar and here and you articulate it makes a lot of sense My references like there's gonna be so many business opportunities in front of you pick stuff that like I'll use real estate because it's one that comes up a lot Yeah, so even To me that means you like it and it's interesting to you I see a lot of people like I'm gonna do real estate because it's smart like real estate is smart But do you love it because if you love fashion You're gonna spend 18 hours a day trying to build a fashion brand whereas with real estate you might hand that off to a person So that's the stuff I'm talking about. You know what I mean the stuff that you fuck with Yeah, and and and being real creative like like it's cliche to like music sports You know like food fashion, but there might be some random ass shit that you really fuck with that's like left field And it's not popping yet, but you have the platform and the communication ability to make it pop Like I was I'll give you mine. I was passionate about going garage selling and buying shit and flipping it that shit wasn't cool But it was real to me and I made those videos and I knew it could help people and then it became cooler But it was it was in me and Bro, you're about you're in the beginning of your journey She's young let alone you You know so you guys I'm so happy for y'all.
