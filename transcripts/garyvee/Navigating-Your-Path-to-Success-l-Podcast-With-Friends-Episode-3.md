So I grew up in Houston. I grew up in Houston. Yeah, I lived here I lived across the street for about six years look literally across the street. I watched this whole area get built It was loud as hell every morning. Yeah. Yeah, so um, yeah, I lived in the building called the almost like right across I'm back in Houston now. I'm just like kind of back and forth What's up everybody I'm Christian Crosby I'd say my claim to fame is definitely working in the NBA as an arena host for the Philadelphia 76ers Which is home base, but I also do all the NBA stuff So like NBA draft and be a all-star weekend. Actually, there was a NBA all-star. It was doing a slam dunk contest Right. I was killing it. I was doing a great job and you were sitting like I don't you were like I think first row and You were just you were vibing you we made eye contact eye contact a couple times and you were just like you're doing it You're doing a fucking good job Well, that's so yeah, honestly by the way real quick for the podcast and everybody on twitch and for all of us Can we start making giving flowers while people are alive? Here they come the goosebumps. I know what I'm saying something like I like we don't do it enough We're quick to tell people what they suck at We're quick to tear people down Quick to be envious of people moving and can't wait for them to fuck up. Yeah, but why not give love? I agree In little ways like that like I remember that vividly Do you really remember that I really remember that because I will never forget it And it's crazy like I really really I really remember it Yes, and by the way the coolest part is and I wouldn't say it at the other thing I've held myself accountable to because I so want to give people flowers is well if I get people flowers when I don't mean it Then it doesn't mean it doesn't I remember it is because I remember it right true because what I do for a living is Try I mean my next book day trading attention comes out next year Attention comes in understanding the ticktocks about to blow but it also comes in knowing that Gunna sat here when he had 400 followers on Instagram or that I or that my company VaynerMedia did a campaign called Finding the next Vine star and the winner that we chose for that campaign was Logan Paul Or was in that office moments before she went crazy like I pay attention to people I pay attention to platforms I pay attention to why quarter-oied hats are hot or two years ago So that's fashion and music and people and so the reason I remember it was because I meant it Right because I think you really work doing a great job, and it's hard. Thank you what you do that's not that easy And to even get to be able to do it is already real talent, but you were doing on a big stage with a lot of chaos I remember it very well Gary's over here trying to make me cry I don't appreciate Let's go even a step deeper and then we'll get in some other shit How did you get the whole give me the real origin story? I'm gonna go into how did you get there? So we got a sense of what you do. Yeah, so you grew up where so I grew up in South Jersey But most of my life Has been Sherry Hill Camden Morristown like I was born in Voorhees I know every zip code in New Jersey because when I was building my dad's liquor store back in the 90s I went crazy on direct mail sending coupons, and I was one of the first people have a website So I was like wait I can send coupons close to my dad's store Right, but I can send fucking mail to cherry Hill two hours an hour and a half away two hours from Springfield But I could say go to wine library calm and so I literally analyzed every zip code Gary be with no Okay, so cherry Hills so like the total wine and cherry Hills that big liquor store I like knew the day it came out in 1992 and analyze how they did you understand now all of you kind of know me a little bit Imagine 14 to 34 Yeah, and really 13 to 13 to 34 But 14 to 30 imagine 14 to 30 year old me having 100% of my attention To the liquor store New Jersey business and wine. That's all I care about right So I got all those bad grades up there in my report card It's why I don't have any story of fun in my 20s I was religious of building the biggest liquor store New Jersey for my dad Okay, but like where did that come from? Because like even if I say your dad wanted you to be glad I have I'm glad you're here You know where it came from gratitude. Yeah. Yeah, I was so grateful I understood somewhere around 12 13 15 17 somewhere in that you know junior high middle school high school Pre-college somewhere along the way I realized damn my parents are better Yeah, it was deep to belong before we talked about feelings. I was just like my mom is the best My dad worked. I don't really even know my dad like when I realized it I was starting to work with him but like my dad worked every minute to you know I was born in the Soviet Union We came to this country lived in Queens in a studio the size of this room with eight family members I'm talking really actually like people on the floor like the shit that people say on come-up stories I lived it and we didn't speak English and shit was hard and it was like really a tough time in America late 70s We were all fucked up with the economy and so I and This might resonate for a lot of people were watching or in this podcast or definitely listening I believe the person that is most unstoppable in life is the person that is lucky enough To be born into a family that doesn't have that much financially In the first ten years of their life, but they're happy as fuck right because they're shown That happiness has nothing to do with finance If you're unhappy in a home that doesn't have a lot you believe because the world tells you money will get you happy If you're in a house that is very wealthy and everyone's happy you think it's cuz the money Interesting, but if you're in a house that doesn't have much That is happy You as you grow you just know and of course these are generalizations when you sit in terms of course Do I believe there are people? I mean I have wealthy kids like do I think there are people? But you but you know what the problem is you can't fake environment. No No, you can't like the way all of us came up and everyone get you can't fake it No, right meaning like it is what it is like you none of us can feel the alternative I can be empathetic and understand, but I don't know what it's like to grow up where you can sit court side at a game I was just trying on one day when I'm older. I can buy a ticket to a basketball game right court side That's But other kids like like you know especially in the circles I run in now they think they should be friends with CJ shroud They just think that's just normal Yeah, so anyway, how'd you come up so so I do come from a household Maybe some struggle but middle-class a little below middle class. It was an up-and-down journey There was a time yeah, good Christmas is where I was lit. Yeah, and there it was like y'all I didn't get anything this year type Christmas. So I just fell in love with the arts. I my parent my dad gave me a camera when I was younger I was just into visual and acting and dancing I'll fast forward to I got my first car commercial with Target. Yeah got a $5,000 check and I was a kid Oh my god, how old think I was like 16 17. I was like oh my god I was like yo, I can make money doing stuff like this So then I did another low-budget Filitourism commercial, but there are two sixes dancers in the commercial at the time I did martial arts I did like flips and tricks and I was doing these flips and tricks in the commercial and the dancers came up to me was like Yo, you'd be perfect for the slam dunk team for the Philadelphia 76ers. I just wanted their number Followed up showed up to the audition. I wasn't even that good, but they liked the karate that I did Yeah, and your charisma. I I wasn't even in the sports. It's funny. I just thought it was a coach in a team I didn't realize there was community relations marketing. Yeah, I didn't know any of that So of course you were kid. I end up getting a job my first game I'll never forget it. I walked in and I just looked around and saw the energy and I was just like I want to be here So for that day forward, I became the super intern kid made every mistake been ever made it twice No, no, everybody's name came early left late that whole story, right? By the way talk about a lost art I'm just gonna say I'm gonna rewind it and have him repeat it The amount of kids this is why I fuck with the guys and gals that come to my team were very selective But it's getting harder 10 years ago. I could find a thousand super interns. There was unlimited kids Who are like, yo, I'm hungry. This guy's got a platform that he I get put on and I'm coming Real and not that I think Gen Z is lazy in this and that it just she got different Yeah, I just want to skip a lot of steps. Yeah, and honestly, I don't Say this real careful. I'm not judging the kids right now. It's just different right zoom Do I have to the government gave everything money? They think they can do it faster, right which I respect the fuck Yeah, each shit for a five years to get on if you think you can go get on right now All right, but like the whole vibe like super intern doesn't exist like they used to I think they're just smarter than us and there's more options to get Ginger beloved said Christian is cute and charismatic How'd your world go what kind of kid were you in Houston man Houston it was all about sports where I was at Everything is about my high school was if you weren't getting a scholarship like you just weren't as good as everybody else So yeah, the athletes were here everybody everybody else Everything was very computer. I saw our right track. That's that Texas shit No, I was the high school was the epitome of Friday night lights the whole and the basketball state twice everything was football Football basketball track. We all went to state. Well, everybody killed in all this everybody was just amazing. How was your baseball team? So everything was just very competitive even our practices were like full speed everything you played sports And I was the sports first was all high school So I actually ended up going to Howard to run track in DC and when I got there I was I'm not going to the Olympics like what am I even doing here? So and like you kind of said before about like how thinking things were just like unfathomable I had no knowledge like the music industry like that like none of my parents are involved in that None of my family at all is really involved in the music industry So when I got to Howard actually was on a college radio station and it just taught me so much about just like that Industry I see media. Why'd you do the radio? So you were in school by me to school communications for something totally different And um, but they offered that as like, you know, I'm gonna get you know, just let me try this out So from then I ended up always want to go to Howard. Uh Well, probably when I was like a sophomore in high school. You were like, that's the target. Yes How did that day feel when you got it? Yeah, so when I went to DC to visit out of Uncle Dax you live in DC It's my first time even going and I got to know just like something is like really special and like different about that Even though what a dress and everything else a DC just like its own world Yeah, it's nations capital just driving by the White House every day was just like some And um, you really don't appreciate it until you like go there and then leave and come back It's like I really did just like every single day. So um DC just taught me a lot about just finding yourself within like Yeah, and you were also in that great. I mean 18 to 22. Yeah, you know, you know Every hour exactly, you know, it's a special time. Yeah, so with the radio station I started DJing in clubs and shit when I was probably like 19 years old And um, how much financial shit happened I had had to drop out and I actually kind of just ran away and moved to my grandma I had just passed away. This part like 2011 or something like that so I moved to Easter Island, New Jersey and I would just get gigs out here in the city for like maybe $50 to $100 a lot of times It was free just like for the look or whatever Of course I was sleeping in Penn Station at a point just to like you were super internet super internet So super intern for a company exactly other people super intern for the market, right? Like I super interned for the market right I sold shit my whole life All right lemonade baseball cards flee markets my dad's liquor store like the market was my boss Right, I didn't have a boss ever the world the world exactly in Super interning for the world That's what you're doing you're growing y'all just grinding, you know, I feel like you know And I had no doubt at any point when I was even asleep on the floor just like Your grandma lived there exactly so I would do gigs in the city But I have trained other New Jersey transit wouldn't start again until like four or five in the morning So I would just have to just figure it out I'll just walk around Times Square like shit like that on some that shit awesome Yeah, yeah until I could get back I would just hop trains and like do whatever and um from there this is when The Darby was like really like the Darby on 14 and I got like an opportunity to DJ there one night And it turned from one night to two nights to three nights a week and then when it became up and down I was like my whole shit. I was there like you were that guy. Yeah, I was there up and down on one I really missed those clubs man for a lot of kind of clubs. So he's at the east I was like my whole that's when you were making your that's when I like to find my own as far as like being a DJ And turn it to Vegas and like whatever you have now and then um, let's back to flowers Who are some of the homies that saw you man? DJ Clark Kent, bro. Yeah, you go DJ Clark Yeah, I mean like yeah Clark Kent. I'll probably say him like every interview I'll ever do this Obviously I just looked up to him so much He was cool and he wasn't like a old guy that tried to be young like he was like oh He stands on being like yo, I'm old though, but I'm like the tightest old nigga Yeah, like he's gonna be like I'm the I'm the dopest old nigga you're ever in your life You know, you never like tried to like yeah youth down, you know, but you down And he just kind of told me he really broke down the game of how you can do it Make money like even aside from clubs and like gigs or whatever to like really enterprise yourself as a This meet these kind of exactly so shake every one's hand hello to everyone I saw some people in the comments on twitch say memorizing everyone's name is real which is super hard as me I'll tell you Names is real hard for me But moments as you saw with Christian like I'll tell you shit that app like that is my superpower Yeah, I'll bring up crazy shit, especially if I see someone that I know I know Like you mean to be like yo, so you're boss at 13 years ago Visual I got it audio and visual I got it But it's why I have reading comprehension something with names just doesn't Anyway, nonetheless. Yeah, so not definitely all credit to do that car camp for you know He's not the point if I said you like what was the moment where you knew you crossed over from like to come up to that next stage? Which one pops in mind man? I just really I know it's millions pebbles to get to a boulder I'm like 87 different things I can tell you like what's one one moment a moment I feel like so often I signed a record deal in 2018 in Columbia and um Just even at that point I never really thought of myself as like putting my own records out and put music out or whatever But even to just when I when I was on that radar of like yo You're much bigger than like what you think you are right now and have to I basically had every single label that call and just like you Yeah, so at that point I was like oh, this is bigger than me just being Present and like at a trap show or in a club. It was like this is gonna turn the market. The market was something much bigger Yeah, so at that point I was alright. How do I shift this into like something much more than what I'm doing right now So, man, cool. Yeah growing up in London Tottenham. I grew up. Yeah when Tottenham was Very different. Yeah, we got a little gender-fied. Yeah, we know what you're saying indeed indeed Yeah, man, I mean I grew up at a time. Unfortunately, it was it was quite quite violent. I lost a few friends So even like in the early 90s, I would be in New York a lot. Yes I'll be staying in Brooklyn flatbush with my auntie and just to kind of get out of trouble from in London You know, I let it calm down. Yeah. Yeah, it was crazy. It was like that. Yeah, it was really bad Like you had to go to America to hide For me, it was just it was it was the fact that I just had a lot of friends and I want my best friend got murdered and It just kind of yeah Yeah, so I was like that's tough. Yeah. Yeah, so, you know from then I mean and for me in terms of like business I knew from 15 I went to work for myself, but I had to do the university for my parents Yeah, for all the kids that are listening and watching on Twitch and even for you youngsters like again when we were come out I just turned 48 40 40 said, you know, like it wasn't like that. Yeah, like at 15 when we both felt it It wasn't as obvious it is for everybody right now. Exactly. I said there was no it for you There might have been internet internet was popping. No, no Like you couldn't do anything. Yeah, there was like no there was not a single every single influencer that you know That's under 20 making money. There was not one of those that existed when I was 16 Not one. That's it. The most famous business person for us coming up was Bill Gates And he was the nerdiest-looking dude on earth And it was like, I don't want to be that Like You had to be like this genius to even Yeah, it was so dorky. Yeah, right. It was like dorks Yeah, like like and it was like and not that like Bill Gates is a dork, but that was like the image That's what exactly plus in cool culture. It was street guys It was it's not what hip-hop is now it's fashion this it was if you were not hard. Yeah, you weren't in yeah Yeah, that's it back to even like where people grew up Do you do you know that people that came up hip-hop in the 80s and 90s? If they had an auntie in the hood, but they grew up in middle class they would tell people they were from the Yeah, you just like you couldn't say you were from like it was that much the currency Hard and rough nothing else not creative. Not nice. Not nothing just And then yeah, so you know from from school had to university went down a university and then straight from university I graduated to like 2000 and 2003 as I worked in my own businesses. I had an installation company property investment company Done well in property Quote-unquote I made the million in property. That's what I was my dream to just make a million, right? Yeah, maybe by about 20 Let me say back to kids that are like 44 and up a Million oh And now That was literally the next sentence out of my mouth Yeah, just so everybody knows 20 years ago Making a million is the way people talk about making a billion. Yes, it was that not achievable Yeah, for almost everyone. Yeah, and now we all walk around and these kids are confused Like the okay, so America very rich country one of the richest in the world if not the richest I don't know where it sits with China these days. Mm-hmm the top 1% of Earners in America the bottom the last person in the top 1% the top 1% is 440,000 a year If you make more than 440,000 you're in the top 1% of people in America No, that's why man. That is and this is where this is this is why these conversations matter Some kids listening right now who thinks if he doesn't make a hundred million he's a loser Yeah, a million not so much Not to cut into your story Contents nowadays words like if you don't if you don't have yeah, then you're this type content Yeah, I don't know why I'm seeing so much but let me let me tell you to it straight It's not like we didn't have that Everyone's like oh, we have it so tough right now everyone saying this well We had less content. There was no Gary V talking real shit and what we had was MTV Cribs As all of a sudden the world is pushing like stuff it's been pushing stuff always Like and we have no other things to find they've been telling lifestyles of the rich and famous was a smash hit Yeah in the 80s Robin Leach British voice telling me as an American seven-year-old boy like if I don't have a yacht I'm a dick So it's been there the difference is I see it flip everyone's like all social media did it I'm like I see the flip at least we now have people saying other shit facts because Chains and bottles and models and probably they've been pushing that right facts indeed indeed. Yeah, so Yeah, I made made it made quote-unquote a million but improperly by by 26 27 They lost it by 28 credit card happened credit card happened. I lost my contract. You were over you were over leveraged Yeah, and I was and I was I was young because I didn't know yeah I was had an installation company. I was making a lot of money, but I just didn't have I was making so much money I didn't you want saving. Yeah, and I didn't have the The kind of people around me to be like look this is business. I was straight into it I feel like they use yeah, it's whatever business man. Yeah, that's yeah crash and burn a little bit So really learn how to really manage your finance. I'm really happy you said that it's why I want to talk about shit that I talk about Yes, ish Right the business man and woman the 80% that's about the stuff The 20% that are about the game never have that happen, right? They're not buying dumb shit, right? They're not overledveraging three properties because they know if God forbid it goes. I'm at zero Yeah, right they're not buying shit to flex Look the amount of people that want to be rich just to buy stuff to impress people that they don't even like right it's crazy You want to talk about a model that's fucked up the amount of people that want to be rich at all costs and fuck their lives up Just to buy shit, right? To flex on people yeah that they don't even like They don't even know don't even know yeah, don't know even know exist for it But what's funny is people flex for someone they know let me say yes But it's always to show the girl that didn't give you that time Yeah, show your dad that didn't give you that love show your mom that said you would never amount to nothing show show somebody Then there's people that are about the process. This is why I was so happy. I was built properly I didn't do that shit right this is why like the Gary like I don't even give a fuck about me I do you know why I like the Gary Vee thing for my parents right? They built me what the fuck that I do I didn't have sex they had sex You know like for y'all I just did it you know for y'all I'm saying stuff and maybe I can have an impact But they did me so like when they're like you're the greatest You mean Sasha and Tamara Vaynerchuk. Yeah, they made me New Jersey made me and the immigrant life made me I it's definitely like so important to what you were saying just like when you said who your environment and To your point when you said watch who you're around because Especially for a lot of black entrepreneurs or black businessmen Depending on environment not every black person. I'm depending on environment There's a lot of times when we make that breakthrough and to wow this is working. Wow I'm actually bringing in some income. We don't necessarily have Yeah, an environment that tells us hey you need to put this amount of money away Black comma anyone who doesn't come from an environment of money facts in 20 years You'll be hearing a lot of people saying it from Latin backgrounds All right, I came up in the hoods of Texas in Arizona like it's all it's whoever at them Like it's just it's a money thing Yes, and by the way a lot black white Hispanic like gender race religion sexual orientation It's the people around you. This is the point of why I think this is a special era Everyone's telling you that all this shit on this phone is garbage and yet the only good stuff Is found on the phone? Yeah, you definitely got a filter for your cell on the TV and tell me what's so incredible That's helping the youth Jack First time the news coach Lori cash the news like please Twitter because I twitch is live Tell me this incredible TV show that's raising the kids right cuz I can show you YouTube channels I can show you Instagram. I can show you tiktok of people putting it down Tell me the fucking TV show give me the newspaper the radio program Fuck out of here with this bullshit. Yeah, that's a good point Like I get the reason people are shitting on all this stuff is because it's where everyone's paying attention Like I'm you know what is TV Someone said ESPN I'll give you that Counter that sports now has these talking heads shitting on guys constantly Yeah, I'm gonna say yes, but I'll report injuries before they post anything Kissed the other day about the about me and ESPN has talking heads Trying to get people to watch which and there's a lot of good dudes and ladies on the SP I know a lot of them. They don't need they don't even realize what's happening. They're in the cons. They come in innocent They're like I need ratings They don't even realize how it metabolizes and you start trying to be positive and you're like oh my ratings aren't there And you say one thing about somebody and like whoa, and then we're getting seduced By rubber necking when you're driving You're not paying attention when there's not an accident, but when there's an accident you're looking yeah, that's true Yeah, so the media figured that out and they're shoving all this garbage down our fucking throat This toxic accident thing just hit me This is why I'm fighting so hard I'm fighting so hard to like the good shit. Yeah, we got to figure out how to make the good shit Giving flowers when alive saying what I said to you like act people the reason to remember it as people don't do that shit Mm-hmm We got to figure out a way collectively all 8 billion of us and definitely the few of us that are so fortunate to just be good We have I always say negativity is loud as fucking good at marketing and positivity is silent No seriously and the reason I'm so fucking loud is I'm like well I can only control me Yeah, I can't tell all of you to do it if I don't do it Right now I think what really helped me there's a quote everything speaks and it's like from the clothes that you wear How you carry yourself to the music you listen to everything you consume everything everything speaks What are you saying and when I heard that quote? I was like wow like okay? What are you saying is a word or are this some of my actions are this but That's saying something completely different than what I stand for it's like sad to evaluate myself right and once I became Extremely intentional and had intent behind every action that I made and I started tracking my own actions I started seeing results like to your point with social media It's like I actually started on following accounts that were posting crazy stuff Yeah Is Manifestation you really don't have any time for negative energy Manifestations bullshit. I'm like manifestation is slang for being intentional I'm like no you took those seven meetings right you did that Real quick actually let's open a pack of V friends With friends this while we're open to this shit. Tell me what you're paying attention to tell me something that caught your eye In the world recently what's something that's like really poppin really pop right now like yeah, oh shit you hit a monster What's that? Oh? Let's fucking go Like I'm like oh, I just got the unicorn and I don't know what that is This is my Pokemon meets Sesame Street thing I'm building called V friends. I'm building for the rest of my life It's a bunch of characters you pulled the gritty ghost. Yeah hearing how you came up This one really hits right for you. So you got to hold on to that and it's out of only a hundred. This is a big car That's not fair. That's real money. It was going on another Oh Tell me which character most resonates with you okay, which character when you look at it I'm gonna go first and I'm gonna say the adaptable alien because I think one of my greatest skills is being adaptable The reason I fuck with people so much is I'm not scared of people Any people I'm around different I look I got very lucky. I grew up in Edison, New Jersey I went to Martin Luther King elementary school. Oh, we had a real melting pot. You already know what's MLK So it was black, but I had a better than black white Indian Asian Brian Chen was my friend in third grade Robert Lee then Natheal Halal like we had it all like you know I didn't know I was a kid when I got older especially in the last 10 years where you realize diversity matters. I'm like Damn not only that. I have the great parents. I had the great environment. I learned how to love everyone We were just all mixed crazy. I don't like I actually have it on my Instagram my second grade picture What I posted that people like oh you weren't kidding because literally there's 20 kids in a class And it's like for these for these for these for these and for these And that's just a fucking gift, right? You know anyway, so I'm gonna go adaptable alien Okay, whether I'm talking to the biggest CEO in the world or I'm in a third-world country building a school for pencils of promise I doubt everybody in between. Yeah, I'm just good with people so adaptable alien. How about you? I'm gonna go agree What does grip mean for you hard work man I'll work and just just do you think the world's demonizing hard work a little bit right now I'm like don't burn out. Oh no, 100% 100% but balance is right. Yeah Balance is right don't burn out But do you think we maybe go a little far? We're like like a little bit of entitlement and a little bit of lack of balance like people trying to win without putting in the effort I'm not saying this just for you. Yeah, I'm in love with hard work. I just I just love hard work my parents work there All the way, you know, so yeah, I just I just love it. Which one might I I'm gonna go right here with the with the graceful goldfish Yeah, um why and just because everything I've ever done everything I'm doing everything that I'm gonna do I try to approach with a real level of professionalism and just and just grace and grace, you know, and I'm just yeah dudes that are cool saying the word grace Yeah, it's literally the mission statement of my life Yeah, watch it this man right now Like, you know professional grace, right? I'm like what our grandma's liked is now right Meaning like grace right like respect my big thing right now that I'm hot on is we're putting youth on a pedestal Mm-hmm, and we're underestimating wisdom and age right 50 years ago The elders had all the respect and it's nothing. Yeah now we flipped it because the technology social Everybody older wants to act young you said about DJ. You even said it exactly I think we need to get back to like respecting people 70 to 100 on the way they earned it Right real talk we I watch people at the airports. We are just losing our shit Yeah, like not getting up for like I watch these three dudes just sitting there Nice, they weren't bad dudes, right? But the fact that a grand I watched it I watched it because I'm on it so I'm looking yeah this 85 year old ladies to walk in by them you could tell I was like behind I was standing doing a call Before the airport this is like two weeks ago three weeks ago, and these dudes are just chilling Not bad did not like out of a movie where they're like Just normal dudes But this 85 year old lady is like clearly like tired Like it just clear like she's like looking and I wasn't even mad at the dudes real talk I'm just mad at where we're at yeah 40 years ago all three of those dudes would have been like yeah We just don't teach yeah I would say my biggest inspiration just as far as like media goes I was my favorite show ever was a different world just because of obviously I went to an HBCU and that was But just the way they looked and the way they acted the way they talked on it was just different It was just so much more professional and graceful doll grace says why can't someone cool say grace? Everyone cool can say grace. Please tell me the last time you've seen a 15 to 25 year old cool person Talk about grace is important. We don't talk about grace now We got a different slang for it. Maybe respectful like there's some other places, but it's everybody can say anything they want I'm saying what we're not it's not 23 year olds that are popping in social aren't making content around manners Grace I love that you did that bro graceful go fish man. I love it go fish Go fish are a great snack so I'm gonna go with that So I noticed this guy had the highest score so that gravitated me towards it But then I read it and it says thoughtful three-horned Harpick So I am trying to be I actually had to have one amazing pair But had two amazing parents that raised me who taught me that purpose is above all and so growing up I relate to a lot of things you said because I At a young age was thinking through like well that doesn't really align with what I believe in or what I want for my life So I'm not gonna do that right It made saying no with this so much easier for me So once you know how to say no to things the yes becomes more clear So thoughtful because I'm trying to be as thoughtful as possible right now I just started trying to make content that I knew wouldn't perform well that just means something to me So I've actually I don't think I've made a video about grace, but I have started making like not pot not a podcast But where I'm just speaking On a microphone just talking about things Number one genre of content creation that no one's doing right now in my mind is you have a thought You're you'd not you don't have a video person around you yet. You're not there yet You don't really love doing the video like this cool hit the memo Talk save post that shit right words radio right shit works still that's crazy Yeah, it's sure I do see that a lot like if you got a thought that you believe in pop it record it You could put some video on top of it later or just post it I think someone's gonna own that and it's gonna make it easier for people But I love that big shout out to the hard pick. Here's the big one. You ready for this. There's 283 B friends It's a big world. Yeah, there's only one made-up character Everything else is something you know an alien a wombat an otter a ghost a worm a duck The only character I drew and made up is the heart pick a heart pick whoa Ladies and gentlemen, come on chat talk to me What up what else is happening in the game that's caught your eye that you're confused about that you're thinking through that you're being thoughtful about or Give some roses. This is one. I love a lot because this shit's so fun to look at five years later How about somebody coming up that you see? Hmm that you see that's a good question I so my the first thing that popped to my head is just what what is what I'm becoming more aware of more than anything Is the shift in? What works so okay what I mean by that is? Think about sneakers. Yeah, we were talking about this off camera. Yeah, by the way, somebody just said I'll buy that goes for That's when you know someone's When someone doesn't know the value of something gets thrown something real at them, but their instincts are like I don't know if you've seen but I always do this in every photo I take Okay, because my mom knitted me a jersey when we couldn't afford a jet's jersey when as a kid and put the number five on it So every photo I ever take as a head nod to my mom and as homage to her and how she built me and why people even want To take photos with me is because of her I throw up the five as a little token Like even some of these Anyway, that's probably why but anyway, I'm sorry go ahead We were talking off camera and like the hype era of sneakers is Dead and I think when I'm looking at social media I'm looking at content the era of doing the wild thing to get attention. I can see it Shifting shifting. Yeah Look if they're good at it. Mr. Beast like this is yes That's just gonna work. That's a lot of talent. Yes behind that's a lot of thought. That's a lot of planning That's a lot of effort Yeah, that's all of it I'm referring more to the the content that lacks any sense of death from any standpoint where they're creatively Where it's just going, you know what it's called supply and demand right we got filled with that. Yes. Yes. So now we're looking for something else, right? Yeah You know something I would like to person. I love giving flowers. Yeah, that's not what we wanted to I'm gonna get back to that but Just personally right now what I would like to see is that with all of these I only want to say kids But there's this next generation coming up so fast and doing these things. I would like to see them even Give like, you know how we have like master classes from you know, ROGs or whoever I would like to see them start teaching the kids below them now about just Teaching these 1920 you know about Jen alpha. Yeah, so Jen alpha's coming right exactly I think they're they're still debating what the year is because that's what they do But call them 13 and under all right. Okay. They're coming next and they're gonna be moving faster than we did in Early science because I'm spending a lot of time reading this the early signs is they got judgment for Gen Z Right, Jen alpha's it's so crazy how fast it all moves exactly. I was coming out saying yo Gen Z you talk big game But you're full of shit, right? You gotta give the codes man. You gotta give the codes crazy 9 year olds looking at their 16 year old crying about some shit, but not doing shit, right? You gotta give the cuffs. I would love to see them Bro, it's that next generation. Yeah, cuz we have this 19 20 year old millionaires from You know building all this content and they're literally like building our websites and you know, they're there's Building on enterprises and empires and everything just really just come down just give the codes to the next generation I think it's been the story of my life.

I'm like man Should I like read it just like refresh ideas because the shit I talked about there I've like this internet thing and like you should do YouTube and like I predict that people will make a hundred thousand dollars a Year on YouTube and everybody read it back then and was like you're a fucking idiot like like you know like like and all I wish If when I look at all those books when I think about what this this comes out I've never tried harder to give everybody all the cheat codes Because it feels important it creates admiration it creates real relationships What else are you seeing?
