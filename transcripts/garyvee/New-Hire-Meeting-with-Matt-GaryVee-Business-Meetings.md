## Transcript
Nice to meet you. Give me one sec. I'm doing really well. How was your weekend? It was good, how was yours? Good man, family. It was hot as shit. I know. We had a baseball. We had a birthday party for my little guy. And it was fucking bad. Yeah, it was hot for a long time. Do you guys have a pool you go on or something? We do, but my wife decided it wasn't a pool party, which I don't know, wasn't necessarily the smartest move of her career. But it was fucking hot. Yeah, it was like 90 with the humidity and stuff. What'd you do? I went to Splish-Flesh, I don't know if you've ever been, it's like a water park on Long Island. Dude, you know what's so funny about that? This is not a joke. I think I like water parks more than anything on Earth. Oh really? Like Wet and Wild is like my favorite place on Earth. Really? Have you ever been to Splish-Flesh? No, where is it? It's Long Island Riverhead. How far is that from the Hamptons, like an hour? Not even, probably like. Splish-Flesh, I'm gonna take my kids there. Yeah, it's probably, it's supposed to be one of the better water parks. Places, you enjoyed it? Yeah, it was fun. I've been there before. I live on Long Island stuff. Yeah, so tell me about yourself. What are you doing here? Bud Light, a good executive. Yup. Really enjoying it. I'm excited about that new transfer and stuff. Yup. Just to keep learning and growing, taking on more. Good. How'd you get here? I worked at Speed. I worked at a digital agency on Long Island. And I actually worked with someone you might know, Jacob Erlich. Yup. Yeah, he was my boss. We're actually good friends. But I worked there. I knew about you. I reached out LinkedIn. Away you went. Yeah, thanks. Good for you, brother. How long you been here? Four months. Four months. And how's it going? I like it. Good. How's the culture? Good. Speed's good. My team's great. We all support each other and everything. Who's bringing you value? Yeah, he's the best. He does a lot. He's a good dude. He's a nice guy. But everyone on the team's super supportive and good. Love it. And so tell me a little bit more about yourself. Long Island? Yeah, Long Island. What are you into? A horseback riding. No. Back to back horseback riding. Last person too. Yeah. Yeah. Good for you, man. Yeah, I volunteer at a place. I'm into fitness. Exercising. Good shape. Reading. Just trying to better myself, I guess. Awesome. And good for you. Yeah. Siblings? No. Solo. Yeah. Love it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very cool. Yeah. Anything I can answer for you? No. I mean, what do you think I could do to bring value to my team more as an accountant to shifting into this new role? I have a really good answer. Asking questions and then listening to the answers. I think a lot of people are scared to ask. Like, it's scary to ask what may seem like something you think he thinks you should know as the biggest thing that holds people back. Deploying enough humility to ask the question is the game. I'm actually giving you a piece of advice that I wish I took when I was younger. I had too much pride in thinking I knew. Too many people here are just yes-ing. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, got it. Yo, I know, right? The number one thing you can do by bringing value is actually closing the gap on anything you don't know and you do that by asking, you know? And I would just form more relationships. I think one of the biggest mistakes youngsters are making here is we have such a nice culture. So you go and you homey up with super cozy, but there's all these other people. Like, where's your relationship? Like, you should ask Jokatron for 15 minutes. Seems scary, but it's not, not here. Not in a world where I do it. Got it? Do it. It seems weird or on the creative side of hitting up Todd Bradley. Being like, hey, can I grab 10 minutes with you and just, it seems tough, but it's the number one fucking game. And if you feel like in a couple months, you're still not doing it and you think about this, you're on the train, you're like fuck, Gary said for me to do that. I haven't done it. If you need me to help, I will. And I've done it a couple times. Some people have just been like too introverted or didn't think it was appropriate. I'll do it for you. I'll send the emails, tip in suit and be like, hey, jam with Maddie for 15 minutes. All right? All right. What can I get for you with this? I'm good for now, man. I'm uncomfortable with like asking for stuff. I like giving more, but you know, but being a part of the culture, bringing people value, being a good dude, being patient, humble, but confident, work hard, those are good traits. Awesome. Thank you. Real pleasure, man. I wish you well. Thank you. I will, I'm gonna do it. I'm actually gonna, I'm literally texting my wife right now.
