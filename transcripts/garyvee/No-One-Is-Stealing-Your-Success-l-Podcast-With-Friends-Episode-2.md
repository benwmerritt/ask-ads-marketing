## Transcript
My big thing is someone else's victories are not my losses. Like this scarcity mindset thing is fascinating. In sports, you play a game, someone wins, someone loses. It's why I love it. It's so absolute. But in life, like not games, 7,000 DJs could be winning. Plus every DJs winning is different. Attention is the number one asset. Podcast with friends is live, episode two of the show. I'm excited about this one because I think for the audience that's listening, you're about to meet three new friends. Some of you may know some of them. Some of you may know all three, which I would love. First big shout out to Twitch. Again, if you're listening to this podcast, we are now also doing this live on Twitch all the time. And so I need to give a quick couple of shout outs. Oh, Bird's UK is on, which is always nice. Big V friend community member. T-Walsh giving Boyd love. T-Walsh, if you have any problems working for Boyd, put it out here in the Twitch comments. I'm gonna allow all three of our friends to introduce themselves. And then we're just gonna talk about a bunch of stuff. But one thing I do need is Boyd, go out there and tell them I need some of B-Friends packs for our friends and some of that swag on the table. Dustin, I thought you guys were gonna have like. Change you up. No, no, no, no. Anyway, let's do this. Why don't you say hello to everybody? Tell everybody who you are and what you do. Hi everyone, I'm Ashlyn Harris. I'm a newly retired professional athlete. Spent all my years playing soccer. Yes, quite successfully. You're gonna be humble now. Please give a little bit more juice for the people that don't know because it's not that simple. You truly are one of the. It's one thing to be like, oh, we're tired of athletes. It's another thing to be like actually. We're tired of athletes, right? One of the best at what you did kind of thing. So go a little bit. I'm giving you the permission to be a hairless humble because really wanna think just to let you know and more importantly the audience, or equally importantly the audience because this is new for me. I've always loved the idea of getting different people together from different genres like in real life. Like this is how I like to have dinner. Tarty. Like one conversation. And I just think this is a fun podcast strategy for me because for example, us, I want more. I'm so stretched. So this allows me to like spend more time with more people. And more importantly, I want my audience to be a renaissance man and woman. Meaning I think one of the things that's lacking is curiosity and expansion. And I think like what I'm excited about is I know over the course of the next five years that this podcast will be listened to millions of times. Obviously a lot upfront and then long tail. And I want people to know who you guys are. You're a sweetheart. So please go ahead. Let me try that again. Be a little less humble. Hi, I'm Ashlyn Harris. Retired professional soccer player, two time women's World Cup champion. One of the plaintiffs who fought for equal pay and women's soccer and kind of spiraled worldwide. So yeah, that's kind of my- That's a better start. Was that better? That's a little a hair press. Thanks for giving me, I needed that. Really, Clark? My name is Will Clark. I, from the UK, DJ producer, podcaster. Love it. And Andy, late edition, somebody who got sick and I was like, you know what, this is fun. Like even when something gets thrown as a curveball, I've always got real friends in the office doing unique things. So for a lot of you listening and watching Andy Kay, who some of you know, but I'm curious to see how he introduces himself and then we'll get into the show. Andy Crenac, I'm the president of VFriends. I've had the privilege of working with Gary for almost a decade now. Started as an intern for his book, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. And now I'm on the second episode of Podcast with Friends. As a substitute. Twitch fam, because I wanna really give you some incredible access, because I've never done podcast live before. I'm gonna allow for you to ask questions only about halfway through shows where you have context. So please be listening and feel free to jump in, put hashtag question and put your question and I'll rely on my incredibly good looking producers here to like figure out what they wanna throw at me ad hoc. But let's go back around the table. So these are always very timely. In the US, we just had Thanksgiving, but even if you were not in the US celebrating Thanksgiving, I'm curious for all three of you and we'll go back around the same way. As we're wrapping up the year, 2023, what was the thing that you most learned about yourself? Wow, that's such a great question. What I learned about myself, especially now going through a ton of therapy, is really prioritizing me and putting myself first and my needs, my wants. Feeling comfortable in that. Yeah, just like really for so long, it's been about other people. I have two young kids. I recently separated from my ex-wife, so there's just so much change. Going on. Yeah, so I've been prioritizing myself, which in the end is gonna make me a better mom, a better human, a better friend. I believe in it tremendously. I genuinely believe the best way to be selfless is to be selfish. Yes. I genuinely believe that. It's why I like entrepreneurship. I'm very aware that some people may demonize it, like that's bad, but I actually think, if you can't scratch your itch, or if you can't be happy, it's very clear to me that unhappy people make others unhappy and happy people make people happy. It's uncomfortably clear. And it's tough to say out loud, like I'm gonna be selfish to be selfless, but I actually have never seen anyone capable of selflessness unless they were in an incredible place. Well, it's like what you're working for as well. It's like the bigger goal is what is the end goal of all of it. And I think it's very easy to like just get caught in the rat race of just like, work, work, work, work. Do this, do that, do that. And then you forget the actual why you're doing this. And I think it's like... So pick us up. Did you learn this? What did you learn this year? I think that's the thing is like the why. It's like, it's very easy to just keep working. That was your year this year? Like you got more into why? Good. And do you feel like all of us, I'm sure all of us and everybody's watching, everyone's gonna listen like, you know, at some level you wake up somewhere in your adulthood and you realize, why am I still stuck in high school? Like why am I still in a place where other people's validation is the currency of my thinking? Yeah. Yeah. I think it's also the why can change. And actually like allowing yourself to change like the reason why you're doing it. And things can happen in your personal life that can affect your work life. And then it completely switches everything. It's like what you were saying, going through therapy, going through divorces, breakups and everything like that. All of that can change. And realistically we all do what we love, which actually adds into our real life. It is our real life. It's not work and life, it's life is all of it. Yeah, I'm a big fan of what you're saying. Like I just, I think the world is obsessed with ore and black and white. And I'm just like, there's no mapping to the way, that's not how life works. It's all and. There's no playbook. It's all gray. Yeah. Because it's too circumstantial. I love when people spew, listen, I live on the internet spewing things I'm passionate about, but I don't think I'm right. I think these are perspectives that I'm observing. And I'm hopeful that for someone in a stream, that moment, this topic could bring value. But I think everyone's spending time trying to convince everybody to see the world the way they see it. And it's just not the way it is. No, not at all. So for you, this was a big Y year. And did you come to any interesting conclusions? No, not really. What about? What about? No, but I think that's the process. I think it's a forever game. It's the process. But what about a running, what was a fun observation that you got out of it? I think for me, it was like, especially like taking it very to like my career. It's like there's space for everybody. I got it. So where you're going is, I don't need to compare myself. Exactly. You got it. Yeah, exactly that. I love that you went there. Like by the way, I'm obsessed with that. Like you're winning. All the time. That's for damn sure. First of all, I love it. Let's go. I love that. First of all, we're gonna end this podcast right now. Thank you for watching Twitch. Thank you for listening. But one's, my big thing is, someone else's victories are not my losses. Like this scarcity mindset thing is fascinating as if someone else winning in, you know, sports, you play a game, someone wins, someone loses. It's why I love it. It's so absolute. But in life, like not games, like 7,000 DJs could be winning. Plus every DJs winning is different. We're building an intellectual property. Pokemon and Marvel or in NFT land, the web three land, board ape or peg wins or cool cats. I want them to win. I don't think them winning means that VFriends can't, nothing, Pokemon Marvel, Hello Kitty, G.I. Joe, Transformers, My Little Ponies and every other, like Harry Potter, none of that is stopping me from achieving what I want. Well, I guess also the more they win, the more it brings people to the market. That's, first of all, that's absolutely right. Like, you know what, in your world, what really pisses me off is when someone is a pioneer in the genre. Yeah. And then it leads to more, I'll think about EDM because I'm 48, so watching that whole scene happen I watched it, similar to hip hop, but I was a kid when it hit. EDM was like, okay, I really understood what was happening. Oh, this is a genre. Oh, this is what a beach means to this. Like, this is cool. That's like run DMC. Like I understood. Watching people pioneer something, win, other people follow at scale. And then those people are mad at the people that created the thing because they think, like that always, you should be thanking them, not envious of them. If you weren't good enough, which is what it is. That's all it is. People are not willing to work hard enough. That's right, which is part of good. Like work, you know, when hustle became like a word I couldn't say anymore. Because the slang turned it into burnout. I was like, cool, I won't use that. Work ethic. Like I promise you, I know all three of you in different ways, nobody's at this table without work ethic. It just doesn't work that way. Nobody just hopes their way. No one's cutting corners here. It doesn't happen. Like I think people work hard and don't achieve things materialistically. But I've met very few people who don't have a sense of pride of their work ethic. One of my favorite people on paper is someone who didn't have entrepreneurial spirit, didn't have an X factor. By the way, didn't even want to have an X factor. Just takes incredible, I have many people in my circles whose number one pride is that they've worked their face off like a nine to five, but they put their kids through school in a world where their parents didn't and they're good. They're like, and now I'm just gonna bowl and drink fucking beer. And I'll see you on the flip side. It circles back around to the why. Well, that's it. Well, this is what gets me into like desperately trying to redefine success. Like one of my pet projects to the day I die is to change the conversation around success. Success cannot be money and stuff. It's why so many people aren't happy. Success needs to be understanding yourself and finding that place of peace because you're just in your process, whatever that is. How do you get there though? How did you get there? I got there by luck and I don't throw around luck. I hate that word. I hate it because people weaponize it against people that work hard. I worked hard, but you have to understand, I will say luck here because at six years old, I gravitated towards 90 year old people at the park in Queens. I think, I believe in old souls. I believe in some people just born with wisdom. I cannot tell you why at seven, eight years old, shit seems simple for me. I can't tell you why at 10 years old, I decided to not be good at school anymore because I realized it didn't matter. I can't tell you why I moonwalked through high school because I never, and I mean ever, have felt peer pressure, right? Or a need to fit in. I had really, really good DNA and I had a world class mother who found super balance between building self-confidence but not creating entitlement or softness. So like, it's why I kind of don't give a shit about me. Like one of the reasons I just walk around and like, I'm aware that people think I'm cool and I understand how many followers I have. I understand what's happening to me. I don't associate with it at all. I'm obsessed with what people that actually really have known me for a long time and people that are getting, I like care way more what you two now think of me in an hour than I did an hour ago. I'm obsessive about people that really know me what they think because my validation comes from people viewing me as a nice person. But as far as like the things that most people know me for, that's just not where my validation sits. And I think that just, there's a lot of circumstances that I've been led into it in the first 20 years. And then somewhere around 435, I'm like, wait a minute. Like it started becoming clear to me. I'm like, I'm telling everybody what to do in business. No one's doing it. Wait a minute, they're scared to do it. Wait a minute, why are they scared? Wait a minute. Grown-ups still think it's high school. For someone who didn't think high school was high school. That's what got me down the journey. If you look at my content, it evolved. It started with like tactical like do this on Twitter and it will work. And then I was like, why is no one doing it? And then it started getting into this, which is why I'm so happy that human beings now can say out loud therapy where 40 years ago you couldn't. Yeah, so true. You're going to psychiatrists, you're crazy. Now it's like, we're just 20 years away from people going to therapy the way we go to school. And that's good. It will be good. Going back on the success, how do you cope with that from being extremely successful in your career to then retiring and being like, what the fuck? It's my favorite subject of athletes. Really? Yeah, because I have a sports agency. And I grew up obsessive about sports. And I think you're asking an incredible question. I'm so happy. I grew up my whole life wishing I was an athlete, but being thrilled that I settled into being an entrepreneur because I got a little taste of it. But then as I got older, I'm like, motherfucker, these people, they found their, especially the one, you know this. Some people are athletes that really love their sport. Others are completely indifferent. It's their way to financial success or to get out. That was a brain fuck. But for the ones that love it, the idea of being in your 30s, if everything goes remarkable and now with modern medicine and training, maybe you're 40 if you're one of the greats of all time in whatever sport. But like most likely late 20s, early 30s. By the way, if you're in the 1% I was lucky. You know, like, and then you're such a young woman right now. I just turned 38. I played a long career. But you're a fucking child. Like real talk, I know you've lived a real life, you got a lot going on, you got kids, but real talk, 38 is like especially got like the way the like. Got a little more to live. Honestly, you're probably gonna live for a minimum of 62 more years. Well, I hope so. So but just think about that for a second. That's fucking insane. You've lived like a real fucking full like life. Mm-hmm. And yet you're a third in. So scary to think that way. And epic. Yeah, it's pretty cool. It is really. You have like another, let's say for instance, you stop work, you retire at 65, 70. You've got a whole new life to do what the fuck. Yeah, I mean, for me, I loved, like soccer was not who I was, it's what I did. But at some point your body takes such a toll and it affects your mental health so much. Like it just started to get hard to get out of bed. You know, like people don't realize how much, like especially women's sports, I have no pinch. I walked away years ago. I have no, I don't have 401ks. I don't like I have deal with this. And by the way, men's sports are not so fucking great either. Like at least they make millions of dollars where they get. But you know what's funny? If you're at the top, right? Yeah, like real talk, like the NFL. America's most popular sport, two and a half year average. Not long. And most guys are out of money after five years. Like because by the way, unless you go in the first, so the way football works is your real money comes in your second contract, which is the fourth or fifth year of your career. Almost everybody's out after two and a half. And if you don't go in the first or second round, which don't forget, if you're out of league in two and a half years as a first or second round pick, you're a massive bust and you have to deal with that. Mentally. Financially, you've got a little more money. If you're a third or fourth or fifth round pick, you're making hundreds of thousands of dollars, not millions. And by the way, you have to pay taxes. You're normally a cliche kid and bought some dumb shit like a house and a car and a chain. And so like most people that play in the NFL when they're 26 are finished with it and have to get jobs. And what people also don't understand is like, and you know, you've been in sports for so long. It's you're really a machine. I was trained to be a machine. And you lose sight of reality a lot of times because that is what your life is. That is who you are. You are competitive. I couldn't stand for someone to beat me in ping pong. I couldn't stand if someone walked upstairs faster than I. I love you so much. What am I doing? By the way, I'm on a mission to make competitiveness understood again. I think it's, I think- I drip with it. Look, look, as you know, it sounds like we're similar. Everything is good and balanced. Yes. I don't think it's nice that I like, I'm willing to like punch a kid. That's not accepted in society. I get it. But I'd be lying if I didn't tell you my chemicals. If like my son is getting really good at basketball and I'm like, oh crap, I need to beat him as many times as possible right now. Cause unlike AJ, my brother who was 11 years younger to me, I was, you know, he was, I think 17 the first time he beat me. I was 28. Like I was still like athletic. Like I was still 28. I'm 48. And my son is actually a modern basketball kid, which means he can dribble his, they're all step-curried out. He's all step-back. That AJ played more like the generation I came up with. There was no massive step-back to create separation and you can hit a three from half court. So you're saying your son is better than you? My son is so uncomfortably better than me. Now luckily right now, I'm also a grown ass man. He's a child. So I can still beat him 11 nothing. But I already envisioned this weekend after playing a little bit, I'm like, oh, I'm gonna have to like really get physical on him in two or three years. Like I don't need him winning before he's 15. Like I can't lose to a 12 year old, but I'm gonna have to body him up and like kind of weirdly hurt him. You have to, true, but it's very different when we were raised, we did everything. We played everything. Now everything's so specialized. Well that's cause all these parents are fucking out of their mind and think their kids are gonna be pros. Fair. These parents are so fucking delusional. I was at this Central Park baseball game a couple years ago where like these two dads were just getting out of my mind. I finally just like, cause I can get loud. I'm like, friends, nobody at this park is playing major league baseball. This is all fun and games. But do you understand what's going on in Central and South America right now? Like every kid is our kid's age three times the size and throwing 90 miles an hour. There's no soft kid in Manhattan going to the league. Harrison Bader is the anomaly, not the preview. All right, Andy. Yes, sir. What did you learn about yourself this year? I would say instead of the why, the how, you talk a lot about focusing on your strengths and punting your weaknesses. And I would say that's something I learned this year, how to scale everything we're doing at V Friends and in my personal life and not giving a fuck about things that I suck at and making sure that I have people around me. Give us an example of something you suck at that you came to grips with this year. Cause these vulnerabilities and like these real talks, like I'm watching the chat as well. Like what I think is happening, I had a hunch when I started this podcast that one on three, like when I do dinner, there's a reason like all of my friends over the last decade professionally have fallen in love with the idea of one conversation with five, 10, 15, not 15, five, 10, you've been in a lot of them. Five, 10 people at a dinner table. It's the fucking best and it goes like real. And already in a quarter way into episode two, I can feel it like there are different conversations that if I had you individually. So just cause there's so much trust between you and I, I have no idea where you're about to go, but I'm genuinely curious just to empower people listening, like go real real with me. What this year were you like, I'm just not good at this. Or I'm not as good as I wish to be. It's worth pointing. Not good at, it's feeling like because I'm in the role that I'm in, I feel like I need to do it. And understanding and being self aware that like, actually this person's better than me at that. And they're gonna do a great job at it. And I can let them run with it. Got it. So like having this major leadership role, what you earned from intern to this and it's high profile, especially in our role. And then learning the role of like, it doesn't, I don't have to be the one doing it as long as I'm understanding it. Boy, did you, Mike Boyd's in the background who's obviously done music with me forever. Tyler Walsh has now been with us for three years, four years. I actually just two. Two. Well, this is actually cool because I think this is the compliment and flowers I'm giving him. When Walsh joined the team, and you've been like this central figure, you my music plug, it's your identity. We have a playlist together. Like you're very well known. We've had a good run. I've been a little head down these last couple of years, but you had this coming off this crazy run in music and hip hop, our genre that we love so much. What did you learn that Walsh was better at than you? And did you struggle with that? Or did you like, were you ready for it because you were stretched? Or did it hurt a little bit because your whole identity in this thing was this. And you're like, fuck, this kid's got, because you were also going through a part in your life when you got married and you had a kid. And like, I assume when you're, let's call it as you two are A and R's. Like there's some advantages to having 15 hours a day to listening to music and finding someone that a Walsh coming up the game can do that maybe that you used to, like I'm curious for you. Yeah. Yeah, so Tyler Walsh, he's watching. He's the best. And when he joined the team, it was great to see him go above and beyond without me asking. Yeah, he's a self-starter. That helped me realize I could let him handle it. Yeah. Even on the way here, we were talking when I was driving and I told him, hey, we could talk about this in a minute. I need you to do something, but we'll do it together potentially. He already had it done by the time we hung up. A lot of times he'll send me a video and he'll be like, look, I really think we need to do this. These are the reasons it could work. Like I didn't even ask him to make the video. Yeah. And he showed up to work. He's like, I was reworking, rethinking everything we've been doing. Without his help, a lot of that would not even be thought about. I think about that a lot. I also think about you too and your, the things that, I think it's such a real thing, Andy. You know this. Go ahead, please. I see you want to say something. Well, it's another thing. It's really rewarding to watch the people that you're managing and the people around you get credit for the work and not feeling like I need to get credit. You giving daps to Ezra for something. I'm like, that's so cool. I'm so pumped that he got to get that validation from you. And I don't, and I think if that's happening, I'm in a good place and the team's rocking and rolling. I think that's right. Maybe I should join. What did I learn about myself this year? I think I've doubled down on like my kryptonite back to being lucky. And I'm comfortable making a Superman analogy, which is actually a weakness. My Superman mode of it all is a weakness. Like I was raised as the first, I was the oldest child in the immigrant family that was born in the old country that had a younger sister. From day one, my mom is like, you take care of her. Plus both my parents lost a parent very young. My mom lost her mom at five. My dad lost his dad at 16. Most of my childhood, I feared one of my parents dying. Like it was a constant play track in my mind. So like, I don't know. My dad worked every minute because we were an immigrant family. So I don't know. Like I thought, like I don't know. By seven for sure, I'm like, I'm the guy. I'm the leader. And like- But does that take away the childhood as well? Of course it does. It's a real thing in my life. Like plenty of like the way I think about my life. And when I go into like therapy mode, whether in therapy or like, cause I'm always in therapy mode, cause I'm always thinking like, yeah, there's a lot. So much of what made me me and like made me pop both in real life. And then, you know, since I last 15 years in public life is so much about that. But it's also my kryptonite. Like my lack of candor, Gary Vee is a candor beast. That's what people fell in love with me for, getting to the punchline. But in real life, if I loved you, it was really hard as a business leader, especially in my personal life. You know, like, you know, I really resonate with like putting oneself first. Like I enjoy making people happy. I enjoy- That's my problem. I get it. You think it's your superpower. Like I think my superpower is taking care of everything and making everyone feel safe. The problem is we're human beings. And so like when it was too much for me, it would come out as passive aggressive razzes. Like something, you know, like, and so like the way I would manage Boyd, you know, less because of the way our, but definitely Andy was on my content team said like, my go-to, if I was frustrated, was not to speak candorous and just like cut to the chase and move on, it was like little slights in jokey form because I didn't want it to be too much poised. But like- When you walk away, you're like, yo, what was that joke? It was true. Yeah. You know, for sure. And like you rely on the fact that you have a real relationship and I can get away with it because I'm providing a lot of value. But over time I realized that's not right. And it was my vulnerability. And so I would say the thing I learned this year was probably the continuation of something that's been the theme for the last five years, which is if I can ever figure out how to get great at what I now call kind candor, which I would say I'm at a four to five, let's call it 4.5 out of 10, but coming from 2017, Gary being at a one, that one to 4.5 has been fucking massive. How did you get that though? What's the process? Pain, realizing people that used to work here don't like me. And I was like, that's impossible. I mean, like how is that, all right. When I look at, please, please. You gave advice, I think it might have been, it was to some emerging musicians one time. And I always tell this advice now to, you had said they were about to pop, like really blow up and you're like, what I would say is you guys should have a day, once a month, every month, every quarter, where you go to the diner and you know that when you go to the diner, you're gonna lay out how you're feeling and everything that's pent up and it's gonna give you that freedom and space to be candorous. And so many times, so many times I used this example, like a cliche one that I did with my roommate after hearing that, my roommate like, wasn't cleaning up the kitchen and stuff. And it just gets annoying. I asked like one. The chats about this. The cliche one, I asked like what? Everybody had some roommate that was dirty. I was a dirty roommate in college, so I'm like, oh no, let's talk about your hat. Let's talk about your hat, I love that brand. Like, it comes. You ask what's your choice and then he's not doing anymore and I'm like, I'm gonna stop asking. But then the next time, you're like, it's resentment, resentment, resentment, resentment. You wanna go play basketball and I'll just blow up like, no, fuck you, blow up and he's like, whoa, what are you talking about? But then knowing I'm like, okay, that, oh, it's Friday. It's Friday, the last Friday of the month. I'm gonna tell Chris what's up. And they've just created like this safe space. It's really cool that I, as a, my parents are both therapists. So I grew up with that every night at the dinner table. And my brother would be like, can you not make us talk about our feelings? Can you like hit us like every other trip like out of it? I'm not a parent, but it's like, it kind of, we were so lucky growing up as a kid because it was like every night was like, how are you feeling? Like what's going on? Like, what have we done? What's somebody else done? And it's an amazing tool to have. It's, I mean, it's everything on the flip side. I think about purple a lot. So America's political system is obviously red and blue. And I'm just like, man, we need to start talking about purple because the flip side of, you know, this, especially growing up with those two kinds of parents, I'm sure, you know, maybe you, your family got fortunate because they found enough purple, but I'm sure they had contemporaries where all that thing went too far the other way. Totally, yeah, yeah. You know, back to competition. I am petrified of eighth place trophies. I don't even know that world. And I would tell you, I understand why it happened because we would have compassion for children. Of course. We would lose and cry, but the incredible amount of indifference we have created for a generation has led to a lot of depression. When you don't care, when you think, when you're 24 and you're like, think about what is the scariest thing to hear when you, as a parent, when you talk to your 24 year old and they say, it just doesn't, nothing matters. It doesn't matter. You know you're in trouble. You know you're having a combo of scary shit, substance abuse, having real conversations around suicide and things like that. Scary shit, the great fear of any parent. I just wanna remind people, it doesn't matter, is something that was instilled in kids' heads. And when you tell people that when they're six and they play and they are naturally built to be competitive or care, I know I can speak for us too, already in two seconds. When people, when I was seven, because they didn't say this back in 1982, but if somebody even, and some of my family did, if they even inklinged when I lost a monopoly or ping pong or pool or backyard football, if they even tried to broach the concept of, because I cried every time I lost for the first seven years of competition. So from seven to 14 I cried. When did that stop? Sure it was 14. Somewhere around 14, 15. And then it just started fighting. Yeah, I mean, I fought a lot as a kid. Because losing was devastating. The thought that somebody would say to me, it doesn't matter, do not tell a child who is wired to care, aka competitive, that it doesn't matter. Because you are confusing the fuck out of that poor little thing. Of course, the only thing, if one of the, if you just said, hold on, you us four need to race to the door right now, it's the only thing that matters. It's the reverse. There is nothing else. I think we've really created a culture of indifference. And I think it's a problem. Because indifference is the scary one. Like, it's wonderful if you're not competitive, that's beautiful. It's wonderful if you don't like enjoy UNO or, like great, but to take that away from the other half, I think has caused a lot of weirdness that people don't see yet. What do you chase or value more, the excitement of victory, or just never wanting to taste defeat? Like, did Nas has a quote, it's cool. Neither. It's cool to love to win, but it's better to hate to lose. I get it, I get it. Honestly, neither. The general genuine, excuse me, the genuine curiosity of where I stand. It's why I love entrepreneurship. And it's the truth, because when I think back of even winning gold medals or world championships, the second I do it, I'm like, great, what's next? 100%. What's next? That's the killer there. Look at me as a sports fan. I love the Jets and the Knicks, but I equally grew up a Rangers and Yankees fan. Equally, my high school friends always talk about this. Like, most of my high school friends think I was a bigger Rangers fan than a Jets fan in high school. But the Rangers won the cup in 94, and that was it. That curiosity was, I was curious what it would feel like to win a Stanley Cup. And then I did. And then it was just not as interesting. But on a deeper level to that, how do you, when you achieve things, because I can relate to that massively, whereas you set goals, you achieve them, and then it's like, what's next? But there comes a point when there isn't a next. I just think there's this inner competition that fuels me. So it's not so much about what you get from doing it. It's the process and journey while you're in it. Like, I fuck with it. I fuck with it too. Like, every day. Like, and I, and it's funny because we're gonna keep bringing up therapy because I'm in it a lot right now. Like, I was so, the amount of self-talk I had as an athlete, I fucking knew I was great. And like, I was so kind to myself, and I didn't cut corners. All of my confidence came in my preparation, but like, it switches off when I'm in the real world and real life. Oh, interesting. It's so weird. Did you have it as you were? It's so weird. I don't think it's weird. I think it's different arenas. Who we are as a professional is different than who we are in a relationship. Different than who we are with friends. We have a lot of different versions of ourselves. 100%. Like, I was not scared to knock on doors and sell stuff at six, but at 14, like asking a girl out was still like, I don't like, we have just slightly, you know, like, you're just different in different places. Certain places you have fear. Some people jump out of airplanes. I'm like, fuck that shit. But then here, like would never like try to sell something. They're like, I can't do that. Or public speak, like when that, when I realized how many people are completely fear public speaking, like I'm like, that's my bed. That's my home. That's the coziest place I know. That's cozier to me than anything I do. We're like the same. When I went to college, I took acting class, poetry class and public speaking for electives. Love. Because I was like, oh, do this shit in my sleep. I'm not doing stuff where I have to like actually work. And like, I'm good. Send me in front of a camera or in front of a group. And I'll just ask my way. I mean, Mike, I'm different when I'm cooking in the kitchen at work. You like just different versions. All right, friends, we're gonna open a pack of beef, friends. So these are my Pokemon meets Marvel, Sesame Street kind of world. Here's the game. Everyone, it's good. You can open. Everybody opens. And then I want you to look at all four characters and tell me which character speaks to you and why. Okay, I've got mine. Hmm. DJ Will, you go first. Which V friend of your pack, which V friends did you pull? Legit Lama, Boisereous Beaver, Shrewd Sheep and the sincere skunk. Okay. And which one speaks to you the most? Legit Lama. Why? I think for me, it's like, I know exactly what I'm doing for myself. And it's not about anybody else now. It used to be about everybody else and kind of caring about what everyone else. What was the tipping point? Some like, fat personal family stuff that happened. And it was just like, the focus just completely changed. And it was like, okay, now is, nothing, no one else matters. It's just, I'm just doing what I wanna do because I wanna do it. And if it does well, it does well. If it doesn't, I'm enjoying the process. It's everything. Love it. I'm gonna go with the fearless fairy right now. Let's cook and go. And I say this because I'm like in this pursuit, and I said this at VConn a little bit ago too. It's like, I'm tired of worrying about being understood. Yeah. I feel like as public figures, so quickly like narratives are constantly ran and questioned about your happiness, your health, who you are. And it's really conflicting and jading and it pushes you off your process a lot because it's like, you could read 500 comments that people say about who you are. You're the goat, you're the goat, you're the goat. And then one. And then it just like is so crippling. Can I tell you something on that? Please. This is real talk. Honestly, one of the reasons I'm saying this is, it's very obvious that the whole Andy Warhol 15 minutes of fame thing, like the whole, I heard this very early in Twitter, 2006, 2007. I don't remember where I first heard it, but the whole, it's not 15 minutes of fame anymore. It's everyone is gonna be famous to 15 people. Is fucking real. Like every child that's listening to this thinks about their personal brand. That's crazy. It's crazy. Now, I wanna remind parents that are like, this is fucked up, fuck social. That's how we all lived anyway. It was just that your personal brand was in the four walls of your high school. It's called reputation, but it's obviously different dynamics. I see it as amazing because some of us grew up in towns where nobody could understand us, but we could find our homies now on Twitch or TikTok. Like I like it. I'm aware of the reverse, but I will say something to you that I want you to hear, that I'm very passionate about, and this is for everybody who's listening, especially parents to say something to their kid. We talked about this earlier about selflessness and selfish. A human being that took time in their life to either find you or consume one of your pieces of content and their reaction was to take time to try to hurt you is in a very bad place. We have to as a society, this is just good for everyone. This has to become the way the world looks at it. We have to stop feeling bad for ourselves. Don't become delusional in an asshole and out of touch. Every negative comment I get, and I get plenty even though I'm a pretty positive guy because I'm just at scale. I kind of look at it like, hey, am I high on my own supply? Like this is like, I don't want, like I don't want to become a character for myself. I'm reading them all. Because I think it's valuable to check myself. But I do not internalize it. I deeply deploy compassion and sympathy for someone who's like, I have never in my life decided to go to somebody's account. No, never. Think about what I'm saying. We've not broken this down. You are laying in bed, you're walking down the street, you're on a plane, and you are in such a bad place that you want to go see someone else's light. And you need to make yourself feel better. Misery loves company. Sains exist for a reason. You need to close the gap on your wound. Your only reconciling, just like people go to drugs and alcohol and food and other things to deal. The way you deal with your unhappiness is you want to hurt someone else. That's bad. Have you ever reached out to them? All the time. I used to do it. You want to, do you know from 2007 to 11, I reached out to all of them? Every single person for five years that left me something negative, I interacted with. Yeah, I respect that. My shit was going so good for me for a while. Like everybody who was like, initially like, fuck this dude, it's cool. They were like, wait a minute. So now I had like, in essence, they became the people that most liked me. Of course, yeah, yeah. Now it's just at so much scale, I can't get there. But I really hope that everybody, not just us four, get to that place because it's 100% true. I was trying to think of a funny tweet where you used to reply a little bit, I just bookmarked this and I'm gonna come back to it in 2025 or whatever the case was. It was a funny rebuttal. Andy yours, what did you pull? I pulled Hype Horse, Unwavering Urchin, Skilled Skeleton and Bullish Bull. I'm going with Bullish Bull. I'm just bullish on life and the opportunities at hand. And I'm feeling bullish. You're in a good place? Yeah, I'm in a great place. I'm in America, I'm in Hudson Yards. I try to maintain perspective. And I just think every day is an amazing opportunity no matter where you are, but especially where I am. I love that. I'm going with Common Sense Cow. I believe that as the world becomes more complex, there's amazing things, we're more thoughtful. No humans like us four 30 years ago talk like this unless you were in a family. This was unheard of talk, unheard of love. On the flip side, what is it, Ignorance is Bliss? Yeah. One of the things that is incredibly waning in our society is Common Sense. People are overthinking everything so much that you've overthought it so much that you don't even know how to cross the fucking street. And so I'm obsessed with Common Sense. The reason I made Common Sense Cow was I knew I know that cows are easy to, sea urchins are a little bit weirder than cows. Like I gave a lot of thought to like who was what and who were they were gonna be and like fearless fairy for a reason. Like I like, you know, like, but Common Sense Cow is like super important to me because I'm gonna develop these stories for the rest of my life. I first thought it was more Disney, now I realize it's more Jim Henson's Sesame Street. Become incredibly impressed with Jim Henson's life. I didn't realize the magnitude of his intent behind Fragile Rock. You know what Fragile Rock is? You know that? It was a big show in the 80s on HBO when HBO was like new and cable. And it was huge, especially for Twitch. Who knows what Fragile Rock is? Give me some love. I'm sure it's been rebooted on the streaming source. Anyway, there was a creative brief that he gave to his writers to create a show called Fragile Rock. Usually these things are like a fucking packet or at least a mission statement. His entire thing when he, because we met the woman who did it was literally the whole brief. Stop War. Created Kids Program that will stop war. Yeah, honestly. It was a cool meeting. The woman who worked for Jim Henson. And she's in her 70s, a British woman. She took the call by way of an introduction. She didn't know anything about Gary. She had no idea what she was getting into. It was very clear within the first two seconds that she was there. That she was there to be nice to someone else. And probably maybe even did a quick. Outerly British woman, like very, very. Like maybe did a quick Google search and was like, fuck this guy. And then she got the Gary Vee keynote of what he created Vference for. And then she was excited. She's like, no, I mean. Not only was she excited, this woman probably paid me one of the great comp, especially, I was always like Jim Henson's rad, but like now that I'm being on this journey, I'm like, whoa, Jim Henson's like super rad. She paid me an insane compliment. She's like, she's like, she even, I think the reason we're both saying it this way, I think she was even like so British and straightforward. She was like, mate, let me just be real with you. I came into this just to check the, like she was that awesome. She's like, but honestly, I've never felt like this. Cause I really went, I felt like I needed to show her that this was real shit for me, not like I want to sell some fucking cards. And she paid me a really nice compliment and said that the way she was feeling reminded her of the way she felt as a young woman around her. Why did you start V friends? Because Gary V has been very effective. Like the guilt and gratitude that I have of the luck. Notice the word I used, one of my least favorite words in the world. I believe luck is weaponized by unhappy people to weaponize against people that are trying hard. I don't like it. That being said, I used it because I'm in guilt and gratitude of who I am. You want to talk like the vert I love the way you talked about being like ready for your sport. That's how I feel about life. Like I genuinely think I can beat everybody on earth in life. It's very unsettling. Like it's incredibly powerful. It makes me unwaveringly happy. Like nothing scares me outside of the health of the people I love, nothing. Especially when you know you're willing to live in the dirt. Like all this is garbage. Do you know my favorite Rockies when he lost everything and had to go back? Yeah. Yeah dude, I'm a weird one like nobody can ever fuck about. Like I love the process. Nothing, I went from not even be able to go to a Knicks game to finally being able to buy a ticket and sit way up there and now I can sit court side. And if tomorrow something happened and I went back to having to be only able to buy a hundred dollar or $300 tickets and sit way up. Okay. And what's going to happen? You're going to make fun of me that I used to. What does like I'm just, I can't. This goes back to the comments. Here's the key. I don't believe the accolades. Yeah. If you don't believe the accolades, you don't believe the hate. It's really interesting that because like when it comes to awards, right? There's awards in sports, there's awards in music, there's awards in business and everything. You've probably won awards for what you've done. Probably. Let's talk about being a businessman. If you talk to my financial people, they despise my relationship with money. They're like, you're a fucking businessman. I'm like, I don't give a fuck. I'm one of the lucky few. Maybe some people on Twitch will know where I'm going with this. If you were born into not much. Yeah. And you get to being about seven and your first seven years is filled with nothing but joy and happiness. And you didn't have shit, which is my life. My mother was so gangster in like pure, over the top, optimism, joy, love. She gave me everything of sunshine, rainbows and hearts. And we didn't have shit. So who the fuck do you think I am as a 48 year old man? I'm a 48 year old man who fully understands there's no correlation of money and stuff and happiness. And yet most of the world lives their whole life trying to buy a car or a chain or a building or a plane or because they believe that once they get that, then I'll show all. Everyone's running on resentment. I'm running on gratitude. It's also really easy though to say that from, we're all in a privileged point, right? It's very easy for us to say that. Well, this is why I keep referencing my high school. My high school friends know that I was making $40,000 a year at 26, living in a shitty Springfield, New Jersey apartment and knew I was the happiest person in the bunch. Even though a lot of them were starting to make money in Wall Street. And so like for me, yes, I am aware that 99% of people that are listening right now either don't believe me or don't know or will take me on my word. But I also know that there's hundreds of people that know it's true. I was more happy at 30. I just had less responsibilities. Diddy and Biggie had it right. More money, more problems, it was real. So it really is. When I was in my pure process, building a company for my parents, I felt at the top of my game. I was sacrificing my 20s to build a company for my dad and mom. What's more noble? Like I was fucking perfect. Now you get like all the noise and as much as I've got it, I'm still a human, like sure I got my force filled up. But like, you know, it's like, something can slip through once every two, three years for four minutes, you know? So anyway, yeah, I'm just incredible. Anyway, where was I going? Oh, be friends. I've done some real damage. Damage is a slang term of good. I have, you know this, you ran my social with me. You know this, I was like, I have unlimited DMs that are gonna come into my DM tonight of people talking about being suicidal, alcoholics, hitting their, do you know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of I just listened to a podcast and I don't know what the fuck you do or what, but you said two things and I just wanna be vulnerable with you and I feel safe in this DM. I've been hitting my spouse and I will never hit her again because of you. Do you know what that feels like? It's deep. It's deep as fuck. When I take selfies, it's not because I'm a world-class athlete or because I'm a fucking shockingly handsome or because I make people laugh or give them incredible escapism through sport or music or it's because I'm talking about things that they're actually doing either to sell things at garage sales and get their family out of debt or completely, it's what you're, it's why I admire your parents. In one gene of non-entrepreneurship and I'm your parents. I'm a guidance counselor, I'm a head coach, I'm a teacher, I'm a therapist. And so, V-Friends is, yeah, I've reached a lot of people but there's eight billion and I'm not the person that's gonna reach them all. And by the way, as every day goes by, I become less easy to be relevant to. My success keeps building. If you wanna reach kids, like I don't know if a 50-year-old white dude who's got a lot of money, even though my story's real, like it gets harder and harder. But guess what? A cute little bull or some of my favorite characters? Accountable aunt. Let's talk about accountable aunt. I believe the number one reason people are fucked up is because they're not accountable. You wanna get real happy real fast? Literally look yourself in a mirror and say, 100% of everything that is not working for me is my fault. And don't beat yourself up and say, I'm a piece of shit, I'm a loser, no, no. The second you go there, you realize you can then also fix it. But if you're blaming Biden or Trump or countries or China or the league or the media or social media or TikTok or Elon or Twitter or Twitch or Fox News or CNN or like, if you're just, well, then you're saying, I'm not in control, fuck. 100, I think even for me, like in my kind of realm, like social media is massive, as we all know, it's massive for all of us. But like the likes of TikTok, for me, like TikTok just doesn't do it for me. It's just not for me. And there's people that are in my career or in my industry that are way bigger than me because they do TikTok. And it's like, for me, it's like, except in the fact that I will never, I cannot stand it. So why do it? It makes me so unhappy. So why do it? I know I'm not gonna be as successful as them, but so what? It's like, I can't be bothered. I could probably own the jets, like business goal right now. If I was willing to do things that I didn't like. If I was willing to do things I don't like, it'd be a wrap. I would have started a crazy hedge fund or a private. Like I'm like, I would have just been an investor after I invested in Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. Like I was in it. Yeah. You wouldn't have the admiration that you have from others though. That's for damn sure. And not that like that's like, you know what's funny? It's not like, it's like, honestly, I just like, I've like back to like going through the process. I love my parents so much that like no question making them proud is like super big for me, but I got lucky because the thing that my mom put on a pedestal who predominantly parented me, obviously, like my dad is a big factor in my life. He just like to his credit, he worked to build our life. Then at 14 I worked with him every day. And so I got very lucky. I got them both more so than my siblings did. My mom's pedestal was not money. Was not had not fame. It was be nice to people. That's why positive reinforcement as parents is such an important thing. If you tell the reason so many people work for people is because their parents told them grades were important. And so they just became conformists. Get an A, aka be a good manager in a company. Do whatever it takes to do that. Yeah. Play the system. Which is a fake system. Just like, I don't know. Like it's such an interesting time in the world. Anyway, go please. Sorry, I do think. But I do think it's something to know, which I find I admire so much about you. To be so, cause you are such a giver. You are, your very, it matters to you how people see you and feel your presence. But you don't lose yourself in the process. And I feel like I, that's a learning. It's a real thing. Because for so long being in the spotlight, doing the social media stuff, I was giving, I was giving, I was giving. I was so empty inside. I was a shell of a human. So at what point, it's the hardest balance to find. It's complete. And it's a very fucked up thing. I, I always wondered, like, will somebody invent a machine that can actually like tap into you, like a lie detector test and actually show everyone everything, like I dream of this machine. Because if that happened right now, and I plugged in, you would fucking faint. How much good I want for you and want to provide for you. The problem is then there would be a comma after all of that. And that comma would be followed with you being like, what the fuck just happened? Because it would show you how much I do not give a fuck about what you think. Yeah. That is a super power. That is like pulling so, and that's why it's like such a fun life. It's why everyone I meet, I'm just like gonna give and give and give. And if you don't reciprocate, I don't feel bad. I didn't get the reason everyone's like, when I say nice. So I've been thinking about building a fashion brand called Nice Guys Finish First. Right? Great, call me. So people are constantly, constantly saying to me, you're so fucked up with this Gary. It's all delusional. I'm like, you just don't understand what I'm saying. Which is like, if you're truly nice, I believe most people posture manipulation into being that they're nice. Most people that like I've run across that are trying to be nice, are trying to be nice to me to set up the ask. Tony, 100% I remember when it first started to happen. Gary, I'll do you a huge favor. I see you're coming to Dallas. I'll give you a ride from the airport. Right, so like instead of like laying in the back of a car that I paid 50 bucks for, so I can like actually rest for a long flight and like maybe call my kids. You want me to go into your car so you can pitch me your business. And like, and you're packaging it as, that was always like the funny extreme example. But I think a lot of people that feel like they get walked all over for being nice need to look in the mirror and realize they're actually setting up a manipulation. Or they're deeply insecure. And their validation comes for like being walked on. There is no other version. Cause pure niceness is undefeated. When you're nice, you give without expectation. Yes. Which means you can't be hurt. Yeah. The reason I've never hurt is I've zero expectation. To my actions towards them should not be reciprocated in any way. I'm not doing it for any other reason than it feels good. I love that. I'm aware that it may lead to something. Like I understand life. I just wish more people like went all in. Wrapping up. I mean, this like zoomed by. And I'm sure there was a couple of things maybe on your mind that you want to talk about or tell people about. I want that for you. What I'm setting up now is permission to tell the millions of people over the next half decade that listen to this. Anything you'd like them to know or follow or, or something you want to talk about. So before we get out of here. Oh God. I feel like we, yeah. I feel like we hit it, but it's so, I'm really happy you do this. It's really special. It's really amazing just to have a really vulnerable conversation and I love that people are so genuine and open to it. And I'm happy I got to do this with you guys today. Likewise. Yeah. For same for me. It's, yeah. It's just nice to speak to people that you don't know and that you can relate on the same level with them and kind of have the same conversation. You don't often get it nowadays as well. It's hard to like dig on a bit of a deeper level. And it's even harder to, like it was funny. 20 years ago it was easier for me to find them. Now people are posturing of it. But it's not. It's fashionable. It's fashionable. It's fashionable to have a therapist. It's fashionable to do what it is. Correct. Which is great. But it's like- The problem is people are using it as makeup to disguise their real intent. Exactly. Yeah. It's right. Yeah, yeah. Andy? I'm grateful that I got to be maybe the best substitute guest. That's what I'm saying. Never substitute. Substitute. And I hope to see Ashlyn and the crew back at Vicon in 2024. Oh, I can't wait. Yeah, late this time. August on 8 to the 11th, lavicon.co. Check it out. My parting thing is first to the Twitch family. Thank you for being here. I fucked up. I promised you some questions. I'm gonna let Dustin and team grab three or four and I'm gonna film answers and use it for social media content, which is 10 times better because you're gonna get full exposure for that. So we'll make that good. Number two, Twitch crew. I'm going over to Fanatics Live right now. So I know a lot of you I saw in the chat came over to watch this. I'm going back over there. I'm about to give away a ton of free VFRIENDS collectibles. So download the app, go over there. I'm gonna assume that most of you know how to get there. If not, please leave some comments to the rest of Twitch family. And I'll leave everybody with this. Please hit me up on Twitter, GaryVEE, which with the quote or the statement or the topic that most hit you from this episode, because I always love to hear like what people attached to. I can also share it with my friends here. Thank you all for being on our podcast with friends and we will see you next time. Can't wait. Peace. ["Fanatics Live"]
