I don't fucking complain. No reason to, right? I mean, you know what? When you're younger, right? You're gonna have shit to complain about cause you're gonna have to figure out life. Once you get close to 40 years old, it's like fucking, your friends start dying. The natural causes of shit. Like, I had a friend 40 years old who died in his fucking sleep. In shape, off his shit. Never smoked, drank his life, eats fucking life, you know, salmon and vegetables and shit. And he just fucking died. You know my friend Dustin who's coming back? You guys know who Howard Bingham is? Famous photographer? So Howard Bingham's son, Dustin, I went to college with, he's one of my best friends coming by. And his brother, Damon, who did the Ali Menbi with Will Smith, passed away in his sleep. It's crazy. Ali died, Damon died, and Howard Bingham died, as you might've saw, all within like a year. So it's all fucking, it just sucks. So it's all good to get back to where we stand. Yeah. Yeah man. Wake up your line, I'm gonna get fucking your up on. You're not a person for the rest of your life. You can have about two to three years. 400 trillion in one. You know that's my, I talk about it every day. Like when I think about the fact that my dad could've, you know, decided to take a shit and like, like do you know how hard it is to become a human? Exactly. Like 400 trillion for one.
