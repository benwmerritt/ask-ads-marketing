## Transcript
you know, we were 20 when the internet was even starting to start to start and and it was definitely not like the same as like it is today and now it's completely flipped upside down. So John, 15 year old John right now only dreams of going viral or winning on the internet and 48 year old John still subconsciously because of the way he grew up thinks of it as a step down. I understand both. You got your perspective. Just want to be happy. Don't you want to be happy? Well, this is exciting for me. Those are remade megos. Those aren't original megos. That's what I love. That's all of yes, they are. They're called figures from figures toy store figures toy company. I looked for my old me. You're the perfect person for this. By the way, we started the podcast because everything that I've been learning about you with going to like garage sales, I guess, and in eBay and all that kind of stuff. So here's here is what I was looking for a podcast set and I was trying to think what is me? What what what what talks about me? What tells me into my childhood, which is where I wish I still was. So I went looking like I went looking for my mego toys. I must have sold them at a garage sale to some guy who became famous on the internet. And but I couldn't find them. And you know, there were some on eBay and stuff like that. I did get some, but there were figures toys. And I just looked it up in their remakes of the megos. The I think they're five and a half inch also had the little ones to the mego minis or whatever they're called. But they were, you know, they were those doll. They were really dolls. They weren't action figures. Correct. And they were awesome as a kid growing up and everything's changed so much at Todd McFarland on. And you talk about going the exact opposite way. The detail in those was incredible. These are like they take the same head and just paint it differently. 100% Yeah, they were Barbies. And let's call them what they were. Yes. And it's and in and when I was growing up, my dad would have been mad at that. And nowadays, it would be it would be perfect. It would be 100% way to go. So you are the guest today, Gary Vee, which and I didn't know much about you. I'm honest on this podcast. A lot of times I used to try. I used to try and be something I wasn't. I used to try and be a really good host. Yep. You're one of the people actually I've heard talk about this, you know, talk about being yourself and that comes through. And I get lost, you know, I'm all over the place. That's why I do the impressions. I bet really? Oh, yeah. I'm very I can be focused when I'm like building a business. But like, I'm the worst. I also on my podcast, I'm terrible. I cut off the person 740. My fans like want to punch me in the face when I'm like doing I yeah, I'm just I'm quite creative. And in a lot of ways that I didn't realize as a kid, because I all the creative energy went into business. And that didn't seem creative back then. Back to your earlier point of your dad and all like that, like creativity and not like the word entrepreneur didn't even exist. I was going to be a businessman. And that that seemed like money and money didn't seem like creative or art or things that nature. But like, yeah, I mean, I have like six thoughts right now. I'm like thinking about your ghost buster figures. I was pumped to see plastic man in the background. Like I'm like thinking about the Hogan figure. I'm thinking about some of your impressions that I've loved. Like, like, was I mad because I saw that before a Jets game that was bad? Like, it's amazing how many places in 13 seconds your brain can actually go. Yeah, and that you see, well, I would not have thought that at all. See, I would have thought you were extremely focused. You know, I did what got me into the Internet. I call it controlled chaos. I'm focused when when I'm on a I can be micro focused, but I'm macro most happy in chaos. Could you stop interrupting me? So no, I wouldn't have thought that because I go back to when I started, I got off the Internet. So my story is this, I when I was starting to make a little bit of a name for myself back in Fox and it fell Sunday and doing stuff on on TBS and even a little bit mad TV. The Internet was just starting to to blow up a little bit. When I first got to Hollywood, people didn't even really have email. Their email was just starting and people like I had a manager's like, you're not going to believe this, you can type a message to somebody on the keyboard and you send it across the country and they get it in seconds. So that world, I was at one point, the number one thing on YouTube before there were any subscribers or anything like that, just YouTube. People, there was even a thing where people like the Frank Calliendo factor of YouTube where people, you know, small blogs would talk about that type of thing, but I got lost in it. I didn't, I didn't see it like when when Microsoft didn't see what Apple saw. I didn't see the future of that. This is very common, Frank. I actually, I remember you on YouTube. I was there very early with Wine Library TV in February 2006 when it was like Rocket Boom and Zay Frank and all this stuff. I know because Hollywood or you thought of yourself that way. These things were a micro little stepping stone to the big game. YouTube was like a small club you would play on your way. Like everybody, I remember it vividly that that 2002, three, four, five, six, seven era really, and then it started to change, but like 01 to 06 to your point, it was like a place you were using to get somewhere. And what I definitely understood back then was like, no, no, this is going to be the somewhere. Yeah. Cause I was, I was actually getting mad about it. I was more, I had more people recognizing me from YouTube at the time than I did when after doing Letterman. And that annoyed me. That, and that's the wrong way to look at it. That's what I've learned is, you know, perspective is everything. That's something you talk about. Ed, my let was another guy who's gotten me into, I saw some of your, I saw all of your interview with Ed. But Ed was one, I was starting to get back into the internet. I got away from it just because I was on Twitter and I was building an audience on Twitter and it was so angry. I described it as like New York City being in Manhattan. And when you're walking in Times Square and everybody's bumping into each other and nobody cares. And do they just start swearing at each other and they don't care? I just, I just couldn't hack it. I mean, it was one of those things I was sitting there. So I just got away. But I met Ed and started getting into it. I learned about you and some of the other influencers. I don't know if you even like that term. I'll tell you, you know, at this point, you get, you know, to your point, it's funny, like, when you put yourself out there and I'm sure you, this happens for you. And really at this point, because everybody puts themselves out there, everybody's getting labeled as something, like, you, I'm just grateful that I have the chance to be labeled, you know, whatever that label is. I'll just, you know, so keep going. Well, listen, what I was thinking about is, well, I want to go with your labeling thing. Does that, does it, it doesn't annoy you at all? I mean, to me, I reckon it's kind of like your gift is your curse. I, you know, have built businesses my whole life and built a huge business for my dad and the wine and liquor business. You know, in the last 24 months, had a restaurant app called Rezzy that I started co-founded with Ben Levinthal, sell for hefty nine figures to AmEx. I sold my direct to consumer wine brand Empathy Wines for almost $100 million. VaynerMedia is a $200 million a year, almost $200 million a year revenue based business that I've started from scratch. Yet, when I get, when I get mentioned on the internet and you read the comments, everyone's like, well, he's just a fucking motivational speaker. And so, you know, as any human, when you work your face off and you accomplish, you know, it's funny to answer you because even as I'm saying it, ultimately, I don't mind because I understand how human beings are wired. Thus is why I've done well. But yeah, I mean, you know, I think we all get miffed. You know, I don't want to be, you know, I love perspective and mindset because I think it's foundational to helping people go do things. But I think there's a lot of, I think there's a lot of characters that, you know, just speak for the sake of speaking and don't have the resume or the execution underneath them. And of course, there's times that I wish that was recognized more. But, you know, I also know that when you have trillions of videos of you speaking on stage being consumed, that's the only context. And so, I have to be empathetic because I'm the one creating those videos and distributing them. Well, you know, I can relate to that a lot because when I used to get mad at people seeing me as just the impressionist guy, but then I realized that's all I'm putting out there. I'm putting that out there constantly. Not only putting it out there, the platform you had, I mean, that's definitely the first time I became aware of it. Like when so many of the percentage of people see that because the platform was so big that you were being consumed on, to your point, this is about empathy to the end user of understanding, well, that's what they see. So, do you think, as I knew, I know a little bit about your story that you built your parents' wine business was worth like $3 million? It was doing $3 million a year. And I grew it to a business that was doing $65 million a year in an eight-year period. And that's by bringing it to the internet and realizing you didn't need to email 8,000 stores. Your story about YouTube Hollywood was my story about email versus catalogs. I understood in 1997 that the biggest stores in the country, Sam's in Chicago, Sherri Lehmann's and Zachy's in New York, Wine Club and Wine Exchange and K&L Wines, these stores that I looked up to, because I've been in a business since I was 14, and the Wednesday New York Times, Dining Edition would have all the national ads. And I was like, one day I'm going to help my dad and I'm going to take us to the national level, like these stores. And those stores that I just rattled off were those stores. I realized in 1997 that I could email out Opus One or Dom Perignon or Silver Oak or Camus or these great wines on email for free back to the agent joke you made earlier, while my competitors, these iconic stores were taking three months producing a catalog that cost them a crap load of money and cost a lot of money to deliver and would be two months, two weeks, six weeks, six days later than I could email it. And I really, really took advantage of that. And I understood that this was crazy. This is what people thought in 1996. I understood that rich people that bought expensive wine would use email and reply and say they want six bottles. And literally, like this is crazy for every listener, people debated me saying that the affluent individuals wouldn't like that experience and would rather order it from a catalog. People always do that. They do it now. Instagram influencers didn't go on TikTok because they were insecure and didn't want to start all over. So they would make up excuses that TikTok was only for girls dancing when it was obvious what was happening there. People don't like change and I love change. And that has been a huge foundation of my career. Yeah, you're kind of describing me with even TikTok there. I didn't want to get on it at the beginning. TikTok was recruiting me to get on there. Now, this is when it had just switched over from musically. And I looked at it and I would open it up and I felt like I was going to go to jail every time something played. I get that. I get that. And it's changed. It's changed. And I think especially, I guess the vine people found it, people like you found it. But what happened was that it evolved. And even now when I tell people about TikTok, I'm like, it's not the same. It's not just sounds and stuff like that and lip syncing. It's a lot of content. Right. That's the thing that I'm good at as well. And I think other people that have the investing or business career that I have are also good at. They're able to look at MTV in 1984 and say, okay, this is not free music. I don't know if you know this story. Most of the big bands in the late 70s, early 80s refused to make music videos because they thought it was giving away free music. And Styx, for example, because I remember speaking to the Styx manager, literally decided not to make videos because that was giving away music for free. Fuck you. Meanwhile, Durand Durand and Van Halen and Twisted Sister were thrilled to do it and then became the biggest bands in the world in that era. I've always valued the attention of society over the short-term economics of the transaction of a sale. So I would rather go to the new place, work hard, figure out how to bring value through my content there and be there when it became the thing versus somebody. I like how you just reacted. Where do you mind just go? I'm laughing because you're exactly the opposite of everything I've ever thought that I've realized I was wrong about recently. Everything that I've always put a value. When people would ask me, hey, are you going to go up to the comedy store? You're going to go up to the laugh factory and do a set? When I lived in LA, I live in Arizona now. I just thought it would be a better place to raise a family and stuff outside of Hollywood. So, which is part of my issue. I made a choice. I've heard you talk about time management and stuff with that family. I made a conscious choice. My guilt with family and stuff, which I should. Guilt seems like a negative connotation, but that's what it was. But it's what I cared about. I'm glad that I'm here for my kids. Even Dana Carvey. It's a mix of gratitude and guilt. Yeah. And it's trying to find that balance. I went way over to the family side because I just knew that was me. I just needed to be there. No, no, no, let's stay here because I think it's going to help a lot of people because I love, you know, we're getting to know each other. I love you for that because you clearly, it's funny. You talk professionally about the chess moves, but I actually think in your real life, clearly what you care about the most, you actually saw foresaw the game, which is one day my kids are going to be 20. I'm never going to get this back. That's exactly what it was. I can feel it. I literally have goosebumps. I don't know if you can see them through the screen. I was like, this guy's interesting. He realized it in the real life, but professionally, because it was so pushed on him that make people pay for your value. Like people in Hollywood and in Wall Street and in Madison Avenue, they overvalue like restriction and they undervalue awareness. Yeah, I mean, I've always been super aware of everything. Like I've comedy club. I'm sorry. I've been aware of this from like every rep matters because if one more person knows who you are, that's going to matter long term. And a lot of the monetization of restrictions, my favorite one, Hollywood's obsessed with overexposure. There's no overexposure. Not any more. There used to be, but they said there's a new perspective on stuff. There isn't. There used to be ish. What happened was music was hard and like playing the Fonz was hard. Like overexposure was very unique. It was people would get caught with such an iconic role that we couldn't stop seeing them in that role from an acting standpoint. The Fonz, whoever, we can do a million of these, you know, Erkel, like Tony Soprano. But and then artists would get a lot of plays. And to your point, there was only MTV. I mean, if you're Madonna and you were promoting a new album, you could actually get all of America to know it was out if you did 13 things. That world doesn't exist anymore. Right. Well, and I think people have been desensitized. If you're, look, if you're, if you open up TikTok, you might see the guy play in the straw hammer, whatever that is, five times in the next 10 minutes, that person seems overexposed. I guess not even overexposed. That person seems like you see them just as much as you see, let's say Michael Strahan, who's doing six jobs on television. So we don't even see it anymore. We don't understand it because it's changed so much in front of us. What you're actually describing is a different point of my opinion, which is the attention of the world is in a different place. And so if you're in the business world of entertainment, you know that Michael Strahan does six shows and he's unbelievably successful in classic Hollywood and entertainment terms. But if you're living in the practical world, you're realizing that attention is staggeringly quickly shifting to 15 platforms on the internet and whoever is winning there is winning. Yeah. I mean, I didn't even think I said, I still lump it all together. I still have it. What you are able to do is compartmentalize and see these different pieces of media. And that's what that's just me trying to go from old school to this new school way of thinking. I mean, Pat McAfee, do you know Pat McAfee? I do. Huge podcast. He's the guy who actually got me back into the internet. He started me going, he's like, you should be killing on there, doing voiceovers, doing this, doing that. I was like, and I didn't want to because I thought- I'll tell you this Frank, keep going. Well, I just, I'll tell you this, keep going. You're good at that. I just didn't want to because I saw myself and my podcast partner who's not here right now. This is the way he still thinks and we fight about this all the time. Fight in terms of- Of course. He's the number one radio guy in Phoenix. He's a seven figure guy. He's set and he's really happy, which is perfect. And I've heard you talk about that too. That's awesome. When you're happy with where you're at, that's great. Five figures, six figures, seven figures. When you're happy, game over. And probably the most talented guy I've ever met with impressions, the ability. He's kind of like a combination of the shock jock DJ who can also do the sidekick stuff in terms of impressions, characters. He's got it all. I mean, he and I go back and forth. We work on impressions together. It's a great teamwork in dichotomy. We get along really well because he's like a slightly more evil version of me, which is in this world, good and bad, but he's edgier and he takes a lot more risks. I find myself working in corporate America a lot, so I don't take as many chances. I back off quite a bit, but he doesn't like the internet at all. And I got back on the internet and started getting on there. And I said, I have to find this new audience. What does he not like about it, Frank? I apologize. I'm just curious. You know, it just feels like a step down to him, although- Did he grow up wanting to be an entertainer? I think he grew up wanting to do radio. I think that's what he wanted to be, a writer too. I mean, that's, listen, it's the song as old as time. Every 15-year-old in America right now, 13-year-old wants to be an influencer when they grow up. That was no different. You know what? I'd say that except for my kid. Fair enough. Of course, you know, I'm jealous. I know. I know. I just- How old are you, Frank? My son's going to listen to this. I'm a year younger or older than you, so born in 74. How old are you? Awesome. I'm going to turn 45 in a couple of weeks here. So I'm 46. I'll be 47 in January. So a couple of things. When you and I were growing up, you know, being an actor or on TV was, you know, and I didn't want to because I wanted to be a businessman, but like half the class did or in a different way, almost all of us would have taken it. Do you know what I mean? I think some people were, you know, and I think to your point, I mean, the ideology of your partner was in that era. So to also, is he in our age group in the general range? Yeah. He's two years older than me, I think. Perfect. So as you know, right? So John, like, you know, we were 20 when the internet was even starting to start to start. And it was definitely not like the same as like it is today. And now it's completely flipped upside down. So John, 15 year old John right now, only dreams of going viral or winning on the internet. And 48 year old John, still subconsciously because of the way he grew up, thinks of it as a step down. I understand both. Yeah. I mean, I felt like that a lot until I realized, hey, I got to get in front of a lot of different people. I struggle with this too, because this is another thing I've heard you talk about. I feel like I'm in a therapy session with you. It's good. But it's, it's been a learning experience, and it's been a difficult step for me to put some stuff out. It's hard on TikTok. These kids don't know me at all. It's funny, because I'll get these kids will tell me things like, Oh, that impression sucks. I'm like, well, it built this 70,000 gallon pool. It's good. And by the way, Frank, I'll be honest with you, play with me here a little bit. This could be interesting. I think that should be something you try. I think the best about it. I thought about, but let me tell you something. This is very, very big. This is the whole, this is the punchline of this podcast. And we're going to help three people who are listening right now. I can feel it in my soul. The biggest difference between what made you great and you became you. And this exact second is the, I thought about it is the vulnerability. You know, you grew up in a world, I get it. I'm gonna cry. You're going to make me cry. You're going to be Gary because it's good. Right? Frankie see, Frankie see, I'm excited about this because, because the, I thought about it once, by the way, Kevin James, let's talk about Kevin James. Kevin James's team calls me a year ago, whatever 15 months ago, we get on the call. We have this, I remember I'm in California on the highway in between meetings, just on a call. And we have this like really interesting, I just had like a 30 minute like jam session with them. Because, you know, Kevin's a Jets fan, you know, we'd interact a little bit. And there was just something, I don't remember what, but something landed in the same way that I'm trying to land with you. Don't think about it. And it just, and all of us, I just remember the whole team, the writing team and him on there and it clicked. And so much good has happened on TikTok and other things for him since. And I genuinely believe the same thing would happen for you, which is in a world where you perfected shit before you showed the world, what, what's so fun about this is you get to perfect it with them, not without them. And, and when I tell you that if you started a whole shtick of you rousing the kids rousing you like in the meta of it, that would fucking crush. Well, this is going to become a TikTok itself with you saying that that'll justify the reason for me doing it. That's what I needed was, listen, I thought about that. I thought about taking the replies, the, you know, the reply videos, the comments, the negative comments. I'd even, I'd even mapped one out in my head. Here are the following impressions people say on TikTok that I do, that they say suck. And then A, that you should 100% do that. B, when you make a video saying, Hey, Ricky Pants 67. And you then show him saying this sucks. Be like, you think that sucks? What about, you know, like wherever you go with it, whatever the transition is. But see, okay, so you're jumping into a world of, okay, see, I love the idea of, Hey, I'll show you. But at the same time, I struggle. No, no, you've got to be very cute. Yeah, I love you already. I struggle with, I don't want to put, but you know where I'm going because then I look like the big bad wolf. King do you know, you play with it for fun. Like, like, you'll appreciate this. And I can, I'm getting a sense of you. You know what, you know what is absolutely worked for me and others intent. People like Gary Vee, like, you know, and that would be the tone of it as well, right? The tone, the way you put it. Or you invite the kid to swim like there's a million places you can do it. See what I'm going to invite the kid to swim during COVID. I got these other four kids, they're coughing. It'll be fine. Okay, here's my Iron Man jackass. But Frank, it really is intent. I remember when I first started putting out content 2009, and I didn't know this and this goes into your world a little bit. I didn't realize how much Richard Pryor, and I listened to so much Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock as a kid. Like when I drove, it was sports radio or tape of standup. And, and so I'm 34 years old when I give my first keynote speech about business. And when I tell you I had no fucking idea what was going to happen when I went on stage, I had no idea. I just went on there. And what happened was when the lights went on, for some reason, I decided that I was going to communicate as if I was doing a set in a very improv. And it was really funny to me that that happened. And I think what, so I was cursing like crazy. And I was getting so much pushback. It was, you know, 12 years ago, it was a different time with and, and I remember people begging me to change my style. CAA, who did my speaking, because I hit very quickly and became hot. And CAA was doing my speaking at the time. And they begged me big shout out to Peter Jacobs. They begged me to stop cursing. They were like, you know, you will make so much back to your point earlier about corporate America and the way you think about what you're going to do and not do. And before you go on already, I know Peter Jacobs, that's the high end. Keep going. Yeah. So exactly. So I, I just couldn't do it. I just needed to do me and was willing to deal with the ramifications. And then the world came to me. And the reason it happened was I had a tent. It's how I actually spoke. It's how I naturally felt. And I had good intent. I wasn't trying to hurt people. I was trying to use it to get them to hear it. And I think if you come out with intent of not being a big shot, but just having fun with the community and enjoying yourself, I think it makes sense. It makes sense because you can do that in a jovial way. Correct. That's what I'm trying to do with the podcast. That's what I'm trying to do with everything. Listen, I'm trying to get people to understand who I am and where I, because I'm, I'm much more sarcastic in real life. I'm, I'm goofy and stuff like that. But people see me as the walks, the line maybe goes even halfway to the line, but on the podcast, I go all the way to the line, sometimes go over the line. It's me. I, you know, we say things behind the scenes. Well, you don't, you talk exactly. I maybe I shouldn't say, I don't know you that well, but you go out there and what you're showing is you, you're bearing your soul. When you go out there and that's what I, that's what, listen, these impressions that I do, it's a mask for me to hide. Right. It's a, it's a way for me. I'm a kid who grew up watching all these TV shows of all the stuff you saw behind me. I was by myself playing with my Legos. My parents like, you ever going to come out of your room? No, I have my friends. They're the super friends. They're going, main way in Frank's room. He's putting together a Lego set. You know, that's, that's who I was and hiding is what I've always been. And this, this internet stuff, when I go out there and look, you know, you see people, the best people are the people who put it all out there and you see the emotion. I learned this. I did a, I did a wrap up. Real quick, the ones that have the sustained, sustained success are the ones because there's a lot of people to your point who are absolutely putting up facades without acknowledging it. The beauty of impressions is I know, let me rephrase, I don't think most people enjoy psychology enough to know that that's what you were doing, but I do, whereas a lot of people are saying they're being authentic. It's why, you know, but then, but then not, and they're the ones that can't have sustained success to your point. The sustained success, you know, fun it is to not have to think. Frank, I never have to think everything I talk, I talk, I talk. Like there's no like, oh, like when I go to the restaurant, like, oh, I better be, like when you could just be yourself 24 seven. I'd love to get there, man. It's, that's an amazing, I'm getting better at it, but Dennis Miller started screaming at me on a podcast. He's like, Frank, just be you, Joshy. What are you doing? He's just screaming at me to just be myself. And I, it's, people don't understand. I built these walls around me. This was a thing I noticed. I learned on TikTok. I did, I, you know, I do the impressions. I haven't even gotten to the part of really showing the me stuff. And even on TikTok, and what I do differently there, and the reason I keep referencing TikTok, I find it the fastest place to grow. You're growing like crazy and you're being more creative. Yes. There's a level of creativity, but what, and what gets me to do it, the motivation is the ability to grow quickly. I mean, it's, it's, you know what, I love you for that sentence. Like that's a big deal to acknowledge that because I'll be honest with you. I love that as a entree, but you have to basically spend all your time getting out of that mindset because it's similar to being in the room with the Legos. The judgment of others and calibrating it is everything. Yeah. The reason real celebrities hate social media is they don't want the insecurity of low numbers and TikToks working. Right. Absolutely. I know. I know. I know all the time. I like watching. Like you, you look and you, you see something going down and I have a group of friends and we go, we are getting, you know, people will just text me all the time. What is the algorithm doing? And I'm like, I don't know. I just, I'd started to just give up on that and through, I would hide, I used to hide the low number ones. And then I looked around at some of the, I realized a lot of people are doing that. A lot of people are deleting, hiding and I just, you know what, screw it. Whatever. Nobody gives a shit at the end. Yeah. In the end, nobody gives a shit. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I just, for me, it's hard to, because they're, it's trying to go from an old mindset of what we used to look at. Here's my thing. My biggest thing is you have so much creative talent. I'm devastated that you overthinking something may stop you from making your signature piece of work. Well, that's where I'm getting to this point. That's where I'm getting to a point is I'm getting to a point where I'm said, I'm just going to start throwing a lot more stuff out there. I've heard you talking about, I've heard about this. And by the way, it's not spray and pray and throw against the wall and see what's next. These are actual thoughts in your mind and you're going to put them out. That's a big difference. A lot of people are like, Oh, it's garbage, Gary, you talk about all human quantity, but that's at the expense of quality. I'm like, who gets the judge quality? All right. Commenters, commenters. But that's why it needs to go out. You know, and I think, listen, I just think it's an incredible time to be creative and I'm pumped that you're putting the pieces together to get there in a world where you've got 40 plus years to give. Well, you don't owe me that. Well, we'll see how I don't. But I, but I, when I say that, I really genuinely believe it. And you're in a craft, unlike athletes, when I say that, you know, and we're of the same age, Milton Burl, right? You go, you know, like all the, you start going into these names, right? Where you know, George Burns, you know, Bob Hope, like these all were old fuckers when we were kids, but they were still doing their thing. Right. Yeah. I mean, I've had, by the way, you know, you want a time, yeah, I should have left three minutes ago, but I'm enjoying myself and I'm literally texting my business client to wait a few seconds. Okay. Then I'll get to the wrap up here. So listen, I just, to me, I found that emotion and not even always trying to be funny. People, people find emotion on the internet, especially on TikTok and they gravitate toward that. I did those Robin Williams thing that I was just like, you know, I miss him. Oh my God, where is, you know, that kind of thing. And people went crazy for that. And it's just a learning experience. It's trying to find out even what people, you know, for taking myself out of the internet for a while and then getting back just to see what actually worked and what it was. Frank, think of it this way. I'm going to give you something. I'm going to give you a prescription on my way out. And I think it's going to work for you. I really mean it. Make one for them because that's what you're talking about right now. Make one for them and then just make one for yourself every time. Two pills a day. One for them, one for you. One for them, one for you. Cause I promise you brother, on my fucking heart and soul, the one that you make for yourself is going to be the one that changes everything. You know, you see where I'm going, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I, my biggest fear is that so many of the people that fit your profile are sitting on gold and will talk themselves out of it for no reason. Oh, I'm a big, I'm a big talker in terms of talking myself out of everything. It's why I'm leading into this one. I think what's so amazing about TikTok for you right this second, because it will change the organic reach will go away just like every platform. I've been doing this for 20 years, Frank. The growing like crazy will just stop because ads are going to come in. It happens on every platform. I've already seen it started. You have 18 months. And in that 18 months, I believe that you make up a fake character because, because we have this talk and you just decide to do that. And that character becomes your billion dollar T movie franchise. Listen, I get, no, I've been having those same, it's the same things. It's just great to hear from you. You were about to say I'm having those same thoughts and I'm just desperately trying to suffocate it right now from thoughts to action. Just make it happen. All right. Two things, two things before you get going. One, do you know how this interview came about? No. And I'm so glad it did because I've learned a lot and I'm going to utilize it and use it. I know that it was somebody close to me talking about you like, it's been on my ring. Sean O'Neill, Sean O'Neill who was a multiple US table tennis champion who's taught me a lot about ping pong table tennis. He texted me goes, do you want Gary Vee on your show? I'm like, he's not going to do the show. It's a small little podcast. It's just fun. He's like, let me go. I don't know if you know him personally or what, but he started, he did that and then it worked out. And I've since then I've watched a lot more of your stuff and how you reach out to charities. And that's how I'm thinking of myself right here. No, but that and I had, he had one question that I wanted to ask you for him quickly, which was in terms of sports. Yes. What do you think kids should do? And this is kind of a reach, but I think, you think they should focus on one sport or multiple sports? Is that multiple sports? Because you never know. Because I think they should focus on multiple sports early on. And then if they think they're going to be professionals, they can zone in. But I think the specialization at the young age right now is more predicated on delusional parents that think their kids are going to the league. And I think a lot of times by limiting children early on, you're taking away early some skill sets that they might be able to take. I actually think some parents are going to stop their kids from going to the league by making them one-dimensional too early, AKA you're going to be a baseball player son. And instead of, and what they could have learned in basketball or soccer or change them up a little bit from a skill set. I actually, I actually think it's a huge mistake because when I tell you the number one delusional animal in the world is parents, not their kids going into sports, it's unbelievable to me how many people are confused. Yeah. And kids sports are, I don't know if it's just COVID or everything, but it's going way down. Have you seen recently? Yeah, but numbers are going way down. People are going to lose teamwork. Okay. I know you got to go. The last thing is this with your business acumen and prowess, how can you wear a jet's hat? I just don't understand. Have you ever, have they ever come to you and said, can you talk to us and help us? The jets were one of my early clients, but the only way I'm going to be able to help them is to accomplish my lifelong dream of buying them and then managing it myself. I can wear it because I love the process. I am loyal. It's my squad. I'm not going to bail just because we're the worst team in the NFL. And that's who I am. All right. I was looking for a joke answer, but I'm glad I got the honesty. You got the one. Frank, real pleasure, man. Continue success. All right. Thanks, man. You do watch or what's up? It's Gary V.
