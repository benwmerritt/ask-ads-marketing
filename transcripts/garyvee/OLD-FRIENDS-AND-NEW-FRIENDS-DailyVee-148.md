You're the number one Madden live player in the world? Wow. That can't be real. No, it's real class. That means you play all day. That means that I play all day. Sabahs, I've been telling you. Fire and turn in Bevin. You just ate? Good man. What's going on? Is this a sugar fish? No, no, no, I'm good. That's it. How you doing? I'm not trying not to complain. I don't fucking complain. No reason to, right? I mean, you know what? When you're younger, right? You have shit to complain about, because you haven't figured out life. Once you get close to 40 years old, it's like fucking, your friends start dying. The natural causes of shit. Like, I had a friend 40 years old who died in his fucking sleep. In shape, he's a motherfucker. He never smoked or drank his life. He's fucking like, you know, Simon and basketball is shit. And he just fucking died. You know my friend Dustin, he's kind of like, do you guys know who Howard Bingham is? Famous photographer? Yeah. So Howard Bingham's son, Dustin, I went to college with him. He's one of my best friends coming by. And his brother, Damon, who did the Ali movie with Will Smith, passed away in his sleep. It's crazy. Ali died, Damon died, and Howard Bingham died, as you might have saw, all within like a year. So he's all fucking, it just sucks. So in this whole game, you just get back to what we say, and you complain about what? Yeah, man. Wake up, you're alive. I'm gonna get fucking you up. Like, you wake up, you're alive. You're not a prisoner for the rest of your life. 400 trillion to one. You know that's my... I talk about it every day. Like, when I think about the fact that my dad could have, you know, decided to take a shit, and like, you know how hard it is to become a human? Like, like 400 trillion to one. Like, there's no math. Like, you can win like 90 NBA championships in a row, more likely than being a human being. So that's, it's perspective. Once you get there. So what's going on? So like, I'm a super pumper here. Obviously, I'm a fan of your work. Like, what's, give me some context. Yeah, so I just emailed... Yep, I'm aware. Yep. I've been punishing you a little bit. Yep. Yep. And I saw a game last week. We did a show here. It was the big industry show, which is with the weed companies coming together. Yep, yep, I saw. We did a walk through there. I asked him if he had known you. He said no. Yep. Yep. Oh, you did? I generally don't mainly think people know. I don't really think people do. I mean... You're like walking through the street, there's people running after him, trying to talk to him. Of course. You know this guy? Yeah, of course. Yeah, said it, got it. Yep. And how long have you guys been jamming? Wait, please. I've been watching, been watching. The NFL thing is insane. He has the agency going. It's like the number fucking five of like the video games on Madden or something. I'm number one, actually. Is that real? Yeah, it's real. You're the number one Madden live player in the world? Wow. That can't be real. No, it's real class. That means you play all day. That means that I play all day. My man. There's just no other way. Like, without bullshit. Like, they have... Like, I haven't played in a while. Like, when we go on to like Xbox or whatever, like they have the rankings, right? I'm number one on every Xbox that you can fucking see in the world. That's, I believe you. That's a myth. Well, I don't give a fuck if you don't. I'm still gonna be. I'm like, I'm big. That's crazy. Yeah, and which, I mean, if you think about it, that's how I got my name. Like, I fucking grew up playing video games. And my grandmother's from Texas and she's old Southern. And she would just be like, this fucking kid is game for anything. Game this, game that. And so that's how I got my name. And so before I became a rapper, my name was just game. My nickname was game as a child growing up. I didn't know that. So when it became, when I, when it's funny because when, when I signed to Dr. Dre, like, I wasn't my, like, that wasn't my rap name. What was it? It was like fucking, what the fuck was it? Oh, it was MC Compton, man. MC Compton. MC Compton. And I had Mike Rockwell, who everybody laughs at. And when he asked me, and I tell him because I rocked the Mike Will, my sister was like, yo, that's fucking weak. And so my younger sister, who's now 27, she was just back then, she was fucking 17. She was like, why don't you just be your regular name, stupid? And I'm like, what? She was like, game and just add like a mister or like a doctor or, or a, or a, or a, she's like a the. And I was like, the game bitch. And then I, I love that story. And then so when I, you know, when I actually went to the studio to meet Dre and Nate and Sue, 50 and N, where all the studio, he was like, what's your name? I was just like, and I was thinking, I wanted to say MC Compton, but I'm like, the game, like, it's fucking dope. Welcome to aftermath. I'm like, fuck. So yeah, man. That's good shit. So games, man, we'll be all the time. That's crazy. I've been playing video games since I was fucked since Nintendo. So wait a minute. Let's take a step back. Like just on another kick. How are you thinking about esports? Are you thinking about that at all? Have you opened up your eyes to that world? I'm just now like, good getting off of, you know, my console and starting to branch out. And I just got in a PC game and in esports, my boy, who's like, my, like number seven and man put me on it. And so I'm like starting to, you know, figure it out. It's not fucking work. Okay. I'm seriously on a very serious kid. Like, I know, I know we've been through this. You're literally the number one player on, on Madden. Number one in the world. This world. That's the best. The current one, the one that's out right now, like whatever, 17. 17. And what, what, what do you end up being on 16? 16, I was number one. Shit is correct. You're just unstoppable and maddened. I'm fucking amazing. What about live? I don't play live. I play 2K. And this year I haven't played like head to head. Yep. I've been playing like my players. That's the biggest thing going 2K. Yeah. If you know about that. But I was number one and since 2011 on 2K2. Do you, and is it just sports games that you're that dominant or shooter games? No, no, no, no. I was the first modern warfare. I was number one on COD2. Oh yeah. Have you ever been number two on anything? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Don't miss shit. Don't miss shit. E-Sports is going to be, E-Sports is going to be the number three sport in America in 10 years. Yeah. Wow. E-Sports, E-Sports. Do you have a Twitch channel? I have a Twitch channel. I mean that's right there at home. I got fucking locked out of me somehow. I should have streamed in like 100,000 but it was the beginning stages. Yep. Everybody wants to watch me fucking fucking mad. Yep. But I can't. I want to be everyone. So what happens on your X-File? Who do you play with? I play with any team. Can you start playing with the Jets a little bit more? I need some more wins. Yes. Thank you. I play with like 40 and 0 with the Jets. Yes, my man. Yeah. I just play with any team because after a while you know if you play like it gets boring. Yeah. I'm like 29ers and I've won so many games and it's like I need to play with other teams. So currently I'm just gonna play with the Chiefs. Do you do dumb shit like pull your defensive lineman off the line? Like I do that. I think that's how I play. That's how I got bad at Madden. Yeah. I used to be good at Madden 93, 94, 95 and just amongst my friends. I got so bored being good at it. I started getting into bad habits. Yeah. And then when shit changed and I got busy I still like couldn't like recover. Well Vic changed it for everyone. Yeah, Vic talked it. And everyone was like I'm just gonna fucking run with my quarterback. When Vic got drafted to the fucking Falcons Madden changed forever. And then. One year they came out the QB and Cone. They just dropped out. Oh yeah, black quarterbacks just weren't fucking fast as Vic. You know, that everyone still wanted to try and run with the quarterback. Yeah, so Vic came and that. Yeah, War Moon wasn't running by anybody. No, fucking slow shit. Random cutting hand. Cutting hand was fast. Yeah, but on the game it was like. Yeah, yeah. Michael, Vic came on with 96 feet. Like no one fucking passed the ball. Like it was just fucking crazy man, but yeah. And I'm still number one after that. That's cool. Makes sense. I'm glad you did that. Yeah, I mean like listen, from my standpoint, open for business. Like, you know, it sounds like you got a good understanding for me. I prefer leverage. I'm so insular. I'm gonna get mine regardless of what anybody does. So my basic thesis is like how do I give? How do I give? And give without expectation. Just give, give, give, give. That's where all the leverage comes from. So, you know, if you want to get some more established LPs for the fund, if you want to figure out something that VaynerMedia is doing right, if you want to come to New York and see it, like if you hear me say something about like Facebook video or influencer mark, like, anyway, it could be a help that I'm interested. Cool. You know, my main thing with like the young up and coming guys from Atlanta and shit like that from the music standpoint just for context is I'm just trying to hack culture 24, 7, 365. It's just hacking culture. And you know, I mean, MC Compton paid attention to more people than the game when he's at that point of the career. Once more shit comes to you, it's just supply and demand. So I just want to try to evaluate people on the come up, bring them more value, know that 80% of them aren't gonna get through, but the 20% that do is a net positive and I'm still not gonna ask them for anything, but it's nice to have. That's basically my thesis. It's a great thesis. It's the tried and true. Are you doing this for 40 years? I'm not gonna ever be number one on Madden, but I'm gonna buy the New York Jets and win a fucking Super Bowl. Doesn't look like the Raiders are going to get to Vegas. Yeah. Looks like that shit's done. That's done. Done. You know what's crazy is that what the fuck are they gonna do about the same color scheme? I thought about just your mind state. I thought about like starting some shit where I meet personally, make fucking charges, change their colors. By the way, do that tomorrow. Change your colors. What's going on? What's going on? What's going on with your social? I've been watching, been watching. I've been watching, been watching. My man. Hey. Appreciate your continued success, man. I love taking part. Thank you for the interview. Of course. What's your number? Tell these characters about the Ida. Tell them how really like... Well, I already told them that every November, right before the Thanksgiving... Oh, this is good. I've never said this publicly. I just want to ex-giv it. Gary, like, fuck, man, I got it. Like, what do you know? I got it in the working shop. It's the busiest time of the month. I'm like, well, I am. Fuck files. Schools more important. I mean, the work is more important. I got to go to the staff. I'm like, all right, he's never gone back. You ready for this? I left so... No, no. Actually, you know what the version of that is? I left so early freshman year, so early when I came to campus sophomore year. That's what you're referring to. Yeah. I got out of the car. I saw them sitting on a soup, stoop, drinking fucking, sane eyes. They looked at me like I was a ghost. They're like, we didn't think you were coming back. We're back because there's no texting. We didn't keep in touch. I'll see ya. Four months later. Yeah. Wait, there was a suite called 301. That's where we all friends. It was five rooms. The two outside rooms had four men to it. And then the three inside had two apiece. And I was the only one who wasn't actually in the dorm. But he was part of our crew. When we come in there and at one point Gary set up a bar. Like, bring up all the alcohol, set up a bar. Actually, like, functioning bar people. Drunk ass piece. That, what do you call it? That name is drunk ass piece. Drunk ass piece. You had a dap hat. He would sit there and drink. Like he was Norm. He'd be like, Gary, hit me for another one. I'm like, all right, fine. What was he doing? Jack Daniels. What was the other dude? Oh, his buddy from Jersey. Oh, what was his name? Tom. They would clean, what was it, a pint? A pint and just down. Remember the time he funnelled an entire 750 of Jack Daniels and passed out eight seconds later funnelled Jack Daniels. Oh, yeah. That's a very good size. Guys, I'm telling you, if I was doing DailyVee back then, we would watch that like, and all this flip shit telling them about like the Spice Girl dolls. Remember that shit? We used to go to it. Oh, he actually got me going. I actually got some Star lineup. We used to go, we used to get up early in the morning, go hit towards the rest. Gary tried to bribe the guy in the back. You know, to get him. I didn't try. I had him on payroll. There was no, there was no trying. The man was up. Hot wheels or whatever it was. I would pay a guy 20 bucks a week. He would open up the toys and the expensive ones he'd keep in the back. I'd come through and I'd get him off. Yeah, everything. Yeah. People think this is new shit. This is old school stuff. Was it Giz Toys? Giz Toys. I forgot. That was the name of the eBay account. Holy shit. Madden, you dominated Madden. Except for Stoker's Run. Don Maynard Hall of Famer. Those jets. That was, you know what, if you've seen my keynote when I talk about playing Madden 95, I was with Don Maynard Hall of Famer. That was the only time I was good. When the 69 Jets were introduced, I was too prideful. I was like, I can't let these guys lose. I remember I beat Chief. Remember Chief, the Indian kid? I beat him 68 to nothing. How about this trip? You got a trailer. Big time. You know what's funny? I really need to get some stories from you guys because I forget things. You forget things? No, I remember a lot of things. Forget nothing. It's true. I remember everything. I remember when you guys all went to Yukon and didn't take me. Oh, yeah. That was at Mike's house, right? Yeah. Oh, what? I was too high energy. That was devastating. Me and Moose, we were both 21 now. His 21st birthday, you, actually maybe all three of you, that story when I lost all my money in Vegas, but then I hit the straight. You were walking out the door. I don't know that. You don't know the story that we went for his 21st birthday? His 21st birthday in Las Vegas, in Las Vegas. I get there four hours early. I come with like $3,000. Everybody else comes. Moose came with $47. We're in Las Vegas for four days. No, no, no, no. Ready for this? Vegas for four days. LA for three days. That man comes with $47. And don't laugh because that's what he had. We were, it was ghetto, man. Anyway, I get there and I fucking start gambling. And I'm losing, like I've never, like just losing. And now I'm like scared because I'm like, fuck, I know I have to like kind of help everybody else like get through this week. So I'm feeling a little bit of responsibility. So I'm like, I'm down to like $1,500. I'm like, okay, I'm gonna start betting $100 at a time. I gotta get back up, lose. And I've got like $200. In four hours, I used $2,800. They haven't arrived yet, right? They haven't arrived. Then they get there. They like kind of come in. They're like, hey, like they see me and I'm white. I'm already the most white guy with the crew. Now I'm real white, right? They were like, what? So I'm like depressed. They're going to get settled. They're like pissed at me. They thought I was joking. I'm like, I lost my money. I get the fuck out of here. I'm like, fuck. So I walk around. What's that? No, no, it's way better. I don't know if you'll remember in a minute. I hear commotion. I need to waste a couple. I need to clear my head. I hear commotion. I look over. There's some Asian dude going nuts. Nuts. So I look, he got four queens in Caribbean poker. Won like $1,000. And he gets up and leaves. And there's this family, country family. Like five characters, like mom, dad, the kids. And they got real thick like Nebraska accents. And I'm like, can I sit down? Because it's like $10 a hand. Like sure. They're like super fun. Third hand. Third hand. And the way I play Caribbean poker is I keep four cards down. I keep one down. Don't look at it. Yeah, I don't look at it. So I pull up the four and I'm like three, five, six, seven, all hearts. And now like I'm, you know who I am. I'm like, show it. I'm like, do my thing. I'm like, guys, if I have a four of hearts, I've no thought I'm thinking. I got a straight four of hearts. 35,000, 44,000 is the whole pot for a royal flush. So I got 10%, $4,400. One hand. I have to fill up the taxing. I sent the check home for 2000. I told my father about that taxing the other time when you walked out. We were walking out the casino and you put it on five. Yes. Yes. You know that's our move. $5 on five. Bang. $3,500. Everyone else lost their ass. You know what I remember about that trip more than anything? The number one thing I remember? Not Glenn jumping over the escalator trying to get girls going the other way. Not that. Not all that. Bone thugs and Tupac song just came out and we listened to it on the drive from Vegas to LA. That's the number one thing I remember. Oh, before I go, you got to hear about Coach K. No internet. So we just would go to the mall. I'd be like, you know, we'd be sitting there and if it got boring enough, I'd be like, hey, let's go to the mall and I'll buy a video game. Remember, I was like, okay. Literally, that's what happened. You get a mousse as fucking hoopy, you'd be playing some fucking Pimsy or some shit that nobody knew what the fuck. Classics. Classics. Did he? We go to the mall and it would be like so fun because that's how we found out about PlayStation. No internet. No internet. We get back, software here. We'd go, let's go do what we did last year. It was first day so I was coming back with Bank and I was like, let's go to the mall. Did you pay cash like every year? Yeah, only pay cash for everything. You showed up in school and paid cash. Tuition. You know how weird that is? It probably like he's a guy who's a drug dealer or something. That's how Sasha Vaterchuk did it. So anyway, fucking, we went to the mall to buy a new Genesis game. I will never forget this actually. Because we were so into video. We were like, as soon as we walked into the KB Toy Store, it had a big display. KB. KB toys. And we were like, what the fuck is that? And I'll never forget it. We were like, should we do it? It was so expensive. It seemed like so much money. And we were like, do you want to see a demo of Battle Arena Toshiendo or whatever? Right? Battle Arena Toshiendo came with it, right? It was a fighting game. I'm almost sure it was Battle Arena Toshiendo or something like that. Yeah. And we were like, okay. And the shit was like, we didn't even understand. We were like, wait, CDs? Because it wasn't right? We didn't know. So I brought it back. We bought it. I wasn't going to buy it. It was real money. I was there ready for $40. It was like $2.30. You got to get another game. This is the single reason. He's like, come on, come on, come on. We got it. It was hard for him to tell me and Moose No. Yeah. You guys teamed up. Not those two. So I bought it. We get back. And like in five minutes, they're just, in like 10 minutes, the word on campus, everybody's in our dorm. We're like, what the fuck is this? It was crazy. Oh, Screech. That's what he called me. I love it, man. I love you. Come watch us if you got a minute. Yeah. Those are some good stories. I'm going to slap you in the face.
