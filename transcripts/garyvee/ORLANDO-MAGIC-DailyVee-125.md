So what we're in Orlando for five hours What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life Oh Good morning. How are you? Good checking in. Thank you so much. So you're just really sharp. Oh, I'm on the road half the year, so I'm used to it. But yeah, I missed it. I landed Sunday morning. Now it's pretty good. Do you have some 200? Yeah, no worries. Okay. The level of me giving a shiz at an all-time low. Super excited to be here at ICR, a conference in Orlando that I've actually done maybe four of the last six years, five of the last seven years. It's an investor's conference where Wall Street comes together with emerging CPG and restaurant groups. It's a really fun conference for me because as a lot of you know, my big goal over time is to eventually own brands and buy them and flip them and trade them. And this is an absolute conference where the banking world, the Wall Street world, the emerging CPGs and fast-casual restaurant groups are coming and some of the big guys and gals as well. And so I always have a little bit of an extra pep to my step when I'm at this conference because I know that so many of the people in this room are going to be people that I'm going to be sitting across from in board meetings over the next decade, two, three, four decades. And so that brings some energy to a lot of people here don't believe in the world that I believe in. A lot of people here are data people and data people in the way of using data to tell you what happened instead of doing what I do which is looking at intuition and then kind of different kinds of data and interpreting tone and using my magic to predict what's going to happen. And so a lot of times when I get talks here, I get a lot of people really excited about what I'm saying and a lot of people that want to punch me in the throat. And I think that's exactly how I like it best because when I talk and when I think about the world, I think about it in two ways. One, either I want them to completely love it or two, I want them to completely hate it because at the end I'm going to win. So we think six weeks of national TV focused in the first quarter will be a game-changing level of advertising that will drive this virtual cycle and will drive momentum and momentum will then drive more advertising and we will then be able to accelerate the move as you heard Mike Stocks and others really a transition from local, spent, international. This is our first step. I'm buying and creating all the capabilities. If you just looked at the hands in this room and this is a small focus group but I don't think anybody is confused by this and even if my brands that spend tens of billions of dollars to make a 30 second video to compel you to buy something that nobody on earth anymore consumes whatsoever, even if your remote control falls off your bed and you can't fast forward that commercial, everybody in this room grabs this and checks their work, treats about what LeBron just did and on and on and on. My friends, every single brand here today is throwing a lot of money in the trash in two places. Commercials, TV commercials and what I call traditional digital advertising. Buying programmatic banner ads and pre-rolls across the web that nobody on earth is consuming as well. Thank you guys. Have a great year. Cheers and other platforms. When you're ABC, NBC and CBS and it's 1982, you have 25% market share for your TV show. When cable comes along there's fragmentation. Twitter was, it was Twitter, Facebook and they had a lot of attention but then as Instagram and Snapchat came and they didn't innovate. They did an interesting OTT play of buying all these rights. If we're talking stock market and I had $40 million to put to work against the seven social networks, I put all 40. I mean all of it on Facebook. I mean do I take the leap and try to start my own company? The answer is yes. You need to have the conversation but you need to have the timing. You walk in and say dad I'm leaving. Well then make him have a counter move which will either be okay tough shot, go fucking show me and or oh okay wait why don't you stay and let's do some of that stuff. But when you go and say I'm out, you need to be ready. What we've done for four years is built an algorithm internally to like really understand who's overpriced and who's underpriced. Yeah really appreciate it. Bye dad. I'm Nicole Miller Regan someone had recommended you. Take care of yourself. Thank you. You did. Thank you very much. Such a pleasure. Thanks. Appreciate it. Take care. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. No no no. Wait a minute. One of the things that I need to expand on in a 2017 marketing conversation is the variable of Facebook creator, in its ROI. Something that I'm tapping into is that 90% of digital execution is garbage. No worries at all. No worries at all. It's nice to connect. But first of all, anytime those kind of trends happen, I get more excited, right? I tend to, yeah, I'm a contrarian by nature. Obviously, my whole career, I got into the internet business when people thought it was a fad. I bought into social media long before anybody did. I'm now pushing radio advertising when that seems weird. So I'm very comfortable in, I could care less what everybody else is doing. And so, and the other thing is, look, I don't view VaynerSports as the economical differentiator in my professional career. So a lot of what's happening from VaynerSports standpoint has a whole lot to do more with my heart and my brain over my wallet. Now that being said, you know, a lot, that being said, Liz, I fully plan on intending to build the premier sports representation business in the world. I mean, I don't get into something for kicks and giggles. Let's let you know, because you know, there's a lot of big agents at CAA and Rock Nation that like text me every day and wish that I picked them and they came with books. Liz, I wanna, listen, you've been around this a long time. I'm a big boy, you're a big girl. Like these agents can do better for these kids. And the reason Brian and Luke were attractive to me is they have much bigger hearts than maybe they have wallets. But the good news is, I'm the biggest fucking shark of all. I'll take care of the rest. I'm feeling like I'm shooting in front of a log. That's insane. And I'm like, so I just talked to my wife. I'm like, how do I get this card back to her? Let her know that it's safe. She's on a plane in Fort Lauderdale. Go to her Instagram. Go to the top right corner. Okay. I got three little dots. Hit send message. Take a picture of it. Send her a message. That's what you do. I will do that, dude. Take care, man. Nice meeting you. Real nice meeting you. Stay well. We're changing lives, man. Keep it up. I'm trying. Stay well, man. So you bought my tickets at Beyonce and we sent next to each other. Yes, we did. My wife works for PureWOW. PureWOW, which we just bought. I remember, man. So congratulations. I just arrived at CES. You know what's crazy? You're a big time creative director of sorts, right? I know. You're going to play humble. We were already far in the deal that night. So my wife and I just sit down to Beyonce and I start talking to your wife and I'm like, oh, this is really funny and things of that nature. So I was talking to Ryan about her and then he told me a little bit about you and I did a little homework. So it's real nice to meet you, man. Nice to meet you. And congratulations. Yeah, thanks, man. I'm really excited about it. Awesome. Yeah. I'll see her soon. I'll see you. Take care. All right. You're welcome. Yeah. Like totally. You feel like it's time? I'm like totally. You feel like it's time? There's nothing I hate on earth more than trying to produce me. Okay fine. People make excuses about they don't have enough time for social media. You're the busiest man on earth yet you find your pocket. Right. I'm advising you like. I'm not the, I'm just people, single parents raising multiple kids, plenty busy. Like I'm busy. A lot of people, you know, I'm real busy. So I'm comfortable with that. Just comes down to wanting it. You know, the reason so many of you A-list celebrities, B-list celebrities, A-list and B-list social media celebrities don't engage with their fans and use being busy as an excuse is because you don't actually want to engage with them. You actually don't care. You're playing a with game versus a depth game. And so, you know, I find my pockets because your actions speak louder than words. If you want something you do it. I used to say that I couldn't work out because it was too busy. Like how could I have that hour and a half every day? Because it was not only the hour working out. It was the 15 minutes, 15 minutes. You know, I just didn't have it. I had it. I just didn't want it. Made an excuse. Didn't care about it. And so the truth is that 90 something percent of people that are able to amass a fan base of any size are stunningly not appreciative. There's so many of you that hit me up on Instagram DM daily. How do I build a fan base and I go look at your content and you actually have seven fans and you've never engaged with them? You fucking take them for granted because you're fucking fancy because you don't want to put in the work because you think you're somebody. Fuck that. That's why you're losing. You deserve to lose. So we do it, I guess. It's a whole new world. All right. I'll see you in a little bit. Let's go to put locker. Barnett's Gary Vee. How are you? This is super ironic. I'm a little bit early for a meeting and I'm actually walking into a foot locker right now. These are cool. You see these? What's that? I'm playing games. All right. I'm playing games. All right. I'm playing games. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. You see these? What? I'm tired. Yeah. It's cool, right? Yeah. The amount of pleasure I get from the competitive nature of business is so insane. I think love, love this whole game just so fucking focused. Like I'm antsy to get the fuck out of this store. Like let's get these two pairs and get the fuck out of here. I like those pairs. I'm fired up. Got some new sneakers. I'll see you later, D-Roch. Going into a meeting now with Face Truck and I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to go into a meeting now with Face Truck and Steve Babcock, our creative officer. We're getting some of the buy. It's fun to watch the day after day. You can see the cadence of it. And then I'm going to go and see Willie Morris from Faithbox, the CEO. Sorry about that. Audio might have not been on point. Then I see Phil Toronto. I'm going to try to get home at least at a somewhat decent time, 1030 or so, so 11, 1030, 10.30.11 because I have a six-way workout because I'm trying to cram a shitload in tomorrow. So, grinding. Alright, are you having a busy week? Oh, you're documenting too. I am documenting. I just hit a thousand subscribers. Not quite a million like your Instagram, but you know. I give you a little love. Bill, how was Orlando? Nice. And you were with me, you were doing your busy thing? Yep. Does it help any time to do the busy? The 35th trip, I think. You just say 35? 35. 35. More times than I've been alive. And when you first started working with me, you used to drive because you were scared of flying? The first year that I worked with you was the second flight I had ever taken. And then through my incentive of flying, you just got comfortable in the side of flying was okay? That and whiskey. And it just grew up and became a big part of it. Yeah, right. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
