Nobody gives a fuck about you or me or anybody. They care about their own. Here is why I'm always happy. I got a lot going on. I know who the fuck I am. And I'm telling you, nobody gives a fuck. That humility is everything. Everybody's so insecure because they ain't humble. You think you're somebody. You think you're supposed to be somebody. Once you realize you're nothing, then you can't be beat. Nobody can beat me. Nobody can make my feelings feel hurt. Nobody can stop me. You know why? Because I don't think I'm anybody. So what the fuck are you saying? Just be happy. Calm it down. My question was pretty much was to how I can like make my business and my social media stand out when everyone's doing the same thing. But I also kind of in the midst of thinking wanted to know if it's right to leave your channel that you grew on because you want to change something. Is it okay to leave it or should you try to just grow, restart it on there? There's a lot to that. First of all, the number one mistake that every young person and every old person makes in life is not being able to be comfortable with adversity. Let's start with that. You built up a channel. I remember you. You wanted to do other stuff. There's nothing wrong with that. I even said in that video with you that you would get less views at first, just like I did. Just like I did when I went from wine to business. I was the wine guy. But I was comfortable because you didn't want to do that content anymore. So that wasn't gonna work anyway. But what you did was the cliche shit that everybody else does. You went, yep, you did it. You went and you wanted to make yourself happier, but then you were full of shit because what happened was as soon as you didn't get the views you were accustomed to, you became insecure, right? And you started getting in your head and you started worrying that you weren't as cool, you weren't as good, you weren't gonna get as many brand deals. And you got it all fucked up. Couple things. Number one, social media is changing like crazy. I need everybody to hear this. How many followers you have is becoming less important? It's becoming less important. What the platforms want is to people to stay on their platform. What they want is for people to stay on their platform. What is now the game is just the individual piece of content. If you go to my TikTok right now, my whole team's in the background, they know this. Literally four TikToks ago, I have a TikTok that has less than 10,000 views. Like literally 9,000 or something, 8,000. The next post has over a million. The 400 trillion to one video, a million. By the way, the 400 trillion to one video did not do as well on Instagram. I'd been on fire on Instagram. We put up the 400 trillion to one video I just put out. It did solid. On TikTok, it went crazy. The post before the million plus views on the TikTok, I have a video that has less than 10,000 views with 15 million followers. So the answer is yes, go back to your channel because that's gonna make you feel good. Because that's gonna make you feel good because you need right now, you're not strong enough emotionally to not give a fuck. All I've been trying to do for 18 years is to get all of you to not give a fuck about the numbers, about the opinions. Go back to your channel, but make videos in any way you want. On TikTok, on Instagram, on YouTube, because it's not gonna matter because it's gonna find its audience. It's becoming more about the individual piece of content. Do you understand? The answer is, believe it or not, it doesn't matter. Whether you start a new account, it can get a million views. Whether you go back to a dormant account that had 100K on it, it will get a million views or zero views depending on the piece of content. And so right now, it's clear to me on your young journey that you need that follow count for a little bit of a boost, so go back to it. Is that what I'm saying? I just feel bad because I left it hanging and my con... You left nothing hanging. Darling, you didn't leave shit hanging. Nobody gives a fuck. Nobody cares. Nobody gives a fuck. I left tea with Gary Vee hanging. It was everybody's favorite show. Now I'm back. I got fucking mugs. I'm back with fucking mugs. Nobody gives a shit. Everybody's so fucking caught up. Here's the problem with everybody. Everybody's equally insecure as fuck and audacious as fuck. Nobody gives a fuck about you or me or anybody. They care about their own shit. Nobody's like, oh, you left the fucking channel hanging. Why the fuck are you coming back? Nobody gives a fuck. Yes, that's true. Facts. Facts. Nobody... Here is why I'm always happy. I got a lot going on. I know who the fuck I am. And I'm telling you, nobody gives a fuck. That humility is everything. This is fucking humility out here. Once you lean into humility, it's over. Nobody can beat you. Humility is the fucking secret sauce. Be humble. Everybody's so insecure because they ain't fucking humble. You think you're somebody. You think you're supposed to be somebody. Just be happy. Fucking calm it down. Nobody gives a fuck that you left it hanging. Okay. Okay, okay. And with that, I wanted to go to my actual question is to how do you make yourself stand out? Well, maybe you said it already, but I just want to clarify. I love you for that. I love you for that. And I got you on this. That's not your actual question. Your actual question was some insecure shit. How do I stand out when everybody else is doing the same shit? That's what you actually asked. Everybody's doing the same shit as me too. I literally watch people make content based on what I said. Do you know how many people are about to make be humble videos in the next week? It doesn't matter. You are competing with everybody. It is the way it is. Like how do you stand out? Be better. Read more, be more curious. Consume different shit. Mix up your game. Live different experiences. Mix shit up. Stay curious. Be creative. This is why I fuck with creative crap. You should go to fucking eBay right now and buy a creative crab fucking trading card about VFriends that's sticking in that beautiful wall you have right there. Fuck it. Can we send her a creative crab? Fuck it, you don't need to buy it. Rips, send this beautiful young lady a creative crab fucking trading card. Let her stick it on her fucking wall back there with all the other shit. Be creative, be curious. How do you be better? Be better. Practice. Make more fucking content. Everyone's in their own fucking head. Everybody wants to get better, but they're all stuck in their fucking head and they don't do shit. Cause you're all fucking scared out here. Everyone's fucking scared. You know why? Cause you're not humble. Once you realize you're nothing, then you can't be beat. Nobody can beat me. Nobody can make my feelings feel hurt. Nobody can stop me. You know why? Cause I don't think I'm anybody. So what the fuck are you saying? So when I go back to my channel, do I do like a life update? Hey, this is why I did it. Yeah. Okay. Be like, I'm back bitches, motherfucker, I'm back. Okay, I'll do that. And do it now. Do it right now while you got, while I gave you all this, like write the fuck now. Cause as soon as every minute you step away from this camera, you're going to go in that little head of yours. Do it right the fuck now. Hang the fuck up. Turn the camera said, fuck it, Gary Vee made me do this. And give him a fucking life update. Fuck the lighting. Fuck the script. Talk about your fucking life. Okay. Okay. I love it. All right. I will do that. Good. See ya. Love you. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
