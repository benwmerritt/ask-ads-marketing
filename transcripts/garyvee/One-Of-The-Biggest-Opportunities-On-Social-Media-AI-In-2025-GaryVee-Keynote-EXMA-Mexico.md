## Transcript
One of the biggest opportunities for everyone in here today is selling things on social media in live shopping. We sold $40,000 worth of t-shirts in my office last week in two hours. I'm talking a lot about it, and 90% of the people don't know it, and in three years I will get a lot of credit, but there are multiple people right now making millions of dollars a month literally going live and selling product. It is going to be humongous. Some of you are shy on camera. Good news, you do not need to be on camera for this to work for you. I need everybody to hear this. You do not need to be on camera for this to work. There are many people who are winning in social media just by writing, only writing. Nobody knows who they look like, they don't even use their real name. You do not need to be on camera. Number two, you're like me, not a good writer, but you're unlike me, you're scared of the camera. There's a third option, it's called voice. You can do an entire channel where I could make content by pointing at you and talking about it and you never see me. There are three ways to win on social media, written, audio, or video. You must figure yourself out and be okay with what you're comfortable with. It's okay to not love video, it's okay to not be a good writer, it's not okay to lie to yourself. Understood? Yeah. Social media is free, it's fucking free. When I landed here and I saw a billboard of this expo, which is a good job marketing, I don't think they got it for free. You pay for a billboard, you pay for newspaper, you pay for direct mail, you pay for Google AdWords, you pay for television, you pay for PR. Social media is free. You can run ads, but you can post something right now and 10,000 people could see it. All right, how many people here know who I am? Raise your hand. Thank you. Actually, how many people here, this won't hurt my feelings, so don't lie, how many people here don't know who I am? Okay, fuck you. I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Listen, listen. For 15 years, I have worked every day to make videos and pictures and written words on the seven to 10 platforms that have mattered to allow me to have the incredibly humbling feeling of having so many people here in Mexico City raise their hand and know who I am. That has allowed me to amass a lot of followers and three years ago, if I had 10 million followers like I do today on Instagram or 15 million followers on TikTok like I do today and you had zero, when I posted I got a lot of views and you got none, that changed three years ago. I need everybody here to pay very close attention to what I'm talking about right now because it is the single most important part of my talk besides fear. Three years ago, the entire world changed. It changed because TikTok had become successful enough to start pressuring Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and every other social media platform. I grew up in social media for the last 15 years and it was more similar to email marketing. How many people here by show of hands have done email marketing in their careers? Please raise your hands. Raise it up, actually stand up, I wanna see it. Let me just see. This is phenomenal. First of all, that's super cool. I love email marketing so thank you, thank you, you can sit down. So for the half of you that just stood up in this room, you're gonna understand what I'm about to say. For the first 15 years of social media, it was email marketing. Get as many people to follow you and a percentage of those people would see your post every day. Three years ago, social media became not social media anymore. Social media today should actually be called interest media. How many people here are on TikTok? Raise your hands. All of the people that just raised their hand, first of all, how many people here are not on TikTok? Raise your hands, not on TikTok. I don't know what your points of view on it is. China, tracking, I don't know what it is, but you could put that on the side, you know, like the kids on it. Let me just say one thing that I believe in more than anything, when it comes to business, business, just business, your opinions of like what makes you feel good to yourself are your vulnerability to what the consumer is actually doing. So that's for all the people that raised their hand. Nonetheless, TikTok, everybody who raised their hand on TikTok, and now it's happening on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter, so whatever platform you're on, you know what I'm about to say. You no longer have to follow people. The content you want comes to you. The fact that I'm standing here in this talk, and I know that I'm saying very compelling stuff, which I genuinely believe will inspire, let me look, some people up there, I know that 10 people in here are gonna listen to me and do something. The fact that one of those 10 people has never posted on social media, and their third or fourth or fifth post next week is gonna start the beginning of them changing their lives is single reason that I continue to do what I do. Period. It is so rewarding, thank you. I wish this on all of you. On the flight here, I caught up with my work, and so it gave me time to read my direct messages and my emails that are not business oriented. There's not a day in my life that I live that people do not email me and say thank you for the details that I'm sharing with you right now, because one social media post, one, can actually change your life. That is insane to me. I know when I say it out loud that people hear that maybe you're not as knowledgeable about what I'm talking about may not believe. What's up brother? You're welcome. You need to listen to me on this. There is no logical reason that a person or a business, whether you're an accountant, whether you sell t-shirts, whether you own a restaurant, there is no logical reason for a human or a business to not be posting on this era of social media as much content as they possibly can produce every single day. I'm gonna make a prediction right now so I can use this video. Hey Dustin, I'm gonna make a prediction right now so I can use this video in 15 years. So I'm gonna be selfish right now, but I want you to listen to what I'm about to say. All of you are gonna regret when we go away from this and we go into glasses and social media will be different. All of you here will regret this one era in the last 100 years where the world's attention was on a platform that was free. All of you, some of you that have been following me for a long time regret not jumping on TikTok seven years ago when I was begging you to. I get it and the ones that did felt the effects. My friends, this is a very special time in the world. It's also a dangerous time. The rules are getting rewritten. You all know this because the television is no longer in charge. Do you understand? The television is not in charge and this is a remarkably important fact. And so now let's talk about this part of the conversation. If this is true, what happens next? What happens next is self-awareness. Okay, let's say you're listening to me and even if you are making content, you realize I'm making 50 pieces of content a day. I have 30 full-time employees that work just on my content. I'm pot committed. So some of the people in here that are like, yeah, I'm doing it, you're not fucking doing it. So if you think you're doing it, quadruple it. And if you're not doing it, start. Because for the people here that are like, yes, I want to be talking about health and wellness or gut health or travel or football, your football, not mine or whatever the fuck you are passionate about. You can't quit your job and just start it, but you can do what I'm talking about every evening and one post can start your career for you to no longer be a lawyer when you want to be an influencer about football or wine or travel. That's real life. Our grandparents did not have this. We are the lucky generation. The problem is most of you are not fully taking advantage of it. So for me, there is no excuse. I understand responsibility I've had in my whole life, but I do not understand not changing your life if you're interested in being happier. Why not? And I cannot believe that we have this and I cannot believe how many people continue not to use it. If you're B2B, LinkedIn is crazy. LinkedIn is crazy. The amount of opportunity LinkedIn every day if you make a video is staggering. If you're an employee and you don't love your job or your company, you're one LinkedIn post talking about the industry you're in away from somebody recruiting you to a competitor and you're making 10 or 20% higher than you made yesterday. The single greatest opportunity in the world for people to change the outcome of how they live or how their business is doing is called organic social media. Social media posts without spending media. I do not understand. I continue to fly around the world begging people to hear me. It's free. It's free. And the fact, the first 10 years I understood, it took time to build up to a level and most of you do not have patience. I understood. But that's not even what it is anymore. There are people literally in here who've never posted on social and are gonna post on TikTok and the sixth video is gonna get more views than I get and I've been doing it every day for almost 20 years. There is a level of merit to the individual piece of content that we have never seen. That level of merit is the great opportunity of your life. I'm telling you what it is, but that doesn't mean you're gonna be good at it. I'm telling you what it is, but a lot of you have already tried and it hasn't clicked because you haven't brought enough value to your audience. My friends, this is a staggering reality and I'll be honest with you, for the ones in here who've seen me speak before or have consumed my content, the level of urgency that I'm speaking on this stage on is grounded in reason. It's called, I don't think it's gonna be here in 10 years. Not this way. I really do believe that glasses are coming and I think when the phone goes away, there'll be a reset and in that reset will be a lot of lost opportunity and I really, really, really want you all to grab it because you will regret it. And I'm telling you, I'm talking now philosophically, but I'm gonna go right back to the dirt. The answer to the quiz, the answer to your question, the unlock to the door is social media. It's free. You could have negative $713 in your bank account right now and you can make content for free. Who here does not have a phone? Does not have a phone? Raise your hand. That's what I thought. Everybody fucking has it. This computer that I have in my hand right now, this computer is more powerful than the computer that Ronald Reagan had in the White House. We have unlimited opportunity. Fear and being full of shit are your two vulnerabilities. There are many of you that are literally not jumping into your destiny because of your parents. It's just the way it is. It's how the game is played. A lot of you are not doing certain things because you love your parents and you don't wanna make them scared or disappoint them. I wanna talk to that crew. Actually, that's a good question and this might be a little bit difficult, but I ask you to be honest for the rest of the audience. How many people here are not actually changing careers or starting a business or doing something in their personal life potentially because they don't wanna disappoint their parents? Raise your hands. I wanna see it. Raise your hands high, please. Great. Good. I wanna talk to the 50 people that just raised their hand because I know it's 150 people because some of you might be sitting with their fucking parents and you're like, fuck that shit. This is my favorite one because it's the easiest one to explain. I study people for a living and have my whole life I've come to realize. The people that don't do things because they love their parents so much, they don't wanna disappoint them, eventually as they get older, actually end up having worse relationships with their parents because what you'll do is you'll start to resent them and not be accountable that you're in control. And so instead of right now having a little bit of discomfort and maybe some negativity for a short period, you're gonna have it forever. And then they're going to die and you're really gonna regret it because hopefully they die when you're 60 or 70 and then you're gonna feel like it's too late and you gave up the last 40 years of your life. My friends, let me promise one thing about your parents. Obviously there are some parents, unfortunately whether it's psychological or drug abuse, obviously there's some parents that are very challenged but I promise you for the people in here who have the most conservative parents or traditional parents, your parents love you. They want you to be happy. They will be hurt by you doing something that they're scared of, marrying the wrong person, taking the wrong job, needing them to pay for you because you took a risk and you have no money. They will be scared but I promise you, I can't think of a single thing on earth that is more vulnerable and riskier than living your life based on what you think your parents want. It is always 100% of the time a losing formula. You must stop it, understood? The partner you choose in life, there's a lot of you that are not doing things because of your partner. That's bad and it's hard. You could feel the room change when I just said that. It's a big one. Any partner in your life that doesn't support you is a selfish partner. Doesn't mean they're bad. Means often, believe it or not, I'm gonna make this very simple, it means they're scared. In fact, a lot of times, it's because they love you so much, they're scared if you go do this thing, you'll become slightly different and you may not want to be with them anymore and they can't bear to think of that because they actually love you so much. A partner that does not support a partner is living within security. Not hate or anger. Insecurity, my friends, is the most dangerous energy in our society. Insecurity is the seed that leads to darkness. It's like Darth Vader in Star Wars. That's why that movie's the fucking best. They fucking nailed it. Insecurity. And by the way, just like Star Wars, insecurity and confidence is a very thin line. That's why sometimes they confuse you. Ego. My friends, you must build up the courage yourself to have a real conversation with your partner that does not support you. You must come from empathy because if you come from anger or negative energy, it will be met with anger and negative energy. I believe the greatest strength in the world is the ability to be the bigger person even when someone is doing something wrong to you. I believe in fact, the reason the world is struggling right now is that we've lost civility because most people don't have the confidence to be the bigger person in the face of someone's action, not being good. We go down instead of up. And so I ask all of you, I come here for impact. I come here for impact. I've also been doing this a long time. I'm aware that 99% of this room will not fix their fear and will not act on the tactics of social media. I know it. I wish it. I wish. I wish I could always reference fucking Mexico City as the one crowd that fucking did it. You guys are full of shit. I promise. You cheer here because it's easy in the seat. But then you leave here and real life starts to sweep back in. Uh-huh. That's why that clapping's happening. Whoever's clapping their nose, you get the high of this. But then it seeps away as you go away. It takes incredible strength to address the two things that I'm asking. It's Mexico. I love fucking Mexico. Mexico. But it's fucking human. And whether it's Mexico or Africa or Amsterdam or New York or Tokyo, I have had the blessing of being all around the world and with all the love and respect to Mexico. This is not my fucking first time in Mexico. And I have watched crowds tell me what they're gonna do. And I'm a funny fucking guy. I start to follow and pay attention because I wanna learn. Because I watch people. People love to talk. People love to talk. People are scared as fuck to do. My friends, make 2025 your year. How many more fucking years do you want to live knowing you're not living the full thing that you know you can do? How many more? Zero. Zero. That is what I hope on all of you. You will learn very quickly the number one thing you should not do, which is allow fear to dictate how you live your life. The number one thing that people in their 80s and 90s talk about is what they wish they did. Always. Always. Promise. And so when I thought about what I wanted to talk about here, it was really only two main things. One, how do I eliminate your excuse? Because when you're scared, you spend all your time building up your excuses. How do we hang out together today? On this day. And how do I figure out different things to say? Or when I do the Q and A? To get someone here to say today, this talk, this moment, is the moment I'm really ready to not be scared again. That if I jump, no matter how hard I fall, that's better than not jumping, which is 100% true. And then number two, how do I address the only other thing that could be happening, which is actually very practical? Fear is fake. My friends, fear is fake. What is not fake is responsibility. Some of you are not ready to jump because you're the person in your family that pays the rent. And if you don't pay the rent, you don't have a house. You're the person that puts food on the table. You have responsibilities. Responsibilities is not fake. This is why I'm obsessed with this. This, a lot of people don't like right now because they think we spend too much time in it. That's fine, you're allowed. This is also literally the key to your ability to address your practicality issue. This is the only weapon that can solve your problem when you have responsibility and you have to do a job or something to pay the bills. This is the only weapon that is practical that can change your life. And so that's what I wanna talk about. I wanna talk about this. Because talking about fear and how it's holding you back, that might take years of therapy. That might not be today. Maybe today's the first seed and maybe in three years this seed blossoms and you're ready to jump. Everybody here, whether it's kissing a boy or girl, whether it's swimming, whether it's jumping out of a plane, whether it is riding a bike, everybody here has felt fear and everybody here at some point in their life, 100% has gotten over the hump and then most of all realizes what the fuck was I scared of? So that I can't control. That I can encourage. That I can give you all my energy that just came from New York City. I wanna give it to you. I hope somebody takes it and uses it to jump. But that I'm not as much in control of of what I really wanna talk to you about, which is this weapon. Because there's some people in here who literally are just letting fear be what's stopping them and they're just worried about the judgment of their parents, of their siblings, of their spouse or the worst, strangers on social media. But I also know that the majority of people here, it's not just fear, it's responsibility. And so that's why I'm gonna focus on this. Social media. Social media is free. I just need everybody to follow along with me right now. Let's talk about being full of shit. A lot of you deal with the fact that you know that you're not living your life the way you want to by tricking the people around you. You talk good game. You come up with excuses that are clever. You talk. I wanna tell you about tricking the people around you. The only people you're tricking are losing players. Every person in here, if they're lucky enough to have a friend, a partner, a family member who is emotionally intelligent, they know that you're full of shit. You know who listens to your excuses? Other people that have excuses too because you listen to their bullshit. And your mom or dad, because they just love you so much and they're creating entitlement. That's who listens to excuses. I don't listen to excuses from anyone except my inner family. That's what you do. My friends, you can bullshit yourself. And the way you're doing that is by bullshitting others. But I promise you, whoever you think you're convincing is not the people you wanna be convincing. This is the greatest opportunity in the history of the world. Literally, TikTok, Snapchat, not to just send messages. It's called, I see some of you taking notes. One of the biggest opportunities in Mexico is Snapchat spotlight. It's their TikTok. There's a lot of people on it, but there's very few people that make for it. Whoever here goes hardest at it, will see results. YouTube shorts, LinkedIn. TwitterX is about to announce their video tab. Meta never ever bet against Mark Zuckerberg. Meta is doing its thing. And Facebook and Instagram are huge opportunities. We are in an unprecedented time of opportunity. There are seven significant platforms that have hundreds of millions of people on it that allow you to reach those people for free. I need you to start posting. And I don't even give a shit what you post. Just fucking post. Please, please. Obviously there's, look, there's obviously so much underneath what you should post. Good news. Oh, very good news. I actually have a URL for you. I wrote a book recently called Day Trading Attention that broke down the whole thing. But I'm so tired of excuses that some people told me they don't have $13 to buy the book. So I made a 50 plus page deck for free so you can get the gist of it. I'm gonna give you the URL right now if you wanna get it. It's free. It's garyvee.com. And by the way, it's real free. When you go to it, it's not like fake free where you have to like go and then like, I trick you and you give me $10. I don't give a fuck. It's fucking free. It's garyvee.com slash attention, right? Garyvee.com, garyvee.com slash attention. If you're inspired but you have no idea what to do, good news. I made a 50, 60 page deck in detail. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For the marketing, who's a marketing executive here? Raise your hand. Marketing execs. For the marketing execs here, I'm just gonna talk to you for five minutes before I go into Q and A. Can you please stop wasting money on dumb shit? It is insane to me. We have a VaynerMedia now has an office in Mexico City. We're very excited about it. It is insane to me how much people hold on to yesterday. They love a billboard. They love newspaper. They love television ads. And they shit on social media creative. I don't mind the old things. I mind that they're too expensive in 2024. And meanwhile, the place where brand and sales is actually happening is very underpriced. That is gonna be the premise of the deck if you go to GaryVee.com slash attention. Marketing friends, you must challenge your organizations. You are spending money based on fake reports. You are spending money on fake reports, fake impressions, fake reach, GRPs, bullshit, awards, headlines. The marketing industry is in crisis. It is in crisis. That is why so many brands are taking work in house. It's why so many holding companies are laying off people right now at scale. We must accept that it is 2024. I too wish it was 1945. It was such so simple. Fuck, I wish it was 1830. I'd ride a horse, eat a carrot and sleep. It'd be amazing. But we're alive now. And this is what it is now. And by the way, in 50 years, all of you will remember this as the simple time. Because technology is undefeated. We're not going backwards, I promise. Just cause some people are going off social media for a month, the robots are coming. The world will look very different in 60 years. This is the simple time now. You're worried about your kids being on the iPhone, wait to see what your kids are worried that their kids are doing. They're gonna be fucking robots. So my friends, we are in crisis. We must change the way we spend media dollars and creative. The world is moving. How many people here do a lot of advertising or do advertising on Google AdWords? Raise your hands. Raise your hands high, please. If your business relies on Google AdWords, in the next decade, you've got a problem. AI is coming. Google AdWords is gonna look like yellow pages. There's only one thing I promise that nothing stays still. I wish it did. I've been winning the last 10 years. I wish I could chill. I hate that I have to go so hard because it's moving so fast. But you can't hope in business. You can't use your opinions in business. You must only do one thing in business. Be obsessed with the actual customer. What does she and he actually do? That is my religion. And that is what I focus on. I focus on two things, the clouds and the dirt. In the clouds, I focus on the first part of this talk. Insecurity, empathy, kindness to yourself. How can you be kind if you're not kind to yourself? Patience, hard work, actual perseverance. You know why so many people are struggling? Parents made the kids too soft. Adversity is good. Losing is good. Getting hurt is good. It builds up resilience. Resilience matters. Clouds, emotions, and then dirt, tactics. I care about what the mentality needs to be successful. And then I care about the tactics today that need to be successful. I play in the clouds and dirt. My observation is most people play in the middle. And the middle, my friends, is dangerous. So get your fucking head right and get the fucking doing. And then why ever the fuck you came today? Because you came today, right? You're fucking here, all of you. I assume you came to get something out of it. Do not think coming here is the doing. I've seen that my whole life. You think coming here means you did it. You know, doing something when you leave here is doing. Fall in love with doing, and you'll smile for the rest of your fucking life. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so here's the idea. We have five questions. Okay. And we want to invite the audience to answer some, ask some of the questions. Please. I would love to. You speak a lot about speed. Speed? And then slowing down. Yep. And then speed again. Could you tell us a little bit to all these people that are here, why it's so important to speed up and then like make some process in order to create a plan? We're all human beings. I don't think this is gonna be confusing to any of you. There's certain times in your life that you're very high energy and you're excited and you want to do. Then there's certain times when you're tired and you need to rest. I am shocked by people's inability to not judge themselves. I'm gonna say that again, nice and slow. I am shocked in the inability of humans to not judge themselves. When I'm going hard, I don't think I'm burning out. I don't think I'm hustle porn. I don't think I'm a workaholic. I think I'm being practical in what I feel in that moment. When I am resting, when I take a weekend, a month, there has been years in my career where I've been slower than I was because of things happening in my personal life. I don't think I'm a loser. I don't think I lost it. I don't think I'm complacent. I think I'm a fucking human being. Stop beating yourself up. Woo! I think that's a great question. You wanna ask something? Yeah, I have a second question. Like I was telling you backstage night, I have a podcast I started almost three years ago and I've seen the podcasting industry burn so much. What do you think it's going now? Because I mean, people were on Instagram before and then it was TikTok and now it's a podcasting world. So what do you think, kind of the end is visual? I was doing podcasts in 2010 when you were a thought in his mind. 11. So I'm gonna give you a really good answer that's gonna help a lot of you. This is actually, I'm really, thank you for asking that question because it's gonna allow me to say what I'm about to say. This may be the single thing that helps a lot, the most people in here, I'm passionate about this one. I think everybody thinks in or and I only think in and. So I think podcasting will keep going and I think social media will keep going until there's a huge shift in distribution. It's why I talked about glasses. But with glasses, I don't know how many of you have used the Meta glasses, but the audio is incredible. Most of my friends that are now wearing the Ray-Ban Meta glasses no longer have AirPods. That's how good the audio is. So when I think about that, I look at all the people in the audience with glasses. In the future, when I'm speaking, I'm gonna be thinking, are these guys listening to a podcast while they're watching me? Because it's that seamless. I'm not kidding when I say we're gonna be robots. It's one step at a time. This is the beginning. Do you know what, I want all of you to stay for a second and remember the last time you either lost, broke, or really, really, really fucked up your phone, how you reacted. You see? Step one, step one. You literally, like if I literally came now and said bad news everyone, I have to take your phone and you can never have another one. You would be fucked up. Step one. So I think podcasting will stay. I think, because podcasting is radio. This is just, you understand? Social media will stay because social media is television and magazines. Everything changes and nothing changes. You understand? And so that's the game. You're welcome. Change on the distribution. I focus on distribution. And once I understand what's happening in distribution, I only focus on the creative that can work on that distribution. That is how it works. So when cable was invented, that changed the world. Just like when television, I mean, my friends, if you're lucky enough to have somebody in your family who's a hundred years old, talk to them. They didn't have a television, phone. So people are bad at history. I was a very bad student, but only one subject that was very good at history. And I never understood and now I understand. It's how I think. I think in pattern recognition. I'm good at the future because I'm very strong at the past. You understand? History. Yep. Took you there. So we have one question in the audience already. Okay, over there. Hi, it's a pleasure having you here. What's your name, my friend? My name's Juan. Juan, pleasure. So I really admire your perseverance and content creation and you really do it from your heart. And I feel like if you do it, it inspires me that I can do it myself too. So thank you for that. Thank you. My question would be, what would you recommend me to would be a key thing to build authenticity when developing my personal brand and to connect with others? By never saying anything you don't believe in. And I'll expand on that for all of you. In 2009, 10, 11, 12, when I was starting to pop off, there was other people because we all kind of predicted Twitter and Facebook. But then I watched all of them guessing because they wanted the feeling of predicting something right. They were just guessing. The reason most of the things that I say come true is because I wait till it became true. Let me give you an example. One of the biggest opportunities for everyone in here today is selling things on social media and live shopping. One of the biggest things that can change someone's life in this room is live social shopping, TikTok shop, literally going live and selling product. It is going to be humongous. And I'm talking a lot about it and 90% of the people don't know it. And in three years, I will get a lot of credit, but there are multiple people right now making millions of dollars a month selling stuff. The other thing I'm very good at is I also do. So once I realized it was happening, I don't know how many of you follow my V-Friends, my Pokemon Marvel thing, but I'm selling, we sold $40,000 worth of t-shirts in my office last week in two hours as me as the host, as me as the strategist. So when you want to talk about doing, I never ever talk about anything. You want authenticity? I don't talk about anything I haven't tasted. And that's that, okay? And that is why we call this community the doers. You are doers, that's what you're pursuing with. I love it this. Thank you, Gary, thank you for coming. I think this is the job. Because some weeks ago, I was dreaming that I was in this place asking you this question. Amazing. What's your name, my friend? Alex. Alex, nice to meet you. I'm from grounded. Do you have any advice for us to get our own purpose? Because sometimes we're just chasing money and we're not sure if we want to do this for the rest of our lives. Yeah, don't chase money. Maybe today this is a thing that don't feel my soul or maybe... It makes you money for now. But that's okay. This goes back to what I said earlier, Alex. If right now, look, money... Like, I talk a lot... And a lot of you know this. I talk a lot about like, don't do it for the money, did it? But money is a thing in our lives. It's okay. Don't demonize money. I'm an entrepreneur. I like making money, but I don't like making money to fill my soul. I like making money to give me optionality to fill my soul. And you don't need that much money. Long ago, not seven figures, not eight figures, not nine figures. Six figures gave me plenty of optionality because there's another thing I didn't do when I started making 100,000 a year. I didn't start buying things to impress other people. There's a real interesting thing about money that nobody wants to actually talk about. Most people want money to buy things to hide their insecurity. The fuck do you think these watches and Lambos are? So, there's nothing wrong with you seeing something or doing something right now that is helping you make money that's good for you and your family. You're also a young man. The first 12 years of my entire career, from 22 to 34, I worked 100 hours a week building a business for my father. I didn't start my career until I was 34 years old. I was definitely not making money because my dad didn't pay me shit. And I was building a business for him. But that's what was in my soul at that time. And then when it wasn't, and I wanted to build something for myself, I went and did that. So you shouldn't beat yourself up because you haven't found your purpose yet. You should actually be happy that you realize that you haven't found your purpose yet. Ooh, you like that, right? That was some shit, boys! That was some shit! Ooh, that was a good one, Dustin. You better clip that. That better be on fucking Instagram next week. So, bro, that's it. You know? The improv is so much more my natural place. So that's it, bro. You're welcome. So we have another one here with me. Hi. Hi. I spoke today about AI. What I want to understand is how your company is about services, perspective services. So how you are facing this digital transformation of AI and your own company and your services, too. To me, ideas are still going to be the punchline. I know how to use AI. A lot of people are going to know how to use AI. To your point, anybody who makes content will be affected by AI. If I can make a video or a picture in three seconds for no money, and instead it would take three people, $50,000, to make it, that's disruptive. I don't think we get paid for the doing. I think we get paid for the thinking. And so the word prompt engineer is going to be something everyone eventually is going to know. So to me, I'm happy for the thinkers. Because it's the thinkers, the people with the ideas, the creatives that are actually getting the leverage from AI. The creatives are not getting put out of business. They're the architects. The masons are getting put out of business. The people who just hear your idea and then make, but don't have an idea of their own. That is what AI is going to do in our world. It's going to do a lot of things in a lot of worlds. But today, I feel that people are still confused because it's early. But by the way, let's say the AI gets so remarkable that it's doing the thinking. I'm never scared about technology putting me out of business. I take it on as responsibility that if I see it, I have to change my business. If my marketing company has to start selling mangoes and hot dogs or hats, then that's what I will do. I am not romantic. I am not ideological. Those are things that get you out of business fast. First of all, thank you so much to Fred for making this experience possible for all of us. Thank you. Thank you very much. Clap it up! What the fuck? Thank you. To be honest, since last Tuesday, I didn't know who you are. And it's pretty fucking amazing and crazy because the Tuesday, I asked to chat GPT, who are the best marketers in the world? And you were in that place. And I started following you by LinkedIn. And that night, I connect to Fernando and Suarez. And I won this wonderful pass. But what I want to know, please, is who or whose are your mentors? And how did you find your passion? And how you don't quit in this passion? Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Mentally, passionately, emotionally, my mentor are my parents. That's it. Professionally, marketing, you're my mentor. And he's my mentor. The reason I became who I became in marketing is I've never read a marketing book in my life. In my life. I've written a lot of them. I have only, since I was six years old, been mentored by you, all of you. I have been 100% for the last 43 years of my life, making every marketing decision by watching human beings. The humans are my mentors. They're my boss. They show me. And when social media came along, I accelerated because I didn't have to just watch them in real life anymore. I could consume them at scale on social media. There hasn't been an election that has surprised me. Not just in America, anywhere. There's not been a fashion trend that has surprised me. There's not been a decline or an emergence of popular culture. I talk a lot for a lot of people because I put out a lot of content. But 99% of what I do for a living is listen. I'm watching. And so my mentor is the world. Hello. There you go. Hello. Thank you, Gary. Pleasure. I'm Lucas. Hello, Lucas. And I just want to share a little story. Please. Last year, I saw you for the very first time in Cannes. In Cannes Festival. Yes, sir. And you inspired me a lot. Thank you. And I cannot believe that today I shared this stage with you because I just opened the event today. Amazing. And I just want to tell you that if I did it, you also can do it. Yes. Okay. So cheers for yourself. And thank you very much. Thank you, Lucas. You're so inspiring. Let's clap it up for our opener today. They have a question. They have a question for you. So we can predict trends. I don't predict trends. I'm very fast at observing trends. Then jumping. I don't have any fear of wasting my time. Many of you, you like that? Many of you don't jump on things because you think it might be a fad. And you're like, well, if I give TikTok all my energy and it disappears like Vine or like Peach, well, that was a waste of time. You're wrong. The reason I was so good at Snapchat and TikTok was all the hours I spent on Vine and social cam and photo booth apps that you don't even remember. I learned the craft of short form video on other platforms and then one stuck. You value your time when your time is not that valuable. Yeah, that one fucking hurt. You notice, you notice there's a lot of people with ego and they're like, I don't have time. You have fucking time. I have 3000 employees. I produce 50 pieces of content a day. I have three full time admins just to check my email and I have time. The fuck are you talking about? And what is Gary's week going? Where are you going? I mean, if I was born in America, I'd be going to the White House, but I wasn't. So you know what? Honestly, I know that's a little bit of a joke. I already, I'm not going anywhere. I've been where I'm going. I am a person that deeply loves his family. I'm a person who deeply loves positivity over negativity and I'm a person that feels guilt. Without fortunate, my circumstances were. I was born in the Soviet Union, one of the worst places in the world to be born. And I got lucky enough to get out and come to America where entrepreneurship was championed instead of demonized. I was also born to the single greatest mother that the world has ever produced. And the way that she played me, I got the luck of the DNA, but then she also molded me. I have guilt and gratitude of how it worked out for me. And now I'm incredibly passionate to use those gifts that I was given in the way that I communicate and the timing in the world that I live in where I can reach everyone to try to do for all of you what my mom did for me. Yeah, that's so where am I going? I'm going to be in the same place for the rest of my life. I promise you I'm going to build businesses. I'm going to spend time with my family and I'm going to continue to put out information that I think could help people with no expectation in return. I am comfortable to sell things when I'm excited to sell them, but I don't see much changing for me because this is who I've always been long before any of you knew who I was amazing. Amazing. One last advice. Yes. Last question. Yeah. My name is Veronica. Hi, Veronica. I'm a holistic therapist. Yes, ma'am. A holistic consultant. Amazing. We are facing a shift of paradigm. Yes. An epidemic is ending and a new epidemic is coming. In previous times the calls were left in stone. Now the calls are left in digital. So every content we are doing is plasming the huge metrics and the internet. Not the internet. The blockchain. What you're talking about, this is why I'm obsessed with the blockchain. The blockchain, the internet is owned by corporations and countries. The blockchain is owned by no one. The real artifacts of our society will live on the blockchain, not the internet. What's your position about this new human, the new consciousness and the new white fight that is arising? The Maya's called the sixth race. I'm a very big buyer of what you're talking about. And you probably know that because you could probably see what I'm talking about. No. You know, I'm talking about right now. I watched you watch me. So I knew. Yeah, look, I think we have spent the last hundred years overly logical. The last hundred years we have put the brain on the pedestal. The next hundred years we will put the gut on the pedestal. I literally look, you see, I wish you could see my goosebumps. My friends, the last hundred years, more, the last three, four hundred years, we have put the brain on the pedestal. The next pedestal will be your intuition, will be your gut health. It will change the world in a very positive way. The faster, the better, in my opinion. I'm so thankful for your question because I get to say this as I'm leaving. The number one mistake you can make is to not listen to your intuition. The number one. I will tell you why. If you go with your intuition, you will be stunned how much better it is than your brain. But more importantly, when your intuition doesn't work out, because there's a lot of variables in life, you might have made the right decision, but something weird happened. You'll still feel good. Most of you are anxious and not light because you're fighting your intuition. The result won't matter. The process of following it will. I hope you hear that. Love you. Thank you very much. Thank you for being with us. Thank you for being here in Mexico City. Thank you for watching.
