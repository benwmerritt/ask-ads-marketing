Hey man, how are ya? Good, how you doing? Good. Wow, if Neelum's your spirit animal, then you're a... She's a beast though. She's a beast. She's a beast. How you doing? Good. How's work? Great. Good, tell me. People all work with a bust. Very, very happy with who I ended up with. Yeah, you ended up with an A team. Yeah. That's the truth. How you work with it is unbelievable. Yeah. First job at college was sweet. Yeah. Okay, I got lucky. You worked out. Yeah. And so, what are you working on right now? We just finished up, so I'm doing always on content. Yep. So we're in a transition and it's never doing more campaign work, so I'm doing less... On what brands? On... I'm also on... Yep. Those I just do community management. Yep. But I'm doing what they let me do. That's the best part about them is, since they're so solid, they let me do up things. Yep. And across the board, all of them, like they're outperforming higher, so they let the person under them... 100%. That's part about it, and that's why I think it's good for me, because I'm getting to do a shit ton of shit. Yeah, it's like, you know how we know each other. It's like a sports analogy. You get driven by a great team. Yeah, it's a bit. Yeah, it's a bit. I got lucky. It's good? It's good to get lucky sometimes. And what about the macro culture of the company outside of your day to day? Yeah, it's good. I mean, I don't really have much to compare to. Yeah. Because it's my first job. That's a good point. Talking to other people. Yeah. I mean, just humans. I've talked to humans before. Yeah, I have experience with humans. No, it's yeah. And I mean, yeah, it's great. And I would say, like, moving, like coming into this, it has exceeded my expectations. But again, I have a little ability to compare it to. But I mean, yeah, I would hang out with most of these people outside of the office. Yeah, and the basketball stuff has been great. Huge. Yeah. It's been great. I mean, outside of work, it's just good to run. And everyone there is awesome. I mean, the fact that it's 6 in the morning, kind of like. Eliminates. Yeah, it really does, though. People that want to be there, for sure. What can I answer for you? Question, building communities. Advice between. What is that, D-rock? Go ahead, I'm listening. Content, outside of blogs, SEO versus just social. For the purpose of? A startup that is just trying to gain a following. Cool, so is this like for like, your side house girlfriend, your friends? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys, what do you, you can be specific, I mean. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, I'm working with like, I just got to see about like Brandon, Guy Enos, John Henry. Yep. What is it? His personal brand. Who's, Brandon? Yeah. The kid we played with him? Yeah. What's he do? He does menswear. It's awesome. You're gonna get more bang for your buck. I mean, you're gonna get, there's so much. So, what's good about search and blogs is there's like, far more guaranteed singles and doubles. What's great about social is there's so many more potential for home runs and grand slams. And so it just depends on how you wanna play it. It comes down to economics a lot of times. Right, I think that's what you mean. And menswear is gonna over index visually. So that's where Facebook and Instagram, things of that nature. You're sure? They're good. If you really wanna build a deeper community, wouldn't you agree that you would have to give like real content? So is that why SEO and Google people were searching for the problems? Yeah, I mean, look, search is real. Like it's- You're getting the real thing, you wanna talk to me. Real people meaning? Or the specific people that are searching for their problem and then you can probably solution it. Yeah, I mean, search is the great intent marketing vehicle of our time. I have a weird rash. Right. You know, how to solve this bike problem. So what search is incredible for is I have a specific thing I wanna scratch right now. And I'm gonna go to this site, Google, and I'm gonna find something. What's great about social is you're interested in basketball and it comes to you. It's passive versus going on the offense. And what's great about social is it's got built-in word of mouth. So you are an individual trying to solve your fashion problem in a menswear thing. You're never gonna tell anybody about what you're doing. There's no inherent word of mouth brand building. Whereas in social, if you discover that I'm interested in that, I see it, the amplification percentages are very high. Even built-in, Instagram, you double tap something. Your friends look at what you're liking. So it's just a very, very, very, very different insular versus outward thing. For me, that's why social has been so big for small brands. They don't have anything yet. And so they rely so much on word of mouth. What about getting a community, like first of all, your community strong down to comment, down to do whatever. Yes. It's like you said. Yes. But I think that's because you get a deeper content. Yeah, I mean, I think the variable of the subject matter, what the person's bringing to the table, if this is a menswear product that has 89% of its overall macro energy in Brandon's heart and brain, is to sell this product. If that's 89%, he's gonna have an 11% community. The reason I have such a big community is on the reverse. That's what people don't understand. Like, it's playing a marathon versus a sprint. When you don't have the luxury, like Brandon probably doesn't, of like waiting two years to monetize whatever he's doing, you go in for the sale. And what happens when you go in for the sale is the people on the other side of it feel it. It's a value exchange game. Mines are accepted. That's exactly right. And I sit here on a pedestal because I've been able to put in the work for 20 years and I have the leverage now to do that, but day one, it's hard. You know, day one, 22 year old Gary trying to sell wine. I don't know if I would have had a 97% youth, 3% me strategy. As a matter of fact, I know I didn't. It was more 50-50, but I even then knew it wasn't 98-2 and that's what most people do. Why are you producing content? Because you really wanna sell your shit. If you wanna sell your shit in the short term, your content and your energy deploys that behavior. If you think about, I'm gonna try to stay alive for two years and the content I'm gonna put out is just gonna build relationship and then I'll be able to monetize that some way in two years, your content looks very different. All of a sudden you're in there answering people's fashion questions. You're just thinking about it differently. See where I'm going? Yeah, definitely. It's my big question. 22 year old, advice. New York, in the digital game. What about that? I mean, it comes down to your ambition. I think the answer is far more like what do you want to happen in life? And then how do you wanna get there? So, the serendipity of being at this, I mean, if you're in the digital game, you stepped into shit because you stepped into the best place at a time when a lot of people didn't realize that that was the case, which means you have disproportionate value. Everybody's gonna wanna work here now, but they're gonna come in at a different company. You have a lot of value and you came in as employee number five, for who the hell knows what number you came in, right? Well, guess what? The people that came in at number 30 and 40 have been more value, right? So, I think it comes down to like, do you wanna have your own agency? Do you wanna have, you know, like, it's amazing. And I'll give you a really good piece of advice. It's been interesting to watch 22 year olds that have asked me that question, who tell me they wanna have their own shop, and I would say, I'll help you. You'll learn so much here. I'll be an external mentor. We'll get to know each other. You work here for five to seven years and give me a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. I'll even help you even more financially, relationships. It's been interesting to see how many of those 22 year olds are now 26 and now say to me, I don't want my own shop. I fell in love, I like my work-life balance here, I believe in you. I like the idea of making $200,000 a year and having that life. Other people want the other way. Like, I don't know, I'm gonna work at Vayner my whole life and make 100,000 and now they're like, wait a minute, maybe I can have my own. So, I think the one thing to understand is 22 year old Jacob and 27 year old Jacob and 33 year old Jacob are very different dudes. I wouldn't cripple yourself with, you know, don't let your ambition create, and whatever ambition, whether the most extreme, I wanna buy the Jets or whatever it may be, don't let it be in permanent marker. That's pretty good advice. And I think the other thing is relationships matter. That's life. And so, the thing we started this meeting with, I would highly recommend spending 30 minutes in the cafeteria every day and working and saying hello. Sure. It's just insane that Chris right there is the guy that might create an opportunity for you and how many people will not even say hello. So, I'd be more social professional. In any sense. Yeah, there's so much value here. I mean, the one, the greatest thing I've created here is that it's easy to say hello to somebody here. That's what your friends are telling you. That they work in a place where you can't fucking say hello to anybody. That's not allowed. That's the whole shit out there. That's the best thing here. So then do it. It's really real. And it creates a different opportunity. Even if your life goal was to work here for 37 years, even internally, it'll create opportunities. Sure. Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. He got a new job now, but he's trying to, he's looking for other stuff. Like in the digital sports, whatever. And he advised for a direction he should go. Again, you know, whether it's 22 years, it comes down to like, how does he want to work for 13 more years? Eight, three, where is he financially? Like, it's so hard. It's why you have to know those things. But I would give my, you know, listen, I've come to really like you. If you, if you come and jam with me for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, I'd be willing to do that. I have a lot of relationships, you know? I'd be more than happy to help him. But I need to know what the fuck he cares about. Like if he's like, dude, I just want to go for three more and go. No, no, he's interested. Cool. Good. So if he's in the game, then I think, then I think it comes down to a financial thing of what can he afford? Does he want to be executive? So Kidber recruiting right now, his dad took a huge pay cut as an operations SVP, took be the first SVP operations at SV. He was right. And so he left, you know, half his salary on the table because he could afford to. And that stock turned into the greatest nest egg of all time, became rich, let alone successful. So I think he needs to go through that too. I had a fucking, he needs to decide if he's going to go for eight to 15 more, can he afford to make 80,000 at Bleacher Report versus 235 at NBC Sports? Got it? That's how he has to think about it. That's the black and white decision. And then if he can afford it, then I would push him very heavy to more fun, more autonomy, more upside, better energy. And if he can't, then you gotta look at the alternative and try to find the best version of that in that corporate environment. It's awesome. Yep. It's a big tool. Cool. Good to see you again. Talk to you soon. Yeah, good to go. You too.
