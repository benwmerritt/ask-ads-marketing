## Transcript
What is your advice for like absolutely zero to roof over your head? The quickest way to go from $20 to 10,000. I genuinely is genuinely people of the universe. I bring to you Gary Vee. What's up universe? Yeah, dude, I decided to go woke. Are you low? No, not not even, but, uh, but ladies and gentlemen, it occurred to me, you know, leave some people out. And while I don't want to be woke, I do want to include absolutely everybody. I love that. So, so that's why you're doubling down on universe. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody in the universe. Yeah. All shapes and sizes. Yeah. All you little pussies like, uh, all just devos woke like suck a fart out of my butthole and chill out like, uh, we're light, we're easy. We're having a good time. And this is Gary Vee. Good to meet you. Pleasure, brother. Real pleasure to meet you. Honestly, you're a real legend. Thank you for having me. You guys are about the same age. Yeah. How old are you? 49. Yeah. I just turned 48. 48. 46. Jesus. 40. 40. Sorry. It's a lot of gray. You look. If I now that I've done now that you react that way and I'm looking closer to skin, I might have went 38. But if the gray was black, you're 30. That's it. That's it. That's a. Yeah. I know I'm gray. Yeah. Of course, it's just harder to hear that. I met up with Simon Eddie at the wedding and he's like, are you 50 now? I'm like, I'm fucking 50 now. It's normal human behavior. The gray over indexes it. And but the cool part is you're fully in control. Like you mean I have my hair. Well, yes, which is amazing. I think what I'm saying is you're in control. It's not too late to lose some weight to move your body. Yeah. Not too late to put down the pasta. I know. I bet you equally get good compliments on the silver fox thing. Yeah. Well, so you're just what I'm saying is the choice of going bald or gray. I'd rather go gray. A thousand percent for sure. 100 percent. Yeah. The question is, do you want to color it green? No. Black. No. And then you're fine. I enjoy it. I enjoy going gray. Silver fox. But you're going to get some forty fours instead of thirty eights. First, you're sometimes even 50. Yes, sometimes whoever that which is crazy, because the face is too babyed. But that's nothing. Forty four and thirty eights. Same shit. Yeah, I'm at the age where like people are starting to like misguess my age. And I'm like, oh, fuck, it's happening. I'm getting older. Well, the worst part was when you in a world going through is just so young sure like that flip where like, you know, like I mean, a lot of my friends were baby faced. So when we're at twenty six, you'd go to Vegas and you get card. You'd be like, yeah, you still got it. All of a sudden you're like thirty four and you're like, you're forty. Like, well, what just happened? Why did I just age 20 years in a seven year window? Yeah. Age is undefeated, fellas. That's correct, man. Yeah. And I could stand to put down some food and move my body around a little bit too. I'm. Oh, I got it. I think at forty it becomes more of a health issue than like a vanity issue. Yeah. Because you know, I was at Dr. Drew's house today. I love Dr. Drew and I think we should get him back on. But that's another conversation for another time. And with Gary V. That not candidly. Yes, Gary. Yes, you're you're so. Specialized. Yes. And in business, being an entrepreneur, financial success. And we've always enjoyed speaking with our guests about like what what their various revenue streams, you know, like I love to share a guest's top three revenue streams without being invasive about numbers. Yeah. But I. But you want me to answer it or? Yeah. So I think I think I operate and invest. And so what I mean by that is I actively am always running a company from, you know, from my childhood, from being twenty two to thirty four. I did that for my dad's liquor store. Those were not super successful financial years because I was building the company for him and we were an immigrant family and you don't get paid a lot. But it was epic and one of my great accomplishments. So when I say I operate and I invest right now, I'm the CEO of a company called VaynerX. Vayner Media is the big company in that. I love this. Yeah. A modern day communications company. So basically Mad Men twenty twenty three. My company does the marketing for companies like Pepsi and Chase and all these fanatic and all these big brands and we do different shit. Some people we do all the social media content. Some people we do the Super Bowl commercial. We killed Mr. Pina. Oh, wow. We were the agency that worked on planters when we killed Mr. Pina during the Super Bowl. It's an ad agency, but it's twenty twenty four version. Almost every client we work with were like, do you understand how important it is to do social media? Right. You know, that kind of stuff. I mean, look, this is actually very meta liquid death. Yeah. Started by Mike. The job he had while he was building liquid death. Was that VaynerMedia in LA? Wow. Sent me emails like I'm ready to do my own thing. Do you want to invest? I'm like, yeah, I wanted to support him. Well, he's a good dude. I was like, here's a couple of bucks. I'm going to make a fucking fortune on it because he's a beast and he built liquid death. He, Mike Cicero is a very, very impressive guy. The CEO of Liquid Death. That's right. And literally the job. The second before he was the CEO of Liquid Death. He was a creative director at VaynerMedia. No kidding. Yeah. He is absolutely a creative director. Well, have you heard of hot sauce for your butthole? Do you want this to explode and you want me to? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing no bullshit. It would be great enjoyment, whether right after this podcast, if we got a couple of minutes or let's get on Zoom, the joy I would have to tell you to do six or seven different things to quadruple the fuck out of this business. Yeah. Would be a great pleasure of mine. You don't have to say that twice. Yeah. Happy to do it. Well, there you go. Anyway, I don't want to be wrong-winded. I'm always driving something VaynerMedia. The other thing I do is V Friends, which is like my Pokemon meets Marvel meets Sesame Street and intellectual property, NFTs, trading cards, apparel, coming out with animation. Here you can see it. So V Friends is really exciting for me. You guys are quite creative. So you can imagine how exciting this is for me, like literally as a baseball card, collectible comic book kid. I can't believe I actually have like I can go on eBay right now and go to completed. Actually, you guys are doing this here. If you go on eBay and go to completed items, like it's crazy to me. If you type in V Friends. Now, I saw you make a post about your V Friends and you said that you were going to make it as big as Pokemon. That's right. And that might let me let me clear. Like, and even sometimes I need to do a better job for sure for next 50 years. I'd like to make it as you keep showing your good whoever this is. Be there it is completed and sold. Hit them both. There you go. Look, this is like I just got to say as someone who like has been on eBay since 1998 and just loves garage selling and finding shit and buying shit and pop cultures, why fuck with you? Heavy like looking at this like blows my fucking. Drew these things three years ago and now it's like a full pledge real thing. OK, we're looking at trading cards at the moment. Trading cards and sold on eBay. Yes. And which is distinctly different from NFTs. You know what's funny? I I think wildly not different, but I get where you're going. I understand. Fundrable and non-fungible. Very smart. Well, NFTs strictly digital, correct? Correct. Yeah. OK. I was telling my dad. Yes. The like my philosophy or my understanding of NFTs. That it's like here. Like anybody that wants to bring it up on the Internet, technically can have it. But the person who buys the NFT actually owns it. That's right. I said, dad, this is like telling a woman, you know, yeah, like any woman in the world can have my wiener, but. Wiener is actually yours. OK. That makes so much more sense. That was how you got your dad to understand. I think. Well, yeah, just like that's what my way of saying anybody can have it. But like one person's supposed to like have ownership of it. Yeah. It sounds like. Anyway, these are the two companies I run. I also do, you know, so let's talk about it every year is different because I do a lot of investing. So obviously one day liquid death will sell to Pepsi or Coke. Yeah. And I'll get a check for that investment. Have seen. Do you think that's going to happen? Are you an investor? Yeah. Nice. I don't know. I'm sure at this point, anybody with, you know, between that and prime energy drink, there's some big beverages running around there that are independent that I'm sure the Cokes and the Pepsi's and the biggest companies are looking at. I think next two, three year you'll see more and more M&A activity. But the place I make my most dollars is being the CEO of VaynerMedia. It's a 2000 person, three hundred million dollar plus business. I'm the founder, operator. So that's that world. That's Invader X. This I mean, speaking is big for me, Steve. Oh, OK, good. Yeah, I'm a I'm a I'm a pretty substantial public speaker and like my fee is pretty bananas and when I we're getting close enough to the end of year, that may be the second biggest place of my revenue. So you book your your speaking engagements, which would be considered a personal appearance. That's right. What's your agent? So I was with CA for a long time and then five years ago, I started my own speaking bureau Vayner speakers. Oh, so if you're looking to make, you know, I can make you some money on the sauce. I can make you some money on the speaking. There you go. Yeah, you have a story to tell. This is turning out to be a really good. No, you know, I'm fascinated with your. You said you have a very big speaking fee. Yes. But that wasn't always the case. Does that come with a self worth thing or like? No, supply and demand of of of. It's a great question. Do I think people, whether they're doing stand up comedy, whether they're doing anything, you know, cutting hair, you can cut it for 12 bucks, you can cut it for 50. Like, sure, there's that game of, do you know what you're asking for? But the market is the market. Like when I first started 34 years old, really speaking, well, I had pretty good confidence. I'm like, I really think I'm good. But the market had and said that I was worth what I'm worth now. OK, so I think it's just applying to me on, you know, speaking is funny and personal appearance is funny for the human. And you've been through this and for people who go through it or think about it. It seems crazy that you could be compensated so well for a short period of time. But in reality, there's something happening on the back end. So I could be like, oh, my God, I'm getting fucking flown to Madrid and I'm going to speak for an hour and I can't believe the economics I'm making. It's not like the world is puffy, ideological. Yeah, the organizers of that event in Spain are making money on the fact that I'm there. Sure. You know, and so it's it's very much supply and demand. Self worth is a good question. Do I believe a lot of people listening right now, mowing lungs, cutting hair, public speaking, super famous, not known at all, doing a service business? Do I think most people don't know how to ask for a little more money the next time to keep upping their feet? Yes, I do. Yeah, I'm glad you asked that question. When I do a podcast like this, I'm like, OK, this is fucking an epic show with icons. I'm going to come on. We're going to talk about our subject matter. But like if I can leave in like three to seven people, here, one little tidbit and all whatever the fuck we chop up at. And it becomes a good thing for them. Like the thought that somebody right now actually that does something is like, yeah, fuck and like they charge a hundred bucks for whatever the fuck we're talking about, right, babysitting 12 bucks an hour. Yeah. And tomorrow, the neighbor goes, how much are you? And you're like $15 an hour because you listen to this and they say yes. Then we had a good fucking podcast. That's great. People will say yes. You know, I know. And by the way, people say no and don't change your price back to $12 an hour. Get ten noes. And then you're like, OK, I'm delusional. My big thing is get ten noes before you go back down. Too many people like are scared to go up. Try one time. Someone says no. And I see fucking Gary. I was always 12. Yeah. You give me pay for. Yeah. I'm glad that you said that, too, because when I initially was saying, you know, what I started to say, I was going to express a sensitivity that I speak into my audience, you know, about like, like, I wanted to make it relatable to people and you just did that for me. Well, honestly, no bullshit. Like I've got lots of passions, but and lots of things I want to talk about. But, you know, I'm very selective of what I do. And when I do it, I always think it's only about them. Like, I don't need people skipping this podcast for you. I don't want to fuck you up. I don't want people to be like, that's suck. That's not for me. If you can't make it contextual and relatable to who's actually going to listen, then what the fuck are we doing here? Right. Like I'm more than capable of trying to build my own audience of my channels. I think when you go into someone's home, you take off the shoes. You know what I mean? Like, to me, the only thing I'm thinking about right now is how to respect y'all and more importantly, even more than you is your audience. And so like, look, take me wherever you think I can bring value. But the good news is like, I'm aware of y'all and I'm a fan and like I like. And more importantly, like cool, I'm a businessman, but like, like I'm also a human being. Like, what do you think me and my buddies did in Jersey in the 80s and 90s? Dumb shit. And like, you guys are legends to us. They're like, oh, fuck, all the dumb shit we were doing is like, real like that. So like, this is fun to be with you. Cool. I love it. Thank you for that. What's the probably very blurry line? Like what VaynerMedia? Yes. An ad agency and a production company. Yes. So we have a production company. You can pull this one up. Eva Nosa Dom. Eva Nosa Dom. How do you remember all these names? It's two separate words. No problem. Eva space and Nosa Dam. Nosa Dam, Eva space. Here we go. There we go. It's there. So this is Madison Ave. Spelt backwards. Oh, this is our production company for our commercials in New York, in New York and LA. And I own this as well. This is part of Vayner X VaynerMedia is the agency. Eva Nosa Dom is the production company. Now, to your point, the world you grew up in production was heavy, like big shit. It was real. And so our commercials are Super Bowl. We do here. Our agency as the creative department, they're also producing actual social media ads. So that's the twist that we did to the industry forever, 70 years. You had an ad agency that came up with the ideas and then that's what you got paid for. And then there was a production company that would make this merch madness by Lil Baby B that we did for Fanatics. We still do that, as you can see here with Eva Nosa Dom and VaynerMedia. But inside of VaynerMedia, the ad firm, everybody in creative also makes social media creative. And that was the twist. And that's how we change the industry is one of your contemporaries or your rivals at VaynerMedia, a company called Shareability. Are you familiar with them? Yes, I think that got brought up to me the other day. Um, maybe one thing I don't do. It's either my strength or my weakness. I'm almost oblivious to competition. Blue Ocean strategy. Yeah, I've heard that as well. What is that? It's just like there's no competition. There's no red in the water. By the way, I love competition. Like, if you guys were like, let's thumb wrestle, I'd get like super serious right now. Yeah. Yeah. But you're the mindset. There's like enough for everybody. Yeah. And by the way, if somebody's like win something, you're absolutely. I don't think that they took it out of me. I by the way, that includes like we're in a pitch right now. For we're not, but I'm going to use it because I love them. If we're in a pitch for New Balance and we're against Droga five and Shareability and Wyden and Kennedy and we're it's four of us and we lose. I'm aware that one of those three people won. But that's the micro in the macro. I'm going to get mine for sure. We're good enough. And honestly, weirdly, I even like one other people. First of all, I kind of weirdly like losing. Like, I'm like, you know, there's a level of like leaning into your own humility and like you should never always win and the merit and trying to figure out how to get better at it. But yeah, Blue Ocean, for me, it's always abundance for sure. It's like nobody's stopping me, but myself. If I spend a minute trying to figure out what everybody else is doing, that's a minute or not figuring out the consumers. And I don't have time for that nonsense. Um, OK, so let's take some. That being said, in your world, Vayner Wat Vayner, V A Y N E R W A T T dot com. This one I'm excited about. This is a new company for me about a year old now. And this is maybe some way we jam together in the future. So we started a production company. Good. And so this is a production company, not for commercialists. That's right. Scripted, non scripted. The guy that left there, Eric Wattenberg, it was at C.A. for 20 years, then he did wheelhouse for the last five or six years. And we've teamed up. But we're just now pitching our shows. That's pretty fun. I like it. For somebody who doesn't know what they want to do, who isn't even necessarily employed. Yes. You know, having financial difficulty. Yes. Like what is your take on that? Well, what is your advice for like absolutely zero to roof over your head? It's the reason I started making. Garage sale videos. So you can pull up trash talk, Gary V. I'm just you could see I'm getting addicted with this. Yeah, I might need to live like this. So this this lady was amazing. Anyway, I this is my advice. So I started getting those emails and I was like, you know what? So for the people listening, I have a good back to a different audience across the room. I know a good amount may not know who I am. I grew up. I was born in the Soviet Union. I was born in the USSR. Belarus. Thank you, my man. So I came here when I was three. We lived in a studio apartment in the size of this fucking van with like five, six family members, like real humble beginnings. And so, you know, I didn't grow up with much. And, you know, in my teenage years, I started going to garage sales and then go into the flea market and flipping shit. I was always into like collectibles. That's why the V Friends thing is fun and all that. And then when my brother is 11 years younger than me, when my brother was like 13, I could tell my mom was trying to make him a lawyer. I'm like, no, no, no, like, AJ, come with me. We're going to go garage sailing. And now this new thing, eBay, I'm going to we're going to sell it on this thing. And so. How old were you? I was twenty two at that time or twenty three at that time when I was teaching my brother. That's when eBay had just come out a few years earlier. And I watched my brother go from zero to like ten thousand dollars in cash in a summer because we would buy video games for 50 cents and sell them for twenty bucks on eBay or a shirt or anything. Nostalgic pop culture, things like that. So my advice is, first of all, I'm going to go macro and micro in the micro right now in America and obviously it's in some other parts of the world. But garage sailing is bigger here in America. The quickest way to go from twenty dollars to your name to ten thousand, which creates some sort of breathing room of some sorts. I genuinely is thrift stores and garage sales. Genuinely because because it's a place where you can buy things for a quarter, 50 cents and a dollar and get twenty. You can't do that in many other places. Yeah, but I feel like like the garage for sure. You're right. OK. But if you're starting out on a thrift store on Melrose, no fucking way. That's that's bougie thrift store. Yeah, I'm talking Goodwill. Like you can go to the Goodwill. It's very interesting. It's very interesting all over the country. Yeah, I bought some cool Stetson shit in Oklahoma at the thrift store. Like and these are like brick and mortar places where you can go and purchase something for like 50 cents a dollar. But then you take it online and you've got such an infinitely larger audience. Yeah. And it's not even your audience for it was listening. Say, fuck, I don't have an audience. No, no, you just listed on eBay. You just lift it on post. Poshmark. You just listed on these places. Macquarie, there's all these places now. So a zero zero. The most logical place I see is garage sales. So it's the tails all this time is like get a product and sell it. That's the one. Like I think about this a lot because somewhere along the line, I kept telling the stories about like early in my career, after which was 10, 15 years in my career, after I saved some money, I made these good investments in 2006. They were called Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. And of course, it changed my life. And I would talk a lot about it, talking. But then I just started getting enough emails saying like, yo, bro, I fuck with you, Gary, I love you. But like I don't have twenty five thousand dollars to put in some sort of startup. So what do I do? And finally, after because I read all my DMS and email, especially back in those seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, I was really doing it because I could manage it. I was like, fuck, they're right. I got to talk about some other shit. Yeah. And that's how I got to this. And so to answer the question in the micro, I believe the answer genuinely is garage sale flipping. Are you still doing garage sale until this day? Yeah, that's me like a couple of weeks ago. Now, at this point, I'm donating what I buy and what I sell for the charity because I'm in this place of my life. But no bullshit, bro. Like, honestly, I like doing that shit more than almost anything I do in life. Here. OK, so so this is great. And in the problem with most people is they're not motivated. Yeah, that's right. And like I I had a product in 2006, I was selling a retail, I invented this thing and I sold it. And it I mean, don't do that. Tom, what it is. So I invented a workout towel, a workout towel, the Velcro pocket so you can keep all your shit in there while you go to the gym. Talsafe. Talsafe. I like that. So I don't it's not even around anymore. But people I mean, it's it's it's a standard. I totally understand that was the suit. By the way, that was the easiest thing to understand of all time. That was smart. Yeah, you fixed you fixed the micro pain. You found a problem. Yeah, I would like that's smart. But my my theory was people are like, how did you do it? It's like, I think any product is a good product. It just depends on how passionate that person is. Because how do you execute? And how? Yeah, of course, that. But how much drugs you're doing. And how drugs are going to. Always a correlation. But but the hardest part for me is like. So back in 2006, I stopped listening to music when I was driving. I listened to motivational books to keep myself that hungry. Happy now. Now you're now you're talking about why Gary V exists. Right. Like so I was going to answer in the macro and I love you for going to where this is all about people being comfortable in their own skin, not everybody to your point. Let me tell you something about me. I'm motivated when we're talking about business. I'm motivated when we're talking about kindness or like people skills. I'm not motivated when you're talking about filling out a form. For sure. Like I'm. No, I'm going to say this nice and slow. I am borderline incapable of administrative duties of administrative duties. Yeah, yeah. I'm with you. For sure. Because we're creative. Yeah. Look, for everybody who's listening. What if you do not understand yourself and you're listening to fuckers like me or your mom or your dad or your buddy and they're like, just you can't do that. That's like telling me like, just shut the fuck up. I can't. I need to talk like we have to reverse engineer truth. So to your point, when I put out all these videos, the comments are like, yeah, but the gas costs 20 bucks. I'm like, but I made $800. They're like, yeah, but the eBay fees. I'm like, yeah, but I made $800. But those are just the weakest people that aren't survival of the fittest. Like it's not you don't have that drive to do that, then. What's interesting about that. And I see where you're going is I'm fascinated by what the Internet does to change the variable of how many don't have to be the weakest. The option. I'll give you a good example of this in culture right now. Everyone wants a shit on Gen Z. Entitled, lazy, this, that and like there's plenty of that. Look, when the government prints unlimited amounts of money during covid and gives it to people for staying home, it fucks up people. Yeah, like it confuses people about merit. That being said, when I hear like some entrepreneurs tell me like Gary, this fucking Gen Z, I'm like, bro, you're asking them to work for $13 an hour for 10 hours a day in your fucking store. I got news for you. A lot of these kids know how to make $230 a day in TikTok ads. Like they could sell some tea. Like these kids have options. Like, like, sorry, they don't want to work at Kmart for eight bucks an hour for 53 hours a week. Like I don't blame them if they know how to make it a different way they're going to. Yeah. And so what is that? What was all that about? That was about there's a lot of options that I think there's a lot of people right now who are listening to us with a blunt in hand and chilling and saying like, yeah, I'm just not. I'm just chill. I'm just chill. My argument is, yeah, but there's some shit you give a fuck about something. Music, something. Yeah. And by the way, this is so fucking meta. You and your crew, that wasn't monetizable 20 years earlier. It's true. It's very true. You guys became famous and rich doing shit that you couldn't become famous and rich for 20 years earlier than when you did it. And they had to get somebody to say, yes, the Internet is like, yo, I'm here. I'm open for business. What do you want? Now, the problem is the Internet is also fair, meaning when people are like, Gary, I'm fucking shadow banned on social media. I'm not doing well. I'm like, bro, you're not shadow banned. You just suck. Like everyone's always got an excuse like, yo fucking. But do you think shadow ban is a real thing? No. So you think shadow ban doesn't exist? It's real for one percent of one percent. It's not real for the guy who's been posting the same shit for 20 weeks and nobody gives a fuck. And he's like, I'm shadow banned. Like you're not shadow banned. Nobody thinks you're funny. Yeah. And so. And, bro, on some real shit, I love when my content doesn't do well. When I post something in underperforms, literally, I'm like, yep, fuck you, Gary, you thought it was good. They didn't learn. Next. Yeah. And so the Internet isn't necessarily fair. It's just highly democratic. Yes. And the blockchains even more. You know, the Internet's got its variables. Things work differently. But here's the punchline. Most things are more fair than people want to think. People want to blame a president. People want to blame their parents. People want to people want to blame blame. But we've gotten remarkable at pointing fingers. Nobody wants to do this shit for sure. People have like almost cut their fucking thumbs off. Like people don't want to do this shit, Steve. Like, guys, like and to me, I'm not trying to be like motivational or rough. It's just very, very obvious to me. There's a direct correlation of happiness and accountability. I love that. Yeah. That's that I love that. I've loved a lot of things that you said. That's my favorite thing. So thank you, my man. Well, that's the change in my life was when I went through the step work and you're like, what's my partner? Yeah. And then you start getting into the habit of like looking at every problem in your life and being like, oh, I let me be vulnerable here a little bit. I've done well, but like, you know, five or six years ago, I was like, hey, this is me talking to myself. Hey, if you're such a nice dude and like you don't care about the money and you really give a fuck about your employees. Hey, dude, why then are there people that used to work for you that don't like you? You see that little Facebook group where they shit on you for employees. You've seen some of these things that they said you've gotten emails from people that have the courage to tell you to your face. Why? So I did the work, you know, because it bothered me. I'm like, man, I really want to be nice. I really think I'm nice. Like, what am I doing wrong? And finally enough things happen both personally and professionally. I'm like, oh, Gary Vee in a podcast with you all. He's Candris because he's not actually talking to anyone. He's talking to everyone. But if I cared about you, I struggled to deliver candor, believe it or not. Gary Vaynerchuk, the business man my whole life. I would have very sloppy firings because I couldn't because I become friends with my employees, right? And then when you had to get like if something wasn't working for a long time, it would be like all fucked up and I didn't tell them along the way. Like maybe occasionally I'd say something. But now the last five, six years, there's like a real process to how I do it. Like if six months in, it's not working. I have the strength now to sit down in front of somebody I like and say, hey, Johnny, hey, Susan, like, it's not working. Let me tell you what you're doing wrong because there was still time to fix it. Right. I wasn't over the bubble of resentment. But, you know, and so like I get like being accountable. I sit here and out loud say to all the people that have ever worked for me or interacted me where I had to fire them where they're like, what the fuck, dude? Last week, you were saying everything was great. And I'm like, you're right. Like I wasn't strong enough yet one on one to be able to talk about it because I thought I was scaring you. I thought I hate fear. Are your people pleaser? Yes, but not that bad. It's more than I hate fear. And I thought if I sat someone down and said, hey, shit's not going well, that they'd be scared. They go home that night and drink and cry and go on LinkedIn and try to find a new job. And it wasn't about that yet. I was trying to find different ways to help them. But the lack of candor created a vulnerability. And then ultimately, especially if I had to let them go. And I wasn't able to figure out a different way without ever telling them, which I did a lot, but a lot. I did. It became sloppy and I regret it and I and I own it and sucks. But I try to be better now. How many people you think you fired? Thousands. I mean, I've employed, you know, lots and lots of people, like, you know, probably 10,000 people have been employed at Vayner through the years. The wine store probably had hundreds and hundreds. It's definitely thousands. You know, and and I directly had to do hundreds. Not thousands, but but at the end of the day, I always say to my people, this is just true. Everything at VaynerMedia, my companies is my fault. And by the way, at VaynerMedia, everybody who gets fired, I have to sign off on just to make sure my managers are not fucking shit up. So at the end of the day, it's still my decision. The I heard a guy say that, like he was a CEO that fired a lot of people. And he said, you know, the one pattern that I found out that was consistent was as soon as you get that thought of like, oh, this person's got to go. He's like there he's like and you you won't fire them because you feel bad or whatever, you give him a chance. He's like within three months, they should. He's like, that's the point where they should have been gone already. Yeah, there's a lot of truth to that. I think what we've gotten better at in our company. I've been surprised how many people have been refurbished. We call it kind candor. If you're able to with compassion, tell not, hey, Johnny, you suck. You better get your act together. Well, you better get your shit together. See you next week. You know, like, no, if you're like, hey, style, there's a great boxing term styles make fights. Yeah. What it really means for everybody who's listening is you can have the two best boxers in the world fight each other. But because stylistically, the way they were, all of us as fans could be bored for 12 rounds. You see in UFC as well, styles, styles make fights. I use that a lot with people. I'm like, hey, styles make fights just because it's not working from the subjective opinion of me and four or five of your bosses. It doesn't mean we're right. Doesn't mean we're wrong. It's six people that think you're fucking up. Yeah. But that doesn't mean you suck. Like, it just means maybe you're not doing the right thing here. Yeah. Now, what I've been surprised about is some people are like, whoa, I might get like, actually, it changes them. It changes them. But other people, we've changed. We've changed positions within the company. Other people are like, you know what? It's actually beautiful when you can do kind. Canter had a dude recently say, you know, Gary, I've been wanting to write like I need to write. I need to write. And like this, you know, obviously, I pay my bills with all this, but like this is a sign I needed. Like, I know I'm not showing up proper this year because I've been distracted because I'm writing because it's work from home and I'm probably not working most of the time. Right. And he was just honest about it. I was like, cool, bro, like love, like it's not so back to Blue Ocean. I don't view my employees as my property, as my competitors. Like, it's bad. I view them as family. And sometimes you have fucking shit that's not working out and it's OK. Yeah. What about hiring family members? I believe in it. You believe you ever had a fire family member? Um, not really, but I've had to have like conversation. Like, to me, the reason I like hiring family members is first of all, my dad has fired both me and my sister. So big shout out to Sasha Vaynerchuk, who has no problem firing family members. I got fired for one day. My sister permanently. Sorry, Liz. I think that to me, I like I think people tell, you know, that old saying, right? Don't hire family or friends. Yeah. I think it's a mistake. I think it works a lot. I think now I would say 48 year old Gary is far more should hire family and friends now than 25 year old Gary, because the lack of candor led to resentment and awkwardness. So I think it comes down to do you believe you and the person you're hiring has a communication structure. And what I've always done with families, I'm like, listen to me, I am running this business for everyone and I can't create an epitism and I can't fuck it up. And there may be a dark horse chance where this doesn't work out. And you just over communicate that stuff. The thing with family is, as you can imagine, you're going to put an extra effort into finding a spot for them. I do that for anyone. You came in as an account manager. Maybe you should be a creative. You came in as a creative. Maybe you should be a back office. But like, I think companies give up on people too fast. Would you be a 50 50 partner with a family member? I have been. Did it work out? It worked out because me and my brother are pretty remarkable at this. And I'm going to tell this story because I hope this helps someone. My brother and I, my brother comes out of school. He's 22. I'm 33. We start this company VaynerMedia. We start off 50 50. I had all the credit. I had all the credibility in the market. I had the money like I was the guy. But I still want 50 50 because because I had just come out of forming not resentment, but I just went through building a big company for my dad and owning nothing. So I was overly empathetic for my brother. Plus my brother, I already knew was talented and I had no clue how it was going to play out. But we did something smart and I hope this helps someone. We said to ourselves, day one, we're going to go 50 50. And we have no idea what's going to happen. But whatever happens, we trust each other enough that we'll adjust in the future to try to make it as good as we can. As good as we can or as fair as we can. You know, I would use both of those words similar to the best of our ability, loving each other and trying to communicate. Let me tell you what happened. Please, please. What you're saying will start 50 50 and as we go, we'll adjust it. But you can't adjust it so easily because there's tax implication. There's a lot that comes along with that. Right. It couldn't be like my debt. Let's say I wasn't doing anything like here you go, AJ, here's 30 percent of the company. He has to pay taxes on it. Like it would become so challenging. So yes, and you can do that. But for everyone listening, do your homework on how tax law works and all this. It's not so easy. Let me tell you how it played out. I thought because I was the older brother and I had other aspirations as well. That I would work with him for a while and eventually he'd become the CEO and I'd go do the next thing and he would run it. My brother has Crohn's disease at about 25, about three, 26, about three, four years in, maybe a little bit further, five, six, seven years in. He has a tough spell and he has to take like, I think, 12 inches out of his intestines. Has surgery. I come in and he's like, you know, like he's in the hospital. Comes home. I could see you shook. I don't remember perfectly, but a couple of months later, maybe within the year he comes in and he says, I want out. I was like, fuck, okay. First of all, I'm 11 years old. So first my older brother slash father and six come in, I'm like, I got you. Then I'm like, then I settled down from that. I was like, yo, we need to talk about this. Yeah. At this point, he says he wants out. How big is the company? Pretty big. Bottom line is I had to buy my brother out for real money. Then we started a company called Vayner Sports. But you have to hear the most important part of this story. Yes, I have to buy him out. And yes, I was a big impact on how much we were doing overall and were we 50 50? We were not. And I feel comfortable if AJ sat here, he would say Gary did more and was a bigger impact. But then we started Vayner Sports and to my brother's credit, Chase, he's working 100% on this. I'm impacting it and recruiting and different things like this. But this is what we're doing. And look at our guys. By the way, weird moment. Side track in the time of this filming, the jets, which are my entire life. I love the New York Jets more than anything. I'm playing the Falcons this weekend. And it's the first time my team is playing one of my quarterbacks. And I'm very weird. Is it still a huge goal of yours to own the jets? Yes, sir. Yeah. Anyway, I'll finish this to move on to the next part. We start this company. My brother's going to be on full time. And I think if I remember at the beginning, I got 85% of company. He got 15 because we were going to work on trying to make it fair. And he's putting in more sweat equity. Yeah. And so what are you bringing to the table at 85 and he's at 15? Making up for what happened on VaynerMedia. Now I'm also me. I fucking recruited mostly like I'm a beast. And that's what you're bringing to the table. But even to my brother's credit, I want to give him his flowers. Even if I never spent a minute on this company, I would own 85% of it. Because that was him holding his bargain of his word at 22 that we would see what would happen at VaynerMedia and we would always adjust. But how is that conversation talking about splitting shares at the time? For this one? Yeah. Easy because me and my brother got lucky and I want everybody here to hear it again. If you feel like you have a family member who if you set out to like we'll always try for each other. That leaves a lot of room for you never talking to that person again. Well, my people always ask me like, you know, I have a thing with a business partner. And what I say is like if somebody asked me if they want to go into business with a friend or whatever I say, if you're going to do that because you have to make sure you're operating agreement is so explicit that everything there's a step for anything that can fuck up. Because what do you do if you know he goes on drugs? You're doing you gotta assume the absolute worst. Yeah. And by the way, you two just crushed the shit out of that last. That's why you're not the bad guy. Both are unbelievably right and comma so we don't live in fantasy land. And it's still going to be gnarly no matter what. You could have the perfect plan in place with everything covered. You could assume the worst. And I promise you nine years later when there's real money involved. And it's not even the money. It's the feelings. I fucking worked every Friday night. Something in my car. Like like I'm even getting the goosebumps. I always get these when I know we're talking about something important. Like just assume. And then and then to your point, here we go. We peeled it out for the last seven minutes. You decide it's on you. Has it worked for some? Yes. Does it not work out for most? Yes. And you're not the bad guy. The piece of paper is the bad guy. But you know this, even with that, shit changes a decade. Like please, dude, you don't understand. I just had a bad couple. I went to rehab. Dude, I'll make up for it. It's like, dude, you fucking scientist. And there's shit you don't think about when you both started out as brothers, cousins, whatever. You weren't in relationships. Now you get married. One of the wives has a point of view on some shit. And by the way, even if it's not that gnarly, what if it's not even weird? Like the wife has a point of view. Two sisters start a company. The husbands get involved. And they're both beautiful, perfect marriages. And and it's all good feelings. But one of the sides of the marriages just want a different level of work-life balance with their two kids than the other side and have different goals and ambitions. It's all good. But what do you do now? You're 50 50 and one person saying I want to work nine to five, four days a week. So because I want to be with my kids. And the other side is like, well, we're about to explode. I want to double down. Now it's now what? Now are you? Do you have the shock? You have a shotgun clause and you can buy out the original? Like there's this is shit. It's complicated. But let me say this is someone who's spent his whole life working with his father and his brother. It's the fucking best when it's right. Yeah. But I guess here's the question. No, no, go ahead. I want to say, can you be clear? Yes, to the audience members or whoever you're speaking to, like, don't do a handshake deal. Always put it in writing, right? If you do a handshake deal, which I've done those things to, it will almost always end up with anxiety at the end, almost always. Yeah. So, yes, I think you're giving people very good advice. If you make a very detailed contract, you always have something protecting the relationship, the paper, the contract. Yeah. Can take some of the energy. Well, it's interesting. I'm saying this means Steve have handshake deals. But I'm just saying, like, if you're going to. You guys have confidence. But it's this is a different like, like, we understand each other very well. No, but I'm going to say it again. You just sat here and said, you understand each other differently. I just sat here and said, me and my brother. And this is what I'm saying. There's no one size fits all. Are there a billion relationships that got totally fucked because of business? Yes. Are there tens of thousands that work beautifully because they understand each other? Yes. You just have to be accountable what you are walking into and have your eyes wide open. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. All right. OK. So the question that's burning on the tip of my tongue is who surfaced the number 85 and 15. So on the record, it's good news. It's somewhere in that range, by the way, might have been 80 20. I don't recall this is seven or eight years old. Who surfaced it? I believe it went down. I'm not remembering because obviously it went so well and easy. It's not something I remember so vividly. I believe my brother said, hey, of course, we're going to whack this up in a different way based on what's been going on with VaynerMedia because that's what we talked about. And I think if it happened right this second, here's what would have happened. And I think this is how it went down. And I would have said, cool, why don't you come to me with what works for you? And then and then that's what I remember happening. Here's here's my what my gut tells me. Please. When you're negotiating with somebody and you need to arrive at a split, it's always going to be better for you to tell the person to suggest what they're thinking. And less about the number landing for me. I've learned even when we did VaynerSports, which was seven or eight years ago, I've learned that money isn't my driver because I'm capable of making it. And because I like the game more than the trophies. So it's always works for me that way because I'm less likely to be upset about five or 10 percent less than I think I was worth. But I don't want the other person to feel that way because they may get fucked up because for a lot of people, they don't have the same mindset as I do. And again, here's me giving advice that I don't take myself because I'm always giving me this. He likes to give out percentages before he sees P&L statements. Because I get it, bro. It's honestly, bro, I'm not a great negotiator by any stretch. I'm about vibes and people and stuff like that. I'm a good businessman. I'm not like whatever. But I get it. But do you have a shark on your team that does that for you? No, but I have Mark Yodkin, who's my guy. He's my lawyer, he's my COO. He's like my conciliators. He definitely like provides a level of even my brother represents that for me a lot. They're definitely more straight and like try to keep it in pocket. The problem is everybody knows like push comes to shove. I won't listen to anybody. Meaning like they there's been plenty of times where I'm like, and I'm like, dude, and I'm like, and I'm like, and they're like, dude, and like, did it and like, dude, and I'm like, did it. Now there's also plenty of times where I'm like, dude, and I'm like, yeah, you're right. Fuck. I got it. You know, like, so that's how it works. Yeah. I like, well, we do that with Steve a lot. But when he's so dead set on that, I honestly just like, dude, well, you have the vision fucking we got you. And that's it. And that's it. And like, this is great. I'm so pumped that a lot of people are listening to this right now because this is going on a lot right now with a lot of people are listening. They've got their crew. They're trying to figure out these dynamics. And look, I'm sure you guys will say this and I'll say it. There's no right way. There's some great principles. We've talked a lot about them for the last 10 minutes. But like, honestly, let me give you the last point on this unless you guys want to keep talk about it. Just try like fucking hell to remember you love the other person like your boy. You're like, if somebody if my dad was here and you asked him, why did you and Gary work out even though there was potential for not to work out family businesses are hard? And he would say because we just loved each other just a little bit more than our feelings towards every issue. And that was right. We loved each other just a couple percentage points more than what was pissing us the fuck off. First one to love wins. 100 percent. Love you for that. That's actually right. Yeah. And when you're 90, none of this shit's going to fucking matter. When the person that you're mad at right now is on their deathbed, right? It's real, man. Like, could you imagine if somebody calls somebody right now that they haven't talked to for seven years because of a bad business break up like a brother or sister-in-law or mom and reconcile the relationship? How cool is that that we did that? Sure. Yeah. Seppo's like, I don't get it. I think that's great. But I'm just I'm just very, very fixated on something that you just said. That nobody's going to none of this is going to matter when you're 90 years old. And then for me, and I know this is important to Scott as well, that come when you're 90 and it doesn't matter. But then you die in your life review. You experienced all of the feelings that you caused other people in every circumstance. Have you ever heard of that? Like we're we're we're big into these YouTube videos that like near death experiences. People recount their experiences having died and come back to life. And they type in life review. I think what do they say? So they go through when they die, they go through the tunnel, they meet their guide or whatever. Yeah. And this is right here that near death experiences undergo a life review in which the meaning of their life is presented to them, but also how their life affected other people as well as an awareness of the thoughts and feelings of those people who experience your whole life as honestly. I have literally my whole life up into this nanosecond wanted to live forever. I'm so looking forward to going through that. They'd be interesting. When I tell you when I die and go through it and they review all the shit that you just showed me, I'm going to be smiling like a motherfucker. I have so much more goodwill towards random human beings, human beings in general, than anybody I've ever met. And I say this because it's an outlandish statement as a compliment to my parents, predominantly my mother. What did I do? They made me. I am stunned on a daily basis. How lucky I am of how nice I feel towards every human of all shapes, sizes and angles, especially in the world we live in now where everyone's just trying to at all cost around anything. We ran out of shit to be mad at each other for religion, race, gender. Now we're on generations. Now we're teaching humans. OK, hey, everyone, if you're in Gen Z, you have to hate boomers and hey, millennials, you have to hate like I'm like watching all this shit and I'm like, mother fucker. So anyway, seeing this for the first time, I'm pretty fired up. I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to grab some popcorn. Have God show me my shit. You said you want said something that really struck a chord with me was I want to be remembered for giving more than what I took. When I tell you I similar to what we're saying here and maybe you've heard this as well. I'm not sure. I haven't said I used to say it all the time. I haven't said it recently. I literally literally live my life based on how many people are going to show up to my funeral. I believe most people do not show up to funerals unless it's really, really, really that person. Like I think back to my life and watching like funerals and being like I cannot believe X wasn't like, you know, like obviously like to compel someone to go to their funeral. You have to have a real impact. Yeah, like actually and like, look, I'm very fortunate. I've been to I've been unfortunate. I've been to a lot of funerals in the business world and boy, I've I remember when I was 19, I went to this one funeral and there was like nine people there and I was like, make sense. He just was not nice. You see laughing. Honestly, though, it was very real to me. I was like, this guy was profoundly successful in the business, the liquor business that I was a part of, but he was just genuinely not kind and like and I saw it all manifested right there. And I'm like, I'm going to do the reverse of this shit. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, and I was such a motherfucker. I'm like, and I'm going to build a much bigger business. With this life review thing, the saying is you see your life flash before your eyes and everybody's heard that. Yes. And it's like, like all of these people who have had near death experiences are describing the same thing and what's crazy about it, like to make you even more excited and maybe the rest of us less excited is that the construct of time is something that like only really applies in this physical realm. But like on the other side, the way to describe it, it's just like, there's not, it's not in the confines of time. So the detail, like you can feel like from like the perspective of a mosquito that's off like 300 yards over there, like the detail, like the detail of the experience and without any constraint of time is like so like beyond our comprehension. Can you please stop talking because I literally like am getting too excited and I still got a ton of shit to do. She wants to die. And I feel very strongly that I've done more good than bad. But man, do I have a lot of practice. You'll enjoy. I think you'll enjoy this because I think about this as well. And now you just said it and trigger something. I am so excited to give you this. These flowers that I'm about to give you. We're all living life, your public figure in the business world, moving and shaking. 20 times in the last 20 years. I am so excited to tell you, I love the way people talk about you that actually know you. Wow, man. Thank you. Yeah, you do good business. For the most part. And like and it's funny, it's sometimes not even like I'm very talkative and extroverted and talk to a lot of people. Even one I remember is like how you treated someone at a restaurant. OK, they told me they were actually paying me a compliment comparing me to you the way you also treated them nice. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, so definitely business. Yeah, like he was great on the shoes or this and that. But like people are watching. We're affecting people and not just people that are known, all of us, every human. Like if you're a human walking by and another human that doesn't have any followers or money, they're not nice. You feel that it's really funny. I'm like, I do this a lot. It's my natural state. I've been doing it since I was eight. I really enjoy smiling at people. Like it's really interesting, man. Like no bullshit, no like haha or whatever. Just like real talk like just like seeing somebody at Dunkin Donuts getting coffee and they're in front of your line. You just look at him like like a little I like to do a little hand. Yeah, like really like it. There's some funny reactions where if you smile at somebody, they look away and they smile. Oh, yeah. You know that? Yeah. Like they're like weird out, but they look away and they realize and then they smile as they're looking away. It's really sad. Like I feel like civility and loving your neighbor, like some of this shit that was actually really. I've been thinking about this a lot the last month. Oh, shit. This is this is how I think about stuff. Oh, shit. We've put youth on a pedestal. Youth. Yeah. These kids know technology. Gen Z has a say. They're going to be better than us and we've really started to disrespect our elders. Well, right. They don't get it. They fucked up the world for us. They don't know how to use technology. And for all these years, it was the reverse. Right. Right. Respect your elders. I saw something that fucked me up the other day. These three kids, good dudes, they weren't trying to do. They weren't like hulkins, but they were just sitting on the at the airport on these three chairs. And this 80 year old lady like clearly was looking for a. I was on the phone having a business call, but I was watching it. And I was like, dude, how the fuck is nobody getting up for this lady? And like that would have never happened in 1954. Every fucking person would have. Yeah. Yeah. I've done that. The other thing too is that old people serve as a reminder of our mortality. And we don't want to think about our mortality. I think there's some validity to that. I just think we underestimate wisdom. Sure. I just think we do. OK. How about this, please? Um, the the idea of having children, you know, back in the beginning of the country and and to work on the farm in other times. Yeah. We needed them workers. Yeah. You needed workers and you wanted to have more children so that when you are in your like end of your life, you would have these children to care for you. It was the idea of you were setting yourself up with caregivers. That's right. And somewhere along the line, I'm going to guess it was somewhere between the boomers and the Gen Xers that that that that shifted to where children were no longer future caregivers. They the children became really expensive pets. And what that's all it is that the kid is like you have a few children now. You've got really expensive pets. Yes. That you have to take care of fully into their adulthood. Like I saw I saw a statistic in 1940. Um, like over, uh, over 90 percent of every kid, um, would, uh, be more successful than their parents. Yep. Then in 1980, that became a 50 50 coin flip. 1980, it became a 50 50 coin flip. So what is it now? What percentage do you think of Gen Zers have 15? That's a general area. We're going to find out what more success do better than their parents. You know, um, with Gen Z, most likely to say they're doing better than their parents. Okay. That doesn't tell us anything. Well, yeah. What were you, um, did you have a statin mind that you're going to say? I don't know. I only know that I only all I saw was 1940. Well, I think what you're saying is like, because most Gen Zers are like, dude, I came forward to fucking house now. Well, right. I mean, and that's the thing. Like I got a vasectomy because, uh, you know, multiple reasons, but various, very major, uh, influence on me getting vasectomy was what I considered to be just dwindling opportunity. Like they had, they had, you hear people say the American dream, uh, you know, this is what it used to be. Yeah. You know, I'm a, I'm more optimistic than that. By the way, I understand all of that and there's plenty of validity to have that conversation. I think there's a couple of problems. First, I think it's hypocrisy. Let me explain. You have all these Gen Z kids saying like, fuck my parents, they fucked up shit and they're 24 and they're on the payroll. Right. Like, like, so first it's really hard to say, well, I can't do it or this sucks. And you're not changing the narrative for yourself, meaning our lack of patience of eating shit for a period of time to get to where we want to get to is gone. Gone. The reason so many people were able to make it was you thought that it would take 15 years for you to make it. Now you tell someone who's 21, it's going to take 15 days to make it. And they're like, nah, man, I ain't got that time. I'm like, bro, all you got is time. Now, a couple of things. One, I'm generalizing. I've met an ungodly amount of 18 to 22 year olds who are on fire, who want to fucking do it, plenty of that. But it has become because some people, popular cultures fucked up people because Mark Zuckerberg could in seven years because of the Internet get to a trilly. Everyone's like, yo, you know, the top 1% in America, the richest country in the world, the top 1% makes 650,000 a year. Lot of money. But every kid that's 19 is like, if you tell them, well, you're only going to make a million a year. They're like, damn, I suck. They think it's like so easy. It's impossible. YouTube influenced their money. That's right. Everyone's confused. So a couple of things. I get that. I understand why that's happening. Separation of wealth is an issue. It's all Roman Empire. Yeah. But here's my thing. As a human, don't be discouraged, meaning, OK, the American dream. Listen, I love America. I immigrated here from the Soviet Union. I fucking love this place. But really, as a human, it's all about accountability. If someone, if I was 19 and somebody told me, bro, 10 years from now, it's a wrap. Nothing can happen here. My next question would be like, where does it happen? And if they were like, Australia, I'd be like, let's fucking go. Like, like to me, it's like, OK, like honestly, though, it's like I there's always an option. Like I'm so pumped next year is an election year, mainly because all my buddies and friends and acquaintances and business associates are all going to say the same dumb shit. If X or Y, whichever one of the two wins, I'm leaving. I've been here for 20 years. There's not a motherfucker that moved to Canada. Yeah. Do you want to be in the frying pan or the fire this time around? Neither. Neither. Neither. The icebox. Well, I think eating some. I think 2024 is going to be a good year because I think the Fed's going to start dropping the rate because it's an election year. Bitcoin having, I think the crypto markets are going to start popping off. So then the real estate, where you have with the real estate market, if they're going to be dropping the rates, do you think though that there's going to be more inventory or? One thing I like is I speak with a ton of conviction of what I know and I tread lightly where I don't know. Down a real estate. I watch it. I'm a human being. I like business. I like pop culture. It's all part of it. But no, I don't have the expertise. I think what I do have is I'm good at history. And of course, to your point, if interest rates start coming down, shit starts to happen. Of course, people aren't going to buy shit when money's got an 8 percent big on it. And it didn't like like this is very historical. There's also trend changing, meaning shit's changing. Like where people want to live, how people want to live. Now it's zoom life. Like it's like when some kid the other day said, Gar, I'm just going to live around the world and do all my meetings. And I'm like, I get it. And they can. And they can. I'm like, I get it. I'm like, yeah, yeah, bro. Like I'm like, I get it. Like like like to me, everything's like, why not? Like everyone wants to look at yesterday without understanding where tomorrow's going. Like why can't you be a kid? And by the way, once you make that shift, the places you can live, if you love the outdoors and you're a little bit more rural and stuff like that, like some of the shit, like sometimes I get weird and just Google shit. I'm like, 900 acres and weird in like weird. Do it right now. 900 acres in Pennsylvania. Like this, right? You ever do this? Zilloporn. Yeah. It's like it's like just click anything. Like, I don't know. There you go. The first one. Don't give a fuck. Pay the fucking ad fee. Land.com. Like some of this shit play. Figure it out. I believe you. You've been very good at navigating this. He's a he's a Gen Z. Look at us. This shit's crazy to me. Here we go. 845 acres. Look at this. 800. Eight now that's 11. Do do me what I'm looking for. Oh, Andy. Andy. Find me like three acres for like four dollars. Go like least price. Wyoming. 100 acres for a million to that's like 800 soccer fields. That's crazy. Isn't this crazy? That's I look at this stuff. So I think about somebody who loves the woods. Actually, let's just use this. 878 acres in Alabama. You got it right there. Bottom left third, fourth one down. If you don't mind with the river, not that one. Go down left down down that right there. That's pretty the creek. Let's just look at this for a second. Look, 3.5 million dollars a ton of money. Let's put things into perspective. comma 878 acres. So if you're someone who genuinely loves that life. And you need it and you wanted to live in New York City and work in New York City and to get this kind of thing. You had to go to the Hamptons where it cost 8 million dollars for a half an acre or you could just chill and fucking Odieville, Alabama where the fuck this is and have 878 hunt every day. Work, live off the fucking food in the land and the whole that's darling. And like, but you could go on zoom all day from your fucking. And that goes for San Diego and that goes for some tropical place that we can probably Google now. Like the world's changing and I love that. And so I'm not like honestly, I'm not worried about my mom made more money than me or the American dreams done. Here's the punchline. The American dream has been going on for 100 years and there's been unlimited fuckers who've been losing. More than 100 years. That's 250. The branded branded as the American dream. Branded. And during that time, Steve, unlimited dudes and gals were losing. The American dream was opportunity. Now it's going away. There will be unlimited opportunity for people in America and everywhere else. The question becomes, what are you going to do about it? Because I promise you if you stand all day and Google and go through your feed and completely believe that your generation can't have it as good as your parent generation, well, then it's a wrap and it's already over. Yeah, I like that. I like that a lot, man. Let me let me let me ask you this. Find what you're looking for. You want to say the world's all fucked up. I can show you 900 things right now on the Internet and you're right. You want to say the world's awesome. I can show you 900 things and tell you the problem is 95 percenter in that first part right now. Is that victim mentality? 100 percent. It's all perceptive. It's easier. It's easier to be a victim than you have to do shit about it. What feels good to. Point people love a good fucking point. Yeah. He's getting too super into it. Yeah, look at him. He's all he's got. He is on the van. Yeah, let me let me ask you this because I know a lot. I think a lot of people are always learning, you know, how did you how did you know this? So my biggest question in my 20s were like, dude, these fucking million are like, how did they how do they know this? And I started, you know, reading Tony Robbins books or Rich Dad, Poor Dad. And then I started to say, well, how did they know that? And then I kept tracing it back to, well, they all got their information from Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich. And that's my favorite book. And it's it's the best selling self-help book of all time. Love it. Do you have a book? No, that's not how I I don't I've learned that I don't have I have real reading comprehension issues. Yeah, I was an 80s kid, so I didn't get diagnosed. But I don't read books. What what I've learned from is the market. But but I'll explain. Yeah. So where you're going? No, yeah, I can't explain to you why at six or seven when it snowed in Jersey and everybody started building a snowman and sledding that I wanted to get a shovel and ring doorbells and be like, can I shovel your driveway for five bucks? Nobody taught you that. Nobody taught me that. My dad, my mom was an 80s mom. Just go outside and play. It was very cool. It was awesome. And my dad was never around. Worked, which I respect the shit. I'm saying that in a good way. Like he was building our family's life. It was just naturally in my DNA. I was like I was actually genuinely, I think, truly entrepreneurial. It was just my makeup. But what taught me all what I learned was the doorbell ringing. Was the baseball card shows was stocking the shelves at my dad's store. I'm inherently curious and I pay attention. So even as young as like 12 doing baseball card shows, when someone's like, how much is that? And I was like, oh, this Cal Ripken Junior is 20 bucks. And they'd be like, oh, no, I would always analyze what went down when I would ring doorbells as a kid. No, I remember not just being like scared. Most people are scared to get the no, which is why I don't do it. I wasn't even not only not scared, I was always like fascinated by like, what did I say? How did I say? I was very introspective. So I think a lot of mine was natural. And then what I was learning was learning on the job as you hear people talk about anything in life. So I'm a better learner living it than I am reading it. And I think a lot of things came natural, which is why I actually think my platform has played out the way it is. I think when I hit the scene a decade ago and I was like, OK, now let me give the game to the kids. I was saying it's so different and saying different shit because I think I did it a different way. And so like I'm very grateful for being like I feel like I feel I can I can step out of my own self and be like, OK, Gary, you you were pretty you were original enough that that brought but it was based on. I'm sure if I read those books, I'm like, oh, shit. Yeah, they knew like I never think right. I don't think anything I do is new. I'm sure it's you. And I promise you long before Napoleon Hill, like somebody like. Well, yeah, because his whole thing was he he hung around with like the billionaires of like the 1900s and he studied their thing and you wrote it into a principle. I love it. But like the billionaires knew and he. Yeah, and they exactly. I think there's universal truce to like hustle hustle muscle. And hustle muscle is, you know, and now we've like made canceled. I mean, that was such a pain in the ass. Well, that's canceled. Yeah, like 70 hustle muscle hustle. It's like a bad like because people turned it into burnout. And like and honestly, and I get it, by the way, nobody wants. I like how trains popped up for hustle muscle. Um, yeah, well, look at this kid that the universal truths of work ethic are real. Well, they're they come from somewhere. Networking is real. Like people fucking make shit happen. Yeah, like, you know, like, I think a big one that is not. Tell me if I'm wrong. I like that you know some of this stuff well. I think humility is a big one. Of course, I think humility is like it's not like what dudes want to talk about enough. I think humility is a fucking superpower. Like if you don't get high on your own supply, it's just enjoyable. People will because you reach a certain level and so many people are insecure. They start talking shit about people because they got somewhere and it fucks you up. Like I think genuine humility is a beast of a builder. Like I think of 100. Yeah. I mean, I'm I never wanted. I love tables again. I love that. And I love I think it's less of being scared of going there. It's more of like, look, we've been fortunate, the three of us, right? Sure. Worked for that. I don't think like I'm lucky. Like, of course, you get lucky that you didn't die or you were born at all. Like you could. I don't like when people weaponize luck so that they don't have to do shit. No. But of course, we're fortunate, but we've worked hard and we're here, right? But the reality is, is that once you get there, how you act is like incredibly fascinating to me. I mean, look, you guys know you guys have been around like watching. I hate that people don't understand that money and fame, they don't change you. They expose you. They. Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't agree more. It it emphasizes it exaggerates it. Magnifies it magnifies your. It exposes you 100 percent. Yeah. I'm telling you, it just does. I've just met too many people. I've been around too long now. It's too obvious. If you were a great dude before it happened, you get money, you become a really great dude. If you were miserably hurting inside and the way you got successful, there's only two ways to get successful. Deep, deep conviction, gratitude, like happiness or the reverse, deep anxiety and negative. Like I'm going to show you fuck every one. Like they are superpowers. Oh, I definitely. It's Star Wars. It's like the dark side and the Jedi's are super close and the Jedi's are just going to win by just a little bit. Like plenty of people make money because of darkness. It's just hard to sustain it once you're there. Yeah. I remember in my 20s, I would go to I would go to bed every night. See you like that. Well, I do because when when I was dropping out of the University of Miami in 1993, I had been dumped by this girl. She said she was looking into her future. She couldn't see me in it. She wanted to be successful in life. She wanted to have stuff. She thought I was going to be a loser. Like it really, really like. I really understand where she was coming from. What there was no precedent for what I was trying to do. She's like you're talking about you're going to become a crazy famous stunt man with a video camera. Like I don't get it. I really do. Like I mean it. This goes back to how the world works. But go ahead. I don't get it. Like I just I can't you know like. And were you in love? I mean you had a big crush on her. I had she had been my girlfriend. And I don't know like a weekend. And that's a long time. Oh a year. Well, not in that time of your life. The year is like everything. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I was a whole semester and then we were apart for the summer. Like don't downplay it. To fans. She was super in love. You could see. Yeah. Yeah. It was her first love. Yeah. And she was right in bed. Yeah. Right. And so and what's her name? Her name is Tracy. And there's nothing wrong. There's nothing wrong. I'm not. No Tracy was right. Tracy was right. She wanted better for herself. And she had to have a boundary. And I mean I was blowing it. I was blowing it. I wasn't going to class. I was drunk all the time. I failed out. I got kicked out. She couldn't have been more right. But it hurts so much to be told that she thought I was just going to be a loser in life. That like when you that when I when I proceeded on with the video came when trying to do the stunts every year Tracy received a VHS tape of how bad ass like my my the filming that I did like each year the tape that I mailed to Tracy got more and more bad. How long were you doing that for? I have what started last week. Yeah. They started with the bucket list. She certainly heard this tape. She just got a bucket list in the back. Tracy is a very deep fan. Yeah. It started like when I mean she she dumped me in 1993. I certainly was presenting footage to her like whenever I had the chance in person. Like a mailed a tape in 1996, 1997, like by 1998 like there were actual like professional graphics baked in because I was showing up in like and and so like I just genuinely resonated with you when you're like you know it's funny. I'll show you. It's funny. It's funny. Wow. When you told that story like the way I would think about it. I don't have that same gear but when I do think about trying to have that gear or like what would I do in that gear? I wouldn't have gone. I would have gone the other way. I think the more gangster version is nothing and just know you're going to get that outreach in 10 years. The wrong game. That wrong game. Like I've gotten some fun outreaches when I was starting to pop 10 15 years ago and it was deliciously satisfying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it's OK to get like motivation out of spite out of spite and look. But I do think I will say this brother and I think it's fair but I will say this because I really am fascinated by this subject matter. I tell everybody who's motivated by spite try to tweak it because when it is your driver, when you get there, it's not like like like when I hear that he's also a humorous dude. Like for sure. To your point, I think the way you're saying just make sure it's not 100 percent spite because when it's 100 percent spite, when it's that pure darkness, it gets dark when you get there. Totally. Yeah. I just mean by like like this one chick broke up with me and I was like, oh, I just want to get better looking and just like also for my health and like to look better on camera and all that stuff. But it was like just like, no, I want to show her that like what she's missing. And what my eyes right or your eyes that pretty. Yeah. I was like listening to him talk and I was like, man, he's got some pretty fucking up. Thank you, Gary. Fall over head over heels. Dude, I and he's like, it's the eyes. Bro, I'm telling you. Right. Guys, I'm telling you it's I'm so blown away that people have not figured this out. We need to do a lot like all these people are trying to look good. I'm like, man, if they just realized it's they should do a little contact lenses like the eyes are the eyes of the game. That's right. To the soul. Dude, I'm telling you. Thank you, Gary. I'm pretty far away right now. And they were glowing from here. I was like, no, I think they're pretty. Thank you. That light eye dark hair thing is real. Yeah. Very Eastern European of you, Vinnie. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I think that I think that there's so much merit, so much value in that. And and if I'm honest, I absolutely was like, I wanted to show show her. Yeah. I want to show everybody. Yeah. I wanted to show everybody. And it's been a huge help for me like in stand up like, oh, people don't want. I'm going to show them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For me, that's like a healthy spike. It is. And for me, what was interesting is back to some of the stuff we just talked about, brother, I've been curious the whole time. To me, it's like, how big can I make this? It's been a very like almost like an curious engineer, I say in my head sometimes. I'm like, I like it because I'm I really want to make my parents proud that that I've realized is a big one. That's a big driver for me, making them proud, like real, like even now, like I can already start to like feel a little, you know, like I love it. I'm so grateful. Thank God they got me. I was born literally in the least entrepreneurial place on earth. For all the kids that are listening, the USSR was like North Korea. You weren't allowed to leave. I was literally born in a country, a communist country that you weren't allowed to leave. Like America passes some like weird like like California and New York pass like some subtle law and they're like so no, I grew up in real socialism. Yeah. Like and so like I'm so grateful. So, hey, I know I'm driven that I want to make them proud, which is awesome. But I am I've become very curious on the merit on the Blue Ocean thing. I'm a big thinker of like a big believer, not thinker, big believer of like to build the biggest building in town. There's two ways to do it. Either you just are capable of building it or you spend your time tearing it down. Everybody else's buildings and I watch people and they really like number two. They build a decent sized building and then they spend all their energy fucking tearing everybody else's down. And I'm just kind of on like, OK, 40 stories, 50 stories, 70, you know, like I sit here just turn 48 real talk guys, real talk. I know we're just getting to know each other. I'm like, I'm just starting. Yeah, sure. Like, of course, I know I've done shit, but like I've got juice for these next 30, 40. Like and not like because I want just because why wouldn't I want to play? You can't see yourself retiring. No, I really can't. No. And only because whatever I would do instead of building companies is not as fun. The way someone loves golf or sailing or cooking, like I like I like what I'm doing right now more than those things. I don't want to go water skiing like fuck your golf clubs. Like like this is more fun. I'll go garage sailing. Yeah. But yeah, no, I don't want to not retire because I want to make more or like whatever. Like it's just fun. It's just fun. Pure bread. Anything pure bread comic pure bread mother pure bread teacher guidance counselor sailor plumber like pure bread is pure bread. I'm a pure bread entrepreneur. There's nothing more fun to me than doing stuff in business. It's super fun and it's not about the money like it just not. Yeah. We're pure bread attention whore. I get it. We're getting Steven to the affiliate marketing game. So I've been researching all that kind of shit. That's going to be exciting next chapter. Make sure that the only thing in that game is make sure you believe in what you're selling. Sure. Yeah. That's the big one. That's where that gets fucked up. You got there's like you got to really find it. Yeah. No, we we've made a cool list of like things that he actually uses. That that and the by the way, you know what's going to be huge is finally it looks like I've been waiting for this. It finally looks we're in a precipitous in America of live shopping. So in China for the last decade, all the social all the social networks, live shopping is a monster. Like you're going through and you're picking out actually virtually. No, no. QVC. Like video on the I mean on the man put a live shopping China lady with handbags. There's something that went pretty viral recently. This is the most insane video like QVC but on your phone. I'm saying Tiktok live. I'm saying my man right here. Like social media. Yeah. And Tiktok is already doing that. Didn't Tiktok just start that. Amazon is doing it. Yeah. Everyone's going to do it. I believe that Steve as you go through your experimenting of affiliate because I'm getting a sense of you got some chops. You're going to be like, wait a minute. Fuck affiliate links. Let's go live on Tiktok for two hours a day and sell shit. All right. That'd be interesting. Hell yeah, dude. Well, dude, this is this is epic. And here we're like it's live put live shopping. It's less selling. It's live shopping on social China. China China. Yeah. China the future of shopping is already happening. That's right. This whole phenomenon this I think you would crush because you're actually entertaining and you're actually talented. And and and like by the way, I'll just do it right now. One of the ways I was going to tell you to explode the living shit out of this is to set up a Tiktok shop and go on Tiktok for an hour a day and just fucking doing what you guys do best. You will be flabbergasted of what's going to happen and flabbergasted. I have no idea what I just said. Flabbergasted. Yeah, this this this phenomenon is coming and it's coming fast. But do you think but do you think like with Tiktok? Yes. It becoming this live shopping thing. It's going to kill the whole creative. Nope. Like posting. I believe in the world of and there's enough for everybody, Vinny. You know what I mean? Vinny, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do I believe that the hours spent on some do I believe the hour someone's going to watch Steve and and you three selling this joking around, trying different dishes, bringing on people with their products to like put it on. Does that hour come away from somebody scrolling in feed and maybe watching a 30 minute video of me or something? Sure. But that's going on every day of the hour. Right. I mean, yeah, it's either that or they're going to watch someone play a video. Look at us. No, for sure. Look what's happening there where it's kind of been happening. This is coming to America and it's going to be fucking bananas. And you guys, I'm kind of pumped right now that we stumbled into this convo because I'm convinced in a year one of you is going to DM me or text me or chop it up and you'll be like, Holy shit, dude. That's how big this is going to be. Now, how do you know? And especially for someone like you who could actually do shit. Some people suck dick on camera. Yeah. Yeah. But OK, how do you sell shit, Vinny? How are you so? You will. Because you're just going to zoom in on your eyes and people are going to be like, I'll take mine. Because he recognizes patterns. That's what I was going to ask. Yes. Because like you predicted like Facebook buying Instagram. You predicted the WhatsApp thing. And then Joe Rogan. It's just all. I'm very good at this because I put in the work. I pay attention. I've been watching this shit since 2018. Yeah. Like I'm like, like, like I don't know, like it's what we do with our time. Nature follows patterns. Yeah. But how could I help me understand how could a pattern predict Facebook's going to buy Instagram? Mark Zuckerberg. Trying to think what he did before he bought Instagram that tipped me off to it. Well, he has to. Yeah. But that's revisional history. Like at the time, like it was just like, you know, at the time, what I knew was that Mark was looking at all things that had attention, not just Facebook. That he tried to. Maybe he tried to buy Twitter. I think that's it. I think Mark tried to buy Twitter. I just could see by his patterns that he got the two entrepreneurs that I most peg were Bezos and Zucks. Because they just understood what they were doing. Bezos was doing how I built my dad's store customer over everything. I cared about nothing. I cared about my employees only because I knew that would help me care about my customers. And I could give a shit about anything else. Profit margin, whatever me and my dad made, I knew that if I was obsessed with it, it's what I do now. Like people, people make fun of me all. I'm writing a new book called Day Trading Attention. It's going to come out next year. Vinnie, I swear to God, I'm putting out literally every secret. This TikTok thing right now, like my friends make fun of me of doing shit like this. They're like, why are you telling it's back to the Blue Osh? I'm like, because I'm going to get mine. And honestly, I like that somebody's going to email me in nine months. It's going to say, Stevebo podcast. I'm going to click and read and be like, yo, never heard of you. Actually, I did see you. Actually, I thought you were a dick face before you on Stevebo's podcast. Like I saw you say somebody didn't like it. I listened. I liked it. It was a cool show. And then I heard the TikTok thing and I started selling my fucking skateboards on it and like, oh my god, I have 600. It's fucking awesome for me. I love that. People aren't motivated. So even if you give them an idea, they're not going to use it. Not everyone. Not, but, but like, To your point, yeah, but he's on, but he's right. As long as one person. Yeah, to me, it's like, I'm with you, brother. I'm with you so much comma you weren't until you were. I always was. Respect. But I was trying to follow your story where you said like you started to build more momentum. So maybe, yeah, well, I always had the drive and I always was like, I'll work for free for the next 50 years. Well, look, this is why you, this is why you, You and I get along like work, look, like work ethic matters to your point. Everybody's trying to figure out a way to make work ethic not part of it. Yeah. It will always be part of it. My point is, well, then do something you love. When Steve Oh said this and Tracy said, you're not going to make it. I get it. Tracy didn't have the understanding that the genre of entertainment he was doing was about to pop. We grew up in an era where a lot of our friends were amazing at video games on Nintendo and Atari and television and Sega Genesis. But none of us were like, Hey, bro, keep at it. You might be the fucking Tony Hawk of video games in 20. We didn't think that way. Yeah. Like that I didn't see. Yeah, I didn't see that because I wasn't thinking that way. Today I see all those things like. So what happened was to his point. I'm very good at pattern recognition. I'm very good at popular culture history. You know, it's funny. I had dinner with Tommy Metola the other night and he was telling about his career. And I was like, oh, I see what he did. He knew what happened in the 50s and 60s. Frank Sinatra did a Christmas album. Let me tell Mariah Carey to do it because it makes sense. Christmas out. Just keep playing. You keep playing and keep playing him right like this time of year. I'm like and he just did. He did Celine Dion's residency at Vegas. Yeah, of course he did. That's what the fucking rap pack did in the 60s. He was good at rebooting shit. I'm good at rebooting shit. When I see Twitch or when I see social media, I'm like, yeah, that was MTV. When MTV first came out, it was like, what the fuck is cable? There's three channels. When HBO was fledging MTV was like, you know, like MTV actually worked right out the gate. But what MTV was in the 80s and 90s is what TikTok is now. It's just the place where kids' attention is. Everything is going to be player one ready. I can't wait. That's what it'll be like, right? Digital currency. Yeah, yeah, yeah. People are going to be in their headsets. I think I think I think VR is real. It has to be. Yeah, it's going to be 20 years, but it's real. Like if I want to sit into the therapist's office, but she's in New York, I'm going to get on the VR and have a therapy session like this. I mean, that's pretty you're pretty much already there with that. You just took the fucking words out of my mouth. Perfect job. Good work. Yeah, but because they're gateways. Yeah. Zoom is the middle step to that. Yeah. I mean, you could put on an Oculus right now. Go to zoom.com. Yeah. The only problem is one day the Oculus will look like this and you're just like, hello, and you're reading AR like even better. One day Oculus is going to look like this. Like an eye contact. Yeah. Like have you seen the movie Aynon? I have not. But I know the punch line. I mean, you're walking down the street and it's just like a digital profile. Everybody walks by. It's AR is amazing. AR is fucking amazing. By the way, the new Ray-Ban Meta Facebook thing. Oh, where you could just hit the dude. It's fucking fresh. The fact that they did that from one year to the next year. And you don't need the earbuds. It's going to speed up. I love when people think that the moment they're living in is when technology stops. No, no, I'll go for this iPhone. It's going to look like a fucking beeper in 20 years. For sure. Yeah. Well, it's going to be the once NeuroLink takes off. If it does, like that's going to be a game changer. But it would be weird to implant the chip into your brain. I would do it. Let me tell you when I would do it. I would do it. I'm a second wave guy. I wouldn't be the first first dude to do it because I'm like, what's up with the cancer? But if you give me a few minutes of it and I understood, I'm definitely not going to be the holdout. Like I'm going to like, why not? Yeah. Like, I don't know. Like, what do you think of chip in your brain? That's kind of weird concept. I get it. But like people put shit in their heart and that was a weird concept to people. That's true. 70 years ago. When people were like, yo, we can fix everyone's dying of heart attacks back in the day. And then they're like, we're going to cut you open and put a fucking thing on your heart. I would have been like, fuck you. Yeah. At Amazon, when you could pay with your palm at first, I was like, fuck that. I just saw that for the first time yesterday. I was going to be like, I want everyone to know everything. I want everything to be frictionless. Blockchain. I was like, of course, blockchain. Wait till deep fake videos come out. Do you understand that we just did a full pledge interview and in four years, kids are going to fuck around and change the shit we said on this and it's going to look like we said it. Well, have you seen them on TikTok? They're taking. Aren't they already doing that? Yeah, they're doing that with Rogan podcast. Of course. Yeah. They're like, hey, my dick got bigger. It's like him and he but they're changing his voice to sell their product. That's right. So what happened is the last 100 years video has been, I would argue video has been the judge and jury of our society. If you see it on video happened, JFK did get assassinated. Like video was the proof. We're about to go into the era of where you don't believe a single video over the next decade. All the videos we're not going to see. And then people can understand why the blockchain matters because this episode in three years, you're not going to post on YouTube first. You're going to post on your blockchain address first. Your I.O. That's right to show that this was real and then go up. And then when I find on the Internet, I don't know if this doesn't exist yet from my knowledge base, they're going to connect those two things. The blockchains about to get uncomfortably, uncomfortably important. Cardano, baby, all the way to the moon. Do you see what that's the four? What the what the blockchain does is nobody owns the service. Everyone's like America, China, Russia. Everyone's like Facebook, TikTok, all controlled. Now, good, good news. There's something called the blockchain. Nobody controls the servers. That's the place of truth. And obviously the NFT craziness of two summers ago, that happened just like Internet stocks in the first wave. People got crazy because this new thing, things get overvalued because greed and ridiculousness takes over. It gets reconnected, corrected, excuse me. And then you start to build the aftermath of the 2000 stock crash of all the Internet companies was 99 percent of the hucksters went away and went back to banking and being a lawyer. And the one percent that actually gave a fuck built the Amazons into PayPal's into ebay's and the shit that actually mattered. Here's the pattern of how I know blockchain is going to pop off is when you start seeing sign that says we are no longer a cashless cash business. That's right. Yeah. Well, what is it? It's like, oh, they want you on your phone. Well, it's so funny. A buddy of mine was like really passionate like a year and a half ago when this combo was hot. He's going to get me at dinner and he goes into he would fucking I felt like he did a lot of homework. I was proud of him. Like some good points. He goes, how could you trust it? Like, how do you know that's your cash? How can you trust it? You have to hold it. And I was like, I was like, what's in your pocket? And he's like, what? And I like so I got his wallet out. I go, that's a credit card. How do you trust that? I'm like, you understand this is the same conversation that happened in 1960 when people were talking about credit cards are coming and all these. Could you imagine dudes in the 60s, all those characters with real money like fuck you, it's all cash. I don't want people knowing my shit. Cash, cash, cash. There's still people like that today. Of course. But but today, like it's I laugh when people like, well, how do you know where your money is? I'm like, where's your money right now? Yeah, we're to fuck your money right now. Losing 7% under your mattress a year. Crazy. Yeah. Fuck it. T bills now. Like it's crazy. Like it's listen, all this shit's interesting. First of all, I just want to say not that I'm wrapping it up. I still got time. But you join the shit out of this. But yeah, I got to be like crazy. And we crush it. We've been doing it for a while. I know. We got an hour and a half. Oh, we fucking Niley. I think this is good. I think it's a lot to ask of the audience. If you went coast to coast, I fucking love you. Dude, I say that at the end of every episode. I say it's our street team. By the way, TikTok live. I'm telling you right now. Here's why. First of all, let me tell let me I'm just going to add a little more value. Instagram live, you go on. Instagram pings the people that follow you. They all come on. And then as I'm sure you know, it decreases over time, right? Because everyone comes, they get paid and they decrease. Make sense? Like an email like fine. They see what's going on. OK. I've seen that kind of thing for as long as they can. And they got a bounce because you had a full flood and it declines. TikTok goes the other way. TikTok, the longer you're on, the more they're surfacing your live. Even non followers too, right? Especially non followers. Yeah. Instagram doesn't even do that. Instagram doesn't do non followers. So you go on for an hour. You guys do it. You got to I mean, this is the last thing you guys have to worry about. Yeah, it's all going to be predicated on good ideas, fun ways to do it. You have unlimited ways. Everything from just wanting to do it by yourself for an hour and talk about it to like you producing cool ideas. I don't have any worry about that, but you do it a lot. Here's the best part also. Then you get to chop up little pieces from it. Where there's. TikTok will show you where the spikes were of interest. You clip it and you run those as TikTok and Instagram and Facebook and YouTube short ads to sell the stuff. So you're basically creating a production day to create good ads while you're selling shit on a TikTok live. It's crazy. It's fucking crazy. You're basically let me use it in old school terms. You're basically doing a QVC show that's randomly showing up to people who don't know you. You are. And for that, you get to see the data that shows you what commercials you should make for your product on all the other platforms. Great. Wow. That's great. Are you are you still on the same tip as posting as much as you can all day every day? Yeah, I think I think this like pushups. If you do 30 pushups, you get 30 pushup results. Yeah. You do 100 pushups to get 100. Now, what people don't hear when I say it back to things I say that maybe I need to do a better job breaking down, which is why I'm writing this book for sure. Or I'm hoping people can hear what I'm saying. When I say post 30 times a day, I'm also saying post on seven platforms. Yes. And I'm also saying tweak it slightly based on a platform. So, for example, I think y'all should post a lot more on LinkedIn. That doesn't seem native or natural. But meanwhile, LinkedIn is getting a ton of organic reach. And because most of it is business content, but people are in it all day long now like Facebook, anything that's somewhat out of the ordinary does even better. And let's call it a spade. A lot of people on LinkedIn are in their 40s and 50s who are like real fans of you. It's like a good demo for you. So like, so all of a sudden think about 30 now, 30 post a day. All of a sudden, if you're just posting on Instagram and YouTube, that's like 30 a day. That's fucked up. But when you're posting on, are you guys posting on Snapchat spotlight? There you go. I know. I'm watching everything. Snapchat's got unbelievable reach. If you know what you're doing, YouTube shorts versus just YouTube. LinkedIn is now if you say when you know what you're doing, like, are there different strategies for like different from content strategy is the hardest marketing craft in the world. YouTube shorts is where it's at. Main or media. Yeah. But that's super expensive and for big companies. That's why I'm trying to put out as much. That's why every five or 10 I wrote a book about 10 years ago called Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. And to this day, I get 10 emails a day like head of marketing this, marketing that entrepreneur, like that book. And I went like a huge rally of it a couple of months ago, just randomly just hearing from a lot of people of how much that book changed your life. I was like, man, how are and then even new people like I just read it. It's so great. I'm like, fuck, man, it's so outdated. So I started writing a new book called Jab, Jab, Jab, Left Hook. Oh, great. But then when I went through it, I realized this is much more complex. So it's it's been renamed to day trading attention because that's what I do. I day trade attention. I'm giving you platform strategy right now, but I'm also paying attention to everything that's happening in pop culture. Why are people wearing corduroy hats? Why did Alex Earl pop on TikTok? Why did liquid death work? Who's the up and coming rapper? What food is working? Like shoes, sneakers, like why? Like, like why did vans crossover from skateboard West Coast kids to black kids in the urban world? Like, why, why, why, why? So I live in that both on platform and on culture. Once you understand those things, you can dominate. Wow. All right, let's dominate. Yeah. I love it, dude. Thank you, man. Thank you for having me. Oh, yeah. Yeah, dude, that was that was rad.
