I look too aggressive. You look too aggressive? Every time I meet someone new or something, it just feels like there's a huge hesitation. No bro, I think you look super cool and fresh. I think you're creating it a little bit. Bro, it's not true. It's 100% not true. What's happening is you're allowing it to get in your head. For every 20 people that don't get you, there's gonna be one to two that do. And that's the only people you have to focus on. Please never let that dog dictate your mindset ever again. There's nothing more intoxicating than not knowing what you're gonna say, but fully knowing what you're gonna say. I know what I'm gonna say in the macro, but I have very little idea what I'm gonna say in the micro. The words, the cadence, the stories, the balance of it, I have no idea. But the fucking mission of it, the point of it, clear as day. The hope, the ambition of what I'm trying to accomplish is to change the fucking lives of a couple people out there. Let's give it a whirl. V-Con is kicking off at LA Live. Tell people what this is. V-Con, this is year three. When I launched V-Friends three years ago, it was important that the digital collectible also had a utility, a business conference. So V-Con was so central to the V-Friends journey. That's fucking awesome. I love it. That's great. Oh, right by the Kobe statue. That photo ops could be awesome. I've been doing a bunch of unofficial micro events of the community, and the biggest theme that I'm feeling on the ground the last 24 hours is this is a little bit of like a sleepaway camp for our community. And so that means a lot to me that all of you are here. I'm just curious, like, do you remember everybody you've made? Names are almost impossible. But Tom will tell you, when I saw him, the first thing I said to him was, how's your Ricky Henderson rookie mark? Yeah, brother. I'm always doing good, my Ricky Henderson friend. That's right. Thank you for remembering. Like, there's so many different data points. So the answer is overall quite a bit. But then I'm a human being, like, sometimes, you know, like, there's, you know, oh, in a way that you blow your mind. I also am aware that it's meaningful for people for me to remember. So I think I put a lot more extra effort into it. Yeah, it's because you're trying it. You're trying to show I. How do I balance that with garage sales and online? By realizing that there's no such thing as balance. And who gets to judge the balance? Yeah. What you do is something I may like or he likes or she likes. Balance is you judging yourself. What I would say is the way to find balance is to find grace. Give yourself grace for when you don't do it. You don't have to do it. You don't have to do it. You don't have to do it. You don't have to do it. You don't have to do it. You don't have to do it. You don't have to do it. It's the best way to find balance. It's the best way to find balance for when you don't do it or when you are doing it. By the way, the way I've eaten this year has not been as tight as I wanted to. Since January, I'm like, okay, next week. Yeah, and so why am I okay? Grace, you're just a human. But grace does not mean excuse. Right. It means that you keep yourself accountable that like next week I will start garage sale. And I said, you know what I mean? Yeah. Grace. I've reached out to. My deepest, deepest want is to not do it here. So I think that's what we need to think about. It's just a half time adjustment, you know what I mean? Yeah, we'll get it up and going and I will find a new location. Yeah, I mean, I think we should do it outside. I think we should do it somewhere. Like I just really think it's what it is, you know? A few moments later. Right here. We're gonna move that. Uh-huh. Over there. Uh-huh. I'm gonna put you here. So pumped. And what time are we on? If you can just bear with us for today. Of course I can. Why in the world would I not? I'm just, like- I love you. I love this spot, by the way. So we're gonna put you over here. I need to be with the people. I know, I know. That's just who I am. No, I totally get it. And I totally, by the way, I totally get all the thought put into this. Like it's important for you to hear that from me. Thank you. You know what I mean? I love it. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Who was born in 1997? It's a very rare V-friend that everybody talks about. What's that? I can't tell you. In year three of this now summer camp, for many of you, you're sitting with the friends you've developed over the last year, two or three. Which is really ironic because most of those started with someone you didn't know at V-Con One. Can we get a collective commitment today that when you're out there for everybody to at least say hello to one person you don't know? The amount of people yesterday told me, my business partner, my friend, my this, met here, you're limiting yourself from those other people right now. They're all here. So please lean on that. Become friends over the rest of these two days. Can I get a little noise for that commitment? Yeah. I love it. Perfect. So I'm there. I like it. Last year at V-Con at your closing, you did the thing where you were standing up and you said, put your job if you're unhappy. Yes. I put my job up once later. And my kids aren't off the bus. I teach nursing school now as a hospital administration. And I'm consulting now too. I'm making more money and happier. So thank you so much for that. You're beyond welcome. It's crazy, isn't it? It's nuts. It's crazy. Doesn't make sense. It does make sense to me. Yeah. That's why I pushed so hard. OK. I appreciate it. Love you both. Thank you. That's it, friends. I know a lot of you want me to do V-Con 4. But as you all know, I'm trying to go on my own journey of being more candorous. Gary V seven years ago would have succumbed to that pressure. I think you all know I'm also going to work on V-Friends forever. And so I don't feel like I want to come up here on stage and say things that I don't have figured out. What I can speak about, though, is that I'm not going to be able to make a decision on. So let's go to the next slide. This isn't the last V-Con. My intentions are to give you a lot more. This project means the fucking world to me. I work every day on it. I work every day on it. I work every day on it. I work every day on it. I work every day on it. I work every day on it. I work every day on it. And I just appreciate all of you so much in a way that you cannot imagine. And that's predominantly because fuck, it's fun to be with you. I love you, Adam Rips. Adam Rips is the best. Adam Rips.
