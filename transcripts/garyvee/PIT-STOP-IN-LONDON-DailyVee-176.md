Pretty busy. Taba motherfuckers, I've been telling you! I Really love the office, and I really hate yudkin I didn't realize how fancy our lawyer was You can like find stuff in there to flip on Facebook marketplace Um, this is Rich What's the best thing what's the most challenging thing the most challenging thing is Right and already just make it subjective calls absolutely. Yeah, so we're dealing with that We had some lovely social content ideas and unfortunately they've kind of Being taken off the radar and the clients keen to do like highlights from events that they do Make splash on social right it's really unbelievable how unemotional I've become about that You know, I don't think we ever waiver from giving the right advice because that's what our job is. What can I answer for you? Um, I'm curious. So I do love photography in my own time. Nice. I absolutely love it. I want to promote my audience So and you're on Instagram the truth is The way you win in building an audience is you have the right content and you get awareness You did the lightweight one, which is the hashtags. It blows me away. How many people don't do that? Like that's just so imperative I used to not do it because I was taking for granted the fact that I had distribution But even I was like fuck that that's lazy. Let me like do it right But the way to really do it is every single day you post a photo you should dm 30 to 50 people who potentially may share it Now but here's the key If there's landscape London and as form at London and they share shit and it's four million followers You have to figure out how to actually bring them value when you dm them. Everybody's dm me. I get a dm every day Like from 500 times. So make sure when you see the accounts you give thoughts To when you write when you forward the photo say, hey, you know, I'm really trying to get some expo like Straight up man, right? I'm trying to get some exposure If there's anything I can help you with they may look and go, oh Hey, mate, why don't you give us 10 other photos that we'll just use for ourselves? We won't even credit you we need more content and you'd be thrilled to do that on an account that has 900,000 followers That's going to tag you on your photo. Yeah, that's the game. That's good. Good. Yeah Good luck, man. Yeah, reach out anytime. Yeah. Thank you Anything that hasn't anything from a higher level or anything that you're curious about Well, we've been talking recently a lot about Well, just since yesterday the youtube announcement And like is this the end of tv? I think no But I think that it's the end of tv for the people in the media landscape who think that's the end all be all You're lucky. I think you're more similar to somebody who was in their 20s in 1940 1950 and watched All these different changes And then that became the market for 50 years. I think that's what we'll see a little bit though I don't think they'll ever be a run because the technology is going to change so much mbr coming in 10 15 years on the consumer side um, so But I do think the youtube announcement was interesting. I haven't dug deep into it, but i'm excited about it Hi, kari. Nice to see you again. How officially? Hi, i'm rome How are things? Good. Thank you. Good busy I Writing is a talent. I don't care if you like this. It was like this in story if you wrote write it on a wall or like that You know Vayner has always been very digital forefront even for digital But I never it's unbelievable how I never the only thing I ever worried about if somebody came from a more traditional place Is if they held subjective things at a higher regard, right? But by the way, that happens to digital natives. Yeah, so to me it's not the digital Traditional thing has never filtered in any other way than who's just holding on to Historic, yeah I'm with you on that that doesn't even put it in my mind really good stuff and everything is so we're using particular platforms Yes, like how do we make those explosives and we have and we have to be smart and respect the context of where we deliver it I think context is everything All things like tell me when it's actually going on because when you know that it starts to change how we speak and it's kind of being a bit More place to do so And so what's your biggest observation about the difference here than what you've kind of seen elsewhere? If anything Is much nicer having like some big agents is there's a lot of big e guys and stuff like that Yes, you know, as I say, I'm an east end girl. I don't think I have time for stuff like that. Yes And sounds like it sounds like I like East London. Is that the East line in the vibe good? Yes. I hate that shit It's a you know what it's always the time it's a very good job. That's exactly what it is. That's exactly what it is Yes, we are it is it's speed is the only thing that matters And opinions predicated on people's Insecurities and ego slow shit down absolutely I'm completely agree good for you. That's good. That's exactly right. I'll give you a good piece of advice. I wish somebody told me Number one Nothing changes humans stay the same. Yeah, so don't Don't ever think the technology is going to make the human change They're going to adapt to it But the core principles of human behavior are very tried and true. Yeah number two Everything takes longer than you think In 19 when I was how old are you 28 28 look good So going a little younger when I was 21 22 when I launched wine library calm In 1996 I said by the year 2000 Everybody's going to come into wine library with a phone that's gonna I didn't say smart So I don't want that's going to understand the prices of everything is what I said And so I better have the best prices It is 2017 You know and you know, it's 21 years later And almost nobody walks into my store and uses their smartphone to look up prices occasionally. Yeah, so ai is right VR is right The technology is there. Yeah, the consumer adaption. Yeah the adoption by the consumer is what people underestimate Because it's why we're not using google glasses and spectacles to scale like our behaviors are tough to change They will over time. Yeah, I need to run We should continue this conversation. I think they're I think you're right. I think there is something to be done um I uh I listen you have my inbox. It's gary of inner media. Let's start communicating I'll I'll email you back my cell phone number. Actually, I'll give it to you right now Anything I can answer for you? Um And yeah, I mean, uh I've worked to like a small A really big one. Yes, and you know during my time there there's been like A shift in clients like they're taking their business away from the big agencies that like loads of red tech and loads of protests And they're going to like smaller or agile um agencies like sort of like vagabond media but even smaller than vagabond media So I just want to kind of ask you like what's your what's your PRB on on when the the agency model's going in the next like five years I don't know. Yeah, I don't care to be very frank. I uh And I just want them to come to us because we'll be the best version of whatever it is I think the pendulum always goes independent conglomerate. Yeah, independents get bought up by the conglomerates. Yeah Um, I think we'll be the biggest independent shop in the world Um, and that's it. I just want to kind of whether they're bigger than us or smaller than us But I think when david and goliath fight It's very important that both of them work on their strengths I think it's crazy when goliath loses to david Goliath should never lose to david. Yeah, that means bad strategy So when we're when we're goliath So like us versus luke, uh, like if he was still doing it I would really make sure we were fucking huge step on his face and kill him And if we're if we're david, yeah, because it's us versus w p p Like get a fucking rock and put it in his fucking eye Like, you know, so I don't really care if I'm the big guy or the little guy Um, I just care to win So, you know, that's how I think about it. Like whatever I have to do. I'm always going to do that. That's what I've always done But it's really hits my radar Like where you are like, I don't know why I was like the other day. It was like why Do I actually know what ryan's up to and like like and like in life? No, no, I'm seeing a lot of shit I think I subconsciously I'm like filtering it And I'm like, do I like ryan more than I think this is literally what I said to myself I mentioned as a property to Gary v.
