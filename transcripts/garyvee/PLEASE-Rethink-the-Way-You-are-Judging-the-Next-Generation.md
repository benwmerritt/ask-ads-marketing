So something that has been on my mind, and I want to make a quick video about, is I've been reading so many of the comments on social networks about these teenagers, these kids. They don't get it. They're always on their phone. You know, I'm blown away by the establishment, by parents, by the market, by the elders, and even by some of the kids within the age demo, of the gross underestimation of this 11 to 16 year old, this 10 to 19 year old demo. What world do you think they're gonna be living in in 2025? And so all these critiques you have about what they're doing, and they're not socially this, and they're not good enough, and they don't work hard enough, I don't know what you're paying attention to. Watching these kids grind and hustle, and create content, and ideas, and businesses in these social networks, why don't you shut the fuck up and go to Instagram for three hours, and stop judging, and pay attention to the explosion of this creative hustler class that is the teenagers and the dominant leaders of our future.
