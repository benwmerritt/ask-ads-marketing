I'm giving you a million bucks. I want you to sell this hat. What are you fucking doing? Influencers, Facebook, Instagram, pre-roll, placement on Pat McAfee's show? Like, what are you doing? Raise your hands, you've never clicked the banner ad on purpose, raise your hands. That's it. Our industry spends more working media dollars on banner ads than social media. You're fucking kidding me? So whoever here is the best at thinking at how to spend the money to make the sale in the short and the long term. Sale the short term, brand building in the long term. That's who's gonna win and AI will take away a lot of the jobs of like what you do in a fucking Excel sheet. Everything that AI will do is force more value on thinking and less value on commodity executing. To become great at media, I believe it's based on the biggest thing that I'm pushing as we go into this next chapter with media. I believe my relationship with our media department is really interesting because a lot of things that the media department currently believes I don't believe in. Because they are forced to believe it because the way the client measures awareness is based on potential views, not actualized views. That I believe a lot of you, even given the head nods in here now, that if your life depended on it, you would not buy programmatic, trade desk, garbage digital inventory with ugly banners and pre-rolls to sell a thing. I think what's gonna happen is that AI is gonna force everyone to realize it's the thinking, whether that's creative or whether that's strategic, that all the value in the world is about to go to thinkers. This is why school is such a bad framework. This is why I've always challenged school so much. School, which all of you are so close to at this point in your life, I don't think anything is lost on this with any of you. You're not being rewarded to critically think or to be creative. You've been taught your whole life in school to do something that AI is now gonna do. It's really true. Like what? Like you were taught to memorize facts. I can get the facts in a second. You were taught math. I can do math in a second. All of the value in the world is headed towards creativity and strategic thinking. So if you're in media, AZ, do you know we're attention shifting, right? Like for example, people are like, Gary, what about Reddit? I'm like Reddit doesn't have good ads. I love Reddit, but I don't like what we can buy on Reddit. It's not gonna do anything. I'm aware that people go to ESPN.com. I'm sure you looked at your brackets to see if we're gonna win anything. You know, like I get that you go there, raise your hands. You've never clicked the banner ad on purpose. Raise your hands. That's it. So I think AZ, it comes down to are you a thinker, right? Do you use common sense and truth? Do you know where trends are going? Do you understand the thinking? Like how, it goes back to planning. Everyone's gotta be the best planner. If you're using a historical term, you're a planner. I'm giving you a million bucks. I want you to sell this hat. What are you fucking doing? How do you think creative, you said creatively, but what do you think about chat? Should you be creating images or like, how are you using it as a tool? Like do you think that's gonna take over as well or no? Yes. Like why do I need a designer to spend four hours making something that I can make in nine seconds? Like if you're a designer today, who doesn't have her or his own ideas, you're in trouble. But if you were the leading salesman selling yellow pages in 1999, you don't even know what yellow pages are. How many people here have no idea what the yellow pages are? Yeah, so, yeah bro. Like the yellow pages used to be a book that every person had that you would look at for information in your general area because there was no internet. Oh, the telephone book. The telephone book. Oh, I thought that happened, the telephone book. Well, when Google came along, Yahoo, search engines on top of the internet, there was people who made their living, paid for their family's mortgage by being salespeople for yellow pages. They went out of business. You're going through it for the first time, so you're like, oh fuck, my cousin John is dead. But like, that's what always happens. When the tractor was invented, everybody worked on a farm. This is just evolution. And if you're a designer, if you're a creative, by definition, the first requirement is ideas. Otherwise, what are you bringing to the table? So, yeah, I was gonna put a lot of pressure on the world. You guys are in it, congrats, you picked a good time to be born. But I would argue it's the biggest opportunity. For a lot of you, it means you'll end up not being an employee, it means you'll end up being an entrepreneur. Because you're gonna learn how to use these things, and instead of being an executive here, making 150,000 a year, you'll do something around something you love, making 150,000 a year, because you'll be able to, because your AI infrastructure and capabilities will be the power of a workforce of 10. So, pros and cons to everything. What's the best way to improve our either specialized skillset or overall skillset? To really become those people of like, no, and become, you know, the experts in the field of digital media. Well, what do you think, Jayden? Oh, I think the start is listen, you know. I agree. It's a pretty good open door policy. I've been making the best of it, trying to get as much feedback and insight from everyone up the ladder as much as I can. I think that is a remarkably smart and strong observation. The only reason that this is a good program is because of the culture we've created for the last 15 years, where you have senior people that are willing to spend time with you. Now, of course, some of you just heard that, and you're like, no, not true, Gary, fuck. I reached out to like two people, and I haven't been able to get a response. There's gonna be always moments in time, right? Like, if there's a fucking account on fire, and you happen to be on that account, and you want like, hey, teach me, and they're like, fuck, we're just trying to save the business. That might just be the luck of the draw. But as a whole, including what I'm doing with you right now from the top down, there is a much bigger appetite to just help you than you will find in 99% of businesses. And so I'm proud of you that you've sniffed that out. And you know this, like, Amir in your office. He's fucking smart as shit. He'll tell you everything. Amir is my manager. Makes sense. So like, to me, if you're like, Amir, will you, can we get like drinks from seven to 10 and talk about things in detail? He'd be pumped to do that. This is just a good life lessons for all of you. The concept of getting one no being the end of your journey is hurting you so much. Ask 13 times until someone says yes. Nicely, different people, different things. So there's a lot of, there's a lot of no's here, circumstantial, people busy, three people are out, I'm Matt, leave, and that person's got a cut. Like, there's just a million things that could be going on. But don't let them know to getting some one-on-one mentorship to deter you from asking the next person. Sometimes you can get the bosses of the boss to give you a half an hour versus your direct boss, just because of the nature. It's just serendipity of just how work works. I wanna be dairy or be past dairy. That's good for, as you should. Let me tell you, let me give you the answer of how to do that. Get out of being in a marketing agency and get into actually doing something. Gary's Gary because the first 20 years of my career was using marketing to build things, not being in an agency. I'm a practitioner. Right, so you may need to seriously start a side business where you do all the marketing, because all of a sudden, marketing is not about reports or theory or politics. It's about the merit of the execution. Zhang will tell you, and he should do a follow-up with this, he's been here from day one. As we brought in fancy math people and seemingly me as the DNF student should not be of that ilk with the media department, they could never beat me because they were playing in media for the sake of media, not the true goal of growing a business. Marketing is a proxy. It's not an actual thing. It is a part of a thing called growing a business or an entity, a nonprofit, a personal brand, a campaign. It is an energy of offense. Yeah, I mean, I view, so I'm old enough to remember when companies were asking this question about internet. And everybody was like, I was just with Pearson and the head marketer at Pearson, she said to me, Gary, you know, Pearson is gonna be an AI company. I'm like, no shit. I'm like, just like Pearson said 25 years ago, we're gonna be an internet company. A year and a half ago or a year ago, everybody was wondering in the company why I wasn't making all of us learn mid-journey and like use, you know, like, it's because of what you just saw GPT do last week. Like we're still early. Like, how am I gonna implement it? It's oxygen. It's not even how I'm gonna implement it. It's how AI is gonna implement itself in all of us. There is nothing. AI is not a thing. It's like a process. It's like oxygen. Yeah. You know what I mean? We will use all the codes. We will, you know, we will, excuse me, we will use all the platforms. It will be just, it will just be fully ingrained back office. Every single way that project managers take notes will be AI. Every way we do media execution will be AI. Every way we make creative will be AI. It's just omnipresent. Which platforms, what I did well that other people got caught on is we're not in a five year contract with technology that's now already old. The amount of agencies last year that locked into two, three, four year scopes on SaaS businesses that are now can't get out of, not to mention the AI tools that Facebook, Meta, and TikTok, and Instagram, and Twitter, and all these companies put at the forefront of the places we do the marketing are gonna be better than the tools that are in the market. Like what GP does for making imagery, I'll be able to do just inside of X and Meta and TikTok, and it's gonna have a propensity to know it gets more organic reach because it has the data, chat GPT does it. Wouldn't it make sense that if Meta made me an image inside of Meta that more understood the propensity of engagement that that creative is gonna outperform me doing it in a silo on Adobe or chat? So look, I'm always me. If I'm not moving fast on a technology, it means that it hasn't fully baked yet. Yeah, I would say to kick that off, I mean, look, I'm struggling to get SVPs who are 40 years old and have had 20 year careers to call elephant meetings. Let there be no confusion. There is 0.0 expectation that you're gonna drive an elephant meeting. That being said, I think it's incredibly powerful for you to practice in your career. There is a gracious, humble way to maybe raise your hand if you're in a meeting where you can hear that the client's not going the way we're going. And maybe you ask in your Slack or your direct report or like, hey, I think XYZ is not doing what I think Gary's saying where we wanna do. You know, how do we go about it? So, you know, I think that's how I think about that thing. What's the balance between escalating up to you and cultivating that ability to handle elephant type situations at every level? How can we kind of develop those skills so we don't necessarily have to at the higher level? Or would you prefer that people do? I prefer that people do. Here's why, brother. I think this is similar to the Jathan answer. I like people to taste things in real life versus theory. Another reason why I struggle with school. You know, it's theory. Like you could read about doing pushups. But you've gotta actually do them for the thing to happen. I can do more in 15 minutes than a lot of our team can do in three months because I lack the fear of losing the client, which is uniquely mine more than anyone's. I have to be empathetic to my SVPs and my leaders. Like, they believe that it's all good in theory that I say that, but if they walked in my room and they're like, so Gary, I had the elephant meeting and Bose fired us so we lost 10 million, thanks. See you later. That that would be bad for them. I know that that would never happen if they had an elephant meeting. In fact, I know that if you don't have elephant meetings, that's how you actually lose the business. So what I've seen, Sam, is that more people are affected in being good at it by seeing me do it in the room with them. It's not like I'm having the elephant meeting by myself. Some of you may be in an elephant meeting because I want you to learn. So I do, yeah, it continues to be an ideology for those people that make six figures a year and have a VP or an SVP title that say, my job is to keep Gary out of it. And it's my job to keep telling them, that'd be fine if you were keeping every client. So the proof is in the pudding, ultimately. So, yeah, I mean, let me go even further, Sam. Nobody asks for it. I just interject myself when I can smell it at my level. We are still not good at this at all, brother. People are predominantly driven by fear. That's why politics means what it means. It's how your parents, parent did all of you. Don't touch that, you'll burn your hand. Don't do that, like, fear is the currency. Right now, I'm sure it's not lost on any of you. It's at scale. That's what's really going on with politics. Occasionally, politics will use hope, and that's why you've heard about Obama or JFK or, you know, but predominantly it's fear. And parenting is almost all fear, and corporations are almost all fear. And I believe the reason that we are different, and we've been special, and we're just starting, and we're gonna get very special, is I'd like to think that already you've realized that I don't lead with fear. Doesn't mean I'm naive. Doesn't mean I'm stupid. Doesn't mean I'm delusional. It means I just know that it's the second best way to get people to do things. Fear is good at getting people to do things in a short term, but then trust is lost and it doesn't become awesome. I am a very different equity with people here than I did when I started the company. Right, there's a lot of people here who've known of my existence since they were in middle school. That's a different relationship I have than when I started this company where nobody had ever heard of me, period, outside the wine business, and definitely not in advertising. Some of you have literally had my videos or books part of your curriculum on your journey. So I have a lot more leverage to your point, Sam. That's why I'm so optimistic. That's why I care so much about this program. I'm obsessed with this program from one of two things. One, it's the thing that showed you that it can be like this in a company, and the skills that come along with that common sense. Or two, this room has the future C-suite in it. Like I'm going nowhere. 15 years from now for me is like, cool, that's tomorrow. And so that's exactly right, that's why this exists. Otherwise we'd just hire people from one year in and other places. What's your vision in five years? Like how can we contribute to that? What's one word that you see being going to it that we can embody? This will be hard to land because a lot of you don't have context elsewhere. But let there be no confusion. Like, hi, we do marketing very differently. All of you are younger and you're more, naturally your day-to-day lives are more social media centric. So it may seem like very common sense to all of you what we do. But again, if some of you have worked or interned in other advertising environments, like we are very different. So my goal is to change the way marketing is done by every company in the world in our industry by us having continued success. If I was thinking about one word, I would literally say common sense. It's probably the biggest thing that makes me think. Like, most of our, think about this. Clients genuinely around the world that are, let's say, Fortune 5,000 companies think it's a better idea to spend way more money making a television commercial than making any social media content. How is that possible in 2025? For example, let me bring in politics. You know, I'm sure this hit everyone's radar. There was a lot of conversation about how Kamala spent so much more money than Donald Trump and I'm sure all of you heard, like the podcast did well and she would, that's the same conversation. Many companies spend more money on making billboards than making social media content. I'm so happy all of you are here because you can never unsee what you're about to go through. You'll always know this information. Whether you're here or somewhere else, you will be grounded in this information. And for a lot of you, you've used social for real life, not from a business lens. So for a lot of you, it's also been a great, it'll be a great learning experience or was great learning experience because you thought you knew things because you were about it every day, but now you're looking at it from a different angle, from a business angle, and you're seeing different nuances, which is also valuable. So, comment sets.
