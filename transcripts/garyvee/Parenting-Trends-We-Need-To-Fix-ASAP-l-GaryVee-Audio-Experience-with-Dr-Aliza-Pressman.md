## Transcript
Humans, when they're a team, co-founders, parents, when they're a team, if one of them's all the way over here and you're struggling because you want them in the middle, what a lot of people do is they go too far in the other direction. But what you're supposed to do is just go in the middle. Meet in the middle. That I thought was like profound parenting and co-founder advice, which is like, however you wanna look at it, if you as the partner feels like your partner is all the way to one side, and you want your kids or your startup or your business or your team to get to the middle, what everyone kinda naturally does is goes too far to the other side. And this is really what happened in our society, by the way. Collectively. And you double down. That's right. Instead of you being the person that went right to the purple or the middle. Attention is the number one asset. Hi everybody, three minutes ago, we decided, the doctor and I decided, instead of doing what we planned on doing, which was she was gonna be on my podcast and I was gonna be on hers, we decided to do a joint podcast, and I'm excited about it. I mean, we're so similar. Why not? Great, why don't you introduce yourself to my world and I'll do the same. So my name is Dr. Lisa Pressman. I'm a developmental psychologist. I'm the host of a podcast called Raising Good Humans. I wrote this book, The Five Principles of Parenting, and I'm pointing to it. I don't know why I just said that. That's why we use video too. I really use it. I said everybody who's listening. Maybe I'll use video. I'm sure you understand that podcasts get filmed sometimes and then clip it up, so go ahead. Okay, I'm assistant clinical professor at Mount Sinai where I'm the co-founding director of the Mount Sinai Parenting Center. When did the book come out? The book came out in January. And obviously for your audience, they all know how great it's done, but for my audience, as you all know, like parenting is such a essential part of how I see the world. And I think we're in a nice time where I think we're starting to put pressure on some of the conversations that have been accepted in the last 20 or 30 years, which I think is healthy, which kind of leads into Meet Me in the Middle. I have a kid's book coming out here in July for everybody in the Leases audience. I know my nation knows it. But the title of the book is Meet Me in the Middle. And my latest marketing book that just came out, Day Trading Attention for all the entrepreneurs, has a purple cover, which is a nod to the middle. I think the world has gotten way too red and blue politically, but also in marketing. People either care about performance, how does it convert, or what's the big brand idea. And all the magic and marketing is actually in the middle. And all the magic and parenting is in the middle. And all the magic and life, I think, is in the middle. Thoughts? I totally agree. My whole, the premise of my book is the balance of, the space between chaos and rigidity is where we have the freedom that allows us to make decisions that are reasonable and we can better support our kids and we can, it sounds like, do better marketing. And I feel like we are in a time where, if we don't find our way into the middle, we're gonna implode. So. Yeah, so I think for both audiences, obviously your audience has heard more of this from you. But, and my audience has heard my versions of how I think about it, but definitely nowhere close to as deep. And so actually to that point, right off the bat, I think so many of you that listened to my podcast, I think it's been very clear that when I touch on parenting or the lens that I look at it from, there's a lot of reciprocation of interest, all the emails, all the DMs. It's why I continue to talk more about it. For all of you, I couldn't recommend you going out and getting the book because I'm surface level touching on it. This goes into quite a lot of depth and so please go do that. What does the book cover and or what even might be more selfish because I love the speed in how the world turns. What if anything has not philosophically changed since January, but temperamentally, culturally, like what's the state of the union from your perspective on parenting? First of all, I just wanna say that I'm surprised, pleasantly surprised that you do get a response when you talk about parenting because I haven't really spoken to very many dads. In this context, you're the only dad podcaster that I've spoken to unless you're, I guess I spoke to a news one if that counts, but so it hasn't been, so I've been curious, like don't dads get pretty obsessed with dadding, but I wondered why that conversation hasn't happened and I think part of it is because so much of parenting and the philosophies that people are hearing sounds so exhausting over the top, minutia oriented, and I don't know, just a little extreme and I think that the world is ready to come back to the middle on that front. Yeah. So I think that might help, but I do imagine that people hear parenting and think, oh my God, you know, like how much more information can we get and can we just go back to the basics? Yeah, and what do you think from your perspective? Because listen, I think probably, so I love touching on parenting. I've been writing a book in my head, this is how I write books, like this last book, Day Trading Attention, was really being written out in my head, meaning the pillars, and then you go put pen to paper, right? I've written seven business books, they move pretty quickly. I've been talking to my community about a book called Perfectly Parented, that I've been writing in my head for a long time, and I already even know how it starts, which is, of course I wasn't, literally the opening line to the book, of course I wasn't perfectly parented, but for my whole life I've been trying to reconcile why in a world where I understand many things that my parents did that were quote unquote not ideal from my perspective, why have I been unable to carry any weight on them in lieu of the reverse, which is my borderline obsession and gratitude for all the things they did do well, and why is that an extreme not norm? That is the opening to that book. Why aren't you hearing from people that they are grateful for the parenting they received and for the gifts of that parenting, the imperfect parts, the mistakes, and all that stuff? And not only me, I'm one human being, forget about what I'm hearing, though I'm very fortunate because I get so much information from the kids and the parent, I get it a lot. Not only why am I not hearing it, when I go out into the wild and do what I do for a living, which is I'm a human anthropology cultural strategist. I read the world. I spend hours a day consuming information, whether it's for channel Reddit, whether it's blogs, and obviously social is an incredible database of truth. Less today, well, correct, but no, of the truth of how people react to things, to your point, truth, fair. But when someone likes something, agrees or disagrees, atomally disagrees, fights, tears down, or pontificates, or celebrates, it's all there. Less today, 10 years ago, people didn't know people were watching. Today, we are more aware that, so people are posturing. I think one of the biggest issues in parenting, universally, is that people posture for acceptance from their peers and society in lieu of doing the right thing for their kid. The greatest anxiety from kids that I get is my parents want me to get straight A's and Horace Mann, not because they love me, but because they wanna brag about me to their fucking friends. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I thought you got to beat that out. Please beat that out, but I think it's a great point of me. I'm glad I got to use it there, because boy, the love of it. You meant it. I meant it so, I mean, it is destroying the trust between parents and kids when kids feel that they are a product for their own parents' self-esteem, AKA insecurities. That is the elephant in the room. You know, my approach is so much more compassionate. By the way, by the way, by the way, there's nothing I'm more empathetic to in the world. Then the desire for that. No, that insecurity dictates behavior. Yeah. When I tell you I so understand why a parent does it, and when you're lucky enough like I am to be a parent, you know you love this thing in a way that makes you not be able to breathe. But that doesn't separate the fact that we need to have an honest conversations with ourselves of how much do we treat our children as proxies for our own thing, versus parenting them to guide them to their thing. And I think there's a third part of it, which is I don't feel like I'm enough of a person if I haven't done all the things for the kid and how that manifests is through these achievements. I love you for that. That's right. Without understanding that usually the overcorrection of that is what leads to the thing you're worried about. Totally. Yesterday, yesterday alone, these three questions came up in one of my parent groups. The first one was a worry about a kid who's 13 who doesn't want to play club sports anymore. It's a worry for the parents. That's insanity. I was like, why are you worried? They've made a decision that it was too intense and it's not for them. Only 7% of high school athletes, so they've already been committed athletes, go on to college to play college. At 13, it says a lot if they realize this is not for me, this is insane and intense. Good for them. By the way, it might not even, note it, so epic, comma, they might not even be out because of its insane and intense. What a lot of kids, so here, let me give you an insight that I love. The amount of DMs I get on TikTok from 13 year olds that use the word toxic burnout, insane and intense, just to get their parents to back off. When in actuality, they're just bored with tennis. It's over. They don't care anymore. It's a very appropriate thing. A thing that was super normal in the 80s and 90s which is like, I don't like hockey anymore. And it was like, okay. Everything has become so magnified as if a decision to quit, even if you're so good, and this goes back to proxy. Is that parent worried because they like the social aspects of them being on a team? Do they just enjoy it? Do they just, I can speak for, I desperately enjoy watching my son play basketball because he's really good and it blows me away that he's so much better than me. And it's fun to watch because I like sports. But to talk. Whereas I was so excited when my daughter quit. To your point, on the flip side, going to school if you wanted to quit, I'd be like, yes, drop out in fifth grade, let's go. Like every parent, but I think what I'm interested in there is the surface level is confusing so many people on the depth. And kids are smart and they weaponize words. Well, that's a whole other thing. I think that social media, you could also say that it's given words to things that are inappropriately used. Like diagnoses for mental health challenges, mental illness. So they're like, oh, I have this checklist of symptoms. I must have a disorder. Yes, but I would argue that we are in a culture right now blaming social media for everything. Long before social media was this hot, WebMD was doing that every day. That's true, but not to teenagers. Yes, but the reality is- And I, by the way, I think we've given too much weight to the power of social media. And also we've turned that one into a binary too. Of like it either has to be the end of days or it's fine. And I think it's somewhere in the middle. Like everything. The reason we talk about social media today, the way we talked about alcohol in 20s and 30s is because this is what we do. What we do as humans is we are too binary. Yeah. And so what happens is we literally banned alcohol in this country because we also are incredibly bad at accountability. You know, it's interesting that you say alcohol. Please. Because I had an episode a few weeks ago with the leading alcohol researcher in the country. Like substance use researcher. And I have not had this much of a response to an episode of like, I have a pretty chill, peaceful, mostly mom audience. Some dads, some grandparents, some caregivers, blah, blah. But it's pretty sweet and loving and nerdy. And so you had a visceral reaction to something. They did. Yes, that's what I mean. Yes, because they didn't like what they heard that the research said. So people were like, well, in my experience, it's this. And the big issue was that all the findings over about 40 years have been for zero for this guy. And of course they've gotten very high tech. Like now they have bracelets on these kids where they can detect like every 45 minutes what their blood alcohol level is. It's not just, you know, what it used to be, which is like check a box of how many drinks you had. That the later you start, the more likely you are not to have, not necessarily in all cases, but the more likely you are not to have disorder drinking and binge drinking in college. The later you start drinking. The later you start drinking. Right, because for the last 20 years, the hot take is I let my kid drink a beer at 14, but they're at home and they don't stigmatize it. So they're not hiding. But wait for it. It turns out that's not true. But so many people got so angry. And they were like, well, my experience when I was a kid, was my parents said I couldn't and then I was binge drinking. Focus group of one. Focus group of one. It was why when you said earlier, it's interesting Gary and I said, no, no, I also go out. Like the thing I'm most petrified is being a hypocrite of knowing focus group of one is the great danger of the world. I sit in my inner circle all the time, like I have no opinions. What I try to do at all costs is complete. The only place I'm irrational is in sports. The reason I know humans are irrational is because I do it in sports. Because you feel those. I hate Boston, the city, in a way that makes no sense. Sports. I actually like Boston. A lot of my best friends are from Boston. But I actually hate them secretly too. But it only has to do with the Celtics and the Patriots. But I want you to hear this. I know it to be true. Meaning it's so deep in my soul. And it matters to me so much that I'm 100% irrational. That I think is silly and fun because it's sports. People do that with everything. You're right. That's what's happening with politics. The thing with politics that blows me away is, I'm like, oh my god, these people are treating real life like sports. I can walk away after the game and move on. This is eating people up. And I think it bleeds into our parenting in a real way. Culture. Absolutely. And I think we're about to see, because we have an election coming up, some really, like if I were a kid right now, and I know we have some teenagers very close to us, I would think the adults have lost the plot, lost their path. And who are we supposed to turn to for guidance? Because everybody is so. Well, that's why we've had the rise of humans on social. People, look, and I think it's grown up's faults. When politicians speak to each other the way they do. Yeah, why would kids not speak to each other that way? And lose that level of civility. It's been, how are you possibly as a parent? So when I think about parenting, I think the death below is hypocrisy. So you're on Facebook yelling at a Republican or Democrat because you live the other life with curse words, and you've canceled a friend of yours from 20 years, and you're cursing, and you're nasty on Facebook. And then you try to tell your kid to be kind. What are you doing? What do you think? They're blind? Yeah, I mean, we could get rid of all parenting. It's really not about doing anything to our kids. It's about ourselves and getting our act together. And then our kids are going to inevitably benefit. And we have so far to go in terms of getting our act together. What I think is very interesting right now is the naivete of my parents' generation, of my contemporaries, of my grandparents' generation, we continue to underestimate the intellect of children. How does that play out in all this? I do agree. I mean, I still think they're children. I get that someone who's nine is nine. But I'm fascinated by how many people have awakenings in their later years when they do family therapy or things of that nature. And the parents are like, wait, you knew me and dad? We're having problems? They're like, no, yes. How much do you think, if anything, this is question form, do you think that this, you know, it's grounded in hope? I think parents are hoping their kids are right. How much of this blind spot of the underestimation of them, which is different than understanding they still have to develop on all this. How much of that is in play? And if we can reconcile, don't underestimate your kids, back to middle, don't underestimate your kids, but you don't need your kids in your couples therapy sessions either. Like how do we find that middle? What's going on with all that? Well, I think we underestimate the brilliance of their nervous system. So even if they're not intellectually ready to understand something, they know something's going on. And so we have to name it. That's right. So once we name it, how are we naming it? I think that's where the middle is. You're not gonna say mom and I are having some trouble. This is these are the details of the trouble. And we've... Your dad spends all his money. He's not fiscally responsible. He's hurting us. I don't think eight year old Timmy's like granny Brunch. Exactly. Stuff. So that kind of thing. So it's like their nervous system is brilliant and growing and growing and growing. The part of their nervous system that's brilliant is the feelings part, the self-regulated part, not so much, but it's growing and growing. And then they have adults who are pretending that things aren't going on that are going on. We have a problem. But if you could say, hey, you might have noticed something very basic. Like you might have noticed that mom and dad aren't, like we haven't been getting along well or you might have noticed that it's been over. We had an argument. We've been arguing, whatever it is. I just wanted to know if you have any questions. Yeah. And then see where they're at and then give them the information they need. But then at a certain point you could say, you know what, that is still a grown-up issue. So I'm not going to give you the details, but I love you. We love you. Middle. What happened was so many parents of the last 30 years so overcorrected in the other direction to what they grew up with that we got to this place. There was something that was said to me once that always blew me away, which is, you know, humans, especially when they're a team, co-founders, parents, when they're a team. If one of them's all the way over here and you're struggling because you want them in the middle, what a lot of people do is they go too far in the other direction. But what you're supposed to do is just go in the middle. Meet in the middle, right? Right? That I thought was like profound parenting and co-founder advice, which is like left or right it, however you want to look at it. If one partner, if you as the partner feels like your partner is all the way to one side and you want your kids or your startup or your business or your team to get to the middle, what everyone kind of naturally does is goes too far to the other side. And this is really what happened in our society, by the way. Collectively. You double down. That's right. Instead of you being the person that went right to the purple or the middle. That even happens in parent-child relationships. Like I was actually speaking to my father because this is a ridiculous example, but he wanted my daughter to sit in the front seat of like an old car that didn't have seat belts. He was just driving in the like little cul-de-sac or whatever. Grandpa wants to show off the car to his granddaughter and have a little time together. And have a little fun. And I looked at him and I was like, absolutely not. And he said, you're so uptight. And I said to him, the reason I'm so uptight as a 50 year old woman. It's because of you. It's because you were so not uptight that I was like, I guess somebody has to be around here. And so I doubled down on being like, everything is dangerous. By the way, that in my late 20s, because I love observing this stuff, that was one of the most fun. And I was very undereducated. I was a poor student, but I was super intuitive and wanted to observe. So I had a lot of fun in my life of like, wait a minute, even though I probably could have read about it. You know, like- That wasn't your love language or learning language. I remember this vividly. After a couple of my friends got engaged and married, I'm like, wait a minute. Everybody either marries completely into their parent or completely left field. Like where's the middle? I'm like, that dude married his mom or the reverse of his mom. That guy married her dad or like literally the reverse. It's fascinating. I could probably pull a couple of the good qualities and find the middle, but I do think it is true that you're just like, okay, then I need to find this kind of opposite or say him is much more- Plus minus all that stuff. But I think you also, you're good to go back to sort of your nervous system. You, you always, we always want to go home. So even if home wasn't what would be on paper perfect, we want to be there. In a real way. This is something I've said to people. For better or for worse. No, I love you for this, this section. I'm glad we got the touch on this. This has been one of my favorite things along my journey to talk about with my inner circles, friends, family. I've been talking about being well-parented my whole life. Like in high school, in the 90s, when it was ridiculously not cool to be like, my mom's the best. Like I just couldn't help it. I couldn't help it. It's been a currency in my mind in a real way. Predominantly, because my mom didn't push it. You know, I remember really thinking that through. Like, did my mom want me to be hurt? It was actually the reverse. It's just so obvious to me. And I also am very fortunate. My parents are opposites. You had a little dog and a cat in the house. In a crazy way. And then I got double lucky. My mom predominantly had me the whole time in the beginning because we immigrated from the Soviet Union and my dad worked every minute. My dad and I slept under the same roof my entire life. He never traveled for work. And when I tell you, I have less than two dozen memories of him between five and 14, because he would leave at 6 a.m. and get home at 11 p.m. It was a very immigrant 1930s, 40s, 50 life. My mom is the nurturer. Like, my mom did super well back to purple. It wasn't, they were extremes, but both kind of weirdly in the middle. My dad's hardcore, but a man that would say I love you. Right, so he didn't have the full that side. My mom was, you're the best, you could do anything, but would slap me in the face and help me accountable if I did it, right? So they both kind of were extremes, but also middle. And this is why I get to be the byproduct of it. But I do believe that I got very fortunate that my mom was the foundation, and then I was ready for my dad. I have a feeling if I was the reverse, I'd be less emotionally strong and broke. And so I think it worked out for me. But even back then, so this has just been a currency my whole life, as I got into my 30s and 40s and friends started to become actual parents. So this was the combo, as you know. We are the generation that is obsessed with parenting. Our parent generation, something to even think about it. They just lived life. Analysis paralysis. I would tell them, I would use friend examples. I'd be like, Sarah, you're so petrified of being a bad mom. I'm like, look at our friend Jan. Her dad, or her mom left because she was an alcoholic at six and was never in her life. And look at them now. Like, your parents, your parent. Like even the worst, most extreme, terrible situations, people want to find home. It's real, especially for moms. You literally come out of them. So I talk to a lot of dads and dads are always like, you know, on some really nice stuff, like good energy. They're like, this stinks. Like, I want to be like, and I'm like, we were in them. Like, moms got the advantage. I'm sorry, like, weren't you start in there? You literally were in them for nine months. I'm like, what do you want? Like, you can be the best dad of all time. They were in them. Yeah. You know, like I kind of joke with my friends about like that connection, but it's very real. No, I think there's always like a primary. And then if they leave the room, if you get hurt, you'll go to your second person. But like, Are you kidding me with my son, like skins his knee playing basketball and we're both there. And I'm like, it's basketball. And he's going right to mom. I'm like, you know, but it is what it is. I like, I get that and I like that. What is, here's a good one. You're obviously looking at this a lot. Where are we furthest away? Of the things that you analyze, you put a lot, your life's work into this, you're really in it. Of the kind of common things that are brewing right now. There's probably 10 to 25 cliche specific things that you're like, wow, I hope we can get to a better place on these things, of those things. Yeah. Which current parenting trend in detail do you think we're the furthest away? Like we can fix the eighth place trophies thing. Like, you know, which I'm very passionate. Yeah, I think that's fixed. It's ridiculous. It's on its way. Yeah. It's definitely on its way. But I think on that one, it's the demonization of losing when life is primarily about losing. Absolutely. You're teaching kids like losing is bad, we're going to avoid it, which then just destroys them for life. Yeah, I don't even understand how we accidentally, I mean I do, but you don't want to see. It's all good, well intended. Also we don't want to feel the terrible feeling that we feel when we see our kids struggling. Like it just feels crappy for us. Well now you're going to the opening part of this podcast. Like I would love to say that it's selfless. Like we care so much about them, but I think we care about us not feeling terrible. It's why someone like me who fundamentally believes that adversity is the foundation of happiness likes when I see it in them. I would just add to adversity in the context of having one person, even if it's not your parent, but somebody, a coach, anyone who loves you and believes in you. And then adversity can turn into resilience. 100%. In the absence of that. Like if you look under the hood of someone who's come out of terrible circumstances and they've thrived and we always credit them, like look how resilient they are. I think if you look under the hood, somebody, and if it wasn't a parent, it was someone. A coach, a teacher, an uncle, a grandma. They didn't do that alone. How much of that though, even without the uncle, the coach, the grandma, the third grade teacher, how much of that game is grounded in actual DNA? There's a lot of research on this. I do talk about this a lot in the book because I do, I think we confuse, like I was born into a resilient type of person. I'll say this, there are people who bend more, like it makes it easier to be resilient when you kind of came into this world, a dandelion versus an orchid. Yes. And so you're gonna be more likely to take all the hits and keep coming out. But even a dandelion needs some sunlight, water, and soil. Of course. But I think resilience, like there are key features of people who tend to be more resilient in addition to having one person, gratitude, autonomy, motivation, empathy, and self-regulation. Those people who have those skills. We'll break those down one more time. Sorry I said that. No, I think I'm just excited because I think I have them all. Go ahead one more time. Well clearly you do. No, but really, I'm not here then. Gratitude, which we obviously- A door. Established. Yep. Autonomy. Go ahead. Motivation, empathy, and self-regulation. Which you have unless it's sports. Yeah. That's right, that's right. By the way, it's so funny we get to bring this up. I want people to hear this. I'm so grateful that I don't have it there because it gives me context of why it works. Yeah, you have more empathy because of it. I mean it's really bad by the way. Can we have a therapy session for me? I've hip checked an 11 year old boy wearing a Tom Brady jersey after a jet's loss at the Meadowlands into a fence. His father looked at me and I looked at his father and said, what the, oh I'm sorry. What the F are you gonna do about it? That's crazy. Crazy. Like I should go to jail. That is crazy. I did it lightly, but it was real. I wanna make sure everyone doesn't think I'm a psycho. But it actually happened. I'm trying to- You had the urge. No, no, it's genuine. This goes back to how I see the world. It's crazy to me that something that's so not important has that power over me to trigger me into like genuinely the bizarro, reverse version of myself. I mean, but it also probably brings you so much joy and community. Of course. And by the way, it's a little bit grounded in what we were just talking about. I grew up a Rangers, Yankees, Knicks and Jets fan. Oh, that's so much to watch. But yes it was. But the Rangers and Yankees won championships for me in 94 and 96. And the second they did, I stopped watching. Wow, by the way, I was at both of those championship games and I had no business. They were the only games I've ever been to of those sports. Isn't that like spoiled? Hold on, we need to break this down. 94, 96. You were in game seven of the Stanley Cup for Rangers' Canucks. And you were in game six, I think it was, when Charlie Hayes caught the ball in 1996 and one. I don't even know who caught the ball because I shouldn't have been allowed to be there. You were there when the Yankees and the Rangers won their championships in 94, 96. And also the Yankees won another year that decade. Yes, that's right, 98. And I was there. Those were the only games. Do you know what I dream that heaven is? Which isn't that terrible though? I didn't do that. Yes, you're a bandwagon fan and I knew you. Yeah. You know what I want heaven to be? That you get up there and you can watch everything. So like when we get there in 100 years, God willing. And we see each other. That is actual hell. Not that, I mean I'd rather be in heaven watching those games with you. No, no, no, I'll explain what I mean. Based on this, this is where my head went. I hope that you can like actually watch all the footage for fun. Meaning like we're up there, we're like, hey, hey, we know each other. Remember we did the pot? I'd be like, let's see. And then I would remember, because I remember everything. I'd be like, hey, we were both at the Yankees and Rangers thing. Let's watch the film to see if we saw each other. Look, look, we saw each other at the hot dog stand. Anyway. And you were probably like, why are you here? You do not deserve this. I can tell from your face. Where are we furthest away, you think? I think we're furthest away from the middle. Yes. And what about specifically? Like not eighth place trophies, maybe fighting, like fighting teachers. Can we stop that too? Well, I think we need to stop fixing things for kids. Yes, that's where I'm going by the way. Eight place trophies and fighting teachers are fixing things for kids. Let your kid lose. I kind of weirdly want my kid to really lose, like in like real stuff, like a fight. Like if you said, what could, what would you like to happen tomorrow? Like my son loses a fight. Like a fist fight? That's right. Not out of some weird, like I'm being silly a little bit on the podcast and having fun, but I'm trying to show like we all have strengths and weaknesses in different arenas. I don't want him to get brain damage. I don't want him to die. Like just a nice solid black guy because he opened up his mouth and he opened up his mouth to the wrong kid and he learns that like, you know, sometimes you get caught if you overextend yourself. I just, we're so different. I'm like, I want my daughter to lose a debate tournament. By the way, I would like that too. By the way, you used one of my, I think debates the most. Like by the way, I think of those things exactly the same. I think it's equally devastating to lose a debate or get punched in the mouth and bleed. One of my favorite things about, because both my daughters do debate, my favorite thing about it, apart from the fact that it's not a spectator sport, so I don't even have the option to go. Oh, is that right? You can't go to debates? For middle school you can, but then for high school you can't, which by the way, it's, I don't know, it's just not a thing. No, it's probably because parents got, I mean, honestly, I would be out of control. Well, even for the middle school. If my kids debated and I was in the crowd, I actually think losing a physical fight is kind of like, I mean, look, you can go to Jiu-Jitsu. I don't know, there's something about losing an intellectual debate that would hurt me more than losing a physical fight. That's interesting. Well, I definitely got into the habit of monitoring what would be a point or not, and I was like, what is happening to me? And about arguments that are absolutely asinine. So I do think it's really interesting, but the reason why I was so excited for both my daughters to do it, even though I really didn't, I said you have to try it once. I didn't force them doing it, but only because our world is so ridiculously incapable of, you know, middle, or even just listening to the other side of an argument. So I think it's a great skill to be able to make both arguments and have, make them with gusto. I think the rise of audacity in human beings needs to be discussed. This issue, the thought that the entire world should see the world. From your perspective, totally. The way you see the world is the craziest. I cannot comprehend. Look, I just don't understand this at, when I say at all, I am intellectually strong enough to understand that a human that was born in a different circumstance, gender, race, income level, part of the world, religious background, family background, may have a propensity to see a social issue different than I. How is that? Why are we trying to come? It is so audacious. It really is. You know, the thing I said about empathy, before empathy, or sort of on the side of empathy is perspective taking that capacity. And the silly example with young children is that at age three, and experimenters did this very cool study where it might sound ridiculous, but they put in a Crayola Crayon box paperclips, something unexpected. And they said to the three-year-olds, what do you think is inside this box? And three-year-olds are like crayons. And then they had the parent, you know, it turned around or in the other room, whatever. They show the kid what's inside the box, and they see that it's paperclips. And then they say, what does your parent think is in the box? Even though they've never seen the inside of it, and the three-year-olds will say paperclips. Because you assume, well, you assume that your parent or anyone sees the world the way you do. So even though it would make sense that a box of crayons. Oh, so it's more of that than their assumption that their parents know. Yes, it's called theory of mind. And it's the idea that someone else's mental state is different from your own. You don't have that before age four. Got it. So a four-year-old will answer differently. Yes, a six-year-old will look in the box. They'll say, you, you, that parent's going to see crayons because they're going to see the outside of the box. But I know they're paperclips. I understand. And when you don't really keep exercising that skill, you end up growing up in a world where everybody thinks you're supposed to think the same way. So when people say things like, how could he think that? I'm like, because he's not you? That's how. I know. Or when people say, well, if that had happened to me, I would have. No crap. Yeah. That's right. That's you. It's audacious. So I think that is a big problem. I think the word, you know, it's funny. I had a wine brand called Empathy Wines. You've done a lot. I've done a lot. I'm a real entrepreneur. And I did that. You know, I've been. It's very cool. It's what's really cool about it is why I named it Empathy. How big that word mattered to me 20 years ago when I couldn't. People didn't even know what the word, when I tell you the amount of times I used the word Empathy in 1998, 2002, 2004. And intellectually strong, like really strong intellectual people, like what is that really? It wasn't in the zeitgeist as you may know. You can go to Google Trends right now if you're a nerd and type in Empathy and watch how it's evolved. I think audacity needs to be the next word. I like that. I think if people understood how most of what they believe right now is shockingly audacious, the lack of humility is profound. I have crazy bravado confidence, gusto, but crap. Not more than I have humility, which makes me palpable and makes me calm. You know, when people ask me about how much easier it is for me to parent, or when I think about all the consumption of parenting content, I have a podcast. I'm on social media. I have a book. So I'm part of it. But I really, most of the messaging is very simplified because we are getting way too in the weeds. And I do struggle with it and feel like how much of that is feeding this beast and how much of it is giving calm. Right. Are you a contrived? Of course. I think about it all the time. But I am brought to my knees. And I have content knowledge, like very few, on developmental experiences. And I am brought to my knees constantly by raising teenagers. I love you for this. So many people come up to me. They're like, your kids. I'm like, are you out of your mind? The only person on earth that my kids are not going to get info from is GaryVee. They hate GaryVee. Like, I'm their dad. They don't, you know, it's just, it's a core, I'm like, I look around the world at other people to be the GaryVee to them that I am to your teenage sons. I say to my friends, I'm like, I'm like looking around and being like, who do I want them to like be in their feed? Or like, you know, when they're sleeping, go like a bunch of their posts and I'm like, and so that shows up randomly in their For You page because of course not. It's ridiculous. I actually, so my, we're in town right now and my daughter, I take her phone at night. So she doesn't have screens and. What time is that? 10. 1030. So I take her, both of my kids I take. I'm, one of my daughters is going off to college next year and I'm probably going to be like. In her dorm, like under the bed. But it's just cause sleep matters so much to me. But anyway. Oh, sex with sleep. Okay, so half of our problems in the world would just be done if we could get sleep and stop focusing on how to solve the problems. However, back to root causes and the well versus the sink, if we could get off of our audacity and lean into our humility, you'd sleep simpler. Yeah, that's true. You know, the sleep issue is an emotional issue. This is all judgment. This is, you know what's crazy? I'm starting to interrupt. Self-esteem insecurity. Actual self-esteem. Not ego which is insecurity with makeup on. It's true self-esteem, true insecurity. That is life. Like it is so crazy how much that's grounded in. When you're laying in bed and you're worried about, let's talk about real stuff. When you're worried about getting fired. Like you can feel it. Actually, one of the hardest things that I do for a living is I had a tough conversation yesterday with someone. And I know that they're walking right now on this floor. And I know they're terrified. And when I tell, like honestly, I'm like, I just gotta look like it's, I would be so much further along if I could just tweak that a little bit to the middle. Too far left on that one for me. Didn't have the candor. I'm better now. The fact that I was able to tell that person yesterday, I used to do it out of nowhere because that's how much I struggled with it. And it was sloppy. And it was the gaping kryptonite to my 30 year career was my inability to be candorous to people because I like them too much. You don't want them to feel. These guys have been hanging around for two days. I'm already like, you're my brother. Like I'm so crazy. That's how I feel about people. And so anyway, but if he or she last night were like, even if I get fired, it's gonna be okay. What's gonna happen? I believe the reason people are struggling is I believe we just overvalue the outside too much. Because if you play it logically, I get fired. Now I have less money. Oh Gary, what the hell? We have a mortgage and things to pay for. I'm like, I understand. I also understand that if you own your home, you could sell it. And you could live in a less nice home. But that's hard for everyone. When you have a BMW and you trade it in for a Honda, you're worried about everyone's judgment. We're so worried about our parents, our siblings, our inner circle friends, our coworkers. And then even the real part of social media that's the most fascinating is people are worried about Johnny Pants 13's comment. Yeah, who cares? But that to me, like to get us into a place of being able, cause I think we want our kids to be happy, but we don't really mean that. We mean we want them to get back to it. So I think I might get fired. Can I get back to happy after that? Like it might take a year. I might be really struggling, but will I get back there? I had a best friend the other day goes, Gary, I just want my kid to be happy. I'm like, Then you're screwed. I said, how about you start with yourself? Aw. Honestly, like this is so much of parenting right now. I don't know. I really think an ultimate root cause is we just value other people's opinions too much. Keeping up with the challenges. Well if we value us, we don't value that as much. I know, self love. And why do we have so much judgment on ourselves? The reason I like bringing up like the hip check of the kid, which is clearly inappropriate, is we all have strengths and weaknesses. Not only that, we make mistakes in our, even our strengths. And then we have to either deny it and then become one of the audacity of that, not being able to just see yourself, or we can grow from it. I'm, I even have hip checks. I have the, I have the, I mean, I'm like, I'm thinking about taking Jiu Jitsu just so I can beat them up. No, but to your point, I actually have to find my own middle of acceptance. Cause I'm almost weirdly like, I like championing. Like I'm almost like too weird of championing my mistakes. Like I love, I think it's the coolest when I screw up at something I'm good at. Yeah. Like I went into a new business pitch a year ago. We had it. I feel like I underperformed in a world where I'm 99 out of a hundred. I loved it. Maybe it was exhilarating. Cause you haven't done it in a while. I like secretly think I sandbag myself just to feel it. Yeah. It's like, It's like I enjoy the loss. By the way, it goes back to my, my sports thing teaches me everything. I could have so much fun with the Yankees. I prefer the losing to the winning. Yeah. You get to feel, especially for a guy. When else do you get those feelings? I think that we really need a reset. I'm so happy that both parenting and therapy are being challenged currently on, is it a little too much? Yeah. Oh, so when you, to go back to those challenges, I think we are very obsessed with the minutia of every moment of how our kids feel. And who is going to ever be able to walk through the earth constantly think about how they feel. You can't get anything done. It's absurd. So we have gone way too far. We over corrected for not caring at all. Correct. And so now I think parents are gonna, that's really hard, really, really hard. I get it. I'm actually so pumped for Gen Alpha. I think they are gonna have such a better middle as parents. The eight, nine, 10, 11 year olds. Cause this is gonna take a few minutes. Yeah, of course. You know, to like work itself out. I think they're gonna be fortunate. I think they're gonna be good. I think they'll be, you know, it's the same old thing. This pendulum swings. This is what I wanted to tell you about my daughter. And then we probably have been here for seven hours. And I don't know. Yeah, go ahead. So she does, she's not in her own room. She doesn't have her books. And she was like, can I read? The only book we had was my book. Oh my God. So she's like, can I just have your book to go to sleep? Cause I have, I'm not gonna. That's how she sleeps. Not normally, but she needed something. She needed something. She always needs something to read. She just bore her to go to sleep. Yeah, I get it. So she starts reading it. And the next day she's like, you know what is so cool? I noticed that the majority of your book is about parenting yourselves, like the adults, and that you constantly are saying like not like it says the essential guide to raising good humans, but it seems like it's more like the essential guide to not screwing up your kids, but not more than that. I was like, thanks. And then she said, and also, I'm going to just point out that you don't do a lot of things in the book. But I think it was a really good moment because A, she felt safe enough to say that to me. Of course, which is great. So then I feel really good. But B, I know all of this. Doesn't mean I do it. It's, of course, you're a human being. And it's okay. Call it that part. Like do some of it. That part. And oh, by the way, in that little story you just told, there was something about the middle that I'm obsessed with. Her feeling safe to tell you that. Powerful. Her disrespecting you inappropriate. So many parents could right now couldn't say anything to their parents that they've allowed their kids to talk to them like a curse on your thing. So please beep this out. They're allowing their kids to shit on them. And I just want every parent that's listening. If you're 14 year old is looking you dead in the face and disrespecting you. I promise you there's a slightly better way. I think that's an example of how we sort of have accidentally lost the plot. Because we're like, that's their safe harbor. I have to be there for them. I remember when my aunt, I was very young, and my nephews, my cousins were younger. I went to her house. They were teenagers. And they were so nasty to her. And they were like, ma, get us this and do this. And they were very rude. Which, oh by the way, by today's standards is like decent. It's kind of even worse. You're right. But at the time I was like, oh my God. And she said they just had a long, hard day. And I was like, sure. But you could say to them, I know you had a long, hard day. You need to figure out another way to ask her. I'm not getting it. My mom is my idol. I put her on the pedestal. She's the greatest mother of all time. If I contemplated being disrespectful for her, she would have choked me out. I respect that so much. Obviously I'm being extreme. It was just so, I'm so happy that I had boundaries with my parents. I'm so grateful that it didn't even cross my mind to have the ability to go there. That is now common talk. Boundaries, like if I had to pick, if your word was audacity, why did I just say that? If your word was audacity, I would say our big challenge right now is boundaries with our kids. Certainly in parenting or with other people. And the difference between wanting your kids to feel safe and still being comfortable with boundaries. There's something I say to business people that maps to parenting currently in my brain. So many business people choose to have it better in the short term, only to have it bad in the end. I watch so many businesses go at, and that's what I'm seeing. Everyone, so many of the behaviors that parents have in their gut that they're not doing right are gonna really play out in post-college. Especially the zoo animal thing. So the zoo animal thesis that I have in my head is the over-coddling and fighting teachers, eighth-place trophies, like eventually they're 23. Eventually they're 25. And what I didn't know, because this was the epiphany of epiphanies of the last decade for me, because I came from a very different family and because I grew up in very humble circles and I didn't go to Ivy League schools, like the last decade of realizing that 28-year-olds take money from their parents put me to my knees. I'm like, I had no idea. I did hear you say that. Yeah, I had no idea how many 31-year-olds are walking around Earth right now, and forget about 31. Any kid that's 22 to 27 that comes from a decently financial environment is getting subsidized. Do you know the psyche of this? I'm like, I went to an Ivy League and took money from my parents. And by the way, by the way, but you're part of a different generation. Here's something you're gonna say. Comma, when you and I were growing up, when especially if you took any kind of like real significant amount of money, you borrowed money from your parents and you paid them back after you got their repeat. For sure, and also it was with the stipulation that you're doing it because you're working towards something, not because you're not doing something. Not you're going to a visa with your buddies. And so, but and, oh by the way, back in your generation, when you were 26 and taking money from parents, it came with a level of respect. You've got people that are 27 on the payroll to go to a visa and are shitting on their parents. The one insight there that I don't see a lot of people talking about that I've gotten through a lot of dialogue in private is a deeper thing that's happening that I am fascinated by, which is at the time the 24 year old really likes the help. But I think that the parent is signaling to the child that I don't think you're capable. Absolutely, every time we fix a problem, we're silently saying, you can't do this by yourself. That's true for 13 or 33. This is why when we were outside in the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s and parents didn't know what was going on, it was so good. If you were at home as a mom waiting for them to come home for lunch, but they were outside for three hours, they had to figure shit out. I think that we are going to come back to, I hope, a little more of figure your shit out. Yeah. See now I'm cursing. This is good. Authenticity matters parents. If you're worried about a curse word, you're going to be in trouble. I remember the first time my kids, because I definitely did not curse when they were younger. And then there was some point probably during the pandemic where I was like, here's what? Hi, curse. How old were they at that time range? My youngest was in fourth grade and my oldest was in seventh. And then they react to the word? Oh my God, they were like, you cursed? They were so shocked, but then also, I mean. That's the thing I always laugh at. People are like, these kids, you can't do that. I'm like, do you understand what's going on in the schoolyard? Have you ever hung out with a bunch of fifth graders hanging out? It's like, they make Chris Rock seem like that. But I always say to them, what you do in the schoolyard is different than when you're at someone's house with other parents. I love that. I'm not going to pay attention to it when I'm not there. By the way, that goes back to what I'm saying about, I love boundaries, context. I mean, I just think we have, and I think it's a little bit my industry's fault. So I'm part of this. But if you think that there's a perfect way to do it. There's not. You're going to overdo it on everything. Two questions. One is based on why I wrote my book. How much do books like this that are targeted to four, five, six? So I've been so, especially with these guys sitting here, how old are you guys? 17. So the coolest thing by far in my life, over the last 10 years professionally, was how much of that person, you said something earlier and it kind of choked me up a little bit. I am so fortunate. There are plenty of cons to your point of social and digital and the world, and there are plenty of pros. One of the pros is how many 25 year olds have written to me books on how I was the person from afar with my content that really was that person for them. And it just like, you know, and especially I over indexed obviously in the 15 to 25 year old guy game, which really do need purple leaders. Are they like desperate to hear from a parenting expert? Yeah, you're going to be very surprised. Yeah, I'll tell you, this goes back to it like, nice guy's finished first was not something they were desperate to, but now they hear it so much from me. They're like, maybe, like, you know, like, yeah. Yeah, but the thing that I started to realize was, man, I want to go younger. Like, you know, I fell in, when I tell you, the path of realizing Jim Henson fascinates me heavily. Because the word that has not been brought up on this podcast yet that empowers parents to take a little pressure off their chest is intent. When I tell you the biggest thing I tell my friends, what I'm trying to get some of that anxiety off is, the intent matters. Back to kids, feel like back to what you were talking about. I so associate with that. If you actually intend for your child to love them and want good for them, the intention matters. This goes back to the thing I said about the horse man, bumper sticker. If your intent to parent your child is for yourself good, they'll smell it. If your intent, even if you're doing something in boundaries that they don't like, is that they can smell that it's coming from a good place. They will rest. They'll begrudgingly at the time act out, but when they're 25, they're gonna be like, dad, I gotta tell you, all those things, you know, like I hate you, that's how that works. That's why we need to sit down and figure out what our intentions are. Correct. So do you think like having propaganda that I want kids to understand like patience is beautiful, but if it's too much, it's, you know, it's delusional lack of activity and complacency and eagerness like the eagle is remarkable, but if you're sloppy and kill everything in your path for it, that's also not good. Do you think, I mean, I went literally literal with the title, meet me in the middle. Do you think even at that age, like those reinforcements are powerful? They're always powerful and also a parent reading that and living that is the most effective. Well, now I love you. The reason I wrote it and the way I wrote it and more importantly, the cartoons that come. You already said you loved me. I'm saying it again. I've cartoons coming out on YouTube Kids in the fall. Oh, that's so cute. And the way I wrote them, I realized on my team, like the way I influenced the copy, every episode is secretly trying to poke at a parent. It's gonna be super entertaining for five and six year olds, but when their parent walks by the iPad and they hear it, I'm trying to poke their zit. You want them in. The things you're talking about every episode, though visually and entertainingly is made for the five to 10 year old always has not. You know how at Disney movies, like of course, inside out I'm saying that. I'm so excited. Correct, like it's so funny. When I invented V Friends and I was like breaking down for someone, my friend was like inside out. And I was like, I hadn't seen that, I didn't know. And that's what got me to Jim Henson. I'm like so affected by him now, intent. Do you know what the brief was for Fragile Rock? No. Creative brief in the creation of Fragile Rock that was given. The normally briefs are very long. What we're trying to accomplish here is, right? Yeah. The entire brief was two words, end war. What? Intent. Oh my gosh. So to me that's like, when people ask me like, why are you doing V Friends? Like the NFTs, the trading cards, the books, the toys. I'm like to make the world purple. And that's why I went so literal with the first kids book. I think that's the parenting game. I really do. I agree. And this book, like the idea of parents getting that message and then getting a little more inspired in their day and hearing those words alongside kids, hearing those words is, you know. One last thing I wanna just say to everybody cause I feel this episode, I wanna be purple every day professionally, personally. And I have many days when I'm red or blue. Yeah. And that's okay. If you understand purple and strive for it, then you're gonna be 90% of the way there. Did you hear what Roger Federer said and the commencement speech he gave? He just gave a commencement speech a Dartmouth. I already did. But I know people are freaking out and they're happy with it. I don't know. I mean, I was like, I went there. I'm a joker guy. And so I always have a little bit of like a weird, I don't like Fed. I don't, I do. He's universally adored. I do can imagine, I know nothing about him other than I was proud of myself. He's universally adored and everybody loves him. Oh he is. And sports makes me not like him. I of course was like, why is my alma mater having like Roger Federer speak? And then I saw that he said in the 80%, he won 80% of his 1500s of odd games. And of those 80%, he only won 50. Is it games or matches? Oh, he won 80% of his matches, but games. He only won 50. He only points. He only won 54%. Makes sense. He said, if you are thinking of your fixating on the loss of the point, you're not in the next one. But he also said, each point you have to do as if it's the most important point in the world until you lose it and then move on. God, I love that. I thought that was good. It's very good. So now I like him. I get it. It makes me like him a little more too, which pisses me off. It's actually how I think about success. I take that three dimensional. If you think success is financial or admiration, you are wrong. It's peace of mind. And until, when I tell you, if we could ever God forbid, AKA meaning God willing, convince society that the binary definition of success is peace of mind, because boy are people confused. Nobody gives a crap about your private plane. Real talk. All that your private plane means to them is them feeling worse about themselves. I'm feeling worse about myself. I tell all my friends, like Gary, cause they post all this crap jewelry and cars. And they're like, no, it's inspirational. I'm like, you're full of crap. It's not inspirational. You want to talk about another thing with kids? Yeah. Give some real thought before you start posting your kids all over the place for likes. Agreed. Cause they're gonna grow up one day and be like, you used me as a tool for your social media growth. Yeah. It's a really hard one. I don't. Get a dog and use that. It's not yours to use. Correct. People ask me all the time, like, I don't know if they want it. Yeah. I agree. Thank you. Everybody please go and get the book. Thank you. The five principles of parenting. And meet me in the middle. Never done that before. That was fun. That was really fun. Thank you. This book. Thank you. Thank you. This book. Thank you. This book. Thank you. This book. Thank you. This book. Thank you. This book. Thank you. This book. Thank you. This book.
