## Transcript
Hey everybody, this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk and this is episode 236 of the Ask GaryVee Show. Music First and foremost, happy, happy, healthy, healthy New Year. Everybody is a really funny, it's like raining, but it's the New Year and we had this weird Monday off yesterday that I didn't really like, I still don't understand why it was a holiday. It seems like real soft culture. And then Penn State, Tyler's Crush, they lost a stunner. Like that made no sense in the whole math game now. Like they do on the Hispanic, 99.2% likely to win at one point yesterday. He's also wearing my earbuds. Why can't I put my earbuds? It's still in your head. Oh, you have a pair? I love that, good for you. Moving on up. See you're wasting your money wisely. Anyway, so we're doing the call-in stuff now. You got numbers? You feeling good? Alright, you can start on the first one. What we've done, if you didn't catch it in the last episode, is we've now changed the format of the Ask GaryVee Show. And what we're doing is we are doing a call-in show now, much more like drive time radio, where we are streaming live on Instagram and while they're setting up, let me talk about Instagram. You good? You can hit call. Go ahead, try and see what happens. What's person's name? Uh... Geo Soto. Geo? Okay. Live on Instagram, people are putting their phone numbers. Now we're just calling them randomly. Please have your questions ready. Hello? Missed call. Try again. Everyone. So the format with the live show is, put your phone numbers on Instagram live. We save them. We call. Have your questions ready, because last time we did this, we were struggling with that. And that's what we're kind of doing. So what I still want to talk about, Instagram, I've been so hot on it. And, D-Rock, when is the eBay flipping video coming out? I need to change that, actually. Can you record something real quick? By the way, I just changed my mind. It is $20,170. The $21,007, the $21,700 challenge means it's the year 2170. Yeah, I was like, what the hell? I was like driving Instagram. I was like, anyway, we're gonna have a $20,170 challenge. It is my belief, Ask Gary Vee Show listeners and watchers, that every person that is watching this can make $20,170 this year if they convert down time, that is bullshit time, that is either playing games on their phone or who the hell knows, house of cards, or even the Ask Gary Vee Show, and convert that into learning how to buy and flip stuff from dollar stores, thrift stores, and most of all, the $5,000 to $10,000 that's sitting in every single person's home, in their basement, their attic, their closet. Andy, how many pairs of shoes do you think you have in your apartment right now that you don't wear anymore? Three. Good, that is $64. 25. $25, their shitty shoes. Got it, you get ready? Go ahead, who is this? Matt. Matt? Yeah. I'm telling people who are sitting with real money complaining that they don't have $1,000 to buy ads on Instagram or Facebook, and that it's sitting in their closet. Matt? Yo. Matt? What's up? You are on the Ask Gary Vee Show. Dude, I fucking know I am, I'm pumped about it. Well good man, what's up, tell me about you. Nothing, I just graduated from the University of Kentucky a few weeks ago. Very nice. Well that is very ironic, did you follow Kentucky football? Yeah, yeah, for the most part, yeah, but I mean they weren't. I know, I know. But, I understand the SEC is tough and you guys are known for basketball. However, just moments ago, John Toth, the starting center, four year center for Kentucky football, projected second, third round pick, just signed with VaynerSports. Dude, no way. Yeah, he was just in the office with his family, great dude, huge. Dude that's amazing, that's amazing. Little fun fact for you brother. All right, what's your question? Yeah. Okay, so, whenever I first found you it was really, basically the main thing that attracted me to you was, I saw a part of me in yourself. Well you must be amazing. Yeah, you're telling me. So one of my big problems is, this isn't really a business question, I guess it could be. Go ahead, go ahead, take it wherever you want. Confrontation, so confrontation. You like it? No, I hate it. Me neither, I hate it too. That's why I knew that you would be like, Are you like me very aggressive in public settings, like content, like, do you think, so I think I'm a weird dude because on stage or even in these videos I've seen confrontational because I'm competitive and aggressive, but in real life I hate it. Oh dude, dude the fire is there, 100%. Like I'm all about it. So what's the question? Do you think it's a weakness or are you concerned about it? Like what's the punch line? I'm worried, I'm concerned on how you deal with confrontation with people whenever you aren't really sure. So like, for example. Yeah, let's go right to the details. Yeah, for example I've had an issue before where a best friend and my current girlfriend got into an argument together and it just like tore me apart. Like I didn't know how to deal with something like that. So I think one thing that I'll jump in because I wanna get some other calls in, I will say this, I think it's important for the people, so the people around me know that confrontation that has no value is a deal breaker for me. Like it was funny what raced through my head which is both my girlfriend and my best friend wouldn't have liked the way I would have dealt with it if it was not valid, if they were just, you guys are young people, like if it was just dumb shit that we were complaining about or having real confrontation about, I would have leveled up the, I would have had one conversation with both and said why are we fighting over our trip to Disney together? Like if it's completely meaningless, I would have created the context that it's meaningless. If it was something serious, then I would have, I made a decision on what I believe and the truth is the way I deal with confrontation and something you should think about is, I think it's a strength to not want to have negativity in your life and so I deal with it with one conversation and it's a one strike policy on confrontation with me in a world where I have 80 strikes and everything else and if they're not able to adjust to what matters to me and that, then I just kind of move on and I mean that by the way. Yeah, no, 100% I agree with the whole year. Just be fair with them, be fair, be empathetic, but like literally, unless you're madly deeply in love then she's the girl that you have to marry and I'm very aggressive with my friends. I didn't lose friendships over this by the way. This was a line in the sand that I created and so people realized they had to level up their emotional intelligence and actually what they cared about if they wanted to be around me. I really, I pressured my inner circle to care about things that mattered because so much shit is bad if you're willing to think about it that way or it's great if you're willing to think about it that way. I think it's great, I think it's good. It's ridiculous, it's even worse. Of course. It's even worse than it is in the adult world because they don't have a higher level of thinking and I think watching stuff really, really helps me. I have real bad news for you, youngster. Let's hear it. The college mentality trickles into 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70. Just because they're older doesn't mean they're any smarter about the way the world really works. You're so right, you're so right. All right man, take care. Love you, see you, bye. All right, give me another number. I mean that's it, D-Rock. I actually, in these breaks on the Ask RDB show as they set up the call, it's a good opportunity for me to just not interact with the person but add the bow. So here's what it is, my friends. Whether running a business, whether running your relationships, one of the things that's been fascinating to me is watching the evolution of the people that are closest to me, including this team. Watching Kourtney evolve over the next year is going to be super fascinating because I'm so aggressive around the emotional things that I care about. Like, Tyler, you care way less about things than you used to, right? And you have that skill, naturally. Oh, we got somebody? No. Okay, get your shit together, youngster. But you have to, I assume you have to now put things into context better than you did even though that was a strength of yours. Why? Because it's not time for it. I'm not sure. You just can't even get to it. Yeah, it's just you just realize what you should spend your time and energy on and what you shouldn't. And 99% of the stuff just doesn't matter to you. I love the quotes, I love the quotes. I mean, it is. You know, there is that piece of content I put out, like 99% of things don't matter and everybody hits me up in the comments and talks about what do you mean? Like, that's what I mean. I mean, like, you would be flabbergasted if you gave a lot of thought to how much time you spend on things that at a macro level aren't bringing any value. And I don't want to belittle the argument or the confrontation that a girlfriend or best friend at 20, you ready? At 22, have with each other. But I just, nine out of 10 times. Yo, this is Gary Vee and you're on the Ask Gary Vee show. The man. Thank you so much guys for calling me. You're welcome, what's your name? Carlos, Carlos Ramirez. Well, it's a real pleasure my friend. What can I answer for you? My question is, when you are setting up a startup, this is a pricing question. Would you go strictly trying to compete? Would you, how do you get that, you know, startup number if you're offering services or a product? Just go trying to be cheaper with a competition. If you have a better product, how, what's your thought on that? Yes. Do you understand? Yeah, completely. I got it. All of it. All of it my friend. Like everybody always asks me, Gary, I'm just starting out and I've got nothing and no business. Should I this and should I that or should I do this? And the answer is yes my man. If you were building a business that you wanna build and you want to support your life and family and have all the riches that entrepreneurship requires, well then you need to spend 18 hours a day. Is it a good idea to have a better product? Yes. Is it a good idea to have a service at a lower price than your competitors to give the person that is actually financially conscious the ability to go with you? Yes. Is it better for you to cold call 97 people versus six? Yes. Is it better for you to produce great content that reaches people through virality that is better than your competition so they know about your service? Yes. Is it better to hit up your grandfather cause he's friends with this guy who's got a business in the space and you're trying to reach? Yes. Is it better to put your phone number on Instagram Live to get on the Ask Gary Vee Show to get an answer? Yes. Everything goes. It's just like in lobby war everything goes. Let me give you a really good piece of advice and we're gonna end it on this. Never say no for the other guy. It's the best thing I ever told AJ. Don't make a decision for the other side of the table of why they're gonna say no. Just do everything and then let them say yes to the thing that they like. That's the answer I was looking for. Thank you so much. And by the way my friend, when you pitch people, mix it up. Sometimes come in with a lower price. Sometimes come in with bravado. Sometimes come in with humility. When you actually try to get to 97 people and you get 17 meetings, you actually get the chance to try 17 different moves. If you're like 99% of people and overthink everything and have one meeting a month and one at bat, you don't get the chances to try the different shit that might actually unlock what the real answer was. So you chop that strategy all the time to get just very close and stay with us. In life, if you have 97 chances and 11 people say yes, that's the game. Everybody's trying to play a game of I'm gonna get three chances and get three people to say yes and then three people say no and they cripple like a bunch of bitches. Yeah. Got it? Got it. Thank you so much. You're welcome. And that's it. Like that's the game. Like one thing I don't understand. So many of you are just starting out your shit and you're fucking fancy. Everybody got real fancy for having nothing. Like this entitlement or you're gonna have some perfect strategy. It's the grind. Of course you should come in cheaper. It's a way for you like when you have no reputation to get the gig, including free. D-rock, how much do you charge me for the first video? Zero. Bang. That's it. You know, Annie's mom was making fun of him for his salary. Like you know what I mean? Like that's it. You got a grind, right, Ant? My friends make fun of me for my salary in my 20s and 30s. You work all the time. I make more money than you. Now what, dick? Man. Like great, you won 1999. Hello. Congrats. Hello, this is Gary Vaynerchuk. You're on the Ask GaryVee show. Hey Gary, it's Alana. How are you? I'm well, how are you? I'm doing awesome. Thank you so much for everything that you're doing. And my question is actually in regards to your mother and the self-confidence that you've got you. I have three children. And if you can give me, I don't know, quick three things to help build their self-confidence, I'd appreciate it. So, here's, you know, I'm really trying to figure out this answer. So let me give you like just a whole like diary of the mouth of like the things that run through my mind, okay? Okay, shoot. The first thing my mom did, I'll talk about things my mom did and I'll talk about some of the ways I interpret it now that I have other things that I've looked at and thought about in having my own kids. She over-exaggerated when I did very kind and noble things. Like when I opened the door for a woman at McDonald's, I'll never forget this, in North Brunswick, when I opened the door for this woman, when I was like eight, and like was just being polite, and like she treated it as if I won the Nobel Peace Prize. So she went ballistic over the top on me being kind and empathetic and respectful. And so that was huge. The other thing she did was she never did that though, when it was an actual life thing. So like when my baseball team lost, my baseball team lost. When I got these NF's on my report card, even though she knew I was gonna be successful, she punished me. So she didn't give out eighth place trophies in a world where that would be the way the world worked, right? But she just genuinely made me feel like I was unstoppable and like was capable of anything that I wanted to do and she believed it. And because she believed it and she instilled it constantly, it was constant offense, right? And so I just think that you need to look at your three kids, you need to audit them, you need to figure out what they're strong at, and you need to make 98% of the conversation around the things that they're strong at. Awesome. Instead of doing what almost every other parent does, which is spend 85% on the 2% they're not, spend 98% on what they are. Love it, awesome. Every parent worries about some kid trying like, you need to be better at math Sally. No, she doesn't. Like, do you know what I mean? Like she needs to be capable. Like you'd probably like your kids to be able to count, right? Right. But they don't need to be a fucking geometry whiz. Especially if they gravitate towards humming 28 hours a day. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Absolutely. Like do me a favor, don't listen to, the biggest thing that hurts parents is they listen to other parents, they listen to other teachers, they listen to the market, and those people don't know your kids. Right. It's you and your kids against the world, do you understand? Right. And too many parents think it's the world versus their kids. Well said. Yeah. So that's it, audit them, really try to figure them out, and don't think of cliches of like, if they spend all their time on the phone, good news. The phone's the future of the way everything will work in life. Do you know what I mean? Absolutely. But make them respect. If you're gonna give them that gift of tripling down on their strengths and allowing them to flourish in that world, make them respect the alternatives. They don't have to pander to it, but they have to understand why it exists. Some kids need school structure. Some kids aren't gonna be whiz kid entrepreneurs. Like some kids path is to become a lawyer and make 130,000 a year. Some kids, cheese, some kids are just gonna make 40,000 a year and work at Walmart, and that's okay too, but they need to get a high school degree to get that job. Like know your kid. And make every one of your kids feel great about what they're gonna be. AJ felt great because he was the best student in the family. I felt great because I was the most entrepreneurial and charismatic. My sister felt great because she was absolutely the feistiest and had the strongest will. Like make them feel great about their thing. Don't make them feel bad that they're not the star athlete or the nerdiest or can make money. Just build self-esteem. Yeah, let them teach us. 100%. But as long as they understand, like check some balances, got it? Yep, got it. Awesome, love you. See ya, you're welcome. Thank you so much. Bye bye. You're good. What's that? Cool, let me get bang out to one more question. We'll do a four person one. So far, big shout out to everybody in the community. The fact that everybody's getting right into their questions. I think we're gonna get our cadence down with this. I'm gonna figure out how to do the gaps in between these. And I think we're gonna have a nice little show. I like this. You like this? Bless you. It's good, right? Who's this? Hello? Hey, this is Gary Vaynerchuk and you're on the Ask Gary Vee Show. Oh, what's up, dude? What's up, dude? What's your name? Roberto, my name's Roberto. Real pleasure, man. What can I answer for you? So I got a quick question. I started detailing here in New York. It's going really good. Is detailing like car stuff, you mean? Yeah. Okay, keep going. Like, you know, I deal with a lot of high end cars doing coatings and stuff like that. Yep. And it's really growing quickly. The only thing is during the winter, it's closed down a lot. So I was trying to figure out how I'm 26. Are you married? No. Good, go to Florida in the summer, in the winter. Okay. I've thought about that also, but. Don't think. I'll have a lot of clients out here. Well, of course, build clients in Florida now. I've thought about trying to attack other things. By the way, that's, by the way, that's, and here's what's the great thing about this show and having a calling show. Like, if this was just something we took from Twitter, that'd be my answer, and we'd all move on our merry way. But this is why I like the call in, because let's keep talking. Do you want to do, listen, flip shit on eBay and Craigslist and Etsy. You can make 50K. Like, I don't know, like, it depends. If you want to triple down on your detailing capabilities, build a brand during the winter months in Arizona or Florida, and actually go down there and live in an Airbnb at first, or whatever, and figure it out, and hustle and grind the same way you did. If you are okay with having other entrepreneurial things during those winter months, you're more than welcome to, I don't know, start a snow removal business, or a winter landscaping strategy business, or buying stuff at the dollar store and flipping it for nine bucks. And like, the truth is, reverse engineer yourself. If it's going really well, a couple things are going. The word of mouth is kicking in, which means that you actually detail very well, and you have that skill. I mean, do you love detailing? No, of course I do. No, but do you really love it? No, yeah, I really do. So, dude, I've got to be honest. I've been doing it for a while now. So let me tell you, Roberto, I think a lot of people don't think macro enough, and it doesn't even cross their mind to actually go live somewhere else for four months of the year. I know how that's weird, but in the days of Airbnb, and the days of Craigslist, and the day, you know, these were decisions that were made years ago, pre-internet, when it was hard to have somebody live in your house for four months, and you had a mortgage. Like, you can, dude, do you know that you could actually, if you were really good at this, and if you're watching, if you're here right now, that means you're paying attention to me, let me give you a real good pe- Do you rent an apartment? Like, what's your living situation? Yeah, I'm renting right now. Dude, the fact that you could probably re-rent your apartment to somebody for four months, using Airbnb or other things, I know there's laws and all that, but stick with me here. Where do you live? I'm in New York, standing on New York. So like, the fact that you could do that, take the profit, and then pay for your living situation in a warm weather place where the numbers are different, that covers your entire cost, and it's all upside for you to grind and continue your craft 12 months a year? Do you know how good that is? Yeah, I've actually been thinking about that, but I never took action on it. Yeah, well, dude, why do you think so many people lose? Everybody's got comments. It's real fun to leave your two fucking cents on my Instagram post. How about the people that are actually doing shit? Yeah. So fucking go. All right. No, don't write me. Like, will you promise me as a man, handshake to handshake over a telephone call that you're gonna do it? Oh, definitely. I definitely will. I've had plans, I've already been thinking about it. I've been following other people. So, I mean, it's definitely something I've thought about. Lently, actually, you know what? Now I've got vested interest. I've got emotional about this. What's been holding, like, be straight honest with me. What has held you back from doing it? Because what held me back was me trying to build it here. Like, even more, like getting more clientele, getting into a bigger shop. And I've also been working with trying to move that into houses. The coding basically protects, like, the car. It's like a glass holding once it cures. I see. And what they do is they just uninstall that in houses. So that's what I'm trying to get right now. By the way, I'm not against that either. I mean, just weigh the options of, like, take this winter, we're in it now. Like, hang up the phone and get to action. Make a binary decision. Are you going all in on trying to go to houses and, like, work your ass off knocking on doors trying to get people to do it? Running Facebook ads? Or are you gonna get down to Florida or Arizona on February 1st and take three months and do it there? Just make a decision. Do me a favor. Just don't think. Think one time for one hour. Make a decision and go. You got it. All right, brother. Robert, I'm telling you right now, I'm saving this phone number. I'm gonna track you. If I fucking see your ass pondering on February 17th, I'm gonna lose my shit. All right. I'm gonna block you to not allow you to consume anything I put out. You got it. All right, brother. I like this show. 236? Guys, episode 236 in the bag. You keep asking questions. I'll keep answering them. Phone calls. The call-in show is well underway. This is how we now do Ask Gary Vee. Have a great, great, great, great 2017. Good. I don't wanna do intro with this format. Just go rent it.
