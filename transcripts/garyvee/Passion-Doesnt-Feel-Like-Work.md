You know, it's not like just because you love football or hip-hop or roses that you're entitled to build a million dollar business around that. Passion is massively important. I'll tell you why. Work ethic is an absolute pillar of variable to being successful. And if you're passionate about something, it doesn't feel like work. And that's a big deal. Like, if you feel like, if you're working on your side hustle from 6 to 2 in the morning, 6 p.m., 7 p.m., right? And you're not up for it. Like, you're forcing yourself because you need the money or the dream you've fucked up. You picked the wrong thing. Like, to punt all your leisure and all your friends and family and to work on something and to be tired the next day because you have to get up for work, which you really don't want to do, which is why you're building your side hustle, that has to be about your passion. Because it's just too hard if it's not. It can't be about where you think you can make the most money. What I don't think people understand is you can make a lot more... Like, there's a lot... So, I will crush it a long time ago. The emails that I get, I get way more people that are making 50 to 200,000 a year talking about the craziest... Like, the emails I get are so bananas. Like...

I've had a lot more people make money deep, deep, deep in the longest tail niche that you could have ever thought of. Hip-hop stars from 1986 to 1989. This is a real one. There's a guy who only talks about hip-hop from 86 to 89 because he was in high school during those years. And now he's like... Now he gets paid like $5,000 to $10,000 a month retainer to do hip-hop consulting for companies. That came from the content he was putting out. He's stopped being an accountant. I mean... Right? But the people that are losing are... I tried to build an affiliate marketing company. I tried to do $500 e-books. They went for the money. They had no patience. The hip-hop guy and the Raspberry Jam girl and this guy had years of nobody giving a shit before we popped. I did Y-Library TV for two years with crickets. Crickets. What kept you going during that time? Because I knew I was right.
