I was streaming for like three or stinoxly and then I lost PC. Bro, you don't need a fucking PC. OK. What do you think the PC is doing for you? I just felt like I was being able to give more value.

Like to me, where I am, my career, 512 people right now is like having one person on. The only fear you have is the fear of being insecure of people's judgment. I give zero fucks about how many people judge how many people are watching right now. Because the new medium with a lot of friction from my audience. And that's OK. Like I'm building black block by block. And if I can help one person in this show, you right now to go on, the only thing you fear is having three people on. Well, I'm live.

They were like that I would read over. I would be able to show them crypto. Do you not? You're not sure you do not have you not have the money for a new PC? Not at the at the moment.

This special night of Q and A streaming and not fucking set the fucking tone to have a good night? We're buying you a piece, bro. Wow. Wow. Dude. Oh my gosh, bro. Oh, oh, let's go. Oh, oh, oh.

Get off the show. We got so many people that fucking answered. I love you. Yeah. You're the best you've accomplished. You don't even have to debate if it needs to be on a phone or a PC. You just got a free fucking PC. You're straight up. Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it so much. You're welcome. All of you on Instagram, you better get the fucking twitch.tv slash Gary V right now because you can't get on the show. Bullshitting on fucking Instagram. Get over to Twitch right now. Stop fucking around. You're not even seeing the whole fucking scene. You should see the chat. I don't want to fucking hear. I don't have Twitch. It's called go to the fucking app store and download Twitch and create a fucking username. Allie. Scary. Yes. Allie, you have a lot of clothes. I do. It's called Allie's closet. I love it. Good for you. Hey, thank you. You have inspired. Oh, real quick. Allie, I apologize for nerving. How do people get on the show? They leave exciting comments here. If you see something that you like, tell them to send a message, aka whisper to team Gary V. Okay. So if I like something, so everyone's going to say I have a question, colon and their question. Abby's going to watch the questions for me because I'm focused on Allie and everybody on. So from now on, all now we got a thousand, the thousand people that are on. If they want to ask a question, they'll say I have a question, then they'll ask for a question. Hashtag, I have a question, colon, then they'll ask the question. Carly, Abby, you like you'll pay attention. You'll, as I'm talking to people, you'll say, I got a question for you. I'll be like, what? I'll tell you if I like it, you have a sense of me. Then we'll throw them in. Fair enough. Allie. Gary. All right. So five years ago, you inspired me to take a leap of faith and build my own business. I 10 next, xed it. From a Facebook group to what I now have and have been running for the last year, which is Allie's closet.store where I buy and resell Patagonia, North Face, Lululemon and Viore. We grew like 30,000 followers on the Facebook group. And since Facebook groups, like lack of efficiency and sustainability, like it was really hard work. I was, my husband was more like my roommate and not, not my husband. So I was like, I got to change it. So last year I built a website. Last, it'll be the anniversary on the 21st of February. And I'm running into some problems. I am finally plateauing and my net profits are going down like 30% a month. I've tried doing what you suggest the posting multiple times on, I've got my checklist Facebook. Are you on TikTok live and doing TikTok shop? I can't do TikTok shop because I have name brands like Patagonia, North Face and Lululemon. But I just for the first time have my TikTok reach like 50,000 views on one of my videos. So here, rack in your brain. I want you to go on TikTok live. TikTok live is one of the great opportunities right now. I'm pushing hard and only a thousand people are on right now. If I went on TikTok live right now in 15 minutes, I'd have a thousand people on and 80% of them would not even know who the fuck I am because Instagram when you go live, like I just did right now, I have 567 people on Instagram live. I'm about to hang up on them. So they go to Twitch. So Instagram, get your shit together. Go to twitch.tv slash Gary V. If I went on TikTok, I would start with 300. When you go live on Instagram, they hit up all your followers. So right away I get 2000. And then it goes down to 600 like it is right now on Instagram. I go on and it starts putting my live into people's for you. And so if I'm on for an hour or two, I'll look up and I'll have 2000 people, 80% of which don't know me. Everyone's job here is to get discovered. Why would you want something to go viral? Because more people find out about you. The number one way to get discovered right now is TikTok live. I want you to go TikTok live and entertain people. You don't even have to do full integration on TikTok shop. TikTok live, not TikTok posts. TikTok live. I want you to go live and I want you to go live for three hours a day. Okay. Figure it the fuck out. I'll have to quit my part time teaching job. Respect on that. So you have that. So give me an hour a day. Okay. An hour a day where you go on live and you do your fucking thing. And I see T-Fam, TV for say, holy shit, three hours. When I see three hours or I say 50 pieces of content a day, I'm just saying as many as you can. Ali, I've started to notice that I have pep muscles. Why did this happen? Because a year ago I decided I was going to do 100 pushups a day, no matter what, even if I was in the gym or when I was traveling. And because I did it, I'm seeing visual response. Had I not done it, I wouldn't. If you put in an hour of TikTok live, you're going to get an hour of TikTok live results. If you put two hours of TikTok live, you'll get two hours of TikTok live results. But TikTok live right now is what everybody follows me for, which is insights to where's the arbitrage of opportunity. By the way, we're all 1000 of you right now. I expect all of you to share this link in your family group chat on Twitter, in your discord. Please share this link right now and say you're fucking missing it. GaryVee has given out gems for free. By the way, if you have a question for me and you want to be on the show right now, hashtag, leave a comment in Twitch, hashtag, I have a question, Colin, and then ask your question. The team's looking for it and we'll pick best questions. Ali TikTok live is going to grow you. Thank you guys. And yes, Ali's closet, we beat North Face Renewed, Patagonia Warnware, and Lulu Like New. And we make sustainable shopping as fun as we can. So thank you so much, Gary. The plug at the end. I'm impressed, Ali. Woohoo! Let's move it on. It's in my DM. It's not a SS Stout 123 first time chatter. Big shout out to Gamer underscore ODZ first time chatter. By the way, there's 1000 people in here that are getting ads. A tier one sub gets you out of abs. Ads, excuse me, not abs. I'm looking for abs. I know that a lot of you buy gifted subscriptions on Twitch. Who's generous tonight and wants to gift some subs to the thousand here that are going to be hanging out with us. And they may miss the best part of my answer because a fucking ad pops up, Dustin. And so I think some of the OGs need to jump in here. I just bought a $3,500 computer. I think some people in here could buy a fucking subscription. Who's feeling super gifty? Oh, Bryson's about to raid. Is Bryson raiding? Oh, I love a Bryson raid. All right, let's do it. Bryson raid. I see it now. It's coming in. It feels like, oh, we're here. Big shout out to fucking Bryson. Vader sports, motherfucker. Okay, okay. Andre, that's good. Too good. I feel like I'm a little concerned, Andre. I think I'm enjoying this way too much in the first 20 minutes. And I have a feeling my evenings and mornings are vulnerable because I feel like I'm going to do this a lot, especially when people raid me. When I get fucking raided, I get really crazy. Yeah, I'm going to be vulnerable now to my highs racing. This is incredible. I'm right here for you. Thank you so much for having me on. Let's do it. So I'm Andre based in the UK. Okay. I run my own startup and have been for the last seven years alongside full time work. It's been intense. I've sacrificed a lot. I gave up that job, not that job, the startup. I paused it last year because I kind of got headhunted for a role to do the same thing. They couldn't say no to was paying you a lot more. Yeah. Yeah. How old are you? 32. Amazing. So you're a child. Absolutely. So yeah, I put down pause on to throw myself into this new role. So I work in a university in the UK and I promote mental, physical and social health. That's what I've been doing my startup. And I wanted to bring everything that I learned from yourself and from running my business into that. So I spent a few months building up a proposal around a new social media presence and the things we could do with that to improve student well-being overall. And because my kind of service has no marketing professionals, it's really difficult to explain the impact of value-driven content and different social media channels. So that proposal actually got rejected and I'm stuck. I can't use social media. So my question to you is, I made it for the long run. I want to do this justice. If you couldn't use social media, how would you engage with Generation Z? That's like asking me if I couldn't drink water, how would I fulfill my thirst? How the fuck are you going to reach Gen Z without fucking social media? Tell me about it. I tried hard. Three months I put into a proposal and got rejected. I was stumped for months. So now the question becomes, you decide to just bullshit it because the pay is worth it for you right now? I've sat for the last lot in the seven years. So stability is important to me now. Correct. I'm about to go there. Don't judge yourself. Just do this for a couple of... Bro, when I was 32, ask me what I was doing when I was 32. What were you doing at 32? I was stocking shelves in the liquor store. Do not beat yourself up if you need three or four years for the financial stability that the job is currently doing for you. On the flip side, understand that I don't have a fucking answer for you when it's impossible to achieve the goal. That's nuts because I've been stumped. I didn't know what to do. It's okay to read a lot. Don't live life fake. I know you talk about like social media for went yesterday. What would you do in that scenario? I'm looking at... One more time, brother. You talk a lot about if social media went down this like yesterday. Well, the problem is if social media got banned around the world right now, all of Gen Z and Gen Alpha and Gen X and millennials and boomers would have to go somewhere. Let's all make pretend it all went away. Well, we'd all watch television and listen to Spotify and like we'd have to do something. That's not the situation you're in. Social media has not got away and you're trying to reach Gen Z and they only live on social media. So what you're doing is playing a fake game. I would run pre-rolls on YouTube. I'd run pre-roll ad videos on YouTube. If I need to say that, I can only have an unlisted YouTube. Yeah, it sounds like you work at a bullshit fucking place. Yeah, large organizations realize now they're hard to change. No shit. I run a fucking ad agency that works with only large organizations and they're fucking struggling with relevance because they live in fucking yesterday. But that doesn't mean you should beat yourself up and think you're a bad man for the next three years while you collect that paycheck and you just make the most out of like your dog shit situation. So keep fighting until I don't have to. Well, I can be wrong. You got to keep over communicating that there is no way to reach Gen Z outside of... I mean, Gen Z doesn't even fucking use Google for search to use TikTok. What the fuck am I supposed to do? All right. That helps. Here's why it should help. If you leave this call not beating yourself up and playing some sort of fake game, like there's some answer. And if you don't beat yourself up for being okay, for working here for three years to collect the paycheck because you need to save some money for stability and then you can do your next thing, then you've left here in a good fucking game. To be honest, you taught me that perspective for a long time now, which is why I'm still in the same role and I haven't left. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of the patience you taught me. So thank you very much for that game. I appreciate it. Who's next? Yeah. Who's... What's up, brother? What's your name? Andy Gillersleeve. How are you doing? Andy, it is such a fucking player. Pleasure. It's a pleasure. You're a player too. You look like a player. So I'm out here in Jijón, Spain. I went to the culinary institute of America in New York, but I switched careers. Like I graduated the culinary institute in my early 30s. And I moved out here with my wife and we got residency, which is lovely. And in the meantime, I kind of had to do some consulting work, which ended up kind of becoming a full-time gig with recipe writing and creating content for like newsletters and things like that, which I really, really love. And also doing some videos on TikTok. And I love your messaging with social media. I guess one of my questions was, do you think as someone that's either a consultant or someone that's providing a good or a service, do you think it's important to give away some of your content for free when you're starting out, whether it is as much as humanly possible? Yeah, got you. Advice is not free. Advice is not valuable when it's general. Right. Bro, there's nothing you would say in a TikTok that somebody else hasn't said before. Absolutely. Now I do mostly cooking videos. I don't give a shit. I also have I have 126 followers. You know, this is that's better than zero. Yeah, sure. Give away everything as humanly possible for free. That is what I do. Look at the do you understand what I'm doing right now? Dude, this is amazing. This is this is absolutely incredible. It's so like, like I have a company that like there's clients that pay like $150,000 for an hour of my time. I'm just sitting here doing like, I get it. Give away for free, bro. It's how you get love. It's how you bring value. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. Give us as much as you can, bro. Gotcha. I love you. Good luck. Thank you so much. Yeah. Let me know if you're in New York. I'm like hitting up all these food influencers yesterday on Instagram at like midnight to come to Little Maven. I'll let you know. New York. You got to come to New York. I'm in New York. What bro? Pee hon. Let's like drink some wines. Like let's go. Go bro. Check out some alvaro and drink some real fucking Spanish fucking ham too. Yeah. No, we're doing ham on beo da iberico all day. Let's fucking go. Yeah. Seriously. I got real real. I got real Rioja that I'll never get to without it. So come when you're around. Check it out. Yeah. I will. Thank you, bro. Yeah. Everybody's watching. If you have a question you want to be on the show, put in the Twitch chat. Hashtag I have a question colon and a question. Ladies, anything stand out for you yet? Do you want to have a mentalist or a magician read your mind? No. He or she can have their own channel for that. I want real questions from real people that I want to really fucking sell for. All right. All right. Keep looking. The questions are going to come in now. Let's get to our next question. These hats I'm bringing tonight that nobody's going to be able to get because there's such a limited run is going to be a fucking thing. This is an ambitious angel. Look at that fucking angel. Look at this fucking ambitious motherfucker. Amalia. Amila, you're on mute, baby. Amela, I'm sorry. Amela, I'm I apologize. I'm still in the select six. No, it's all right. I'm just so excited. How are you doing? I can. How are you? I'm just so excited to meet you. I've been I went to the pod con and I thought that I was going to be able to see you, but you wasn't there, but it was still a pleasure to see you. Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry. I know it was when they put up the ads for a day and made people feel like I was going to be there. I text the wall. I'm like, yo, don't fuck me up. I'm going to be on this. Yeah, anyway, it was really dope though. Very, very. I was sitting in the front and I was willing. Yeah, definitely. I was just coming to get some type of like information from you. I was looking into like starting a podcast of my own. I'm working a part-time job right now and I'm just like every day waking up thinking about starting my own podcast. It's been like for the last three and a half years, but I'm at work. What are you thinking about? How to start. Do you know what to do? Like, do you have the general basics of like, how do you record an audio? How do you upload it to Spotify and app? Do you have that sense? No, I don't. Okay. So I'm just like putting one foot in front of the other. It's a great. Yeah, no worries. That's why I'm here. I'm here for this reason. Literally go to Google after today and type in how do I upload an audio file to a podcast? Okay. The amazing thing about Google and YouTube is it's there for all of us at 101. Okay. You know, like for some people, like I realized that like my so as hurt. That's a muscle, right? So I was like, how do I stretch my so as enter? I didn't know. Okay. And you don't know how to do a podcast. Good news. Literally type in in YouTube and an end or Google. Maybe you read better. I'm more audio and video. Yes. So if you're more audio and video, go to YouTube. If you're more reading, go into Google and type in how do I upload an audio file for a podcast? How do I post my first episode of a podcast? Whatever your question is, it will show you the answer. Okay. That's it. All right. How did you get comfortable? Like I'm so like, because I don't know people making fun of me. And it's crazy for me. Like I'm the opposite. Like I feel like I can do like public speaking. I can talk talk to anyone. I come across like daily, even at work at home, people calling my phone or I'm at work, people like talk to me on like casual conversations, but they just be like basic. But then it goes into them telling me like personal business. Yeah. And then I think in the back of my personality, that makes people feel warm to you. Right. Right. So then I think in the back of my head like, wow, this person is telling me their personal business, but I can do this in person. But for it's like recording, I really get like stuff where I'm like, uh, what do I do now? What do I say now? What do I say next? Things like that. Just ask questions. Okay. How are you feeling? What's wrong? What's on your mind? Okay. When you feel stuck as a podcast host, ask questions, ask basic questions. Okay. What most upsets you? What fucks you up the most? Okay. What are you about? Okay. What's on your mind? That's it. Okay. Oh, I think it's a different thing. I think you're worried about the judgment. Most people don't start because they worry about judgment. You can say that. Yes, for me. Yes. I don't want to be in garland. Honestly, here's my thing on that. Like who gives a fuck? Right. Winners don't judge because they're worried about their shit and lose their judge and what the fuck are you worried about losers for? Right. Winners don't judge. I'm not spending time worried about you doing well on your podcast. Okay. Losers who have misery loves company. They're the ones that are going to tell you your podcast sucks because they got time to tell you that to tell you. I ain't got time to tell you. I'm in it. Yeah, I'm busy. Exactly. People are out here not living their dreams because they're worried about other people who are losing judging them. Right. We need to get off that shit. I think that's not even fair. 100%. And you know, the problem is the people we're most worried about is the people in our fucking family. Right. Absolutely. Your uncle, your mama, your brother, like fuck. Yes. And I'm a young good of six. So. Yeah. And those five above you got fucking things to say. Yeah. You're absolutely right. My big thing is like, yo, fuck you, big bro. I live in my life. Why don't you worry about your shit? Why can't you keep a job, motherfucker? Don't worry about my podcast, motherfucker. Absolutely. Absolutely. One more question before I end it with you. How do I look for like I've been on Amazon as well looking for like podcasts equipment. Do you know like the best brands and like investors? I'm sorry. I'm on what on Amazon? Like podcast equipment. Do you know like the best brain to like invest equipment is bullshit. Okay. Okay. Period. I know my team's got stuff. I fucking did. I had no lighting. I had no mics. I did a thousand episodes of Wine Library TV in my daddy's fucking liquor store. I had no fucking equipment. I had a $300 bullshit camera from best fucking buy. Quit. Quitman's another excuse. To not. To not. That's it. Beautiful. I love you for that. Period. Equipment is the cliche excuse to not start. I don't know how is the other one. It's called Google. Right. The thing that's stopping you is your five siblings, your mom, your dad, your plus one, your kids, like people. People. Period. When someone says, yo, why are you wasting your time with that podcast ain't no one listening anyway. You look them dead in the face and says, my podcast has nothing to do with your fucking life. Fuck you. Absolutely. I thank you so much for this and I'm so, so, so happy I got to talk to you. I'm happy we got to talk to you. Tonight's a good night for me too. I love all of you. I wish I could get a thousand of you. Oh, get to who we can. Let's keep it going. We'll talk. So let's get the next question. You want to be in the show? Do you have anything you like? Fine. Bye-bye, John. Yeah. This is a good one. How do you fold space for people vending to you about their problems, without their problems affecting your mood? Beautiful. Get that person in the fucking ghetto. Who is that? Kiara. Kiara, you're about to come on the show. All right. Give me one before Kiara and then Kiara's next. PR King of Hearts. What's good, my guy? Yo, PR. The King of Hearts. What's good? We're going to move on to the next one. We'll get somebody else. Sorry, PR. He had all that equipment. The shit doesn't fucking work. Coach Ant, what's good? Gary, man, first and foremost, man, I got to give you your flowers, man. I mean, honestly, I learned so much from you over the years. You know, I'm a professional boxing coach. I've been working with professional fighters, MMA fighters, UFC fighters, everything, but then I also went ahead and moved it online. And I have a YouTube channel. I do all that stuff online. Now, and a lot of the stuff that I do from Instagram and all that is from learning, basically by trying to mirror and mimic what I see you doing. I mean, that's as basic as I can get. I can say it all. Bro, I read, I get a thousand these DMs a month. I say it all the time. Watch what I'm doing. I'm focused on live right now. You should be focused on live. I'm focused on fucking LinkedIn. You should like, it's, thank you for saying that. It's my greatest joy watching people follow my moves and get their fucking, you know, get their wins from it. Real quick though, I apologize. There's a high train. There's also people asking for subs because people are fucked up with these ads. I saw Pokescoot get in there and give some. Who's at the top of this? Ginger's giving some subs. We need some fucking, we need gifted subs in here. Go ahead, coach. That's crazy. It's crazy because I've been around, you know, some of the, you know, highly touted athletes. I'm freaking starstruck talking to you, man. It's crazy, man. How much I respect you, man, but I'm, right. A couple of things, man, real quick, man, you know, I see that you're pushing over to Twitch. I see that you're pushing over to Twitch. You know, I do obviously on Instagram, I could teach instruction, teach people how to slip, jab, jab, jab, right hook, right hook. Go all after you, all I could do all that stuff on, on Twitch. I mean, on, on TikTok, I could do that on Instagram, YouTube shorts. But I see the, the push to Twitch. I think live streaming is where social media was 10 years ago. 10 years ago, 2014, social media was already known. It had come out for like seven years, but people were underestimating how big it was going to be. I was on Twitch when it was just in dot TV. I've done live when it was on Ustream, but I feel like we're in this moment where we're on the precipitous of many different ways of being on live, right? Meaning I feel like I, for example, for everybody's tuned in, I'm here every day that I'm in the office and we're live in the office and I'm unmuting and talking to you, I'll unmute all thousand of you. I expect you here tomorrow. Let's hang out, work with me. This is like my big new genre, the work with me behind the scenes. Just come and hang with me while I'm in the office. Video game players, streamers, like cuts, you know, like all those people like Aiden Ross, all that, like that genre is known, but a businessman that's really running a $400 million company with 2000 employees, just chilling in his office, taking meetings all day. People don't think that's right. Just like people didn't think you could do anything besides TikTok dancing if you're on TikTok. But I was telling everybody, no, you can do other shit. I think all of us can be live doing whatever the fuck we do. I believe one of the most famous people in America could be a gardener who's just live gardening. So like I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, no, I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, I'm just saying. So, so for instance, like me, let's just say I'm not, um, coaching a fighter or something like that. I decided to go live on Twitch. Like what would like, how would you like, if you were a boxing coach, how would you approach the whole Twitch thing? Because I understand on Instagram, you can go live. TikTok, you can go live. YouTube, you can go live. How would you approach? First of all, which is hard. TikTok is the opportunity. Okay. TikTok live is just going to put you in front of people. And I would just look at the camera and talk. Okay. All right. Um, TikTok is different. You got to understand, TikTok's different than everything. Because the longer you're online, the more they're going to put you in people's streams to discover you. No other platforms doing that. So it goes up slow, right? TikTok goes up slow. Cause I've been on TikTok where I feel like nobody's there and then out of nowhere, like people start showing up. Is that just how that algorithm works? It's just, Yes. The biggest reason I think that- So just like you're at zero for five minutes and then out of nowhere or just pop in. Well, maybe not you wouldn't know, but I know. No, I know too, bro. I know that there's only 568 people on my Instagram right this second. And it was 2000, the second I went live, it goes down because it pings your users and then goes down. TikTok, the longer you're on, the more they're putting you in random people's for you page and you get discovered. So you would just go live. I think it's not out to Wes Martin who just said, who's this guy? I don't know if he's talking about me or you, but we're just some dudes, Wes. Thank you for fucking being here. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't really go live on TikTok. I've seen you tell the young lady to go on there for three hours straight. So again, you just like it as simple as place the camera up, put it in your office, whatever you're doing. What the work? Listen to music, look at the thing, answer boxing questions. I don't fucking know. Go fucking food shopping and put on your fucking forehead. Live is next. Live has been going, just like social has been going, but it's on, I feel like it's not next. It's not like I'm saying something nobody's ever heard before. I think live's about to explode. I agree. We're tired of the same fucking clips on social. Lives are different medium. Now a question about stories on Instagram, like a Instagram story, what I'm noticing is I don't know what gets in front of the, in front of my audience on stories, right? I'll post something, five, 10,000 views. I'll post something, 100, 200 views. Is there a strategy or a simple method that you feel that Instagram pushes stories? You need, it's all about compelling shit. The more shit you put out that the first 50 people that see it love it, the more likely you're going to reach more people. Okay. So not that many people saw it because they just didn't. Because the first 100 people that saw it thought it was wack. Got it. All right. Fair enough. Good. One thing, I'm in Jersey, man. Can I, can I get you a boxing session? Can I give you a boxing session, man? You might be able to send me an email. Gary at VaynerMedia. Come on, man. Let me train you, man. I'm in Jersey. I'm in Cherry Hill. Dude, you're not in Jersey. You're in fucking Philly. That's a hundred years from here. You're in fucking Jersey. Cherry Hill is fucking Philadelphia, motherfucker. I'm in four hours against you. I'm from New York City, though. I just live here. Don't get me. You're not Jersey shit. You're in fucking Philly, bro. I know Jerry Hill. All right. Thank you, Gary. We'll talk soon. All right. Who we got? Who just came up? Rainage, Twitch. Thanks for Gary. Mocktail. Let's go. Mocktail mom is in the building. Let's clap it up for Mocktail mom. Emily, how are you? My gosh, I'm great. How are you, Gary? I'm well. Fire away. Yeah. So what are the three top qualities that you look for in a person professionally and then also just with friendships? I think empathy is the first thing I'm most attracted to. Just one have the capacity to care about other people. It's huge for me. Two, I'm a very big fan of optimism. I am shocked how many people think this glass is empty. Do you know how many fucking people I know think this glass is empty? And then meanwhile, me. Are you okay? Was that a good one? Was that so good that your phone? It's actually propped up on a base of my mom's for when she was alive and it just the phone just swids. So sorry about that. Was your mom a big fan of optimism? No, clearly. I'm trying to honor her because she's not here anymore, but. Respect. I'm jumping in and making it easy for it. Look, I'll go. I'll be vulnerable and talk about my mom. If there was one drop of water in here, she would be optimistic. And my father, who's changed a lot in the last decade, but 20 years ago, this full cup, he would find reason of what's wrong in between this tippy top and this part. So I'm very big on empathy. I'm incredibly big on optimism. The thing that I'm most visceral to is all the people in the chat here. Big shout out to scuba Steve who just bought a bunch of tier one subs. The people here who are cynical by default, pessimistic by default, because they're emotionally not strong and it's easier to be that way. I struggle with that. So I need optimism. I need empathy. And I would say the third thing that I really appreciate is accountability. I think that way too many people in the world right now are pointing figures on blaming people. It's my mom's fault. It's my dad's fault. It's my ex-husband's fault. It's my ex-wife's fault. It's my brother's fault. It's my sister's fault. It's my boss's fault. It's Biden's fault. It's Trump's fault. Like it's the media's fault. It's social media's fault. Everything is, everybody's gotten addicted to pointing fingers. We completely lack accountability. And so for me, it's empathy. It's optimism and it's accountability. Well, I just thank you so much for the level of kindness and empathy that you do have for people all over the world. It has really touched my heart for years. And I just want to thank you because that to me is what's most important. You know, I'm raising my eight-year-old son, Cody. And that's what I instill in him every day is just to be as loving and kind as he can be to all people, no matter what they're doing in life and what their spiritual beliefs are. And my biggest dream was to become a mom. And I told my son on the way to school today, your story about your jets jersey, how your mom made you one. My son didn't know who you were until this morning. I had you on in my car, taken to school. And I told him about it and his whole face lit up. I told him the exact story about how your mom knitted you that when you were young. And you guys were poor and that you wanted to buy the New York Jets so you could put in the plaque, you know, coming from a little boy that, you know, his mom couldn't afford to buy it. Yeah. And it just really touched my heart. You are the human that I most admire. I don't give a fuck about Jeff Bezos or Steve Jobs or Gary Vaynerchuk. The person I most look up to is the mom or dad whose number one goal was to only be a mom or dad. I am the byproduct of a woman whose singular goal in life was to be the best mother, she could be. And there's nothing I admire. No athlete, no Aaron Rodgers, no, you know, Brunson, no, no, no. I'm not joking. I'm not kidding. There's no, there's no Martin Luther King. There's no Gandhi. And there's definitely no business person. No, nobody who made money that is remotely close to me. For the admiration I have for you and to our Vaynerchuk and all the other mom and dads out there whose singular ambition was to be a mom or dad. I couldn't admire it more. That's amazing. Thank you so much. You know, I'm so grateful for you, Gary, and your heart. It says, you know, one of the biggest honors of my life is to be able to meet people like you because this world meets people that lead with empathy and kindness. And I heard about your empathy wines years ago. So I started the hashtag and the Emily empathy because of that. And I just, I really, my deepest prayer for this world is unity and that we have more people like you that lead the way that you do. We have so much unity and the media and social media. People don't get it. Emily, good news. The world is more inside than people realize. Of course we have differences. News alert. We've had differences forever. There's been world wars. The biggest wish I had for people is for people to get out of the news cycles, both in social and mainstream media and understand how much unity we have. Do you understand how much love is in this room right now? Yes. There's a lot of love, but we, but people love to sell us on what's not wrong because we watch. Well, my favorite part about this hour and a half is going to be that it's an hour and a half that motherfuckers are not on CNN and Fox news and motherfuckers are not in their Facebook feed or Instagram consuming some fucking bullshit negativity. Shit. Anyway, I love it. I got, I got rid of my TV years ago and I don't watch the news. I have one friend and I said, if there's something going on in the world that I need to know, please let me know, but I refuse to watch it. So I love you for that. Honestly, like it's so crazy. Like all we're doing and by the way, social too. And by the way, for all of you that are mad at social media, unfollow the people that are pushing negative fucking content. Be accountable. I don't want to hear about the algorithm. The algorithm is you. You're the fucking algorithm. Thank you, Emily. Let's keep it going. Thank you so much. I love you. I'll bless you. Everybody who's on right now, let's share this link. I want new people in here. And if you send someone, I want them to say Johnny sent me or fucking, let me get some names in here. You know, like fucking haunted house sent me horse, whatever. Israel 11 sent me fucking twins sent me. Sweet dev sent me. Let's keep asking the questions. Let's keep answering PR King of Hearts. You ready? There we go, bro. There we go. That guy PR King. What's good? What's going on, Gary? How you doing? Good, bro. Where are you at? Long Island, New York. My man. Yes. Yes. All right. So I'm 34 years old. I'm a single father of two. My name is Gilberto, but I go by Piotta King of Hearts on social media. Real quick background. So you have an idea where I'm coming from. I was focused on being an independent music artist. I started focusing on saving up money to build a home recording studio to start doing projects. COVID hit. No one can come anywhere near anyone. So I decided to pivot and turn my project, which I was going to call clocking out into an actual brand. And I made it a podcast. I used all my recording stuff to basically use for streaming. And I've been trying to work on just building a brand of focusing on people that want to clock out of the nine to five jobs that they really have no interest in and just try to build something from nothing that's focused on what they actually have a passion for and that they're really interested in. And I wanted to ask you, what do you do? Or if you ever find yourself daydreaming about the future or putting too much energy into thinking about how things are going to end up in the future, that you end up missing all the beautiful things that life has to offer in the current present time? If you could give an example of that and what you did to ground yourself and focus on the present and now. I have the capacity to think about both. I've never struggled with being so focused on the future that I fucking ruined the now because I've also been okay with working my ass off for two years and not enjoying the fruits of friendship time and downtime because I've enjoyed my process. For me, working on my missions has been as exciting as going to Las Vegas with my boys. So I don't I don't struggle with it because I'm aware that I signed up for it. Gotcha. You know what I mean? Yeah. The only thing I'm always worried about is not spending enough time with my family other than that. Exactly. Yeah, that's that's what I'm thinking about. Yeah. On that, bro, I'm just willing to change my mind. Like my Friday nights, I used to work every night. Now I don't my Thursday nights this year. I used to work every night. Now I don't. So if you react like I'm willing to adjust and reallocate my time, that's it, bro. That's all it is. I appreciate that. Don't worry about yesterday if you feel like you haven't spent enough time with those two little ones or your brother or uncle or whatever. Fix it tomorrow. You're right. The biggest problem in the world, bro, is people dwell. Yeah. There's no fucking time machine. That's that's my issue. It's over. Of course it's your issue. It's everyone's issue. Exactly. Do you know how insane dwelling is? People dwell like they fucking think there's a time machine. You're right. The fuck are we dwelling about? Exactly. Yeah. If you're dwelling, you're fucking up today because you're mad about yesterday. Yep. You literally fucked up today on some shit about being upset about fucking up yesterday. Yeah, you're completely right. Learn from your dwelling and stop that shit. Be accountable. But I fucked up. I was too hungry for the money. I wanted to fame. I didn't worry about little Alberto. I don't fucking know. It's OK. We all fuck up shit. I made 19 trillion mistakes. I'm not out here mad at myself. I love myself. I'm a human being. Show me the fucking human being that didn't make a thousand fucking mistakes. Sure. What's about learning from them? Yeah. The problem is we put everybody else on a pedestal and we shit on ourselves. Exactly. Yeah. That's the problem. I'm telling all 1000 of you right now, don't put me on a fucking pedestal. I'm feeling good about myself. I'm a nice guy. I'm capable. I got love. I'm funny. I work hard. I got stuff. But like fuck me. Don't put me on a fucking pedestal. Put yourself on a pedestal. Exactly. Thanks, Barry. I really appreciate that. Thanks for the time. I love you, bro. Time for a commercial pre-order. Meet me in the middle. Meet me in the middle of my new kid's book. I expect all 1000 of you to order this shit right now.

I'm predicting now one of my most commercially successful books of all time, every one of you should get this book. That's available as well. Link that up. Also, flexing these new hats pretty proper. This one, they've seen this one, but they haven't seen it with this. They've seen this one, but they haven't seen the fucking new updated version. The fearless fucking fairy in your mouth. These hats are about to become a thing. Most of them are giving away to like super bougie, fucking ridiculously cool, sexy fucking cool, motherfucking influencers. So everyone's going to want it. That's why you got one. No, that's why you got one. You see your desk? It's right in your desk right now. Oh, really? Yeah, bro. You're the ultimate fucking influencer, Dustin. Motherfucker. Let's keep going. This is Kiara. What did you call that? I want to check. Let's do it. Kiara, what's good? Hey, what's up, man? What's good? Just chilling, bro. Yo, I can't believe I'm on the fucking show. Hell yeah. You're on the fucking show. This is fucking crazy. So yeah, I just have a question about like, how do you hold space for people that are not necessarily in a good place and they're like just venting to you, whether that's friends, co-workers, those random people off the street? They're just they're explaining themselves, but then like a part of me, I feel bad and like kind of like, it's like an energy drain or like throughout my day because I'm thinking about their shortcoming. I'm like, fuck, there's nothing I can do about it. Like, how do you how do you deal with people's like venting and complaining to you? Like, can I give you a huge idea? Heck yeah. Do you have a TikTok? I do. I want you to make a TikTok at the end of the day. Okay. And I want you to call it dumping the bucket. Okay. I want you to start a show on TikTok every night. Every night. Hell yeah. This is going to help you and make and really help you a lot of ways. I want you to start a show, a one minute video that you make every night called dumping the bucket. What's your name again, darling? My name is Kiera. I want you to call it dumping the bucket with Kiera. Every episode. That's crazy. I have a podcast called the On X Strong podcast. I'm in the health and fitness industry. So I give health and fitness advice to beginners. So I guess I can start. Start it on my podcast. Stick with me. Stick with me. I want you to make a one to two minute video every night called dumping the bucket with Kiera. And I want you to say I started this show because Gary Vee on Twitch told me to do it. Okay. And I want you to start every episode with I'm an empath and I've got room for people every day. And every night I'm going to make a video talking about something I observed without using people's real names. And I'm going to dump out what I took in because I know by me dumping it out and helping the world, it's going to help me not have it in me anymore. And so I'm going to take someone's anxiety and negativity and concern. I'm going to sit with it during the day. But every night I'm going to dump it to the world. And I'm hoping that the people I come across every day that are struggling become an inspiration and observation for y'all. Wow. Okay. I can do that. What's going to happen is two things. You're going to get, oh, do we lose her? Damn. I feel like we're winning. Well, let me just tell her. Yeah, let's move on to the next question. But team for everyone, Kiera, if you're watching, in case your phone just died, what, maybe she went and did it. She might be the biggest to, she might be the greatest guest of all time. She's just doing it. I believe dumping the bucket as a team knows here, I've been talking shit for two months that I'm going to start a show called winding down. And they all make fun of me. Mainly I make fun of myself that I haven't started yet. And what I want to do is drink a bottle of wine and review it at night and talk about my day of observations. So I'm giving Kiera similar advice. There you are. Sorry about that. I don't know what just happened, my man. No worries, my darling. I think you're going to win twice. One, you're going to get that shit off. No, you're going to get that shit off your chest. And the two, you're going to build an audience. You're going to get that shit off your chest. And the two, you're going to build an audience. Okay. I think you got the gist. I don't know. Monkey, I'm going to ask the team to move it off. I know you got a multiple things. I'm sure something died, but you got the gist. Dang it. Don't worry. You got it. You got plenty of shit. Sure. You got the gist. Dang it. All right. I'm moving. Um, let's go to the next question because I want to get in a bunch more before I get off. All right. Let's keep it going. Izzy, what's good? What's going on, my man? How are we doing? Where are you from? I'm in Massachusetts. Are you a fucking Patriot fan? Maybe a Just Fan. Yeah, get out of here. Go ahead, bro. No, it's my question had to do with the, it was a Snapchat you did. Humility, practical steps, straightforward on humility. That's a great question. It's complicated. Here's what I would say about humility. The practical first steps is not to take yourself serious. Bro, I've accomplished a lot and I get a lot of love. And when I tell you, I don't think I'm special. I just don't. Humility is understanding you don't need anybody else's validation. That's an insight to humility. People understand. I believe the reason I'm humble is because I don't need your cheering or your booing. Okay. I think most people live life for outside people's validation period. That's their entire framework. The opposite sex, their mom, their dad, random people, followers. That's why social media worked. I knew it was going to work. I knew that people wanted followers. Yeah, I definitely started with that for sure. Bro, I'm telling you, I'm appreciative of all the followers. Tonight's a special night. I'm clearly going to do this again because does everybody want me to do this again? Leave a comment, Twitch. I feel like this is something we should be doing. But bro, when I tell you with all the accolades and everything, I just don't think I'm that special. I feel good about myself. When I say I don't think I'm special, I don't think I'm better than anyone, but I think I'm the best. People get confused when they hear me. Don't make self-esteem with... Like just because you have confidence doesn't mean you don't have humility. I have unlimited both. Right. But I think humility comes from just realizing I'm going to die one day and I'm going to get my family who didn't really care, given where I'm at in society. I'll probably get a good 24 hours on social media. People will share their favorite quote in their video when I'm 100 and they'll be over. Okay. Oh, yeah. I think people that struggle with humility are insecure. Yeah. Period. Real talk. Yeah. All your three books just came to the mail. I know you just did a quick commercial break, but it might as well... Thank you, bro. I have 12 and a half out there for your fans. Thank you, bro. I love you. Do you have any nieces or nephews? I... My nephew was just born two, three months ago, actually. Bro, you better get this shit for him. I'm going to fuck with you if I don't. I want this to be the most successful kids book of all time because on some real shit, it's teaching people the middle. The middle is extreme confidence and extreme humility. That's actually the middle. Got you. Dude, my nephew's... He's going to be hooked up. I got you. Got you. Love you, bro. Hey, love you too, man. Yeah. Let's keep it. Kevin W. Murray in the building from TikTok on Twitch right now. I love you. I need all of you from TikTok to go over to Twitch. Twitch.tv slash GaryBee. Get over here now. Now. Hi. What is good? Hi. How are you? Oh, my God. Hold on one second. Hold on one second. Somebody just said humility is overrated. I just want to pull back on that. Humility is overrated. There he is. Inner scorecard. I could not disagree more. Get his ass on the show. Pull him in. Inner scorecard. We can come in. We're going to debate this. All right, Destiny. What's good? Hi. So nice to finally meet you. I'm Destiny. I am the co-founder of Diamond Extensions. I'm 31. I recently moved from Charlotte to Jersey City, so I'm right outside of. Let's go. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you. So we launched our business back in February 2022, and I currently work a full-time nine to five, and I'm completely burned out at this point. Why? Just a lot of the workload overall. It's been kind of challenging to say the least, and so that on top. So the job sucks? Yeah. Like, I mean, I've been in merchandising for eight years now, and I think I'm just kind of like burnt out from it. I don't love it as much as I used to. And I mean. Do you think that's a product of whom you're working for and where or just a general overall thing, or do you not know? I would say, yeah, definitely where I'm working. Okay. So that's a big mistake. People make career changes without realizing they just don't like the team they're on. Football players don't retire just because they're on a shitty team that they don't like the coach. They wait out their contract and they go sign with another team. Yeah. I mean, I will say, I get to this point every two years within my career. I start putting in so much effort and then I just get burned out. And so I don't know. I'm definitely trying to grow the business at a larger scale so that I can make it more of my full-time job. Like, I would love to just put this as my full-time job. But it's just the diamond extension. So we're an online hair boutique. And so right now we just strictly e-commerce. And we've been having some challenges trying to grow it at a larger scale with working like nine to five. So we just love your advice on- Tell me what you're doing from six to midnight. Real talk. Don't bullshit me, Destiny, because I'm going to get crazy on you. Okay. Full transparency. Real talking. No bullshit because you're a young woman. And so you got to, you got to rest. You got to go out. You got to do shit. I get it. But I need to hear your Monday through Friday. No bullshit. Yeah. So like, yeah, I work nine to five. And to be honest, like I come home. Yeah. Do not come on here. This might be the only time we ever talk. Yeah. And I'm going to give you everything I got. Yeah. So don't come on this fucking show and bullshit me and try to make it look good. Tell me the fucking truth. Like most days I come home and I'll put additional hours into work, which is why I'm out. Come on. Of course. Yeah. So like 10, some nights, 11, and by that time, like I'm done. I'm tired. And when time starts, you get home at 5.30, you go like, like real talk? Like real talk. I really need to hear it. No, I don't leave work until 5.30. It takes me like an hour, a little over an hour to get home. So I'll get home around like 6.30. 6.30. Then what? Cook. Cook. And then I'll log back in. I'll log back in. I'll log back in around like 8 ish, maybe. Right. So you can decompress, you can music, watch some teeth, whatever. Yeah. I'll put a show on the background. Start working. You're, look, nobody should be just working. Yeah. And then. So 8 to 10, 8 to 11, you're working on the thing and then you go to sleep and do it again. Yeah. Pretty much. And what about the weekends? The weekends is where I definitely spend a little bit more time. Working on the business, but I have been working like additional weekends as well for like my 9 to 5. So that's where obviously the burnout is coming in. And so I'm trying to find the balance to be able to. Right. Well, you can't commit yet because this other gig is not paying for your life. Exactly. Exactly. So. My point of view is how long you've been doing the side thing. Since 2022. That's 2020. It's a baby. Yeah. It's it's fairly, fairly new. Yeah. It's a baby. Yeah. Two years old is a baby. I know. I just want it to grow. No shit. But I don't know if you heard, but two year old shit their pants still. I mean, well, will you put it like that? Yeah. It's it's a baby. It's I'm going to put it like that. You got a two year old business as a fucking baby. It shits its pants. Pretty. Yeah. Great analogy. Good news. You're young as. Do you understand that? Yeah. Yeah. Do you? I mean, I feel like this is just not where I saw myself at 31. What the fuck are you seeing yourself at 31 for? I just would was hoping to be a little bit further along than where I'm at right now. Why? Because I feel like time is just so that's all we have. And that's you're going to live our 70 more years. You're a 31 year old in 2024 with modern medicine exploding. You're going to live to 100. Yeah. It feels like time just it just watch this. Yeah. Everybody in the chat. Tell me how old you are right now. Tell me how old you are in the chat right now. And then tell me when you've figured it out. Yes. Listen, you're your kid. Here's what I'm hearing. Look at all these ages. Like you're just starting. And we're on Twitch. Look at these numbers. We're supposed to be all 16 or not. The problem here is how's the how's the business? Like in the first two years, it sounds like you got something going a little something. Yeah. I mean, we we've had some sales, but you know, I definitely I'm I want to grow it at a larger scale. I want to see how much how much social media you're putting out. Not as much as I should, to be honest. I don't post enough. Yeah. How much how many posts is your business post a week on social media? Don't lie because I look it up and I'll fucking. No, I'm not even going to lie like barely enough. Like we'll post during the holidays and that's like it. I barely have enough. Like I really don't have enough time. You saw Abby's face right now. Abby's face is they know when I hear when I hear once a day on mad. You said we once posted during Christmas. You came on this fucking show. I'm out here talking about day trading attention. I want you. I want your business posting four to 20 times a day. Oh my God. And you had the audacity to come on this show and said we posted on Thanksgiving once. Oh, I feel blasted. Yeah. Yeah. That's why you're coming on a show and be like, yo, I don't know why I ain't got a six pack yet. And I'm like, cool, let's talk it out. How many times have you done ab exercises? And you're like once. But that's the thing. Like I'm trying to like balance that and my job and like trying to find a new. You said you're told me you're fucking on work three hours a day at night. The fuck are you doing? Yeah. A lot of people work on side shit and they stand in front of the computer and try to make pretend they're doing something. A lot of people go to the gym and fucking go on their phone on the treadmill and walk at a fucking snail's pace and watch the fucking Netflix show and make pretend they went to the gym for an hour where they didn't break a fucking sweat. A lot of dudes go in the gym and start throwing around weights. Now that I'm educated, big shout out to Mike, the content Jordan, Syed. I go to an equinox once in a while because I'm traveling and I see dudes go for the vanity and start throwing around weights and fucking doing curls, swinging their whole fucking body. They're not building their fucking shit. You can't fucking move when you do your shit. These motherfuckers are like this and this on some ego shit. They're in for an hour. They're not accomplishing anything. I'm worried that you're going on fucking the computer three hours a night and bullshitting. Definitely not that. Like I'm so what are you doing? Just all of the tasks that I couldn't get through to out throughout the day. Like what? Just because before you say anything ready for this. Yeah, you're going to love me exactly. Like before you tell me anything, the number one task for a business that doesn't have enough customers is to market. Yeah. What are we doing? If you don't have customers, you have nothing. Yeah. You're right. Oh, I know. Yeah. I may not know about a lot of things. This isn't a cooking show. This is not a show about how to get your lawn real green and healthy. This is not a show about how to make perfect fucking roasted coffee. It's a big show and that's what I do and I know I'm right. And I want this for you. I'd rather you just relax and enjoy your fucking evening so you're not burned out than to not do the fucking right strategy on the three fucking hours that you're on. Yeah. Yeah. I think I need to dedicate more time to like posting on social media so that we can breathe. Maybe you have to post two posts today for your business and post them on TikTok so people discover it because you might go viral. You might get more views. Instagram is hard, but you should do it. Facebook's a monster. Facebook fan page. You should absolutely do that. Pinterest. Like you got to fucking come if you're giving me three hours a night, I need an hour for social. Okay. And before you go into the next like what do I post? You have a million businesses that are in your business. Go look at their shit. Okay. You know, I can do that. I know you know, I can see in your fucking face. I can do that. The customers, the fuck are you doing? That's like opening a store, having no customers and fixing the shelves. I know it sucks. Like nobody wants to store with no customers. It's a fucking customers. I'm going to get some customers. Thanks Gary. I appreciate it. I got you. If you want to be on the show, everybody, it's right here on Twitch. I know there's 1400 of you on TikTok, proven my point by the way, right here live, proven my point, started with 50 people on 1400. Can you see it? No, you can't really see it. Yeah. This is what goes on with TikTok. As you can see, top right corner, 1400 are on right now. I just looked over at first. There was 150 people. TikTok continues to grow. Watch this. How many of you have no idea who the fuck I am right now? You're just, this just showed up and you're like, what the fuck? Say have no clue in the comments. Say have no clue in the comments. Have no, there's me. See, people don't even know. And it's a little blurry. See, have no clue. You saw one in that. I got it. All of you should be on TikTok live. All of you should be on Twitch. But Twitch is harder. TikTok gives you discovery. Twitch, you have to earn much harder. First time from TikTok, Moonberry. All of you on TikTok, get over to Twitch right now. Twitch.tv slash GaryBee if you want to be on the show. Oh, awesome. Inner, let's go. Inner. How can you hear me? Yes, my friend. Where's your video? Listen, man, I'm on a desktop that doesn't have a camera. I apologize. Is that a problem? Not at all, brother. I love your voice. First of all, love you. Tell me the point. Where are you from? I'm from California. So should I start telling you how you're wrong or should you start telling me how I'm wrong? Well, the good news is we're both. There is no right or wrong. I actually was more interested in what your angle or perspective is on why you believe humility is overrated. Like what's your perspective on that? Because I don't think it's a right or wrong game. I'm more curious about what your take is. Right on. Listen, man, I've been following you for years. I mean, I'm a fan. I've been like the last couple of years, I haven't been totally in the loop. But I mean, you've got it right. One thing I love about you is that you only teach what you've done. So like you don't fear. You know what I'm saying? Like that's huge. And the people that are listening. That's such a good point for the first one. Big deal. What's your real name? Tom. Tom. First of all, I knew I kind of like intuitively like your comment. I love the way you came on. And for your opening line to be that, I really am very impressed, meaning thank you for seeing that. You're absolutely right. The reason I have so much conviction. And it was funny how I just was with that young lady and said, this is not a show about making your long nice or coffee. You're absolutely right, bro. I'm petrified about talking shit I haven't lived because I don't know the answer unless I did it. Thank you for seeing that. Love it, dude. Love it. And so like the way I look at it with humility is overrated. I make a distinction between internal and external. So you were just talking to a lovely lady who's worried about starting a podcast, right? She got five siblings. And what is she worried about? Being judged. And I see a synonym between being judged. And what did some of those people say? They say, who do you think you are? Stuff like shit. Right, right, right. Who do you think you are, right? Don't get too big for your britches. They put people in this box of like, be humble. Don't get to your head out over there. Ah, ah, ah. You see what I'm saying? Like on the inside, internally, the more you know, the more you know you don't know. That's a total humility right there. It's, but it's sort of paradoxical. The more you know, the more you know you don't. So yes, you always need to stay humble on the inside. But how do you get attention? How do you put yourself out there when you can so easily be beat on the outside with this box of humility? Does that make sense? Very much. Now I understand because as you can imagine, words are all contextual. So what you're saying is, I love that. To your point, I'm such a buyer of that. So many people, I believe that the insecure, one of my favorite sayings, I don't use it a lot. I don't bring it up a lot. But to your point, this pandemic of misery loves company is real. The reason to your, and I fully agree with you, the reason people say to you, stay in your lane, who the fuck do you think you are? You're not as good as you think you are, is because that's how they feel about themselves. So I'm in full agreement there. I think that if you're using it in that context, I don't view that as being humble. I view that as being scared. All right. You know, I so understand the word you're using, and I fully agree. I actually think, and I love how you said that, the more you know, the more you don't know. That's the whole point of this for me. I talk with unlimited levels of conviction, but I also have incredible capacity to not want to convince people. This is the biggest issue in the world right now. Everyone's trying to convince people to see the world the way they see it. I have no interest in convincing anyone the way I see it. I'm just convicted about my perspective with the hope that it brings value to some people. And so, you know, I fully understand where you're coming from. But that's, I couldn't read more, your point of outside versus inside. I don't even hear people when they say that thing. And I think to your point, too many people are living for outside validation, but I actually think one of the most, I think the people that are most successful oftentimes are either in extreme insecurity or extreme humility. It drives them, you know? Let me, can I ask you the question that I've been trying to get through into you and real quick is, let me ask you this, and I think it might be somewhat related. Do you think it's worth a leader's time to work on developing their people's attitudes? It's, yes, I do, sir. As a matter of fact, if you looked at my schedule, the majority of my time as a CEO and as like someone who leads a lot of things, I would say it's the majority of what I spent my time on. No one can be remarkable at a task if their emotional framework is weak. Even if they're great at the craft, they will crack under the reality of humans interacting with humans. I find that fascinating. Dude, I watched when you first rolled out the stuff with, I believe her name is Claude Silver. Tremendous, okay. Brother, I love you for that question. I'm fascinated by how many CEOs spend no time on HR. You'd be blown away. Can I show my calendar? I can show it to you. It's a little trick out of my mind. I mean, if you saw my calendar, my team is right in front of me. They'll tell you, it's like absurd by time. I'm, I'm predominantly spending time on that because once that's strong, you create continuity, you create retention. It's an incredible thing when you try to, when you give love to people, you get love in return. It's very real. Yeah, I'm glad for that question. Thank you, brother. I knew I wanted you on here. No, did I vibe with you? I've been messing with you for a long time. I'm a big fan. Thank you, brother. Thank you for being on. You got it. Thanks, man. Take care. All right. Let's get more questions. See, didn't I intuitively feel good about that one? Yeah, really good voice. I agree. I was like, weirdly attracted to his voice. I was like, put it, because he didn't show, right? He didn't show his face. You're like, is he cute? Right? Were you guys like, is he cute? Were you guys talking like that? I was kind of like, is he cute? Oh, that's what I was thinking. All right. Let's keep it going. What's up, Gary? Can you hear me? I can, Jared. How are you? First of all, Jared, I actually can see certain faces below my screen that are in the back room. I just want to give you some flowers. You're, you're, you've been reacting to a lot of the right stuff. And it just makes me feel warm towards you. So some love for you, bro. Bro, love for you. See that wine bottle right there? Which one behind you? Yeah, it's insane. Oh, I see the cute little girl there. Yes, I see that one right there. That bottle's got your signature on it. I just bought this girl your book just a minute ago when you, when you said. Thank you. Thank you, brother. We're diamond holding book hands for the kids and v friends too. And I want to get a heart trooper for this one as, as soon as we can. VF one. So what's her name? Mia. Mia, such a pleasure to meet you. This is Mia Ireland. So that's actually one of the things that my question has to do with, she likes to vlog. She likes to do baking stuff, kind of life stuff. She has martial arts, jujitsu. And as a dad, I'm 44. She's nine. Her older sister's 14 into singing. What, where do you go with the, the rails like a bowling alley? No, I figured it's got to have rails of the kids live streaming, the stuff you talk about them wanting to create brand and content and what that is for a kid. I mean, they're great at playing outside. I've got great, these, I've got the greatest kids ever. I'm so lucky, man. But what, where's your stance on supporting the kids and all of that? That's a great question. So a couple of things. Thanks man. I know those quarter-race borrow. What the fuck? Dude, these are going to be so great. Bro, I'm so excited because I've unveiled them tonight. The most fun part of the whole thing is they're so limited compared to most B-Friends stuff. There's going to be, this is going to be a fun one because people are not going to be able to get them and if they're going to be mad, it's going to be a whole to do. I'm excited about it. Anyway, first of all, I love talking about parenting, right? Yeah. But I never, never am comfortable ever telling an individual parent advice because every, every family, every child, every sitch is different. That's number one. In the macro, I think it's complex. I believe that the concept of children being public facing has historical precedent. We're aware that very few child stars worked out in real life. Totally. Because there's something about that level of scrutiny and judgment and money and fame and that is very, it's challenging for us 45-year-olds, our 38-year-olds, our 44-year-olds, our 48-year-olds, our 50-year-olds, 7, 9, 12. It's hard. On the flip side, one could argue that for a 7 or 9 or 11-year-old, they start to learn it early that people's comments don't mean anything. And it actually could. And so I think it has something to do with individuality. I believe that if you're fortunate and you win the DNA game and you've done a good job parenting and the circumstances of the friends and neighborhood that they grow up in, if you have a wildly confident, actually self-esteem kid, I was one of those. I got terrible grades. And even though all my teachers and all my friends' parents told me I was a loser, I didn't believe them. Yeah. I think I would have done okay as a 10-year-old with a YouTube channel talking about baseball cards and people saying, you suck. You don't know anything. I would have been okay. I think a lot of people would not be okay. And so I think at the end of the day, this is an individual thing between parents to look at their children. But what they have to do the entire time is they must make their children not care about the subscriptions, not care about the likes, not care about the followers, and not care about the positive and or negative comments. I actually think parents are good at saying don't worry about the negative comments. I actually think the bigger thing parents have to teach is don't listen to the positive comments. Love that. That's really good. Because once she doesn't, these two don't get addicted to the fucking positive feedback, then they become strong. I actually think the positive feedback is more dangerous than the negative. That's when you get higher known supply. That's when you get addicted to the feedback. That's when you need to get addicted to the love of the audience's feelings about you. That is the vulnerability. That's so good. You get that? Yes. Yeah. Definitely. All right. Gary, you're the man. You're the man. Love you, brother. Thank you. Good job, brother. Love you. Thanks, brother. See ya. Good stuff. I fucking love this show already. This is a real problem. This is when I do my big boy meetings. My 7 to 10 p.m.s. are like really important work time for me. If I get addicted with this show, it's a problem. Fuck. But this is it. The Q&A shows everything. There she is. Hi, Gary. Great to see you. It's nice to see you again, but it doesn't matter how many times I talk to you. I get nervous every time. Even in Chicago at Bacys, even at Chicago at the baseball card show, even on Zoom right now? Yes. Well, that's extremely flattering. I'm going to do this one. I'm going to get one more in and I want it to be spontaneous from the chat, from a question right now, right to the show. Go ahead. I don't think, no, you're not going to be able to see this. See, I'm not good with this stuff. But I put on the mirror in my daughter's room. Love yourself first. Love yourself most. I put those messages on there. So that was the one for today. So I thought that was great. So my question is, I run a very tiny nonprofit. It's a youth dance group. When I first started it, the whole my mission statement was to continue teaching traditional Mexican dance. So it doesn't die out in our area. That's cool. So I've lived here outside of Chicago and Porter County, Indiana since 1977 when we moved here. So fast forward 30 years, there was still no dance group of that kind in my county. They're all in Chicago. Okay. So I had a daughter. So I went ahead and I started my own group, even though I really didn't know what I was doing. But it's been 10 years later and now my mission has changed. And because I'm very small, I can't qualify for grant funding or things like that. So my mission went from teaching kids traditional dance and discipline, teamwork, all that stuff. But now it has turned into something with a lot more meaning to me. I've had kids come through that have survived abuse, that has survived just grief from losing a grandparent. And I'm going to try not to get emotional. But like I had one girl, she was eight years old and she came up to me and she's like, you know, I don't think I'm going to be happy anymore. And I said, why? And she said, because my grandpa died. And that's why her mom had actually brought her back to the group because, you know, life gets in the way. And most recently, I had a family that the kids were climbing out a window to escape domestic abuse. And so now my mission is I want a place for these kids to be normal, to have fun. So, you know, teaching the traditional dance has taken. It's escaping. Yeah, it's escapism. It's you just want to see a place for people that are struggling. Yes, exactly. And so my question is the way I'll get funding, like because we put on a community show every year, we've been doing it for 10 years. And by the way, the person who started that that I had to help with that is your buddy. Is it Todd Kaplan from Pepsi? Yes. He doesn't know that. Well, I mean, I told him I didn't tell him when I saw him at Vekon. But, you know, I'm sure he has a bunch of projects, but he did the Pepsi Refresh project one year for the Super Bowl. And to get funding, you had to do voting on Facebook. And that's really what I even got on Facebook. So with with that Pepsi funding, we were able to get costumes and everything. But anyway, how do I ask like a bank or a business or an insurance agent, how would I get a request for a sponsorship or for funding to stand out? How much are you looking for? Oh, I mean, it can be anything like, you know, we'll ask for $200, you know, do $1,000, you know, I don't think that's the other thing. I'm very bad at asking for help, let alone money. Well, then if you're bad at that, you're going to be bad at it. OK, but I'm trying to change. See, that's why I am. Yeah, I understand. I'm asking how by asking I stand out, though, from everyone else. There is no standout. There is no standout. No, you know, there's little leagues and cheerleading and everybody's aware of the millions of little organizations in every town in America that are looking for funding for the things that are passionate about. I've heard the way you do it is by asking. But I guess what like what's the focus like for me? My focus is I like is I want the kids to have a safe space. So is that more important than saying, oh, we're a youth dance group teaching traditional Mexican dance? Well, if I'm somebody who has Mexican heritage and my grandma, who is my favorite person, love to dance, for me, it's going to matter that you do Mexican dance. If you're if it but if I'm the CEO of a local business or that or some sort of high net worth individual or what have you. And the number one person in my life was my mother and I lost my mother. And you said I'm here for people to be able to escape the traumas of their day to day. Then when you said that, that would trigger me. The answer is there is no right answer. There's just the right answer for individual people. You don't know the answer until you ask the question. OK. All right. What that that you have a go fund me. No, I think you should. Good. Usually I'll ask on Facebook. And again, like I said, pushing myself out of my comfort zone, they do those birthday you know, requests for Facebook. And I wasn't going to do it because I don't like, you know, asking my friends for money. But I did. So it raised seven hundred dollars and I wasn't going to do it. So I was excited about that. So how about this? Is this an actual nonprofit? Yeah, it's a 501c3. Amazing. Why don't. So you said seven hundred you got on Facebook. Yeah, for my birthday fundraiser. OK, good. I've decided right here on the spot that I'm going to give you 10 times more than that. You don't make me cry. That's amazing. Thank you so much because we have we're having our annual show that we're preparing for that comes up in the fall for Hispanic Heritage Month. And I even this year we start at the end of last year, we started even with senior citizens. I had an 87 year old lady ask me, why don't you give classes for people my age? She's right. I said, find give me find four more people and I'll do it. And we did. And I was surprised even at the need for, you know, senior citizens that why I'm How much did you raise last year for this? Because of things that were happening at home and. Yeah, I'm not I'm not worried about don't hedge it. Just tell me how much. Well, I guess my point is I didn't really ask because I'm not that wasn't the question. How much did you raise? Four dollars four hundred four thousand. As far as sponsorships, I don't think it was more than four hundred. As far as sponsorships, I don't think it was more than not including if you take out my birthday fundraiser. I don't think it was more than five hundred. Great. And then you made seven hundred birthday. So you made twelve hundred bucks last year. Yeah. And today you decided to jump on this stream, give awareness to it. And I just gave you seven thousand. Thank you. You're welcome. I that's not even enough. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. I'm happy to do it. I've I've met you multiple, multiple, multiple times. I like your daughter very much, by the way. I think she's sharp. I caught her. I caught her watching your the. The friends opening. They were opening the cards. I told you at random times. She's always doing that. I told you she was smart. And you know what? I have to tell you the last time I talked to you, I said because of because she decided to pursue nursing. And then but then and I couldn't put my finger finger on why I couldn't picture her as a nurse. Like I just never saw that, but I didn't say anything because I couldn't figure it out. Recently, she said, Mom, don't get mad at me. And I said, what? And she said, I changed my pathway. I'm not going into nursing. And I said, OK. And I said, why? She said, I want to take care of people. Like the elderly. She works in a nursing home right now. She said, I want to take care of people. I don't like the medicine part. I have no desire to learn anything about medicine. And I was like, that's it. I said, that's why I couldn't picture her. I was thinking to myself as a nurse. So I was proud of her. I said, good, then don't. Said, you want to be a caregiver and you don't want to do the nursing part? That's fine. So I was just glad that she figured that out for herself. People are asking for the name of the charity. You have anywhere to send people? Oh, gosh, it's in Spanish. And I don't know where I can. I'm going to put it here in this chat. Facebook. Can you please create a GoFundMe? Yes. OK, thank you. And WI. So I put it on the back in this backstage thing. I don't know. He's got it. He'll figure it out. All right. I want to sneak one. I want to sneak one more in. I got to be in a meeting in one minute. And it's a four minute walk. So I'm already in trouble. Thank you so much for your positivity and for being friends and for everything. Yeah, we're in trouble. We'll get that taken care of. We'll get that to Nate Schroeder and Mike in the van. They should you'll take care of it. You have $7,000 now. All I need is you with the show now. Nobody I know. No, probably one person knows who you are because those are that's just not. They don't. They don't. I just gave you $7,000. Why are you dissing me? No, I'm not. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm joking. I'm joking. I'm joking. Guess just not there. I'm joking. I'm joking. There's 8 billion people on the earth. 7.9 billion. I have no fucking clue who I am. I'm thrilled. Let's keep it moving. All right. Quick. Do you have something or no? We question this. Are you safe? No. You know what? Actually, I can't be late for this. This is an employee. I got to do HR. I love you. I hope you enjoyed the show. Tick tock. I fuck with you. Now I'm hanging up on you. Twitch, I love you. Feel free after I'm done with the show, hanging out with each other. Tell me if you want me to do this again. Thank you for coming out. We'll do it again. I love you. I hope you enjoyed it.
