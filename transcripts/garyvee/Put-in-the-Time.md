What my question is, like I said, I just started blog and I've read all your books and I'm all about giving back, but I also work full time. I was wondering if you had any advice, like how to scale to give my best to my job? So that's where I'm making my monetary plan. And eventually, yes, I'm going to do my blog full time and teach people how to network. What happened I gave the best to both? By putting in the time. And it's the only asset you got, right? Right.

And it was easy. I wasn't tired. I didn't want to go to sleep. And so, you know, the thing that I would tell you to do that gives you the best prayer for this to work is make sure you really in tune and self-aware that this blog is around the thing that you like the most. You know, don't make it about interviewing internet peeps. Like, unless that's the thing you want, unless you grew up one day I want to be Charlie Rose, unless that's right.
