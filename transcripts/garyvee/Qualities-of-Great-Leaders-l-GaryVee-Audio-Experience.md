## Transcript
If you're an operator, you can operate around new truths. Sometimes that's the consumer behavior. Sometimes that's a political organization. But the reality is you do have a lot of control, including things like, you know, there's this a global audience like, you can leave where you live. If you're in Sweden right now and you're like, man, it's just harder to build a huge company in Sweden and tech. I'm like, move to San Francisco. You could. And so I really do love the happiness that comes along with accountability. VaynerNation, how are you? Very excited about this podcast. I always like when I'm starting new pillars, new genres, new concepts. This concept of interesting emerging entrepreneurial stories is something I've been bouncing around. And I met this young gentleman in Utah, right? Salt Lake. Yeah, Salt Lake. And we we apt. We got some stuff brewing. And it really just kind of sat with me for a while, because I think that was in February, about like, oh, I should have him on the podcast. He'd be a great kickoff for this thing that I want to do. So first, because I know a lot of you have really cool, interesting backstories and have emerging entrepreneurial ventures. I'm excited to have many of you in the future years in this hot seat to tell your story. Obviously on this podcast, a lot of times you get to see the finished product. We get a lot of cool people writing their book of their whole career or at the top of their game. But I really want to start putting out content, because I think it's going to really matter to my audience, this audience, about individuals that I see have the potential to be the type of people that in 20 years have books about their life story or their career. But we catch them in the beginning of it, or in the middle of it, or the early middle of it. And so that's what today represents. I'm excited about this conversation. And I'd love to get feedback from all of you on Twitter or email or DM me on what you think about this genre. So kicking off our first episode in this concept of interesting, emerging entrepreneurial stories. My friend, why don't you tell everybody your name, what you do, and we'll go into it. And thank you for being the kickoff first guest to this concept. Sure. Thanks, Gary. Thanks for the opportunity to talk about my story. Of course. My name is Anthony Tussoni. You can call me AT. AT. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Trulio. We do police body camera analytics. Yes. And my background is South Side Chicago, big family, brothers or veterans, became FBI agents. I didn't. I went to college. And I did quant finance. And what number were you in? Number three, the negotiator. Yeah. So number first, who did that? So my oldest brother and my youngest brother are veterans. Got it. And I went to college and did quant finance. Yes. Ended up on Wall Street. Yes. Building trading strategies and looking for signal and unstructured data. They signed on the dotted line and served the country and now are in FBI. And so I'm super proud of them. Yes. From a proud military police family. And when I spent a lot of time dealing with unstructured data, looking for signal, built my first company. Before you go there, why did you gravitate towards math as a kid? Was it in the Wall Street? Was it games? Games. Games, strategies, profitability. Was the Wall Street thing a money thing for you as a kid? Like you're like, I like games. I like math. I like stats. Oh, and now that I've become aware of this Wall Street thing, I can take those skills. And it can also be a financial thing. Sure. I like to win in games. And trading is a big game. It's like a video game. And so, yeah, like probability and stats. I thought I needed math. I learned a lot of math doing quant finance. Then you grow up and you learn that the world is not linear or deterministic. A plus B equals C, but not in the real world. And so I learned through building trading strategies that game theory is actually more important to making money than formulas. The gray of psychology? Yeah, understanding herd mentality. Yeah. How people think. And having a trader's mindset has definitely helped me as an entrepreneur. Helped me understand how to manage risk, how to think about losing trades, whether it's like a bad hire or a decision I made that isn't working. Really allows you to separate yourself from ego. How old are you right now? 41. So at 41, how would you say you balance the gray and the black and white that you've just now talked about in the first couple seconds? Like if I asked you, and obviously every scenario is going to be different, but just gut feel in your stomach right now when you are making decisions. Because I think this is going to be very powerful for a lot of people who are listening. Making decisions is like such a big part of it all. And I think some people, a lot of people, really gravitate towards one side or the other. It's all black and white linear, or it's all like gut feel. What do you think your current mix is in your current state? It became more gut as I've gotten older. How do I feel about this person sitting across from me? Yeah. I really think the key to making good decisions is your clarity of thought. It has to be grounded in reality. Meaning you have to ask a lot of good questions to understand what actually is reality. And I learned over time that my success was highly correlated to the quality of questions I ask in a meeting. Do you think that a lot of people are grounded in ideology? Yes. I think a lot of people's egos in the way, they don't, they're thinking about their business, they're not being realistic that it's suffering in some way, that there's some damage that it's not doing as well, that it could fail. And they've convinced themselves of a different reality. Often not being accountable and liking the ability to blame somebody else. My favorite thing is when I talked to so many, there's a big one for everybody who's listening. When you come and tell me your business is failing because of these two people that work for you, you do understand that you were the one who hired them and you were the one that is deciding to let them still be there. Yeah. Yeah. You're 100% responsible for your business, period. 100%. One of my favorite things is talking to entrepreneurs over the last 15 years is their passion for who the president is as if that's a proxy to how successful they are as an entrepreneur. I'm aware that taxes could change under different presidencies. I'm aware that policies can. And I'm aware that there's rules that can be made. But the reality is still at the end of the day, if you're a operator, you can operate around new truths. Sometimes that's the consumer behavior. Sometimes that's a political organization. But the reality is you do have a lot of control, including things like, there's this global audience, you can leave where you live. If you're in Sweden right now and you're like, man, it's just harder to build a huge company in Sweden and tech. I'm like, move to San Francisco. You could. And so I really do love the happiness that comes along with accountability. My gut instinct, I think, became more honed as I got older as I had to hire people. I think during the hiring processes, it's not as black and white. It's very difficult to quantify or structure an interview. You need to spend time with people. But there are things you should be looking for. There are certain questions you should be asking. Or even more interesting to me has always been, and then you've hired them, and then the process actually begins. The data gets very clear when you're actually with someone. Hiring, even to your point, even if you have a good process, there's still going to be so much of an intuitive guess. Yeah. You're not going to bat 1,000. Not even close. Working with someone, the data becomes dramatically more clear. So what you do about it once you realize you've made a poor hire or a great hire really becomes the variable of growth. You need to eliminate poor hires, especially a small startup like Trulio. I owe it to my team, my investors, my customers, and that person. If they're not the right person to be at the company, it's not right for them or their family or their growth. And so it's better just have that honest conversation. Let's back all the way back up where I distracted us and took us off course. OK, so you're trading, then what happens? Yeah, so I'm building trading strategies, a systematic approach to trading, all model building. Everything is, nothing's discretionary. I built systems. And so I work on Wall Street, and I learned to do something called natural language processing, which is essentially transcribing and analyzing calls. I was very interested in structuring all the different conversations I had. At one point, I had 180 counterparties that I would talk to. And I wanted to make our conversation searchable so that if somebody called me and asked for Coca-Cola, I could search who else asked me for this product in the past. And so I was very interested in structuring unstructured data, email, chat messages. A lot of trading is still done over instant message, believe it or not. And so I learned about natural language processing, and I ended up forming a company simply because I was pissed off that trading, you're worth 1x multiple revenue. There's no multiple on your revenue. Trading forces you to be a very perpetual learner because strategies decay so fast. After nine months, a strategy is irrelevant. And that's because everyone catches up to the strategy? Because trading today is like Star Wars. I mean, people use AI. Yeah, inefficiencies are spotted quickly. And so the market's. And extracted quickly. Yes. So you need to evolve and adapt very quickly. And it's a lot of work. And you're still going to be worth 1x multiple. There's no SaaS. No one's going to acquire you for your trading revenue that's what occurred last year. And so right around 30, I started my first company, Greenkey. And we transcribed and analyzed banker phone calls. And we gave the bank client insights. What are the customers calling for? What are they upset about? How do you hire better salespeople? What should they say? Change a product, fix a product, whatever it is. Yeah, how do you create better objection handling? We were structuring the unstructured data. Yep. And give us a little bit more of how that went. Sure. So I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. Of course. One big mistake. The news. So is every single person listening? The number one problem that a founder entrepreneur needs to solve is what is the problem you want to solve? That's it. Everything starts with the problem you're choosing to solve. Because you're going to have to work hard. But how you direct that hard work is very important. The problem we tried to solve, looking back on it, we were solving a problem for banks that we thought would move this data to the cloud. They didn't. We made a lot of assumptions that were bad. Another big assumption we made was that. Did you make assumptions out of what you knew would be better, but didn't understand that the customer wasn't ready? Yes. But also, you know. I want to apologize. I jumped in, noticed everyone, even just rewind this, and start working two minutes ago, and just keep listening. The reason I was able to jump into that is talk about pattern recognition. No different than people living on ideology versus reality. When I tell you, the single thing that I see over and over of very capable talent in startup land is knowing what is better, but getting there too fast for the market. Because the market has other rationales where the best technology or the best thing isn't the actual North Star. There's some sort of other rationale, legacy software, contracts, political relationships, in the business sense of political relationships. So keep an eye out for that. You might be right, but you might be so early, or you might have been naive, to how people make decisions. That's exactly right. Timing is everything. The customer might not be ready for you to solve the problem in the way you want to solve it. Correct. And so another issue with that business was that, we would do a great job for J.P. Morgan. And guess what? They would paper us and say, don't tell anybody about how this works. So there was no viral coefficient. We couldn't build on that success. They didn't want Goldman Sachs to know what we just did. And so that's very different than, for example, in policing, where I do a great job for one department, and they tell 50. But if you do a bad job, they tell 100. And so but I like that business. I like a business where I can compete on quality of service and quality of product. Yeah, absolutely. Let's actually segue to that. So that business had a story just quickly. How did that wrap up? Sail, fold, what? Eight years. It was acquired in 2021. OK. And you were happy with that? Yes. Good. And so then you sell a business that you were happy about. So that's good. So that means what was you said, 2021? Yes. So very recently. Year and a half going on. So you're 39, 40 whenever this goes down. What's running through your mind post that exit? And how does that play into what you're doing now? The problem of police trust being low, I thought about it, was obsessed about it. I like thinking about problems that society has that it doesn't yet know how to get the solution to. And so trust in the police is low for a lot of different reasons. And I thought, actually, I'm in a very unique position to maybe solve that problem. So I began to research it. I went around to the camera providers, the people that manufacture body cameras. And I said, hey, guys, NLP is eight years old at this point. Transcription's 30 years old. Why aren't you guys analyzing body camera video? I wanted to figure out why no one else was doing this. You're asking the questions. Yeah, doing a lot of research. Went around and met with various chiefs. Went to the FBI National Academy, which is the top gun of policing. Met with the top 1% of police. Hey, guys, this is what I think the problem is. I think this is how I can solve it. What do you guys think? Just doing a lot of Q&A. You already have a lot of nuances and hypotheses because you've got your brothers around you. And so it's between research and listening to the stories and I'm sure whatever that was. You're on a hunch, and then you're confirming hunches with more questions and you're going through this process. How long does that go? That goes for about six months. And what happens at the end of that six months? What's the Eureka or the AHA? I see signal. I get access to data. I look at unstructured data. I quantify cops language. And I see in the data, cops that give more explanation have better outcomes. Before we go down this, which I think is super fascinating, I want you to go back to the natural language stuff as a whole because it's at the foundation of where you're about to go. And we have so many different people listening. There's going to be the people that are generally just interested, like I am, which is probably why you're here, of like, hey, this is really cool to solve some of life's biggest dilemmas through technologies that are merging with AI and everything else coming. There's a whole new world order of the next hundred. I can't wait to watch from heaven. The next hundred years, we're going to do a lot of cool shit. But then there's also the nerdiness of this. There's a lot of people that could find their calling because of this. Break down the natural language stuff for just a quick second. We'll go back to where we are on the police stuff. But I think watching videos, transcribing the words, and then structuring that to actually get into an AHAs or six is really cool. Yeah, I understand. So most of the electronic communication between computers is done over protocols or had been. So you write to an API. There's a protocol. There's a format for these two strings to be passed back and forth. They have to be in a certain order. And that's how the world worked primarily. But that's not how humans communicate. We communicate in an unstructured way through language and video and chat and some message and all this. And so NLP, natural language processing, it's a subfield of AI. It's like the intersection of linguistics where basically it structures language so that a machine can understand, not just the word being spoken, but the sentiment and the meaning behind it. So NLP is being used to, for example, summarize a document. It can be used to label documents where, OK, these words are empathy. This is questioning. This is different types of labels that created. Like in Trulio, we create labels around an arrest, use of force, noncompliance. And so you categorize the insights, which is how humans are actually conveying. We're conveying these large insights back and forth. So NLP is just a way to structure unstructured data so machines can process it. Love it. It's like an interface between humans and machines. ML and LLP, all of this stuff is, for a long time, I'm like, man, this is a big. Because for me, all my magic was in the gray and in intuition. And so when this all started hitting my radar four, seven, eight years ago, I'm like, wait a minute. I'm glad I'm going to retire because my magic can actually become commoditized over time, which is profound. It's profound. Like everything that has worked for me is actually going to be mapped. Yeah, that's exactly right. It's structured in an Excel spreadsheet. NLP makes data come alive and be able to be structured so it can be analyzed and compared. So you go through this journey. You start analyzing the videos. And you're like, shit, I got stuff. Traders mindset, sifting through a bunch of unstructured data, thinking about, should I start this company? Why need to know that there's signal? I need to know for sure. Because there's a lot of noise. I'll give you some examples. Bring down signal and noise because I'm a little bit, but I feel like a lot of people can get a lot of value if you're breaking it down. Sure. So signal or alpha is looking at data sets and finding causation. And it's like an example would be, in the data sets we mine, you could say, well, I don't want cops to say swear words. Well, I got news for you. They're super effective cops that say swear words. We can look at their data and I'll find civilian gratitude. They've got good outcomes, even though that they use some profanity. And so that we realize, well, actually, it's directed profanity. It's the F you to somebody that they don't like. Of course. And civilians don't like insults and threats. Watch this, everyone. Dustin, let's go fucking kill it together. Versus Dustin, fuck you, motherfucker. Exactly. Yep. Thank you. Yeah, so we had to sift through noise and look for, what is the actual signal? What is it that creates good outcomes for cops and civilians? Here's another example. The number one complaint from a civilian for a cop is he was rude. He or she was rude to me. What that means in the data is that the officer gives commands and doesn't negotiate. There's no listening. There's no back and forth. We don't monitor tone. I want to tell you why. You can do it. Tone cadence, volume clipping, frequency, all this stuff. There's not enough signal there. Got it. Because there's loud cops that are respectful and effective. And so I don't think the science is there yet. What about the intent? Well, I got like, boy, if you know I'm sorry. Podcast, I'm apologizing right now. I'm getting very selfish. It's insane to me how much the currency of my being believes that intent is like this profile. Like, it's unbelievable. I basically make every decision based on my interpretation of the intent. Is that something that can factor in? Or is that just too fucking hard at this point? We can't do it. I don't know if anybody can do it. We can't. And my job as CEO is to make sure we only work on the things that we're going to do really well. And we can't do that well. We can't do image analysis well. So we don't work on those things. Yeah, it's funny. As Vayner, as the agency we're sitting in right now, I think one of the people, somebody asked me the other night, man, you guys literally built one of the biggest agencies of all time in such a short period of time. Like, how? And I'm like, there's a lot of answers. But it was funny. It was similar to what you just said. I was like, self-awareness. I was really, really clear in my brain of what we could do exceptionally well compared to everyone else and what would be a commodity or as good as everyone else or below everyone else. So I really love hearing that. It's a real big insight for all the founders listening. Understanding that, not doing things you think you have to do because everyone else is doing it. Focusing on strengths versus trying to half-ass weaknesses. You need to protect your company with the word no. Customers are going to ask you to do a lot of crazy stuff and bolt on different solutions. You can need to say no to that stuff to stay true to your core value. Especially in B2B land. Because then your product becomes rank and sign. Then your professional services. Yeah, I think that's right. Those aren't grid multiples. So you're going through and you're seeing it. I mean, that must feel like a... Elation. What's that, brother? It's related. Yeah. Not only related, pretty emotional because, you know, look, I'm trying to do great advertising communications and that's important. And obviously when I do it for nonprofits versus for-profit, like there's a different feeling, but like you're not fucking around here. Like this is a big one. Like God forbid, which I mean, God willing, I use it as slang. You map this one, you get this at scale. Like you're going to do a lot of good for the world. Talk about getting this right. That just helps a lot. Yeah. Yeah, we're super excited about our mission. You know, the vast majority of police do a pretty good job. There's some percentage that shouldn't be cops. But this gives them a map, a protocol, a structure of an algorithm to follow. It's very simple to follow. We give them the rules of this video game. They play the game. They structure their strategic language around it and they're going to have better outcomes. How many cops in America or around the world today wear a body cam? Well, in the US, there's about a million cops and about 650,000, 700,000 of them wear cameras. Really high number. Yeah, it's not 100% yet. They still don't have cameras in rural counties and things. Every major city has cameras. And how many cameras go to fuck? You always hear, again, the news is such hyperbole, which is what, like, I love what you said in here, like, which is like, what I think about all the time, which is there's probably not a, there's very few humans on earth that are more optimistic about humans than I am. It is what keeps me so happy. I believe in team human so much. It's crazy. I'm also aware that the small percentage of humans that don't hold up to a level of humanity that we all aspire to are eating up the oxygen of the conversation, thus rendering a lot of people feeling unhappy, because I think the noise around the one or 2% that aren't doing it well clouds us to understanding that 98% of people are good people doing the thing. And so, and that comes in every form, parenting, politics, teachers, police, on, on, and on, relationships. So your point earlier of like, most cops are doing it really right, some people shouldn't be, and then there's probably some sort of thing in the middle with a little tweaking and training could get to the side that you wanted to. And so, I mean, I assume this is a massive tool for whom, the chief? Yes, a chief would use it to sort of mitigate risk, right? You wanna go to sleep at night, but the tool's designed for the sergeant. The sergeant's responsible for eight or nine people called their squad, and it gives the sergeant the ability to do some coaching, to identify moments of non-compliance or any unprofessional language, to intervene and say, hey, cut that out. And during non-compliance, hey, I notice you interrupt this person, I notice that you gave a lot of commands, they ask questions, you didn't give explanation. So it's really a tool designed to help the sergeant. How much is bad behavior that isn't on, like, what is ideal predicated on fear? Most of it. So these young cops that give a lot of commands, that's what's going on. They're afraid, they're in this situation, they're nervous. If they weren't nervous, they'd be more confident, they'd engage in more negotiation. And so what happens is the older the cops get, the more fights they've been in, the better their language becomes. That's what we saw in the data. Cut a recognition. So I wanna basically help young cops speak like old cops as quickly as possible. Interesting. Just to get out of your startup and this incredibly interesting thing back to, like, a rising start, where do you think, give me another genre of the world where you think structuring the data could have a profound impact. Because if your brain is playing puzzles and games, like, obviously you're super focused on your startup right now, which is cool. And I think it's such an important topic which is why I'm happy to have you on. Just take me out of that for a quick second. Just knowing you're a human being, living life. And I think we all do this. Whatever our framework is, we can see it in other places. Give me a four instance. This is almost like maybe inspiring someone who's also strong at this. Be like, hey, did you look at what's going on with the surf current or like with soccer? Or like, where else do you see a huge opportunity right now in this? Anything stand out? Yeah, because I come from sort of a market-centric background. What I mean is I think about how liquidity interacts with each other, building trading strategies, I think very deeply about liquidity dynamics and matching engines. Blockchain is basically markets for networks. That's how I think about it. It's like networks interacting with each other in a market sense. So an example would be, Gary, if my car is behind yours, my car is going to be able to negotiate with your car to get out of the way so I can pass you. And maybe I pay you some fee and so cars are going to be able to negotiate. OK, let's stop right there. I like the way Dustin responded and my brain did the same thing and I was shockingly quiet. That was fucking amazing. To your point, this all goes to the technology. I keep telling my friends, because I am profoundly stunned that people think technology stops in their lifehood. I'm like, you do understand that people were our age 40 and then the car was just invented at that time and then everything changed, or the TV or a plane. I'm like, AI is going to happen and more crazy stuff's going to happen. So to your point, self-driving cars at scale, in the world, now on networks 5G, 6G, 7G, 13G, it's going to get fast enough, no lag time. And now, because I'm in a rush to something, I can actually be in my car in 27 years, 9 years, 99 years, whenever this happens. And I could say, I'm about to pay a VIG. This is exactly right. This is exactly what blockchain is going to do. Makes so much damn sense. I'm literally going to be in an interface and be like, I need to actually get there in 7G, because I could get there in 17 minutes in travel time, but it's the traffic that's going to make 39. So now I'm going to pay the drivers in front of me, a VIG, to actually get me there in 17 minutes, because that is actually that valuable to me, because if I lose that 15 minutes, I might not get the business deal. And this might be worth $1,000 for me. And that could be disseminated amongst the 83 cars in front of me, or 830 for me to get there, yes? Yes. That was an example of how it's fucking rad. Well, I was just explaining how markets, how I think of blockchain is like this big market for networks. But the NLP component of blockchain, you asked what I think about. I think right now it's hard to know what's true in the world. And if you have this big network of authenticators and consensus, I think there's a product where we dump things onto a blockchain. And that network, through consensus, decides whether that's true or not. And so that'll be done through NLP, because that's going to be a bunch of unstructured data. Correct. Here's this article I read. It got dumped on the blockchain. The chain says this thing is true. And because these are decentralized servers, and nobody can really impact them, it has the capacity for provenance and truth that the internet and society does not. Yeah, exactly. Through page linking, the network can decide whether that's true. Those are factual statements. And something will then be relatively true, and we'll be able to have confidence that what we're reading is relatively factual. Right, because to your point, for many years, to get back 300 years, or what have you, 100, I don't care where you go, what was in a book was default into believing. We believed it. We're, this is clearly, the blockchains are clearly have the potential to replicate that energy in the world in 100 years, clearly. I agree with that. I'm still pumped about paying 1,000 bucks to get to my next meeting a little bit. No, but it's really powerful. Like I really do love that. Okay, before we run out of time, what have we, I always like to leave five or seven, 10 minutes for this. You were coming in this morning, we were gonna have this podcast, I'm sure it was fun, I was excited about it, because I knew this would be a fun one. I'm really excited about the audience's take on this. I think we're gonna be able to bring a lot of value from these kind of stories, and meeting individuals around the world, like yourself doing interesting things. What did we not touch on, that you kind of thought we would talk about here today, kind of giving you the open floor? And you can be very selfish here, and if you wanna talk about it, or anything that we didn't talk about. I've raised a lot of capital throughout my life, whether it's seed or series A or B, or even through exits. Truly, in addition to professional VC, we've done crowdfunding, and we put it up on our website. It's an invest now button. And I think founders should be thinking about crowdfunding in the future. And I really think it's interesting, because it's sort of a big digital marketing exercise. And for a business like Trulio, it's a big digital marketing exercise. It's a call to action, where these engaged civilians wanna be involved somehow, and this is the way that they can. And what I'm seeing is that, if somebody invests 100 bucks, that's fine. They could be somebody that drives 100,000 dollar deal in their city, because they go to their city council, they go to their mayor, and they say, I want this product in our city. I'm a taxpayer, we bought cameras, we're paying for storage. And so the idea of crowdfunding, I think is very, very interesting and important, because it can create activated ambassadors for your brand. Got it. So you're saying how humans work. If I'm a human, and I put $500 into an investment through a crowdfunding, no different than people that buy a stock on the public market, and then now that they bought Nike, they buy Nikes in the store, or they like Nike, you're saying that the crowdfunding allows them to be micro business development and awareness engines, and that in general, from a psychology standpoint, and a strategy standpoint, might be highly interesting, because it's not just about the $409 that they put in, which might be quite small, and a $50 million raise, it's that they may actually trigger behavior that leads to higher economic impact on the business. That's exactly right. Especially at scale. If 13,000 people do that, it could get real interesting real fast. It might not be right for every business. For a business like Trulio, which right now is B2B, the first 100 departments are early adopters. Yeah, where are you guys? Where, how far along are you? 20 departments out of 18,000 in the US. So there's 18,000 police departments in the US, and you're in 20 right now, so we're very, very, very, very early. How long has the longest one been using it? 16 months, like since day one. And like without tooting your own horn, like give us a, I assume, like there's gotta be something that's really cool. Yeah, so we learned to embed academics in these departments to measure outcomes. So in this department, Alameda, California, in the Bay Area, they had a 36% drop in use of force, 36%. Got it, in the 16 months, they've had 36% less need for force because of all the training and from the insights that we were able to create. Yes, because, yeah, officers have better outcomes. There's less non-compliance, they're less transactional, right? The cops are smart. Once they know their camera data is being analyzed, they're a little bit more patient, they speak differently. The machine learning and all this, like I assume the more the, so at scale, the more you continue to analyze, the more you're gonna get further down the pipe of like another subtle insight, another subtle insight. So this thing gets stronger over time, yes? I'm building a virtual sergeant. I mean, that's what we, I don't think departments are gonna hire more cops. I think we're gonna build virtual bots that automate supervision, coaching, and they promote professionalism. They're gonna create content for departments. Do you think robots, what about robots that are, like RoboCop, I didn't even have to think for, like where do you think that, like do you think that's gonna be wild, right? Yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure if they'll be robots. I would definitely listen to RoboCop more than a regular robot. If a robot, if a cop was like, yo, yo, don't like, like I like to like probably J-Walk too much here in the city. Like if a cop was like, yo, I'm like, yo, I'm so sorry. But like if a robot did it, I'd probably run back. Like the robot would probably scare the shit out of me, like laser me or something, you know what I mean? Yeah. Do you think we're more likely to listen to robots than humans? I think we're more likely to listen to female cops, actually. We need more female state. They give explanation about 12 times the rate as a male. Makes sense. They're always better than us. They have to be more strategic in communication. We do. I got three girls. I agree. You're such fuck ups. So that's interesting. Right to your point. This is where the data gets super duper, duper, duper interesting and becomes more actionable. I love it. Again, I know we're running out of time. Any, just cause I'm so fascinated by this. Again, everybody listen to podcasts. I think you can sense that I'm trying some new stuff from a content and marketing standpoint. Please give me feedback on what you think about. Obviously this is one man, one startup, one subject matter, but the concept of emerging things and emerging individuals that you may not just be able to find every day, not the same people that are being talked about every day. Love your feedback on this. Cause I personally am enjoying this conversation quite a bit. Last parting shots. Appreciate you, Gary. Yeah, appreciate you. Thanks for the opportunity. Of course. Thanks so much. But that's very sweet. But one last parting shot like a RoboCop or something. Anything else cool or interesting from being a founder or a reason capital or anything in the machine learning space? As a founder, have an athlete mindset. Get sleep, don't do drugs, limit your alcohol. Think about your physical being like an athlete. It's really, really hard. And your team needs you to be making the best decisions possible. Love it. Thank you for being on the show. Appreciate you. Thanks, Gary. Thank you, sir. That was fun. Yeah.
