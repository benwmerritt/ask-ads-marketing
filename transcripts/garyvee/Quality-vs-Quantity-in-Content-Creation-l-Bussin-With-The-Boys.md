People seeing success, it's like that kind of dump chart you see on a teacher's wall, it's like an iceberg and the success and everything, it's all the hard work. And a lot of your videos you talk about like from 06 to 07, how like you started to get into the content game, not knowing that's the way it is at the time, but the struggle of doing 365 days before you get a call to go on a late night show. People don't understand like the wife's looking at you, your friends are looking at you, you're like, Gary, what the hell is he doing, man? Like he's just out here acting crazy. And especially back then, YouTube was four months old when I started my show. Like what you're doing now, people are like, oh, podcasts can hit, like it's known. When I was like, I'm doing this, people thought I lost my mind. Attention is the number one asset. I love that, let's go Twitch. Such a pleasure, such a pleasure. Glad we made it, glad we made it. So happy to be here, so happy to be with all of you. What's up man, such a pleasure. Yeah, thanks for going on. What's up man, such a pleasure. Ma, I know you, what's up man? Hey. One, two, one, two. I made the kick it off, I have to say, like you've been a very indirect influence in like the ascendance of busing. Just I came upon you probably, a lot of your stuff was getting in front of me like my first or second year in the league. But just to give you those flowers, like it's so humbling. Thank you brother, thank you for saying that. Means, you know, this whole year right now, because I was in it early, like it feels crazy to have a positive impact on people from afar, and so I appreciate it, it makes me feel super nice. I'm pumped to be on the show by the way. Yeah, you talk about like, obviously people seeing success, it's like that kind of dumb chart you see like a teacher's, on a teacher's wall, was like an iceberg, and the success and everything, it's all the hard work. That's right. And a lot of your videos you talk about like from 06 to 07, how like you started to get into the content game, not knowing that's really, that's the way it is at the time. But the struggle of doing 365 days before you get a call to go on a late night show, people don't understand like, your wife's looking at you, your friends are looking at you, and you're like, Gary, what the hell is he doing, man? Like he's just out here acting crazy. And especially back then, when I told everybody I'm gonna do this, YouTube was four months old when I started my show. So like, it wasn't like people, like what you're doing now, people are like, oh, podcasts can hit. Like it's known. When I was like, I'm doing this, people thought I lost my mind. Like it can't be overstated. Like my brother, excuse me, my best friend Brandon and my dad, because in my cousin Bobby, the core four of us who were running the liquor store at the time, I was the guy. I was buying the wine, I was selling the wine, I was marketing, I was on the floor. And now I'm taking all this time to record in front of a camera and put it on the internet. That would be like me telling you right now, listen, the three of us have to go to Mars, set up a lemonade stand, and it's gonna work. It was that far fetched to them. And so, yeah, but for me, my whole life, you know, this may really resonate with you in a lot of the audience. I'm almost like Reverse Allen Iverson. Like I like the practice. I like the crap that no one sees. It's a really important part to me. I enjoy when it's small. Like I'm doing Twitch right now. Live streaming, are you doing it right now actually Dustin? You got a little something in and out? But like in my office, I'm sitting in my office doing 10 hours of meetings and Twitch is running in the background, 90% on mute. And people are watching it, but not a lot. Like why would you watch that? It's like almost ASMR for entrepreneurs. I unmute a bunch and do questions. I give away stuff, we hang out. But I watch it, I'm like, okay, hundreds of people are watching now, but I already know my brain. Tens of thousands of people are gonna watch me go about my business day in six years. And like that gets me off more than anything. I love the hundred views, not the millions of views I have on social. I'm almost like, it's almost why I think I love the Jets so much. The chase to finally get it is more interesting to me than getting it. When the Yankees won the World Series, I stopped watching the Yankees. But like the climb, the behind the scenes. You get this multiple layers to everything you just said because we can go into the Jets thing where it's like, when you finally get to the result, your process has been all the way apart of like, is the fulfillment gonna be there? Or are you gonna look back and be like, damn the process was truly the best part? I already know the process is the best part. But you haven't bought it yet. I know. But sitting there with a green suit on, signing the piece of paper, and you're gonna be like, that process was tight. I believe that that is at 48. I believe that I'm very confident telling you that I already know. Like to the point where like I almost, and I'm gonna say this, this may sound weird to a lot of people. I'm curious if I get some DMs or emails about this from people that have experienced this. I'm actually so extreme on process over the thing that I sometimes almost get like this weird, not depression, but like, I don't know. I don't even, I'm gonna try to articulate it because this is what I do, but like, I'm almost weirdly scared of how not great that moment might be. Almost to let that, like, I don't know. I'm so into the chase that getting it is like, like, like I don't, it's actually, I think it's a little fucked up, and I'm working on this. I'm trying to be better at smelling the roses and enjoying, my brother, who's 11 years younger to me, has been very wise on this with me in my whole life. Like, we would just do these things when he was 22, we started the company, and like a lot of great things have happened over the last 14 years, and like, he kinda, he's like, bro, like, good things would happen. We sold a piece of our company to Stephen Ross, who owns the Miami Dolphins. That was like a meaningful event at the time. University mission event. That's right. Big event. Like, change the course. Mainly, I was very enthralled to do it, because I knew for AJ would be money that really changed his life. At that point, being in his young 20s, like, it was a real catalyst. Like, it hits the bank account. It looks weird when you've got those kinda dollars in your account and you've had it. It looks like a phone number. You know, and I was like, no, like, I don't know. Like, I didn't even, like, I don't know. Like, it's very consistent in my life. I just, I'm obsessed with the chase, and I think a lot of people listening can resonate. Other people enjoy the winning over and over, and it is about the trophies and the success. I like the process. And by the way, I'd like to be a little bit better about smelling the roses and enjoying these big moments. I just like the game. I like the practice. I like the grind. When you say you work on it, how do you work on it? Meaning, how am I working on trying to enjoy the rose? I'm talking to myself about it. I think we all do that. Like, I think everyone has an inner dialogue. We all talk to ourselves about shit. Every one of us right now, us in front of the camera, the crew behind the camera, and definitely everybody who's watching, we know some shit right now that we wish we were doing better or something that's bothering us. And you know this, we all talk ourselves into a tipping point where we do something about it. I try to get better and better at making, fixing it, or making it better, happen faster than dragging it out. That's what I'm working on. Do you utilize like a resource, like a mentor or a group of guys or therapists or? Ish on all fronts. You know, I think not having a troop, like my parents in a lot of ways are the only thing close to a mentor. You know, I need to be better at being a little bit more vulnerable with my inner circle. Like, I was born in the Soviet Union. I came to America. My dad starts working every minute. He was never around because he was trying to provide for the family. My mom was only 20 years older than me. I had a sister who was three years younger. And as long as I can remember, I'm talking like six, seven, my mom's like, you're the leader for your sister. And I grew up in the 80s. We'd go outside and play all day. So I actually like actually had to keep an eye on her. And I was like eight and she was five. And we're just in the wild. You know, back in the day, we did a different, you know? Like crossing the rail. I mean, we would cross the street. Cars are like kids' Frogger. Like, you know, like, like I really like, and it was just like ingrained in my mom by my mom, like you take care of her. You take care of her. I naturally had my personality. So I was definitely also like a leader amongst our friends. And so like, and then I started being very important in my family's liquor store business as a teenager. And by the time I was 22, I was running the business. It's always been on my shoulders. And I always felt like I was the guy emotionally and financially for everything that I've ever been a part of. You know, I didn't feel like I had permission for the vulnerability. I felt that if I showed cracks, everything would tumble. And so that's the era I grew up in. That, you know, and honestly, a lot of it works for me. 95% of the time it works perfect. I like it. I want to take the last shot at the buzzer. Like I want to be down. I want the Montana versus Bengals moment. Like if I was ever a quarterback, please give me Super Bowl. The last drive of the game, go to win it. Like I live for that, right? I live for it. Even the pressure I put myself on when I do something like this. This is in Super Bowl game winning drive. But I walk in subconsciously saying, I'd like to say something that really helps someone on the other side. When you say that to me when I first walk in, that's everything. Like why wouldn't you want to have a positive impact on other human beings? It's the best. So I like pressure. I like putting it on me. But I'm very self soothing. Meaning this is very left field, so bear with me audience. There's something weird when I see a cat licking themselves. Like right? I've always been fascinated by it. I never understood why. I'm like, that's weird. Like I was like, but I always would take note of it. I was looking around like, yeah, I'm sorry everyone. But I'm really like in third grade, ninth grade. I always wondered like. But yeah, I told him not to do the cat thing. He's doing the cat thing again. It's funny. The cat thing is like something a lot of people. I just said, have you ever heard me talk about this? Maybe once or twice, right? This is not a thing I bring out often, but it's been in my mind. I there's something I really enjoy of when I most I'm feeling pressure, the most it's not going well. I kind of like going into like the shower and like just like thinking and like it's almost like an action movie or like a superhero cartoon. Like I feel like I can fix myself. You know, like those sci-fi things where like the cut off the arm and the arm gets grown back in scene. That's me emotionally. Like I get a lot of I have this thing where I'm able to do it. And I rely on that almost more than anything else. And I'm not sure if I look back at this clip in 20 years and be like, that was naive. I should have used and I can sense a piece of that. But, you know, it's really hard when you're 48 and you're this happy. And you're not happy. I'm not happy because of my notoriety or financial reasons. I've always been like this. You know, I've always been happy because I keep shit simple. I think people complicate life. Like you can have all the money, all the fame, all the sponsors. And then you guys are having a crushing week right now. It's cruising. I love watching you from afar building. But you know this, God forbid, if you get a text right now and someone you love is in trouble, like health, like real shit, you don't give a fuck about this. And honestly, I think about that every day. Nothing I'm doing professionally matters. I'm completely detached from my success and notoriety. I just want the people I love to be healthy and good. I just want to wake up and play my game, which is being an entrepreneur. I always envy. I always wanted to be an athlete when I was a kid, like a lot of guys. But then when I got older, I was like, wait a minute. Athletes go through this such hardcore transition like the thing you loved and were best at, you're going to stop in your football late twenties. You're a child. If you're lucky, if it goes phenomenal, all time phenomenal, mid 30s, late 30s. You're a child. A 37 year old that's watching this right now has no comprehension of how young they still actually are. Society has taught us the wrong shit like you're supposed to have your life figured out at 22. It's ludicrous. Like, I don't know. I think I think so. These are the things that run through my mind and like are my emotional framework. It seems like the best way your best therapy is being by yourself through thoughts. Yes. And I'm my therapist and there's something really powerful there. That being said, I've gone to therapy. I find it very valuable. I'm pumped. People are doing it. I love that people are doing ice bats. I love that people are doing, you know, meditation. I love that people are doing walks and exercise and reading. And like, I think just like anything in life, everybody is watching of the seven to 10 things that we all know can make your life better. We all have a mix of the one or two that works best for us. My big thing to myself and to everyone is try them all and see what works for you. Like for, you know, and so I'm pumped when people sit and set out to meditate and that works for them. I feel like I'm meditating every minute. I feel like I'm meditating right now in the meta of this interview. I'm locked in with y'all and the audience, but there is a part of me in the back of my head right now that's also kind of like zenning out. And I was just like, isn't this great? Be grateful. Like gratitude, I think, is a currency that runs heavy through me. And I think it's something I want the world to be thinking about more because I think we spend way too much time complaining of what we don't have versus spending our energy on being grateful for what we do have. You said something during all this about your process and everything. Talking about the cat and being like, I might look back on this in 10, 15 years. Maybe like I probably should have gone about that. Yeah. Since you've been in the Internet game for so long, yes, you can truly go look back. Yes. And essentially watch film on yourself. Yes. The way you approach stuff. What are some things you've looked back on the past where you're like, OK, I can see where I navigated that incorrectly or not incorrectly, but I see things a little bit differently now. This is a great question. And I really need people. You should be. It's a great question. It was really well done. It was pretty well done. It was very contextual to the moment. A little improv, but macro. I thought it was really good. Uh, the one, the thing that stands out here, and I this, I'm excited about answering as well. Things are contextual. So I think the thing that people beat people up about, this is why cancel culture is so flawed. People trying to rewind shit from 29 years ago and yell at people for what is a social norm now shit changes. So when I was making videos in 2008 and being like, yo, you got to go hard at 9 p.m. To midnight, at that point, everyone was out of a job. The economy collapsed. And the internet was exploding. I was right when someone like brings it up now, 15 years later, and be like, oh, people were burning out. I'm like, people even know what the fuck burning out was then. People weren't worried about burnout. People were worried about fucking paying their bills. So I think a lot of what I look back at, what works for me, that I highly talk to a lot of content creators, influencers about, is like, never say something you don't believe. The amount of people that say shit that they don't believe in, only with the hope of going viral, is a fucking disaster. No million views is worth looking back at and being like, you're an idiot. So the reason I don't have a lot of answers to your question, is because everything that's ever come out of my mouth, I mean. So I feel good there. But I think what's interesting is to look back at context. I think the things that I think about is. I think the middle purple is the game. I think America has gotten way too red and way too blue. And purple is the magic. So when I look at things back, sometimes I didn't create a hedge or a context point to my overall thought. So I'll give you a great one that's happening now. I'll break it fully down since we have a minute. As you two may know, and as some of the people who are watching who have seen my content, I believe in volume of content. I believe it's crazy for you to do this show with me and not put out one hundred fifty clips from the show. But when I say one hundred fifty, people take it and I don't do a good enough job to say not one hundred fifty on Instagram. One hundred fifty. For example, I think twelve YouTube shorts posts from this are important because if you title it properly, YouTube's the second biggest search engine. And somebody might watch a clip from this in three years and discover you guys because YouTube works differently than TikTok. Then there's TikTok, then there's Facebook. Do you guys post clips on Facebook? Yeah, more because it's a supply and demand issue right now. I'm pretty sure you don't post on Pinterest. It's probably unlikely that you post on LinkedIn. LinkedIn, I would argue, is your biggest opportunity for your audience and how you roll. So when I think it, but I'll say in a clip, I'll look back and be like post 40 times a day and people people take it as like in their one channel and they're like, that's stupid or I don't get it or I can't. Another thing that I've been thinking through, for example, because I've been speaking of volume of content for seven years, is I take for granted that I've made good content. You're making a good show. It has the potential to have seven or 12 or 15 pieces of content. I think things now more and I have an art. I've always thought of it this way, but I didn't articulate it. That is a quality quantity framework. You should post 40 times a day over seven different platforms. If you have quality posting for the sake of postings, not going to do anything for anyone. So I think about those kind of things where in the speed that I talk, because I get hyper and excited in the fact that sometimes it's limited, you know, you only have limited time. We're trying to get to a lot of stuff. Sometimes I don't finish out all the sentences or all the context. And that sometimes out of context, I'm like, Oh, crap, I wish I had a two more sentences because I know the audience took this out of context. There was when people were making fun of me of like, I was like, imagine your family being dead and like, and that one super viral in TikTok. I laugh at that because kids will roll up on me in the airport. Like imagine your family said, and I'm like, I realized that they didn't get the full context of what I was trying to say, which is like, if if you actually did, you could imagine how grateful you'll be. But out of context and then clipped or stitched, it can seem a little silly. So it's those full thought out things that I leave on the table at times that I would look back on and be like, I wish I had three more sentences of context. Yeah. What was that quote? It's like shooting them in the fucking face. Yeah. Imagine if someone exactly I'm trying to make it in that talk that that got clipped on. There was just a lot of like complaining, like just complaining and complaining. So by the time I got to the 18th question, I'm like, I'm like, you guys are so entitled. Imagine horrible things because horrible things do happen. As we sat here during this podcast, some bad things happen to people that is sad. They lost someone they loved like bad stuff. And like, you know, I think about, I don't know how not to think about that. Like there's almost a billion people on earth that don't have access to clean water. Do you know what saying that is? Like, like, I don't know. I don't I don't know how not to. I don't know how to unsee that. There is literally 780 million people right now, predominantly in Africa and parts of India and parts of Asia that literally within a 12 hour window can't get to a cup of fresh water. And then I have to listen to DMs about like, why don't I have a million dollars? Yeah. Like I just don't like, do you understand that every human being that's in Las Vegas right this minute for this week should fucking kiss the ground and be fucking thankful as fuck? They have nothing to complain about in real eight billion people in life. But that's not how life works. You live in your little reality and when shit goes awry within your reality, it's annoying because you have it so good and you haven't contextualized the macro perspective of how remarkable you there's no human watching this clip right now that doesn't have it awesome. Yeah. But many think they have it horrible. And especially with the way mainstream media and content creators on social media are talking, everyone's looking at the downside without looking at the upside. The G.S.O.D. Yeah, I was going to go back to what you were talking about, working on being more vulnerable with the people in your circle. Yes, you obviously have a mind for business like that's a drive. Yes, process like you are obsessed with. Yes, you have a good piece out there and talking about balance. Like there's no balance to what you love, like all those sorts of things. But as like you spoke to it to like being a leader in your household growing up, being the leader, being a leader of your businesses, being a leader of your family, you do so well, compartmentalizing and self soothing and everything else. How do you like talk about the times you got to check yourself with checking the pulse of the people like in your family, in your household to where your drive and your balance might be indirectly affecting them in a way that it just the wall has been broken down to be like, hey, me being vulnerable here makes me feel better than I'm actually hearing this from you, Gary, because I didn't know you were actually going through that. And that helps the family grow with you because there's this bridge that's real talk. It's real. It's real talk. Yeah, I mean, I think I think it's still a work in progress for me. And I also think people get comfortable in realities. Like there's a lot of like peace of mind that I'm able to bring to the people I love the most by holding it fucking down. You know, and so like people love to say to the alpha, I'd love to have you be more vulnerable and tell us. But then when you go there, it's like, fuck. And it's shake. Like there's it's a really fascinating thing that's happening in society. There's this big conversation of like we want our alphas, mom, grandma, dad, uncle, whoever it is, boss, to be more vulnerable. The reality is, is that there's a lot of insecurity in the world right now. And when the person that is your foundation starts to show cracks, people want to step up for that person. But often they're not the leader because they don't have the capacity to go there. I've flirted with vulnerability with everyone. I've also seen the reactions to it. Yeah, you know, we want more from bosses. Do you know if a boss went on and went did an all company meeting if she or he just said, all right, let me tell you what I'm dealing with. And here's all my pains and struggles and concerns. And we only have a month worth of cash flow. So if we don't get this again, people are scared shitless. Yeah. And so there's a real balance to this game. So I'm trying to find the purple. A lot of people are talking shit that they want their alphas to go more vulnerable, but they don't. If you really pay attention to what people want. And so this is a conversation that will play out in the next 20, 30 years. There's been a there's been plenty of razzling and demonization of alpha men over the last 20 years until we're in a war with China. I have a funny feeling that those alpha dudes that everybody likes to razz on when shit hits the fan, they'll be churned the fuck out of them. Right. So that's just the way the world always worked. People just are very bad at history lessons. I love that. And I also love the game. Yeah, when I know, yeah. Yeah, because the consumer can sit there and be like that. Just the first second. Yeah, yeah. The dramatic pause is a go to how about how about imposter syndrome? Somebody with a K.A. The new funny word that we've made it imposter syndrome. I'm sorry to interrupt imposter syndrome. You mean what we used to call insecurity? Yeah. The packaging of insecurity as imposter syndrome has me laughing my ass off. And I'm glad I got to finally address it. I don't I've said it maybe one other play like, yes, what about insecurity? I was going to say, I was going to say in your very like early stages, like YouTube and you're taking your never you're not in this game. No. And putting it out there. Never. Not bad. Not bad. Hitting on girls in high school. Yes, I know what insecurity looks like, but not in business. The day the day I did that first. You ready for this? The day I did that first video in my head driving home, I said to myself, I'm going to fucking win this. I'm going to be known. I'm going to be the most important in wine business, literally first one. Because I knew I was going to grind it. I don't know if I'm going to buy the New York Jets. You know why I'm not fully in control, but I know I'm going to give it a real fucking run. Right. You know, if the Johnson's put it up for sale tomorrow now, I just don't have enough money yet. But if they hold on to it in the range that I think they'll hold on to it. 18, 20, 16, 24 years, I'm in the mix. I believe that to be true. So you're saying your foundation, your cloth was built as this world of social media comments, fee seeing negativity was there. But like as this stuff transpired and transmitted and what as to what in high school, no one's opinion or peer pressure even remotely came to penetrate the way I walked around. I think that's the toughest environment. Yeah, yeah. I didn't know it. This is fun to say as a 48 year old man in my late 20s, mid 30s, when I started being like, well, I was a weird kid in high school. I was friends with everyone. That was based on me not caring that my cool friends were making fun of me for hanging out with my not cool friends. I didn't care. I wasn't willing to compromise on kindness in the 90s in New Jersey, in high school. There was no way to get to the upper echelon of popularity without being a dick face. You had to make fun of people. It just was the currency. I wasn't willing to go there. And that's where you learned that? Like, how'd you have that? How'd you know that? My mom, my mom, my mom, my mom, because it's like everybody deals with I could even think of myself being like, damn, you see, somebody talked shit about how you played in the game. I'm thinking I'm in my 20s at this point, but in high school, that stuff. I'm just trying to imagine somebody that's just uncompromised. Like I'm not even known. Yes, very much. I'm detached from results. Even though I want them. Meaning when someone says stuff, I'm just first of all, there's a lot to it. Let's break it down. Let's because we're bouncing. People shitting on you in social media should not be met with you being upset for you. It should be met with you being compassionate to them. Do you know how fucking sad a life is that you walk around the Internet and make fun of people or try to hurt people because you're in such a bad place? Saying that you guys suck at this podcast is a little endorsement hit for that person for a nanosecond to feel better about how bad they feel about themselves. All they're doing is tearing you down. They're just misery loves company. You I swear to God, every single negative post that I see about me or in the comments, I literally my brain fundamentally only says, man, I hope that person's going to be OK one day. Not one thing about me. That has nothing to do with me. But there's a key to that. I also don't take in when people give me the flowers. I'm appreciative as fuck. You live through the cheers, die by the booze. Bro, that's shit. If I could, if we could get the kids fucking forget the kids. Everyone who's watching this, every grownup to understand. If you become susceptible to the fucking cheering, you're dead because the booing will kill you. I'm grateful for when people leave, go to Moji's. I'm fucking. I mean, you I wish you could see what I felt like with your opening line on the show. It's like, thank you. It's so nice, but I don't think I'm special because you said it. Which means I don't think I'm a piece of shit when you say the return. I know who I am. The end. And unless you really, really, really, really know me, how the fuck can I even count it? Do you know me famous people that are universally adored are straight pieces of shit? Probably a lot. Yeah, you always see the stories you never want to meet your heroes. Right. It's real talk. It sucks. I mean, like you like currently right this second. Universally adored. They're the best. No, they're not. They sure are. They do not treat their people well. Everybody that's close to them does not love them. I can go to sleep every night and put my head on the pillow because the more you know me, the more you like me, those are the results I see. When you talk about people that really, really, really know you, how many people would you say really, truly know who Gary Vee is? Zero. And let me break down where I was going with that. That's a context one. Yeah, I was. Have you seen that? Hey, we're clipping that. Just so you can get. Right, right. And it'll have you come on again. It'll be about the whole series of this. Yeah. I'm obviously going tongue and cheek because I wanted to make two points. Yeah. So they answered your question on that one. The way you actually asked it, probably a hundred. Yeah. Like if I'm going to like where I'm really going, like would you bet your like if they went to someone in that if they went to Brandon Warnock, my best friend who I've known since 14 and talked to every day and still runs WineText.com. Like if they said bet your life on him, he would. Yeah. Like a hundred, right? 70 to 100. I'm very fortunate. Like I always judge leaders of business on the longevity of their team. It's we took a flight out here, a lot of the VaynerPay. We've been in business for 14 years, seven, 10, 12 people that have been with the company for 10 in advertising that has an average of two. Like that feels great. When I look, I'm like, man, I'm so proud of that. That's only a reflection of how much I actually care about them. So I would say a hundred to the way you asked it. The reason I said zero was I wanted to make a point that I'm curious to ask you to do the thing that I'm most fascinated by is that the only person on earth that fully knows you is you. Because you're the only person that's been there for every single actual thing. Everybody can watch this and you too as well. There's certain things that nobody on earth knows about you besides you. I think that's fascinating. And I've been thinking a lot about it, which is why I wanted to throw out that fun answer. It's interesting. Please. Taylor and I, we have this thing like nobody's coming to save you. Like, you know, if you think about it, you're the only one who lays your head on your pillow. And I, no matter who's next to you with whatever stresses you have in your mind and ultimately it is, is just truly true. Even you like that one player game of knowing yourself. Bro, in such a real way. And my big thing is like, how do I, you know, one of the things that drives me is. I feel a little bit of guilt of how lucky I got with my DNA, how lucky I got that I was born in a shit country and came to America with nothing and had a really humble beginning. Because I think it's advantage. That versus foundation of success, I believe that. And then on top of everything else, with those two good things already going for me, fucking the world gave me the best mom of all time, that fucking molded and built me. I feel a level of guilt about it. I believe that Gary V exists because of that guilt and gratitude. It's a mix of those two. All I do is try to figure out how to do what my mom did for me. Like all I want to do with my content is build true self-esteem, not eighth place trophy self-esteem, which is actually leading to a lot of insecurity. Merit self-esteem. And a lot of that led to me with me. I like myself. Most people don't. And it shouldn't be like that. Everyone watching should like themselves. They're just focusing on the wrong things. Parents are beating themselves up every day. Parents are trying. Of course you're not going to be perfect. There's not a soul on earth that becomes a grown-up that doesn't have plenty of things to say about their parents. It's the rules. No matter how hard you try. You had a unique conversation, a type of situation where you're talking about work-life balance is almost not existent. But if you're trying in all phases, you're phenomenal. I think so. What's work-life balance? Everyone has their own rules. I have friends that think work-life balance is 9 to 5 Monday through Friday. I have other friends that think it's 9 to 7 Monday through Friday. I have other friends that think it's 9 to 9 Monday through Saturday. As long as the people in your circle are cool with it, there's all sorts of... There's a cost to everything. There's just real-life circumstances. The big thing that I focus on is when I talk about shit, I'm not trying to tell everyone that I'm right about what I'm talking about. I'm not trying to convince anyone. I'm trying to share observations with the hope that it helps someone. That's a very different framework. I don't think the thing I talk about is applicable to everyone. That's insane. I just think that I love observing and have been doing it for a long time. I don't even talk from my framework. Most of the stuff that comes out of my mouth is not just me. It's what I've lived in combination to what I've observed for the last 30 years because that's what I do for a living. I pay attention for a living. That's why I have an advertising firm. I'm interested in the collective, but that will never be the reflection of an individual. Gen Z. When people are like, Gen Z son! I'm like, are you a fucking idiot? Do you know how many Gen Z kids I know right now are grinding their asses off and have incredible work ethic? Do you know how many lazy boomers I know? To just blanket paint these observations as wild. Are there rationales to why there's general statements? Sure. Are those things sometimes like pretty close to on the nose? Sure. Like I get it. But like nothing is directly one by one. That goes to one on one. You with you. Only you know. And you have to make yourself happy because you can't make anyone else happy unless you're happy. That's real. I love it. I know we're getting the spinning wheel of death in the back there so... Come on bro, we're rolling here. Can we go into overtime? You hit Cheers, I have another interview too that I think would be a lot of fun. What's that? I said nothing, he was talking about you. Oh no, you go ahead. I was wanting to get into, okay, you have a VaynerSports meeting. Yes. You have your agency. Yes. NIL. Yes. Getting into that, like you obviously represent or your company represents. Yeah, VaynerSports has plenty of NIL and pro athletes. Correct. And so you're getting into the world of college. Yes. I just got off the phone this morning with a college coach. Yes. You know, there's always a new thing of like how the NIL is just out of control. He's like, bro, I'm telling you, every player in the end of year meetings sat, they gave a number and said if they don't get that number, they're going to transfer. Because they all represent to you. I love it. What is your thought on the NIL world? Love. Here's why. I love the NIL business. That's called capitalism. I love all my capitalistic friends. I've got such a fun answer for this. Ready? My life because I'm in the business. Unlimited entrepreneurs, unlimited dinner and drinks with very well to do individuals who love their universities and are boosters to the universities complaining about NIL. Unlimited. Let me get this straight. You are a real estate mogul. You had a free capitalistic American market to make money and you loved it. You've benefited from being able to have the market be an open market. And now you're going to sit here and tell me that you like communism. What do I think about NIL? I think it's fair. I think the University of Alabama made a fuckload of money over the last 20 years. And do I think that the humans that directly impacted that are entitled to an opportunity to be a piece of the action? I sure do. Because I love capitalism. And for every hypocrite that is into entrepreneurship and capitalism and fucking alpha this and winning and competition, you better shut your fucking mouth about NIL because you are a fucking hypocrite. If you don't like, oh, you mean you don't like that you liked it in the past because your college was good and these new rules may reset the deck? That I understand. You're a diehard UT fan and you're sad or you're a diehard noted like I get it. I get it. I see it. I'm going for some razz-y stuff. I'm trying to get some emotions. It worked. It worked. You know, like, yeah, man, I think it's what do I think about it? I think it's fair. And people that are crying about it fucking buckle up. I love the answer. Now put yourself on the board of looking at the structure compared to like, you look at the professional market in the NFL contracts and everything else. The college world is more of just anybody can leave at any point in time. If you're sitting on the other end of the table advising that board, what would be your opinion about it? Let's push for contracts. You know what the best part about merit is? You can adjust. Notice how they're not running fast to contracts. Why? It works for them too. That's a great point. He gave me the look too. So it's a little bit like before. Yeah, that's something. Like, cool. If you don't like NFL, you hate America and you hate capitalism. By the way, by the way, and pretty non-debatable, I can't wait for the rebuttal to why not. It's either merit and capitalism or it's not. Hey, bro, that's. It's just, it's binary. Yeah. Because I was like, you know, maybe some rules and regulations would be great. Literally it took this conversation. I think I was like, yeah, they do have to get it figured out because it is kind of a lot of fun. It's a wild west out there. It's the wild west like every other business on earth. Because you think about as football players, we look at it as like, when we went to school, there's gotta be a sense of loyalty. The rest of these kids nowadays are built soft. Of course. Of course. That all it takes is one. Do you know? And you're like, well, fuck you. And let me, let me, let me give you something. Let me give you a little something on top of it that you guys are going to like because you've met the OGs. You're doing that. And I get why you're doing that. What about the Hall of Fame offensive linemen who played an entire career and made less money than the seventh offensive linemen of every team in the NFL right now? Which is a great point because we had it. So we hit on. So the economy was worse then. Get out of here. Get out of here. You guys should have said you're ready. You ready? Ready for this? Run the inflation numbers. You all did better. You're right. I know. I know you did better. I've seen the media. I see what's going on here. Maybe I'm the house cut out. But now it's 270 percent in the last few years though. Yeah. Because when we sat with, we've had Ed McAfrey on Marshall Fogg. We had an older interview with Mike All-Stotton. They walk out of the room and you're like, man, we are in our world in the whole alpha. We are so much softer than what that generation was based on. Of course. And their granddaddies literally were playing at college football and then an hour later had to go to Germany and die. Like I don't understand how people don't have history lessons. It's so funny you said, even when I was playing. Gary, did we go to the front? We got Gary being in the back. History lessons. Did anyone take history and fucking go to the front? Next time here, it comes in the show where you put a camera behind you. I need more cameras next time. All right. Now my team's yelling at me. I'm going to get the fuck out of here, but I'm rooting for you guys. Happy. Congrats. By the way, real flowers. I also love your audience. I read comments for a living. The way your audience love y'all, the demo and just the vibe of this whole thing, it's real good. I'm so glad we did this. Thank you. Pleasure. This was a pleasure. Thank you.
