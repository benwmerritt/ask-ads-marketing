I'm well how are you? I'm G-well. What can I help you with man? I had a couple of questions that I came prepared for. Okay. And I just wanted to ask you. Sure. I'm from Canada and so I'm in Toronto right now studying at university. First question is honestly there are some days where I feel as if I am working at a very high level of doing things. It's awesome. There are other days where you wake up and you don't feel like you're doing it. So normally it's like those days which I have a hard time. How often are those days happening? I see it twice a week sometimes. It's just because school and other stuff. Sure. It just means whatever. One man's point of view and this takes away a lot of psychological things that I could never audit like real depression things of that nature. But like from like just even vibe I don't think that's what we're dealing with. It just means you're not doing the thing you love the most. Right. It could be. I believe that to be true. Right. I mean like normally it's like. I feel like that's a classic example of somebody who's motivated and is like generally happy and wants to make stuff happen but is just not doing what they want to be doing. The only time I get into that pattern is when I'm not doing what I want to be doing. That pattern hasn't really existed since I got out of school. Right. You know? Yeah. And how did you find school? The worst. I was a terrible student. I punted it. I thought it was not for me. And not the disrespectful. You know it's great when I say it now because people know I went on to be successful. And so I was being fair. I wasn't like a loser who's like ah a school and then I just want to do more loser things. I was like damn it. This is not built for me. Like I don't give a shit about the catrin the rye. Like these symbols for fucking salt are going to do me no good. You know? But like but if they like God forbid you know it's funny history I did well because I thought I saw patterns. It's how I do business. Right. History tells you the future. It's why I'm good at predicting stuff. You know it's pattern recognition. That was cool. Hey don't let these things happen because that's how wars start. Hey don't let these things happen. That's how like you know suppression of information can happen. That was good. But like other things that I knew weren't going to be me. So I struggled with it but I struggled with it in hindsight by being respectful to it. Knowing it worked for others. School's not stupid for everybody. School is stupid for me. So that's how I dealt with it. And you knew that from early age right? I knew that from a very early age. I'm self aware for the most part right? And like have grown into it obviously but yeah I knew it at a fairly young age. And when you talk about self awareness that's another thing too. I heard you know you talked about that. Like Wrecked Book. And I think one thing though is it's hard to teach self awareness to someone right? Yes. It really is hard. So people don't. Yeah so I think the thing that I'm trying to accomplish is I'm trying to just make it more like a conversation. I don't think I'm going to solve self awareness. But I sure love to be a little tiny sliver in all the people. If I can talk about it so much that it becomes a cool thing to talk about as 25 year old business men and women. And one of them goes on to do that you know. I like to be part of it because boy is it the game. Yeah definitely. I mean my mom I don't know my mom also used to believe in that type of thing. She didn't call it self awareness. We had a handy term friend. What was it called? Uttvasha. Uttvasha. Uttvasha. Like how do you translate it? You just need to know yourself. Yeah. She's right. You're lucky. If you're lucky enough to have a mom that believes in that no wonder you got to this moment. Thank you for that. You're literally very happy. So I'm also I consider myself to be not a conventional entrepreneur in that way like you are I think. I'm more of a social entrepreneur. It's something that's rising and at least I'm trying to help that rise. Honestly money is something that is I want it. Sure. But I don't see it as like my goal. Sure. I really do think you're helping people is like the number one way. And of course helping people like you do is a way you get to the money right. It just works out for you. There's so many ways to do the right thing and the selfish thing and there's a lot of different patterns. Some spend 50 years of their life being unbelievably selfish and then deploy unbelievable generosity. You know my big thing is the content right like like I have entrepreneur friends who like buy an umbrella give an umbrella or one 10 cent set of everything. And I'm like and I debate with them social entrepreneurs are my homies. First of all 80% of them are using good as a disguise for their truth. Let's call a spade a spade the 20% that I'm able to sniff out that are legit. We have amazingly deep conversations because I'm like look cool. Like you know my autobiography is called the honey empire in my own head. I think I'm going to build enormous success and I think I'm going to do it the best way possible. I think I think this thing that somebody just sent me is very true to me which is I don't care about how much money is in my bank account. I do care about how many why the fuck am I meeting with you. I need this five minutes my man like to be very frank with you. I need this five minutes. I'm doing it because intuitively it feels like it felt like the right thing to do based on the email. I don't know. It's very random. And so I think there's a lot of ways to do good. There's a lot of ways to do good. And I think the thing you find out is I think too many young entrepreneurs who think they're doing good don't realize the money is not the part. It's not the part. Do you know how much easier it is for me to sign a hundred thousand dollar check to a charity now than it is to be on the board of a charity. I need my time. Right. So I've all these homies who are like yes but I give a percentage back. I'm like I'm like the money is the easy part. Right. How about bringing value to the ecosystem. Right. How about putting in the work. Right. And so I I the most confusing thing I do in public is I leave a lot of money on the table by being Gary V. Most people watching this right now think the way I built my personal brand is why I have this wealth because they don't understand that I actually built a business long before I was anybody. And if I spend every hour and every piece of energy I'm actually just building businesses like the one you're in right now. Right. I'd have more money not less. Right. But what I do with this is kids in Toronto can watch it and use it to build their future. Literally. Literally. Literally. And honestly that's why you know I don't like I know you can probably know it. I apply to be a project manager at your company over the last year. And then I was like maybe I should probably be a furniture program. And then I got the way I was home but I was dead settled on here. I love it. I really want to work here. I love it man. Well listen real pleasure. I'm sure we'll get to see each other again. Definitely. Yeah man. Good luck to you. Let's do it. No worries. For my mom. Let's do a selfie. Selfie. Yeah. Awesome. Let's get some of the view. I gotta start taking it. You have a beautiful view. Awesome. I appreciate it. My man. Good luck to you. I really appreciate it. Yeah. Love your vibe. Thanks so much. Yes. In the last seven days. Yes.
