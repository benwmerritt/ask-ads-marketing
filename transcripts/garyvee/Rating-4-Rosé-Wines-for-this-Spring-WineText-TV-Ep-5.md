This is stinky. Ooh, this smells like, ooh, this excites me. This is like, you played three hours of basketball and you took off your sock and then you went to Wine Library's cheese department and got subjects really esoteric and earthy and you put that, you took a scoop of it, you put it in your stinky sock, you smashed it, you threw it against the wall and then you went up to your wall and you smelled it. Hello everybody and welcome to episode five of Wine Text TV. Brought to you by WineText.com, America's most established favorite way to buy super and just premium wines at discounted prices. I am Gary Vaynerchuk, host of Wine Text TV. After a thousand episodes of Wine Library TV. Hello everyone and welcome to the first episode of Wine Library TV. It is super fun to be into episode five of Wine Text TV. We are talking rosé. It's getting sunny outside. It was dark for an hour because we had the eclipse. Rosé, rosé, rosé, rosé. Has become a national obsession in America and has always been around parts of Europe and other parts of the world. And on this episode, we get into all those wines because we are now into the spring or just on the precipitous of that kind of weather. All four of these ran in that I'm looking at premium rosés. Yes, I would say that. Premium rosé show, but yes, different grapes because you can make them from a lot of different grapes and different parts of the world, which is important because the key to Wine Text TV is the number one rule about wine is keep trying new things until you find your next favorite. The number one mistake in wine is drinking the same thing over and over, whether it's the same wine or the same type of wine. What's the first wine we have here, Brad? So that's summer. Summer in the bottle. Long Island. Jet's country. I give it a hundred points. Summer in the bottle, 2023 rosé, 12.48% alcohol. Suggested retail price, 28 bucks. On average, about 25 bucks. We sell it for 22 bucks, but you can find it for 19 to 35, depending on where you find it, on the sniffy sniff. Get a little bit of peaches. Fuzzy peaches, which is always better than non-fuzzy peaches. Kind of like, you know those yellow cherries? You know the cherries that aren't red? Get a little bit of that. Little flour. Summer breeze. Very aromatically pleasing. Let's give it a whirl. Really solid acidity. Well-structured. The peach flavor really comes through, but I will say that it is a, you know how peaches, like, if you time them perfectly are epic, but if you get them too early, they're like a brick? This is a little more like the brick kind, which means you're not getting as much of the sugar flavor. You're getting a little bit more of the acidity, which is fine. The body's medium to me. It's not the most complex rosé I've ever had. Rosés can really vary from like, it tastes like straight water, and you might as well just get a water with some lime in it, all the way to like really interesting white wine, complex white wine flavors. It's solid. I'm not blown away with it. I've had a lot of hype on this wine. I was excited to try this. I don't know. Not the biggest fan. Yeah, I'm gonna give this wine 87 points. It's a solid score. You wouldn't be offended having this wine. 2022, Whispering Angel, Rosé 89 points, wine enthusiast 89 points, Robert Parker, 88 points, wine spectator, 91 points, James Suckler. Probably one of the most popular wines in the world right now, definitely in the rosé category. Let's give it a sniffy sniff. Ironically, it's more interesting than summer in the bottle for me. It's got more of a kind of a orange peel, beautiful strawberry on the nose, aromatically pretty exciting wine in comparison. There's a little more freshness and spritz, a little jump to it, kind of like a perrier with an ounce of like, like a lemon squeeze. So it's like fresh, it feels vibrant, which is great. Let's give it a whirl. Smoother wine finishes quite strong, little more complex as well. This is definitely a step up. I'm right, wow, I'm right in line with wine enthusiast and Robert Parker, 89 points. Doesn't have the complexity and the explosive deliciousness that I look for in some of my rosés, but I think all the critics are kind of in the same range and I'm right there as well. Usually my palate tends to be a little bit different and sometimes I'm all over the place, but I'm in pocket here. I think it's an 89 point wine. Look, again, in a world where it's 17 on the low end, at a store, at a discount or at like a big outlet, or like some weird states where you can get a deal, this wine really much more is a 19 to $25 wine. And again, 80 or 90 or 100 on restaurant lists or like 20 bucks, 15 bucks a glass. Again, the purpose of this show, this is a solid wine. Both wines are solid. They're solid, but like think of it as like dating and marrying. Do you want to marry someone that's solid or do you want to marry someone that's like your forever person? Let's move on. Daniel Crochet 2022 Sanseir Rose, suggested retail 30 on average, 23 bucks. I love rose that comes from Pinot Noir. The complexity of that grape does shine through in a lot of rosés. Sniffy sniff. Right away, that Pinot Noir is coming through. This is deeply the most kind of like profound, aromatic, serious nose. This is almost like red wine rosé on the nose. Little hints of cassis, which is interesting. Catches my attention, little pineapple and mangoes. It's like tropical and red. Like I guess the best way I could put it is like that I think will land for everybody is like think of strawberries and cherries and raspberries mixed with mangoes and guava and pineapple. So tropical and red is what I would say it smells like. Let's give it a whirl. So let's press that yawn. Is that ever what they say? How's that ever happen? I'm ready for the next one. Come on, look how good this is. Happiness roll gooble. I see many people still say what they want. It's like a white tea. This is really kind of perfect for us in here. You may think that's bad, but it's actually very complex and an interesting flavor. I get a little bit of that, white asparagus. So again, you're getting a little vegetal thing. It's not just a fruit thing. And if you know the difference between white asparagus and green asparagus, you start imagining what that brings to the table and beautiful strawberries and cream. This is silky, this is elegant, this is complex, very well made. I'm a big fan of this wine. I'm gonna go 92 points on this rosé. Brilliant job, great job by Daniel Crochet. I like it a lot. Domain La Saphrine, Bondol Rosé, Bondol being one of the great regions where San Cérez is made. This is made from Grenache, since so, and Carignan. 92 points wine enthusiast, $28 SRP on average, about $27 excuse me. Wine library sells it for $18.99, which according to Wine Searcher, is the best price of the country. Good job you and dad. Kudos to you guys. Congratulations, way to have the best price. Here you can have mine. Let's do a little, let's call it friend sharing wine. Action, my turn. Let's give it a sniffy sniff. Stinky, this is stinky. Ooh, this smells like, oh this excites me. This is like, you played three hours of basketball and you took off your sock and then you went to Wine Library's cheese department and got something from Aaron or Josh that's really esoteric and earthy and you put that, you took a scoop of it, you put it in your stinky sock, you smashed it, you threw it against the wall and then you went up to your wall and you smelled it. This is stinky. This smells like me and Joe Minicow's freshman year dorm room in like the some, around this time when we played a lot of basketball and did no laundry, none. Zero laundry done. Had to wait till like I charmed some girl to like do it for me because I didn't know how to do laundry, still really don't. This is stinky. You smell it, it's blue cheese stinky. It's sock and blue cheese stinky. Let's give it a whirl. Mm. Wow, it is stinky and smooth. Holy crap, that's smooth. Wow, this is, so that sock with the blue cheese in it, when you ate it, it also was pure silk. Like you bought the most expensive silk sheets. If Louis Vuitton put out silky, silky, silky sheets, that's how smooth this wine is. This is a really interesting wine. To begin with, I like stinky wines, but it does go away a little bit and the cantaloupe and the kiwi cup, it's smooth, right? It's, you like it, right? Look at his face, like you like it, right? Look, it is smooth. It is smooth. I'm gonna go 91 points on this wine. I like this wine a lot. I think this is a really well-structured rosé, very complex, and so this is number one, this is number two, this is number three, four. That's the rankings of the show. Good little rosé show. We're answering some questions. Remember everybody watching on Instagram and YouTube, ask your wine questions and you may be on the next show. Let's do that part of the show. What do you got? Why do you think wine gets such interesting in terms of its flavor and depth and all that stuff, but not other drinks? Well, I think other drinks do. I think we've seen that explosion in bourbon and whiskey and tequila for that matter. Vodka's the only one that really doesn't, because it's really, you know, like, so I would argue, look, the biggest thing about wine that's different than all the other spirits, is it's a farming product. It changes every year. You know what insane that is, everyone? Imagine if Coca-Cola and Poland Spring and the Big Mac and Doritos and a Shake Shack Burger and like anything else you consume changed every year. It is the only consumable product that you're like, I like this Pinot Noir. And then next year you're like, I don't like this Pinot Noir. Because it's the coolest, wine is one of the coolest things in the world. It's like a brand that changes every year. Have I run out of time? Bray is leaving. What's that? Bray is leaving. You were supposed to stop by and say hi, Bray Dalio. Oh, got it. And was I supposed to be done five minutes ago? Wonderful, I'll be there in one second. We'll keep leaving right now. Okay, should I go say goodbye? Okay, I'll be right back. Sorry, Ray. Next question. For Frambo Brazil, I know that you have a special relationship with Insignia. How is it now that Napa, CAD wines are skyrocketing and a lot of people are mooring the balance wines than over the top wines? Yeah, I mean Insignia is a special wine to me. The 94 Insignia was one of my favorite wines of all time. 93 Insignia is one of the wines I bought so many cases. My dad was borderline scared and I sold it all. That wine, we were selling for $39.99. That wine's like, how much now, Bray? Over $300. It's over $300 a bottle. So, my career was built on underpriced attention. Underpriced wines that got huge. Look, Napa's really challenging. It's gotten expensive. But yeah, people are looking for more balanced wines. But I don't wanna downplay big bombastic wines either. There's a time and a place. I only drink balanced wines. So wait, you're telling me that you only have main courses but you've never had dessert? Like there's a time and a place. These massive bombastic Napa wines or Barossa Shirazas, like with a cigar with your buddy that you were friends with for 20 years on a summer night, shooting the breeze about your lives, that's the wine you want. I don't want something that makes me think. I want something bombastic. Going to a great steakhouse in New York where the steak is like enormous and it's juicier in Vegas with your boys or your girls and you like are getting a big juicy steak. I don't want a balanced Bordeaux or a, you know, I want like big juicy explosive Barossa or Napa wines so time and place. But I have the gun expensive they have. Thank you for watching episode five of Wine Text TV. Remember I'm trying as many wines as possible to guide you on your journey but trust your palate. Don't like these wines because of me. Go try them and find out if our palates match. Keep trying new wines, keep exploring. We'll see you on the next episode of Wine Text TV. Todetta Michiel!
