## Transcript
On this episode, we do a call-in show again, because that's the only way we do the show now. What is the intro for this? Hey everybody, this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk and this is episode 241 of the Ask Gary Vee show. We've been calling in, it's been going well, I'm excited, it's a nice day, there's a lot going on, there's all the Periscope, Facebook, Instagram, we are bringing it live, hardcore, and I don't know if you guys have been paying attention to the YouTube numbers, I'm sure all of you have. The Ask Gary Vee call-in show kills. People are excited for this show, it's quality, it's good, and I love the call-in nature, it's allowing me to go deep. So right now, the way we've been taking the numbers, if you don't follow me on Instagram, you're making a huge mistake because that's where we get the numbers from, that's where Chris is doing his thing, you ready? Alright, hit it. Here we go, first caller, excited. Hello? What's the name? Oh no, Sebastian, this is Gary Vee and you're on the Ask Gary Vee show. Yeah, baby, what's up? Gary? Life is good, where are you from? I'm from Jersey City, man. I love it, the Jersey love, what can I help you with? Oh man, so I have this company called Sexy Nerds. Sexy Nerds? We are the premier nightlife event for Keaton Nerds and oh man, my heart's racing. No, don't worry, don't worry. Get into it. Get into it because this is a huge opportunity for Andy K, he's a huge nerd, he loves nightmares so I'm like, let's go. He's a huge nerd and a huge sexy one. That's right. What's up Andy? There you go. Actually you got a whole crew of Sexy Nerds out there, yourself being the leader, I already know. That's true, so what's your talk to me? We're in the nightlife space, I've been throwing successful parties for the last 30, 15 months in New York City. We're about to expand to Toronto. I want to get into the eSports field. We had huge plays on nostalgia. Our parties are 90 themes. We bring out Nintendo 64, crazy video games, cosplay, it's like a mini comic con. I guess my question to you is, I'm reaching a point where I'm funding this on my own as an individual and I feel like I'm reaching this feeling where I feel like I need money to expand but at the same time I just don't want to take money silly. I kind of want to take more money. Who owns it? Me, 100%. My intuition is that if you found a sales driven media person and made them your business partner who is 10 years your senior and gave them 10 to 20% of the company, you could explode. Somebody who's got a Rolodex that can get a brand that wants to tap into this audience, if your parties are going off like that and you've got the momentum as the creative director and entrepreneur, there's beer brands, there's all sorts of brands, Frito Lay, there's all sorts of brands that you could probably rack up a nice little kind of six figure revenue business just based on the Rolodex of some guy or girl that works at Omnicom or Starcom or Ogilvy. This feels like the exact example of not about money but about partner. Everybody right now is thinking about money. Everybody's about raising capital, smart money. I'm the smartest fucking money you can get but I'm not going to help because I'm busy. My 100,000 is smart but I'll talk to you like four times. I'd rather you get smart partner instead of smart money. I would go out and get a sales man or woman who works in the media space, the way you interview them is you go into meetup.com, you hit up people on LinkedIn who work at Mindshare, at MediaVest, at these media buying agencies who have Rolodexes to agencies and brands and who from day one are into this concept and you can build a very nice event marketing business predicated and easily this is a seven figure business if your parties get big enough and you can have a sponsor brand. This is a real thing. Nightlife activations event marketing is real business but the people that make the most money are the ones that sell ahead of where they're at and that's not fake it till you make it. Okay, give me money to be a sponsor and I'll give you a two year deal and if you believe in me and I deliver you're going to steal the sponsorship from me because over the next two years it'll be worth way more. You see where I'm going? I see exactly where you're going. But you're the marketer and the creative director. You need somebody who can subsidize the sales funnel and the biz dev that's the partner you need. Excellent, excellent and myself being in the sales background. Well then maybe you need the other person. Right, right. I do need somebody who's my senior like ten years down the line. So I feel like I know what I'm explaining. I'm just kind of in the forest and I can't see the forest from the trees. Experience, the biggest mistake kids are making right now is they lack experience and so what they're doing is they think VCs are going to give them that VCs and angel investors are going to give you money. They don't have time. What you need is an actual grinding partner. It's the biggest mistake kids are making right now. They're not. Everybody thinks that they can just do it and by the way maybe you can but if you're calling in and you're looking for advice and it feels like to me that that senior partner. There's so many 33 year olds that hate their job, made a couple bucks that are looking for that business. Find them. Wow, that's great and Gary while I'm looking for these people any idea in terms of the eSports play and sort of sweat equity I could build and everything that we're talking about because I'm looking for the money. I'm looking for the partner but I'm also looking to bring as much to the table myself so that I can keep as much in the long run. What do you mean by sweat? What do you mean by that? Like who are you looking to bring on? Yeah, I'm actually looking to assemble an eSports team and using the social capital and the allure. Yeah, now you're talking about a totally different thing. Now you're talking about like you just said to me hey I've got a donut shop but I'm also going to start a junkyard business. They have nothing to do with each other. I get that there's some retro shit but you're making it conveniently fit in because you believe in the eSports sense. You're getting into a whole different business. Can you drink out of two hoses in a world where one hose is overfilling your mouth? That's the thing I would debate there. Fascinating. Fascinating. Thank you so much guys. I've never got an opportunity to buy you lunch on Rezia. Thank you. And deep in love. Thank you, YouTube brother. Make sure you get me the name. Yeah, I think the theme of that call is very simple which is there was two very specific themes that so many of you are going through. Number one, everybody wants to raise money in a world where 80% of the startups especially youngsters I see need a business partner to fill out their operations, their financials, their sales, their creative. So that's number one. That was a clear theme. And number two, he was trying to force fit that he was doing retro gaming and that's why he should be in the eSports game. That's two different things. It's hard to date two people at the same time. Who is this? Jojo. Jojo. What's going on Gary? Life is good you? I'm working hard you know trying to hustle. I get it. What can I help you with? So I want to ask you a bit on something. Let's say you have like a business that was going well. You built it up from the ground. It's some custom clothing and a parol. You know sneakers, hats all that. I was getting on celebrities and you know I was getting a lot of shout outs with them, a lot of tags, getting a lot of traction on Instagram and then my account got disabled. Why? Tell me the truth. Now it was like an acceptable use policy and I was going back and forth with them and I still haven't gained access to an account. So I also had a personal account but it wasn't as big as that one. So you know sales decreased dramatically and I'm just trying to gain traction and I wanted to have some advice. You know like it basically took a bulldozer and knocked down my whole business and like without letting customers know where to go. You know what I'm saying? Hell yeah, know what you're saying. This is why I'm so scared of everybody building all their businesses on top of these platforms and not realizing that that can happen. Now to be very frank with you bro, like it's not that easy to get disabled. There's plenty of people that have clothing brands that are getting shout out. So I don't know if you got really unlucky or if there's something you aren't telling me or if there's something you don't know what happened but it's like you know it's not that easy. Something happened. You know I don't know what. What I would say is this. The lesson here is you can never be reliant on just one platform. It can't just be about Instagram. It can't just be about YouTube. It can't just be about Twitter. You have to ways to communicate with people outside of just one way. You need to collect cell phone numbers. You need to collect email addresses. You need to build up profiles on all sorts of platforms. I don't know what other advice it can really give you. I think what you need to do is go back into the comments of every shout out you got. Some of them probably disappeared. Some are still there. Hashtags. I mean truth is sometimes you just start over. Yeah. I know. I mean you know like outside of like you see listen send me an email to Gary at VaynerMedia. I'll see if I can dig in. Truth is I don't have any big relationship with Instagram more than the next guy. Maybe I'll take a look but like you know other than getting it reinstated which is hard because it's a big company. It's not like Zucks is like yeah cool got you. So I think you got to restart and be smart. Build up. You know one thing I think people need to build up is cell phone numbers. Do contests. Give people reasons to give you their cell phone number. That doesn't go away so easy. More of that. Yeah I was doing like the whole mail chip and everything. So I still have all the email addresses. Good. But you know getting somebody to go through the email. It's hard. Yeah. I'm gonna say listen here's what I would do. I would send them an email right now then to everybody and say look building back up my account go follow me here and doing this giving away 50 hats like give them incentives to get back into the following of you. Okay. All right. All right. Thank you. Good luck man. One other question. Is the address for your thing available online that can just send you some gear or how does that work? Yes it's on VaynerMedia. Put it to attention Tyler. Just put Tyler at our work. He's at Tyler now. He's fancy. Cool. Thank you man. Appreciate you man. Stay well. Lesson there. Very simple. Everybody's doing it right now. You can't be reliant on just one platform. You know everybody you know this is deja vu 2004. All my friends hitting me up like yo Google fucked me. They did an algorithm change. I used to be the first result for hats. Now on page 19 my business collapsed. I'm like yeah build brand. Build other funnels. You never want to be at the mercy of a platform's singular impact on your business. Now you can also run short businesses and you extract the most you can. But this is why you always want to build the biggest brand. You want to build multiple things. I highly recommend all of you to build out different places. Who is this? Ty. Ty? Build out in different places. Do not be at the mercy of platforms. Email and phone number have been. Hello? Ty? Yeah. This is Gary Vaynerchuk and you're on the Ask Gary Vee Show. Holy shit. Where are you from brother? Orlando's in the house. Good to see you. What can I help you with? Well I didn't get that last part. What can I help you with? What can I answer for you? So I'm in high school right now and I'm like just a hair away from dropping out and I really don't know what to do. Okay. Well give me some more content. How old are you? 17. Are you in your junior year? Yes. Will your parents punch you in the face? Probably. And you want to drop out because? I mean I really just want to pursue like my business aspirations but I don't know if I like that to get in on my case about it. I don't know. I hear you. So are you good at business? Are you making money right now? Yeah. I actually just opened a Shopify store and I've been using Facebook as to bring in revenue and it's been working out pretty well. What are you selling? Just iPhone cases right now about to start putting bad hats on there too. So I think the thing that you need to think about is do you actually have a like look dropping out of high school is pretty high risk because the world still gives a shit about that if you ever have to get another job. Now if you are willing to eat shit for the next 12 years and live with like 13 roommates in a studio in Orlando like to drop like you know I'm the you know me I'm pure entrepreneur I speak very aggressively against school's value to real entrepreneurs. What you got to promise me Ty is this like you got to really figure out if you're a good entrepreneur like this is a very high risk move like high school like that's like we're now getting into like no high school diploma you're getting into no jobs like you've got to basically know at a very young age which is very hard at 17 if you're willing to take this massive risk because you can't get a job anywhere that doesn't pay anything about the minimum wage if you're unable to be successful. Yeah, absolutely. Like do you like have you like you know what I'm scared of and you've heard me talk about this like are you into it because entrepreneurship is cool now or were you like not breathing when you were seven and always wanted to sell blowpops. I mean like you're really first started like I was in middle school and everybody started smoking Smarties and my first instinct was like I went to Walmart bought a fat ass pack of Smarties and started selling Smarties before I got in trouble. Good that's a good start I actually like that that means your natural intuition is to be a sales guy here's what I would say you know listen nobody hated school more than me and I was able to eat that shit so I mean at some level like I don't know like like why do you want to quit like like like can't you just mail it in they're going to push you through the system anyway. I mean it wouldn't be like dropping out it'd be more like getting my GED you know. But why not just like go have fun for six hours a day and like network and like do like consumer insights and just like like do what I do I literally did nothing I didn't pay attention in class I never did homework and I got F's on all my tests they're still going to push you through the system. True true and then then you just go and just like you're never going to be 17 again you're never going to live in a life you're never going to live in a life you drop out now you've got stress you got no fucking stress now you might think Mrs. Thompson's is a pain in the ass that ain't shit compared to real life. Yeah I hear you I hear you and socially like it's going to be more fun if you're in school like what kind of grades are you getting D's and F's or are you kind of like kind of like still like. I'm doing well. Good. Here's what I would say do fake dropping out get these and F's. OK and like use your time thinking about your business like I used to read the wine spectator in class like I just roll into science class and just I don't know look at your phone when they're not looking or just daydream about strategies. I think there's just a way to play I think there's a way for you to have your cake and eat it too where your dad doesn't whip your and my ass at the same time. All right yeah I hear that. So like like if you really want to drop out of school the first move is to just get really bad grades and get through. Yeah I think you're just going to the extreme. Yeah I hear you for sure. I needed this. I appreciate it. My pleasure man. Give me updated OK. Of course. I mean take care. I need to. And by the way flipping like iPhone cases like it's not a good business like you'll get caught. The algorithm will change. You're commoditized. You're doing sales. You're not building a business. Way too many people are getting confused. So understand what that means and get back to me and then we can have this discussion again. OK. Great. All right man take care. Bye bye. I mean if you told me I was going to keep kids in school I would have paid you real money. Getting getting getting soft in my older age. That was fun. That was interesting. Yeah I mean I think look I think what tied to he's a young man but I think it's a great way for me to segue. Obviously I think I'm finding my cadence here of giving advice on top of advice while we do the phone call thing. You don't have to go zero to 100. This is why I created. Oh now I can point to it and crush it. I wrote about 7 p.m. to 2 in the morning because you don't have to quit your job to follow your dream. You can just quit your your bullshitting and you can quit your watching TV and quit your leisure to build your dream. And so I'm quite practical for all my insanity and that's the advice I gave Ty right now. You don't have to go from being doing pretty well in high school to dropping out of high school. Just mail it in. High school. Of course you can use high school and market research sell to the kids from high school. Dick. Come on. OK Adam. Who's this Gary. This is Gary. What's your name. Hello. Hello this is Gary. What's your name. Oh my god I am trembling. I can't believe this. You made it. Wow OK. My name is I'm so sorry. My name is Kim and I've been I'm a helper. I'm a fan of yours since like I found you. I honestly so shocked. I had a blender. Hold on. What. Hold on. Let's calm it down for a second. Where are you from. How old are you. Sorry I'm trembling. My I'm 24. I'm originally from Venezuela and I'm currently living in Boston. OK. Awesome. But wait are you a Patriots fan. No I'm not a Patriots fan. I I I like that they were able to unite us. Let's not go any further. Let's keep going. All right. So. Yeah I know. No worries. What can I help you. Building my second business trying to connect teachers from Venezuela and the US just trying to help out in the professional development. So let's say that you were a student that we were strict what classes or what techniques would you tell teachers to really use for students concerning many of them are very entrepreneurial. So one more time. Help me understand what business you're trying to do. You're trying to sell consulting or something of that nature. No. No no no. So I'm trying to do a nonprofit in the tech. At Tech. Got it. OK perfect. And so who you got a two sided marketplace or who who is the client that who are the who's the customer you're trying to reach the teacher. Because the client the client would end up being the not necessarily a teacher it wouldn't primarily go through the school and it would serve as a professional development course that would take either six years. I see. And so are you selling are you selling to the district or the superintendent like who are you selling your ad tech to. So I'm selling to the private schools and then as well the public schools are so deteriorated that would I wouldn't even make a dent. So here's my problem. The biggest reason I'm successful is because I day trade attention and understand markets. The truth is I'm so not burst in the current state of private schools in Venezuela that I can't reverse engineer the decision makers. Yeah. So no so so that what the question was would be is curriculum is more entrepreneurial curriculum. So yeah what would you do to have to for teachers to really learn a more entrepreneurial curriculum. I think the problem for me so are you asking about the curriculum that is taught to the kids. The problem is I don't know the current state of the Venezuelan market because I know enough about the post Hugo Chavez regime there. To me it's tough to teach entrepreneurship so I would never want to teach entrepreneurship in places that weren't complete capitalistic environments because I don't because I'm because I come from a communist country and I'm scared to give advice curriculum wise that wouldn't bode well for the kids because they have to navigate through uncharted waters or a new regime. Like so I'm going to ask you because you're from there. Like what's the state of the union of entrepreneurial opportunities for people within that environment that aren't kickbacking and paying the government that would shut them down if they got any leverage. Actually there are surprisingly enough there are a ton of entrepreneurs in as well that aren't necessarily just doing it for the need of getting food and stuff. A lot of them have to do with the social impact space. Makes sense. Like there's Ampec Club in Garacas which has made a huge dent in it. So what I want to do is be able to connect. Sorry. No I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm trying to think on the spot because it's not. No no no. It's cool. Let me ask you a question. One of the things that has caught my attention is how underpriced the attention on social networks in Venezuela is. I would tell you the first one of the things I would give a lot of thought. So do you feel comfortable building your brand and putting out content to that market? Yeah. Because I think I could be able to find investors that would be able to really help out. So I'm a grad student right now and the only reason I'm really attached to it was the need to be able to leave the country. Simple because of how deteriorated it was. But I know there's such a huge level of people who work for me to reinstate the country. The best piece of advice I could give you is creating original content to the theory of this and in specifics and running ads against individuals within the marketplace because it's an underpriced attention graph on Facebook ads. Okay. Thank you so much. I just want to say one thing. I help out so much and so inclined to be able to make honey company. I was actually banned from we worked for simply being a nice person and knocking on people's doors. So I was just going to say I'm so happy that you actually answered my call. I am proud of you. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Have a great day. You too. God, I love her passion, her voice. I think the key last one. I think the key in general of that call for me is staying your lane as much as I wanted to give her advice. I think that you got to know where your limits end. And I think knowing the market is imperative. I think when I look at the market, it's even right now we're doing a lot of transcripts like I'm enjoying so much reading the comments. I'm hitting the Facebook translate. I'm reading the feedback of all these different countries because every market has its own nuances. I've got America mapped intuitively. It's in me. I'm in it and I can roll and I think other markets like the UK market, you know, Western Europe, I feel comfortable, but start getting into a post dictator socialism regime like Venezuela. I just don't know the nuances. And so need to be careful when you're giving advice to stay within your lane. Piece of advice that a lot of you need to pay attention to. Last one. They're here. This is Stacy. Stacy, this is Gary. Hey, Gary, what's going on? Life is good. Stace, how about you? Everything's good. I appreciate you on so many different levels. Um, I think you have the blueprint on so many different things. That's why I had to talk to you. Well, thank you. Where are you from? Um, I'm from Vegas. I'm in Las Vegas right now. Love it. What can I help you with? Um, couple of questions. Um, I have been hustling all different realms from being with texts to part of me, um, no, I start up texts, e-commerce, um, I've called asked me all of that. And I know it's prepared me to kind of have success in the way I'm going. So I started my, um, marketing company to help small businesses in regards to their social media presence and really try to help them to the next level. Okay. But then I'm hearing you every single day, like people need to fall in love with you. People need to fall in love with the brand. So I'm going to do exactly that from my business tips, my success, my failures. I've had success when I was young and I didn't have the models and systems to place, um, to kind of maintain that. So this time around, I've kind of wanted to share my journey with people who suggest I, um, do something else. How would you try to plug that in? Um, to kind of like help me along my journey. Meaning how do you enter weave your journey? Correct. So what, what platform are you communicating on as a human? Um, Instagram, and I'm going to be starting my YouTube channel. Right. So that part where you said I'm going to be starting my, that's the part we need to address. You don't need a DRock. Your DRock is your phone. You need to start creating. Yes, sir. That's it. It's that crazy stays. It's so crazy, right? But like the answer is, of course, you've been hearing me. You don't need me. The blueprint I have is free. You know it already. Mm hmm. You just got to do it. So the answer is yes. Do I think you, and by the way, there's even Instagram, if you just did Instagram, you could use your Instagram account to do your content and your marketing and you could use your Instagram stories to be your vlog. It's incredible. We have so many tools. We're so goddamn lucky, Stace. I know. No, you're actually right. You and I are doing a five-time radio show right now that would have cost millions of dollars to distribute just 20 years ago. I'm holding up some weird fucking phone and like other Tyler's got a camera. There's 40 live streams going on. Like we're living in unprecedented times. You just have to do. I appreciate that. Thank you so much, Gary. Do you agree? I'm trying to read your reaction. No, no, I said I appreciate you so much. I heard that. I've read every book. I see every live stream. Yes, it's in the process like being ordered. But you know what I mean? Like you don't need to order jack shit. Fuck a fucking camera. Fuck lighting. Like you've got a phone. Okay, Stace, what I'm scared of is everybody's reading my books and watching everything and reading everybody's motivated. Everybody's ordering the equipment. It's you know, I'm always scared that all my followers are. You ever see that guy who like buys Roger Federer sneakers and wristbands and he's got an $800 racket and he's got the headband and the water bottle and he drinks the $8 fucking electrolytes coconut water and he stretches for 15 minutes and then he goes in the court and loses six love. That's what I'm scared of. What what winners do, which is put in the practice. I want you to take the tennis ball and hit it against the wall because that's all you've got a shitty racket and your wall and you just keep hitting it over and over and over again. Yes, sir. Absolutely. I still don't believe you. I don't believe that you're going to hang up and do it. I'm going to get on. I'm going to get on my phone. I'm going to use my iPhone. What's your what's your Instagram account? What's what is your Instagram account? S T A C P E N A. Stace pinion. Great. I'm going to keep an eye on you. Absolutely. Don't let me down on it. I promise. Do not let the Vayner Nation down because they will go on your they will troll the shit out of you in a week. I'm there. I got you. I promise. Good luck. Thank you. You're welcome. Question of the day. How many of you are that bullshit tennis player? You keep asking questions. I'll keep answering them.
