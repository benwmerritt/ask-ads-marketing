## Transcript
Remember when people used to talk about saving money? I literally, you and I grew up in an era where that was a conversation, that people were like, that was a word that people said. There's not a motherfucker under 25 years old that even wraps their head around the idea of like, I'm gonna work and I'm not gonna go into credit card debt. I'm gonna live within my means and save 10 or 10, 20% of my take home. We are now in a place of zero savings. Full debt, full debt, full debt. And we don't own. All to buy shit, all to buy shit that doesn't mean shit. The International What Is Good, a pretty exciting podcast today. We continue to try to bring some of the brightest and most exciting minds in the world. This gentleman is one of the few people that has been on the podcast more than once. He's putting on all sorts of helmets. If you're listening at home, there's a spare helmet. Now we got an army hat. If you're watching the videos, you'll see it. Damon John, the world renowned entrepreneur, investor, but all around good dude. And so it's really nice to have you on the show, brother. I hope you've been having a great summer. The last time I physically saw you we were sitting apart from each other at a Nick's heat playoff game and I was texting you. I don't think so. I think I was at Deacon after that, was I? Oh, you're right. That was after, was it? You're right. Thank you, sir. You're right. I just want to bring up the Nick's heat thing because I'm still a little salty because I felt like you were clapping for the heat in Miami and I was like, wait a minute. Tell me, educate me. You know, I got some closure at Vicon because I know at Vicon you sit up there and you say, yo, cats don't get to me. You've got to understand in high school, you know, I've been a jet span. You said something like, you was like, so nothing can get to me. So, you know, we'll get back to this helmet later. But you know, I realized that the Knicks have lost for 40 years. I'm aware. Now, Gary, I want to make sure that you understand. I know that you somewhat think you understand business and pretty good at it, but they have a job. Their job is to win. For 40 years, they have lost. Yes. I'm not sure if any of our employees, if you would say, hey, man. Oh, wait, it's 50, by the way. 1973, it's actually 50 now. 50. Okay. So, Gary, you know, the chef, you know, or the person who does the catering, if after two weeks you're starving and you're like, I didn't eat, I think you would fire the person. Well, good news, the Knicks have gone through a lot of players in the last 50 years. I mean, anyway, look, I know we don't have a lot of time and I'm excited to have you on. I just want to go right into this. I think one of the reasons I was excited to have you on is I've been thinking about just having people that I think are doing things I admire, I think can bring value to the audience at a podcast. And literally the only question, and then I just want to spring off of it, is what are you up to? What's on your mind? What are you most passionate about? What's interesting? What are some of your observations? What are some of your conclusions? What's brewing? Or what's, what do you have closure on that's a full belief? Those are the things running through my mind. Yeah, things running through my mind. That is a big question, but you know, I think all of us really go through that every single day unless we're blindsided by the fact that we're having a temporary form of success in one way or another. And we're thinking that for some reason, it's not going to go away, but usually normally we have a healthy paranoia. So if I have to think about the entire scope of everything I'm doing right now was, number one, of course, I have a dedication to entrepreneurs from Shark Tank because it's not a game, right? They're livelihoods are there. And even if I quit today, I still have five to 10 years of being somebody of value to the ones I invested in. I'm thinking about what do I do as this world has changed? I have remote employees. I have other employees that work next to me every single day. I, knowing taking my inventory, I do not want to have, I don't want to be a Gary where I have 1,000, 2,000 people. It's a lot of responsibility when I topped out as 500, 400 employees. So what do I do where I get to really be the point where I have a small amount of people that I know all their names, right? I know everything they want to do in life. Because when I had 500 employees, every time there was, we had to stop doing birthday cakes because birthday cakes would come in every day. And I was like, well, who's Tanya? Yeah, exactly. So how do I keep it small? But yet, how do I make a major impact globally using all these new devices and AI and all the things that are changing? And then, of course, sometimes you can draw on an opportunity. People like us, I'm offered billion dollar funds every single day. Hey, Damon, let's do a fund, a lovely fund and this and that. And it sounds good, but at 55 years old, it's not that easy. When you are raising capital from people, and if I go around to whatever, 20, 30 people and raise these funds, well, the teachers union or pension, they're not giving you $50 million without you showing up in Geneva or some other place every other day. Now, you times that by 20 people, and then you have some of the billion dollar fund. You have a lot of people reporting to you. You have to report to a lot of people. And then my quality of life goes away because I'm giving it all away and not to my children. So I don't need 20 houses. So what the hell do I need a billion dollars for? So I have to think about purpose at the end of the day. And how does that equate to my health, my family, my friends, and my time? And your joy. Your joy. Yeah, my joy. I hear it right through your mouth. It's a very, I love the last minute or two because what I'm hearing and it's so right, which is, it's a three-dimensional game of entrepreneurship and life. Of course, especially for you and I, and for many people listening, when you, the money part, especially when you don't have any of it early on, it's just so black and white. It's like, that's a thing. Yeah, yeah. I need to feed my family. It's pretty simple. You don't have anything. Yes. But then as you like go through the processes that we've gone through, whether our own accumulation of more paper or more interestingly for me, and I have a feeling you're gonna jump in on this, you start looking at the people that are a generation or two ahead of you. Now that we're 47 and 55, we have a lot of contemporaries ourselves who are in places of achieving certain things. And you just kind of get to this place where you're like, man, I know unlimited, sad, anxious, depressed, miserable, wealthy people. And like, what the fuck is that about? That's not, there's nothing interesting about that. And then you get into a place of like, oh, if I'm gonna play this, I hope you're thinking the same way I am. My great hope for you is with modern medicine and the way we all roll now, 110 is not impossible for us. And so if you've got 55 more, God willing, you'd like to kind of fucking enjoy it to the best of your ability. And that definitely isn't gonna be money at all cost. It comes in impact, purpose, joy, it matters. I mean, you're a spot on, we are at the greatest time and you agree with me. We have the greatest moment in our lives where, listen, you know what, put it like this. If you're that everyday person right now who is growing, I'll give you an example. You know, because we are so tempted and it is our ego too, that is a little bit of a, I can do this, but you go to a place and I love, I invested in a restaurant, I remember about 10 years ago because I love the chicken wing. They were amazing. I said, you know what, great. I go there, I have a good time. The feel of everything, chicken wing, I'm gonna make, you know what? I'm gonna then start doing these chicken wings frozen. I'm gonna make them all over the place, whatever. When I started having to deal with the labor and the inventory and all that, I never went back to that goddamn place again because I just wanted to enjoy the damn chicken wings and I should have just left it at that. Yeah. Right? But today, like you're saying, you know, I heard, listen, Kim Kardashian has gotten a lot of different hate mail because she went to a place called Pernoubo that I went to about a month ago. I went and get this full body scan, no radiation. They find an aneurysm or a baker's cyst in my leg in the back of my leg. Now, my friend who just owned the, who unfortunately passed away, JR Rittinger, who first vacation he took in 30 years on his $85 million yacht, he had a pain in his leg. He went downstairs and unfortunately, he's no longer here because of an aneurysm. So immediately I was petrified. But because I got that 25 or 3000, I understand. I don't wanna be told that. I got that Pernoubo thing. I went, I was able to check it and realized it was just a baker's cyst, but I have a freedom of thought to know that I'm okay. That's what technology is today. But why am I saying that? Because technology is to the point where, you know, I'm having things on the e-boom machine and I'm draining my blood to see and what I'm doing is ozone in my blood to see how much inflammation in my body. Technology is a great point, but we can live forever. Now I'm gonna touch on that Kim Kardashian thing for a second. Everybody's slambered, Kim, $2500, $3,000, but you know what, unfortunately, maybe then some of those people standing outside all those luxury stores that I see online all day long that ain't got it. Maybe they won't be able to afford a bag for another six months, but they'll be able to live for the next 20 years of their life. Or take the point of where we are today and forget if you can't afford a $2500 or $3,000 you know, thing like that. If you work in McDonald's, you know, you get every year one physical, go get your blood check to see if your white blood cells are in line or whatever it is, right Gary? My point is that technology today is there. My favorite thing Oprah did ever, and she's done so many iconic things, was she had a huge audience really go to the doctor on their birthday. The big agenda she put on her show and I watched women across this whole country during that era where she was that person in society create new behaviors in a positive way. And to your point, in a world we live in now, this is my number one point of social media to a lot of friends. You, I tell my friends, you posting a picture of you on a private plane, break down for me how that's valuable for the person that's receiving you on the other end. And you know what they'll do, they'll try to be like, oh it's aspirational Gary, I'll motivate them. It ain't aspirational. I'm gonna fuck you. I'm gonna see that shit. Yeah, I'm like, that's gonna make people upset. On the flip side, you coming on this podcast right now and saying, hey, I'm empathetic, I've been on both sides of the financial equation, but even if you're making minimum wage, you do have most of us, God bless, no matter what the financial situation, your ability to check your white blood cells on a blood test around the world is high. Of course there's third world countries, of course there's North Korea, I get it. There's edge cases, but starting out these conversations is what are value. Like I'm with you 100%. Gary, we're not crucifying anybody who's talking about how many planes and trains they're on and or drinking X amount of champagne and cars, we're crucifying her. But you know what, the point of the matter is Gary, you and I, we both come from immigrant parents. We come from a day and age where we didn't have social media to say, what is the right thing to do? You know what, maybe I can't afford that, but I know how to put a bunch of ice in a damn tub and then reduce my information. You and I come from parents and people who didn't have this information, who they said, listen, we never go to the doctor because we can't afford the doctor or they're wrong or whatever, the same way that I get motivated in following whether Gary Vee or somebody about medicine, everything else, well then you know what, if you're gonna have all these feeds on places to go and things to buy and music, no problem, put some feeds on there of AI, financial intelligence, how to help your health. And you know what, slowly in the morning, when you look through these feeds, maybe you're starting a new year to realize, maybe I should do something else. DJ, I'm so proud of you brother, I'm loving everything coming. This is going so well, I literally just was in Australia. And you know, we both speak a lot, we've been able to cross paths, I still always finally smile when I think. I love the gangsterness of how long that goddamn trick took because everybody, like you said, they see the stages and they don't realize your ass was up, I don't know how long, no joke, but go ahead, let's go. That's what I want people to see, but let's go. You and I, you know, I've always liked your speaking style as well because I think you, you know, you don't have the same deck. And so in this talk, I did three cities real quick and I did it in the first place, so I brought it back in both spots, improv kind of, I was like, hey, by the way, talking about these feeds, when I opened my Instagram, when I open my TikTok, I'm seeing people save a kitten off a tree, I'm seeing a three-year-old hug another two-year-old, I'm seeing Jets videos, I'm seeing sports, like you find what you're looking for. The fact that you just went there as well, which is like, you can say that, like that we're getting all this bad stuff, why don't you engage and spend time on good stuff? You are more than welcome, like Damian just said, to go to Instagram and TikTok right now, which are the predominant feeds for a lot of people, go to the search, type in financial literacy, enter, things will show up, you can then follow nine of them. You don't buy anything, just yet? Don't buy anything, don't buy a course, don't buy anything, get educated, back out, type in, eat cleaner and healthier, enter, follow nine, 12 people, enter back out, how to fix back pain, enter, find a bunch of content, follow that, tomorrow. And I have a funny feeling, both of us are gonna get some tweets on this, everyone listening can change their feed tomorrow, by searching 20 positive or informational or thoughtful things, following 20 to 50 accounts through your little discovery of that, and watch what changes. You become what you think about most of the time, Oprah said, and we can do these in simple forms. You know what I've learned? Listen, they say that, I don't know, whatever it is, all the PhDs will correct me, there's 105,000 words in English language, we use about six or 7,000 of those words. And if you wanna make immediate changes too, my little girl is seven years old, she's taught a new word every single week. And the words that we use are the people we are. If we use words in our 5,000 to 7,000 words, if we use words like drama, hate, broke, fight, ignorant, you know what I mean? Then we're going to start moving there. So the words that I teach my daughter every week is something like interest. If you know about interest, you'll earn it. If you don't know about it, you'll pay it, or love, or compassion, or empathy, or save, you know, these type of words. It's the same as the feeds we're watching, right? It's all of these things that we use that slowly can change us. We always think too little, we gotta go to school and learn financial intelligence right now, we gotta do this. It's the small habits that get us because when you stick to those small habits, you know, we stick to bad habits, no problem, I say the devil thinks you're right. I'll give you an example. I think about it, I told somebody the other day, they said, well, I can't get nowhere in life. I said, when you go on vacation, when you say, I'm going to get that pina colada with a double 151 shot as soon as I land, I promise you, as soon as you land, you've got that goddamn pina colada with a double, and then you go into more. You came out with a 151, my God. I worked out my love. You had to have 151 in there, double shot of that. When I was a kid in the liquor store, the people that bought the 151, I was like, ooh, they're playing a game. Let me tell you, who's really gangsta? Mark Cuban used to drink Mad Dog 2020. So that showed you, he was on some other shit, right? I mean, I thought it was only Grady on Samford and Son who drank that and Ripple, right? Oh, all the hours close. The bottom line is you're not going to let yourself down when you say I'm going to do that, but you know what, when you say I'm going to go home and read the chapter every night, you get the other things. You know, it's the ones who break those habits and are just as disciplined about the positive things, whether scrolling through those things or getting their 151. Let's go. In the back half of this podcast, let's go micro. We went very macro about perspective mindset. I think everything we just touched on is going to bring a ton of value, especially because we went a little deeper on like change your algorithms. Talk to me about in the micro, any sectors, any startups, anything that has got you going, anything, what's going on with, actually, how about five minutes about what's going on with you? Like what are you, like what's going on with you with content or podcasts or... You know, it's a good question. So I think obviously the biggest, to utilize what I have in my disposal, I've come from a business where I had to make your shirt, warehouse it, I love content, but I love content and education. My three P, if I'm going to call it, or the rest of my life is going to be spent on drilling down on education and giving access. Now there's a couple of forms of access to give, right? There's what we do every day. You and I have written many books on this. I'm one shark tank, I do that. But I've become a little more of a Gary V, Kevin O'Leary kind of guy where I'm like, all right, I wrote five books on it. If you guys don't get it, then that's your goddamn problem. But the people that I want to get it is the kids. So my thing is that hopefully I've made an impact with Fouville. Hopefully I made an impact with shark tank, but my really goal now is financial intelligence and education for children six to 10 years old to start them off thinking this and break the school system that does not teach them this. Because what happens if you don't teach them this and then at 18 years old, they can go get $500,000 worth of student debt for a career that I'm even sure they want to have, then you set our country up for failure because then they don't have enough money. And when you don't have enough money, like we talked about earlier, the cheapest things to consume for food are made out of salt, sugar, and butter. And then also we have a bigger issue. So that's my three feet. I want people to say, Damon changed the system and he got a whole bunch of other amazing people to either compete with him or see the value. And that's why I had that book, Little Damon Learns to Earn, that did really well hit Amazon number one for 24 hours. So that's where I'm going. Good for you. You know, it's funny, I love that. And you know, what's crazy is I said something ironically on this point this last week, last week, I also improved into the standup keynote style that I talk. I'm like, remember when people used to talk about saving money? I literally, you and I grew up in an era where that was a conversation that people were like, that was a word that people said, there's not a motherfucker under 25 years old that even wraps their head around the idea of like, I'm going to work and I'm not going to go into credit card debt. I'm going to live within my means and save 10 or 10, 20% of my take home. We are now in a place of zero savings. Full debt, full debt, full debt. And we don't own. All to buy shit, all to buy shit that doesn't mean shit. And we don't own because now we rent an Airbnb or we take and we don't own any equity. And that's critical. But listen, even as I talk about investing like this, you are obviously somebody who broke into the market and really have educated us on NFTs. I just did a post, I said, when it's not sexy anymore and you really love it, that's when it's time to invest. Because if you know that, you know, you know, you know E and you need Bitcoin, but you need E to power all these NFTs and nobody's talking about it no more. Fucking Bitcoin just went up from, I don't know, 15 or $18 to whatever it doubled in six months. Right? So you already know that this stuff is not going away. But if you get financial intelligence from us, you could have, think about when would your money have doubled in six months ever? Yeah. But if you're not thinking like what you're talking about, ownership, saving, investing in early, like Barbara says, buy houses now. Why? Interest raises too much. You know why? Because nobody else is buying and the interest rate's going to reset in another six months or a year. This is the time to buy. Own. Love. I love. And listen, I think the six to 10 thing is massive. And I think you're so on it because I think the, look, V friends, all this crazy shit, right? The NFT part, obviously that's a very volatile asset similar to internet stocks in the 90s. We talked about that at Nausea. Yeah. On the flip side, the mission, like what I'm doing with the cards and the comic books and the toys and the animations, teaching kids at six to 10, which is my target's five to 10 in a lot of ways with what I'm doing now. Later, it will be more like. Yeah. Same thing. Five to 10. Yeah. Later, I'm going to convert them into the stuff like Marvel movies, 18 to 25, all that. But teaching account. One of my, when people ask me, what's your favorite V friend? I don't, it's like children. I love them all. I created them. But when I tell you a countable aunt, if I can get a countable aunt to be cool as fuck and a real thing to five to 10 year olds and humans at 18 to 30, like think it's a good thing to be accountable. It will literally reverse, forget about COVID. The great pandemic of the last decade is a complete lack of accountability. Literally everyone on earth is walking around pointing fingers. It's the government's fault. It's that person's fault. It's technology's fault. It's everyone's fault but themselves. Right. Exactly. It's crazy. Accountability, it is critical. I mean, those are the type of books I'm trying to put out, right? A little Damon learns the barter, a little Damon learns responsibility, little Damon learns all those type of things. And it's also, we have a job and that's the problem, right? As we know, our children are growing up and they all want to be singers and dancers and TikTok people and China's changed in the whole game and they're showing them. But we want our children to understand these processes early. Like I said, you don't teach, I mean, maybe that this is exactly what they probably did to all the players on the Jets and the Knicks. You don't teach people to be a professional athlete when they're 18 years old. You teach them when they're five. Now most of the Jets and the Knicks were probably taught at 18 years old. But you don't teach people to play an instrument at 20 and put them in an orchestra. You teach them at five and six. And I always break down the very simple way that any person should activate $3. When $3, $3 million or $3 billion come in, the first dollar, and you teach kids this in the right way, they'll start thinking like this. The first dollar goes to what exactly they need to buy because they need to live. The second is an investment. An investment can be in their public company, in their education, whatever the case is. And the third dollar goes for what you would like to have, but don't have to have. If you don't buy it, then put it into number two. Number two sooner or later grows because of investments and to bucket number one and number three. But the way that we live today, like you said, with no ownership and no accountability, we work really hard. I get that. We go and buy number three first because we want to treat ourselves. That means we have no money for number two, and then we're paying 18 to 24% credit card interest on number one, and we never, ever get out of the cycle. Teach kids that at five to six to seven years old, they will start off with the fundamentals on what to use with financial intelligence. While you battle on that, which is going to be massive, I'm going to be battling on redefining success for some of these kids of like, hey, if you're happy, like real talk, if you're 24 and you wake up, if you're 33 and you wake up, and you live within your means of making 79,000 a year, telling y'all you're winning. I know what, all the glitzing glamour, I know the Hollywoodification, listen, I'm a capitalist and an entrepreneur, but the capitalist entrepreneur, Hollywood American thing, do not get tricked. You need to fight for happiness and being content. That doesn't mean being passive, being content and happy is unstoppable. Like I'm ambitious as fuck, but there's a level of contentness that doesn't lead to the anxiety. I'm going to share with you a story that, I've never shared with anybody and I just thought about it. So Fubu was obviously doing really well, but I knew when I did my math, I was like, listen, you know what, when I came into the market, Leap I was doing 18 billion, it's doing three now. I don't even know where United color of Benetons are. I don't know where anything's are. So naturally I'm not going to put myself first as an ego. Sooner or later, Fubu will have its up and it's down. I realized I lived across the street at the time from my office and I had a Maybach because I wanted to pull up, of course, all the time at the parties and the clubs, the Maybach. When I think about it, I'm paying for a Maybach, I'm paying for all the stuff. I'm flying private, by the way, you know, I got to fly private at that time because I'm rich, right? When I really thought about it, the five people that saw me in first class going to LA and the five people that saw me coming back, I got there maybe two hours later, but you know what, it was a difference of $60,000. Why do I give a shit about those 10 people that saw me or not? Why did I need the Maybach to go across the street to my office, right? What I did was I went and bought a little property, didn't cost much, but it was in the middle of the woods, way upstate New York. And I said, if everything goes to shit, I got this little place and I'm not gonna have to be, and I can live, I had enough money to live. I can now live and not have to worry about being discriminated. Hey, weren't you the Fubu dude? Oh, Fubu suck, yo, you're broke. I did that, I put that away and thank God I did. But today now, you can live anywhere you want in the world and you don't have to walk down the block. You can have a shit ass little farm that you're super happy with, you can live in a little ass apartment no matter what, and you can really be financially secure with what you're gonna do and put that money into what you really need and not have to, who gives a shit about what other people are gonna think about you because you know who's important, what your kids and your family and your wife and your husband and your parents to be okay. And today we're in the world where you don't have to live in the city, you don't have to have a big car, you don't have to have that shit because this is the only place they really need to see you. So who are you trying to impress at the end of the day? And that's the important part of what success is to you. Success needs to be, are you happy with the ones that you love? I couldn't agree more, man. Listen, I'm sitting here and having an out of body view of our combo and I'm like, man, there's a chance. If guys like us who are in the public sphere right now for business are having a 30 minute conversation that we just had, we have a real shot because the bottom line is this was none of the conversation by mature business men and women in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s and I think this is huge because I think a lot of people are very confused about how to get to a good place. And I think that there's a level of compassion and empathy and sympathy and good that is emerging. And I do believe in the power of merit. The reason I love sports and business is they're grounded in a level of merit that school and politics and corporate are not. And I just really hope that you and I are the preview and there's others out there right now doing the same thing with me. If we're the preview of the well-rounded business combo, I think we're gonna have more successful financially and definitely more emotionally successful people and I'm excited to be on that journey. I am Tillon. I don't even need your answer because I know just like I just said, whether it's when I gave up everything, I started working real officer. I found this thing called Fouble and when I gave up everything and I moved to that little house, I found this thing called Shartank because I was able to clear my head and do what the hell I liked and I love. And that's when my greatest successes came. I love you brother. Thank you for being on any last parting shot that you want the VaynerNation to know about or go check out or anything. Check out my podcast. It's called That Moment with Damon John because I learned from Gary as well. This is what I love about it. When people give answers to a lot of questions, a lot of us are like parents and we talk because we know that's the go-to. I dig really deep in the conversation. Say, hold on, don't brush over that. What happened that moment? What happened that moment? I dig really deep. Check out the podcast. It's on every week. I think Monday and Tuesday, Black Effect Podcast Network, iHeart and all that good shit. I love you man. Thank you so much. You've done so much for my family. I'm not gonna mention it. You never mention it. You never have asked for any favors. I fucking love you man. I love you too. And that's why you're so great. Talk to you brother. Bye brother.
