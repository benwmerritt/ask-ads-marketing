How do you make so much content? But how do you make so much? I have 29 full-time employees on my content. GaryVee is the team that actually builds all the content for Gary's brand. We are a team of about 35 individuals living all over the globe. A lot of people would call me Sid the Intern still. I started as an intern on this team. I am Executive Vice President here at Vayner. Now I lead the brand. Our goal is to showcase Gary's life in the way where people can see the behind the scenes and also get value from all the conversations he's having on a day to day. We take 15 minutes to an hour of his day and make that into his full content strategy. There's been a lot more things that Gary has started doing and the time that we had with him has kept constantly decreasing. So the goal from our side is always to show him what we're up to, get his feedback, get some insights. At the end of the day, the main goal is to make Gary the most famous entrepreneur of this generation. Let me just kick this off. First of all, it's really great to be with everybody. First and foremost, this is probably the most challenging year for my brand and my content. Probably since 2013. I am fully operating VFRIENDS and VaynerMedia in a real fucking way. But there are a lot of things looming. VFRIENDS, obviously the live streaming, that has been very substantially important for the brand. You know, I always say with my content through the years, don't listen to what I'm saying. Watch what I'm doing. You know, I'm excited to go into this year. I'm excited to listen today. I'm excited to brainstorm with all of you. And I'm excited to figure out what will work for us. One word to describe the off-set. Thought provoking. Lots of content coming. Some of the people who are really OG here know that I'm still frustrated that we don't use search Gary the way like I dream it. I know in those thousand episodes of Wine Library TV, I have crazy comments of the building of Twitter. There's a website that has blown up over the last six months on the internet called Twitter. I believe that the content that sits on the internet from 2006 to 2016 is some of the most interesting stuff for us to debate. The biggest impact we can have is not dwell consciously or subconsciously that there's not new video. I definitely also have 18 seconds to add one sentence to something I said 11 years ago that is historically correct or an interesting insight to where we are now. I think the actual future of social media the way we all see it right now. If there's the next TikTok before we go to a new form factor off phone, I believe the way that platform can be TikTok is being even more extreme than TikTok. Literally someone like me getting 91 views of video or the next one getting 91 million. Why did TikTok win? The upside not the downside. If everyone here knew tomorrow they could post and it could get 139 million views, you would be more in said device to do it. That's what TikTok did. It brought everyone in because everyone had a shot at a time where Instagram was at maturity and everyone's like well fuck Gary B already has 8 million followers I have 17 I'm out. One word to describe the offset. I probably have to say like mind blowing. Recharge. Exciting. Inspiration. Look I think what we're going to leave here with that's clear I think is massive. I keep going back to the way this meeting started because I'm excited about it. It's just incredibly obvious that everything I've ever believed is true. Creative is the variable of success. And we can hack but then that makes us just like everybody else who doesn't realize they can't hack themselves to success like you have to be good. Alright thank you team. Really good session with the team really rethinking content making it frictionless given how busy I am. And it felt like it was really productive 3 hours so really happy to do team vibes and it was intense and focused.
