You can't be scared of being something. Being something in the beginning is better than not being anything ever at all. You know, it's hard to get the match when you're just trading your time. I can literally say in the holiday inn, I... Fuck the middle. But these fuck faces don't listen. Mindset that it is your fault is the game. And if you're capable, you'll be whatever the fuck you want. Los Angeles, great day. Heading first to go see the CEO of Activision. Kind of our first meeting. I know a lot about him through reputation. Bobby's got a great woman. So excited about that conversation. Later go and see Media Mogul, manager extraordinaire, entrepreneur extraordinaire Scooter Braun. And then we'll see him again. I've known Scooter a long time. He's a guy I've jetzt into. And I love the whole Braun family. His brother Adam is the founder of Penses of Promise, a board that I'm extremely passionate about. And then a couple other secret meetings. And just a whole lot of phone calls and VaynerMedia stuff, just running the business for my cell phone. And some pods. Vlogs about to... I thought it was going to be the office. I thought it was going to be the office. I guess we're not. We're going to a home. Looking forward to it. Should be a good meeting. Will not be filming. What can I talk about? Let's... Well, I got a few seconds here with you guys. I'm just going to look at some tech headlines. Google. YouTube says creators will need 4,000. Do currency, massive decline. Nothing interesting there. What about Vine 2? You've been talking about that a lot. The Vine 2 thing. What is interesting about that extension? I think it's going to have a pop from a lot of the Instagram Snapchat personalities for a second. And then if it's a good product, it'll get going. You know, it's hard to get the match. So many of you struggle with the match. To get the match to start the fire is very, very difficult. And Vine 2 will naturally have that off the hype of what it was and what it became. And don't get twisted. Vine is the absolute seed that accelerated the growth of the Vine is the absolute seed that accelerated the influencer movement in the youth culture along with, you know, it was YouTube, but YouTube was not mobile centric, right? It was desktop centric Babin. And it was Vine that was the precursor to what we saw on Snapchat. But more importantly, long before Instagram was reacting properly, not copying, reacting. Enough with this copying shit. We copied Snapchat. They reacted. Long before Instagram reacted to Snapchat's phenomenon. It first reacted to Vine's phenomenon and created one minute video. Instagram was pictures. And a lot of the Vine celebrities went to Instagram where it was easier to build even a bigger audience at scale and different demos, not just teenagers. And so Vine has a very important kind of like quick history in kind of the game we're playing right now. And so Vine 2 will be interesting to just see what it does, what the features are. Is it good? Is it bad? My space rebooted. It wasn't good enough. And that was it. It had four hundredths of a second. I think Vine has eight hundredths of a second. I think you'll see millions of personalities, people with Instagram followers, Snapchat followers and a lot of my audience that has learned. You buy beats from property. So I think a lot of you will jump on Vine 2 day one and see if you can hit pay dirt and virality and awareness. And so we'll see what's up. It's nice. It was very good. Like basically the five days I take with my wife every year where I'm not allowed to have my cell phone. I have to put it in the safe is when I get the most thinking as you can imagine, especially by like six hours in, I'm like, I'm going to kill somebody. And like usually I'll just like sit on the beach and like draw out like priorities and creating top of the funnel business for LA is number one. I'm really mindful of like getting my energy into here. Like even I'm accomplishing what I'm doing here right now. Guys, please ping me if there's anything I can answer for you. All right. Have a great day. Text them. Text them with me on it. Tell them it's important to me. Hi. Couple of important meetings in LA. That went well. That's good. Heading to lunch with Scooterburton. Heading to lunch with Scooterburton. Yes. You know, it's worth our effort to produce a great, super smart, clever video where we got out of pocket, but we didn't have to pay for it. You know, James, I'll give you an example. Tyler's going to have a body. Okay. Then I'll go. I'll call in the conference. Phil, what I need from you is to project manage the, the open job descriptions of like interviewing internally and externally. What I think we need to figure out for my biggest thing that I'd like you to figure out is like how to get those candidates down to the final two so that I can meet them and have, or final three and have that conversation per job description. Considering you're kind of negotiating for like heavy discount or free, I think we should be able to fill all those positions by the end of February. Yeah. Okay. There you go. Thank you. All right. I'm cutting out tomorrow morning. Dude. I believe I see you here in California. How are you? Good to see you. I've been following you so long. Thank you, man. Yeah. It's like, I sent you actually a pair of the side where they were going to make the reservation. I know exactly what that is. I saw it. Okay. So yeah. So I sent it to years ago when you were with the Jets and Quicksilver. I literally remember it. Okay. That's so cool. I was in my company. Yes. I built that brand up selling in 65 countries, doing it all online, all because of Crush it. Yep. And I feel like a pussy. Why? Because I had to go back a year ago and get a regular job. So? Yeah. It's just one of those things that that's why I'm down here in this monkey suit. I don't think that's right. I think you're thinking about it wrong. I think you're thinking about it too short term. Like you could start up again in 24 months of something else and like, you know what I mean? You know what I've been doing? Yes. From all around the world. Yes. I haven't told them that I've gone back to take another job and I'm just, and I feel like we're in a time to where if I take care of the presence online, so it still looks like a million dollar brand online. I think that's exactly right. But it's, but yeah, man, I do it's back in the. I do. I mean, you got it. Look, you've got to, you got to sometimes take care of whatever the hell you have to take care of, whether it's the bills. Yeah. That's what it is. Honestly, it's not about that. I think here's how you think about it. If you think about your nine to six as like you're just sleeping. It's basically what I'm doing. Like I'm sleeping through this and then the evenings, but I mean, I'm getting phone calls today. So the biggest struggle that I'm having then within it is so and it was Phil Knight, the shoe dog millionaire or shoe dog. Yeah. So he kept going back to being a accountant. And so I was like, you know what? If I got to do that, defeat this machine. But what I underestimated was a physical product. Being a brand just requires capital beyond what I was able to find on my own. I get that. So yeah. So in any case, I think of it as a minor step back to be forward. I'm running late for a meeting. Hey, thank you. Thank you. Take care. Thank you, brother. You know, whether, whether you fail, whether not achieving something is, is your fault or not having the mindset that it is your fault is the game. You know, just sitting in those writings for a lot of people right now who have managers and agents. It's so easy to blame your manager for not getting you gigs or making you pop, except if you realize you're the one who chose your manager and you can fire them. It's so easy to say you're not winning because your assistant sucks until you realize you're the one who empowers it. I could think my YouTube thumbnails suck, but I also know that I'm the one who empowers that decision. And as you know, when we debated it, I was like, okay, I'll let you guys do it. And even though I think I'm right, like, like it's just that, like if you always think that you're in charge, like your husband's holding you back, the borses ass. Or choose, you know, I think we all make choices, but my big thing is if you've made the choice, shut your fucking mouth. And people that like, well, you've made the choice, but then you also want to just complain about it all day is fucking loser shit. Like you guys wouldn't care if I said the thing for you to do is to go dance outside. If you go out, I have a funny feeling if I told the three of you, go outside right now and dance for an hour and your business will do $48 million in revenue this year, you're going to say yes. I mean, business people care about their business. And so what I'm telling you is that I'm thrilled to figure out what you guys care about from your business standpoint and deliver what I care about is putting $25,000 to $50,000 into the pocket of one or two or three of my players who know that they could never get that dollar amount any other place than VaynerSports. Got it? What's the biggest impact or best thing on your business? Make sense? Bye bye. What's up brother? What's up brother? Get to see you. You made it out? You made it out? This is the crew. We're doing some filming. Good job. It's great to see you brother. It's been great to see you lately. I know Nick really well. Good to see you man. Where's D-Rock? He's not around, huh? No, we don't like him as much anymore. He's doing something. Babin's just better looking. Yeah. We can cough or anything or water. No, I think I'm pretty. I'll take a water actually. Still for you if you want some swarming. No, this is perfect. Gary Vaynerchuk in the house. Hey brother. Great to see you man. Great to see you. Fun to be back. This is the third time you'll be on the show. Second time here. First time I was in my bedroom I remember because I just remember it. I don't know. I think the biggest reason I'm willing to spit authentic is because I don't think so highly of myself. Meaning I'm not insecure. It's just that like me thinking Nick is not good at something like business. Forget about photography where who gives a fuck. Like me saying your business stinks even with all my business things I still think is just one fucking dude's opinion. I understand it's a solid opinion. I understand that it comes with some heritage and value but it's still too many great people who've won so much and things have told me I'm not going to win and that I've won. That I know I'm the same. I think one of the reasons I'm willing to spit is like my opinion is still my opinion and like take it with a grain of sorrow. I think what takes everybody to the next level is cutting out dumb shit. I mean like no question whether in your training, in your business, in your friendships do you understand that if every person who's listening right now started to weed off the friend that is bringing the least value. I mean they're a bad influence. They're bad mojo. They're bad. I mean they're just negative. They're a negative person so they're dragging you down. They're selfish. They have bad habits like a drug addiction or something and you don't want to leave them out. I want to make sure people when they hear me say this like oh you fucking get rid of your friend. No. Just if you audit your circle of who you spend time with if you just spent less time with something that is broken and you added one person that was incredibly valuable your life would be a lot better. That's just real. Such a pleasure man. Such a pleasure. I do hunk right there. Walter. Walter. Such a pleasure. Let's go. I heard about like some guy making a trade and his job was on the line so the kid didn't get to play. So much. But like look at your situation like what I'm so fascinated by which is like just about getting the at bat. Yeah. Just about getting the at bat. Or like Jake Del Home who got to play in a Super Bowl as a quarterback. Like if the World League didn't exist for that like six years well then he would have like he'd be you know. What about the Seabour in that Seahawks Patriots Super Bowl that had the Patriots not won he would have been the MVP and he was working at FedEx like six weeks earlier. And on the other side the corner that made the interception that was the undrived. Yep. It wasn't even supposed to be the same thing man. Same old thing man. Jeff. Jeff. Such a pleasure man. How are things? Using my savage. I don't know. You ready for some savage shit? I'm always ready for savage. About four years ago I was touring the U.S. on Tour Bus with this hat company. I did 41 states, 175 from retailers, all about retail and etc. Distribution all that. Distribution all that. You know I found an artist he wanted me to rap him. I never managed anybody. He gave me a piece of Ralph Kardashian he posted on Instagram, got 5,000 powers. Sold a piece a week later for 1,000 bucks. Now Drake. An artist. An artist artist artist artist artist artist artist artist artist not a rap artist artist. Now mech and trainer, Snoop Dogg, Drake, Jordan Carson, Dan Chon Russell. He was 20,000 dollar paintings, $500,000 probably in top one. All the emails, 95% of the emails people come to 40 yards. So I'm like wow, huge space in the price point art. So I was like I don't want to tell you the brand. Also I don't want to limit our ups and downs. So I was like yo, let's go 72 hours, drop a limited edition of Spring. Made 17 grand in 3 days. I was like wow, huge fucking space for price point art. Where do you get it? You get that bullshit art and IKEA. You don't really know where to get it. I know the whole space. From an actual talent standpoint, who's the best in the world, not even fucking close. From a speed standpoint, I'm talking 5x everybody else. Yeah, like the way we do shit. The way I do cut. Like be good and make a ton of it. And from a work ethic standpoint, I know. Well that's the only, by the way, you don't have to say that part because the other part doesn't work without it. The reason speed doesn't happen is only two variables. Romance and work ethic. Well we have a problem. We don't know why we're not clear. Our family is on the West Coast. We're fucking out of our minds. I've never seen from an artist standpoint, like this one, it fucking pushes the pace. I've never had that kind of answer. Okay. So we're 50-50 partners and basically I'm one of the ones. 50-50 partners in what? In Iconic. So that's what we did. So fucking around in 2016, I owned the big guys they were in Iconic. I started bartering. You have a million, I have half a million. I'll post you twice if you post me once. Zero marketing spend. Black Friday of last year. We're like, yo, we can make some fucking money doing this. February 27th. Selling art. Selling art. But I'm gonna tell you about the actual business business. It's fucking crazy. But we keep watching your shit, which we started probably January last year. And you keep saying Facebook, Facebook, Facebook. You know, finally we're like, yo, fuck. Fuck, if he's so good and he keeps saying it, let's fucking see. Ready for that shit though? February 27th, we go from Square Space to Shopify. We address Facebook. Month one. Month one. Month one. Month one. I've been trying to tell people like, I'm... It gets better. It gets so much better. Of course it gets better. When you make month one, shit gets better. It's getting so good. We're just starting. Brother. I mean, I don't know how... You know, you're busy. But like, you know, look, it's like, like, I don't know how to explain it more than the way I'm explaining it. Like it's much... Like I'm about to become one of the hundred most famous people in this country on this same thesis. Yeah, it's the same thing. You know what's crazy? No one's listening either. We try and tell people no one listens. I know. That's... By the way, do you know why I give away all my advice for free? I realize nobody listens. So like, like, like I give away such good advice, but these fuck faces don't listen. So that means I can still get mine. And then people like, you were like, I... Do you know how much you guys love me? Love you. I think that we have a lot of cheat codes that no one knows about. Yeah, because you're in the trenches. Yeah, because we're so fucking deep. The only people that have cheat codes are the people that actually are... Like it's kind of like if we're using video game terms, you can't know the cheat code unless you're actually burning the bush and realize the key was behind the fucking bush. Like I was great at Zelda because all I did was like, it was more fun to me to find which rock to push than beat the fucking game. I'm only about cheat codes. Like honestly, I will not make the most money because I enjoy too much about the cheat code. Some people love to make money. I don't. I like to break shit. And the only way you break shit is you're doing shit that doesn't seem to make any sense in the short term until you're like, why did this rock move? Oh shit, coins. You know? I'm waiting for my buddy Rohan Oza to come in. I think he should be here any minute. There he is. I see him walking in. Came here for his 40th birthday years ago. We've literally been missing two planes in the night. I haven't seen him in years actually, but communicate with him. He's crushing it. Incredible brand guy. Vitamin water by five. Just like unlimited. Like a beast crushes it on Shark Tank and I'm just fond of him. Looking forward to chopping it up with him. How long ago was that? Six? Like a hundred years ago. Was that your 40th? This is Babin. How are you doing buddy? Good to see you. Was that your 40th? I'm fine. And what are you now? 46? Well you haven't aged. Try not to man. You figured it out. I remember the first lunch we had. Me too. At down in the Gramercy. We were both like, all right, we're going to do some things here. And we're going to do some things together by the way. The good news is we have time, but it's really great to like, it's just all, you know, it's funny I said to somebody today, I'm like, you already know who the 39 players are going to be 20 years. It's actually, so it's probably the reason I've been having a lot of energy to like keep reaching out to you and make this happen. I'm glad we did it is I was literally walking on the beach and I'm like, you know, I actually know already who's going to win and who do I like. Because there's people going to win that you don't want to be around. Correct. It's very true. Correct. And I'm like, I have to make a better commitment because we're all the same character. The same people that are going to win are the same character, which is literally we haven't seen each other in like four years maybe. And it feels like I saw yesterday. Yeah. And I feel like we've been talking. Yes. I 100% agree. I said to myself, you know what? That's exactly right. I feel the same way about them as they do. It's complete serendipity if you're seeing somebody, but I'm going to do a little bit of a better job in trying to find more time with people that I want to see. That's it. Simple as that. I go to the same. I use the word when I did my New Year's post get balanced. It doesn't mean we slow down. It just means you maybe do less of the small stuff and more of the bigger stuff. Right? That's right. That's exactly right. You can pack you. I mean, you do pack a day, but you can just pack my day. But literally 31 kids are going to leave comments on this YouTube vlog about how cool they are that they're pumped that I introduced. They looked into you like, oh my God, you're such a boss. And I'm going to meet with six of them, which is amazing. I got to learn from you and this stuff. I might need to meet two of them and be able to have this meeting. Literally this meeting is happening right now. If it wasn't, I'd be meeting some influencer on Instagram and some up and coming hip hop artists, which is great. Or a client or trying to buy Uno from a tell or whatever the fuck I'm doing. But I've made a mental list of 30, 40 guys and girls and I'm going to triple down on those relationships. They're valuable. Of course. And that's a fucking scooter is my homey homey homey. And I don't think I've seen him in 18 months because again, I realize Ashton too, which I didn't pull off on this trip because he had a fly up to San Francisco, but like, I already know who the fucking people are. I know who they are. Ashton's unbelievable because we've done stuff together. Yes. Like people are saying how smart that guy is. I know. Well, that's because he was a real celebrity before he got smart. And brother, the stuff he was a celebrity on, which was like the 70s show, even the ranch where he's doing. Hey dude, where's my car? Like, no, the public perception was so goofy, but he's so smart. I know. I have like the best. I'm lost in tech conversations with him. The best. Operating at a higher level. The best. The best. Then you've got grocery where some groceries try and match like an HUB and they work off of a low margin. And others realize they're working up a high margin. So they have higher pricing and they do promos to grind. That's right. Costco says you ship direct to me. It's a bulk item. You're not selling singles. That's right. Everyone's got their plans. Yes. It's like the jungle, right? Lions can coexist even though they're the strongest. Lions can coexist with gazelle because the gazelles are just don't come in my way. What happens today if you introduce the T-Rex into the jungle? Well that's what's happened. So the T-Rex is eating everything. The greatest part of that is why the direct to consumer business is going to be so important. Yeah, but what Amazon is doing, the problem is if they had to operate their business on a profitable basis like everybody else, it'd be a fair game. That's fine. But they're making so much money in the left hand. It doesn't matter what they're doing on the right hand. And then they're saying, well, we're going to sell singles or whatever it is. But if your pricing at Costco is this. My friend, lost leaders have existed for a long time. They just have the most macro fucking lost leader. He's living now that. I don't know. But he's like legitimately. Do you have a place out here? No. Where do you stay? SLS. Really? Yeah. Why? Where do you want me to stay? I'm thinking about it. So nice to meet you. Thank you for the hospitality. I'll talk to you soon brother. SLS, does it feel relaxing? I mean I sleep. I could literally stay in the holiday and I like walk in, go to sleep and leave. That's literally where I'm at. Thanks brother. I'll talk to you later. Great to see you Ron. What do you think? Like you guys were talking about Ashen in the beginning. How about from like this goofy thing that Basing has like a whole different monster. Do you think like it's just natural that you'll be pigeonholed as like one thing? Like how do you force the system? Well that's scare. At that scale. How do you force the system to see you as other stuff? That's one of like my personal demons. I'm always scared of being seen as one thing and not being able to do the other stuff. If you are it, you are it. If Mark Wahlberg is a movie star, if Dwayne Johnson is a movie star, then they go from being the rock and from being Marky Mark. If I am a entrepreneurial mogul, I won't be the wine guy. That's all that people call me. 2009, 10, 11, 12, all I ever heard was oh the wine guy? You can't be scared of being something. Being something in the beginning is better than not being anything ever at all. And if you're capable, you'll be whatever the fuck you want.
