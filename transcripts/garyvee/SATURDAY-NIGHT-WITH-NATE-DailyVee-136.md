Heading to the next game with Nate. Love Nate. Saturday night, 6.36. Hot date with Nate. Nate's a real Sons fan. So that's funny. But he was born in Arizona. Got our tickets. Excited Nate? Got your sons gear. Alright what do we got today? It's gonna be a short episode. Weekends are always... Oh are we doing this sushi thing? Maybe we'll have some filming to do. Is Trouty setting it up proper? We'll have a continuation of some filming for DRock which is good so maybe we'll get some more content. I'll go on Instagram live in a second. Actually maybe I'll go Facebook live. What's on my mind? Was reading some comments today here and there. Same old fucking themes. Nothing too crazy. Same old themes. The amount of people that are making money is ridiculous. It's been good. I know what I wanted to do in this episode. I want to make sure to subscribe. I realize I don't do really hardcore right hooks to subscribe. I also know how we used to do the flash up of follow Gary on Instagram. We want to do a little bit more now. But also subscribe. Do a little red one for to subscribe. We really don't. I want to do it in mis stuff. The amount of people who are watching every day and discovering and then not subscribing which then doesn't remind them. DRock. There was something else I want to talk about. Nate I'm on this new concept. Comet Muscles. Comet Muscles. So you know how some people get beer muscles? Like they get you know, you know what I'm talking about right? They get a little liquor in them and they think they can fight. Comet Muscles. So I went back exactly like my sports muscles. That's exactly right. So I have sports muscles. I go to a Jets game all of a sudden they got beat up people. And I want to start fights and it's crazy. But I'm noticing a lot of people have have Comet Muscles. I got into this rabbit hole in the flight back from London where I went back like to 40, 30 episodes you know ago and then all the way back to like episode 12, 15, 19, 27. Be cool if you did a little clip from there. Quote kind of went like the guy or gal that grows up cooking with their grandmother in the kitchen is always going to beat the person that goes to culinary school. You know it was kind of the essence of doing it. He said that that quote inspired his friend and changed that person's life and is now at ironically one of the great culinary schools and has a profession. It's kind of funny. But you know it's just crazy. I mean it's just crazy. I mean I wish it on all of you. I wish it on all of you to know that even though you're going after your own self-interests by proxy, by sawdust, by process you're bringing so much good to the world it's an incredibly intoxicating feeling. I get equal if not slightly more value out of putting in the actual work that has allowed me the attempt for the audacious goals that I've created for myself. As soon as I started seeing kids who never had an entrepreneurial bone in their body who never sold a thing in their life who never cared about any of that stuff and were coming out of college and starting businesses that's when I was like 24 months ago that's when I was like uh oh this is starting to get a little awkward. I would like to just read the very last paragraph of your book. 10.30, hold up. I'm scared to feel a lot of foolishness I told you. That is so crazy. Did you see this? We've been getting some snaps that makes us feel like there will be a little bit more. London, I'm humbled. I love you. You create some clarity about tonight. Yes, the park is going to be closed but we're just going to be outside at the corner. That's how I'm rolling. D-rock, you're going to need to look at what I just saw. Fuck. Jesus Christ. Alright, this is going to end up a little bit bigger than we thought. Fuck me. Thanks for being here. D-rock, help me, D-rock. Yeah! Yeah! Oh, fuck. Alright, let's do it. I started seeing way too much chatter of people not being able to make it. Maybe it will meet 20 or 30 people in the corner. Kind of misjudged it a little bit. Anyway, and the amount of you mother fuckers that have comment muscles, things like, Gary V, watch out, I'm coming after you. And then I click and one year later you ain't coming after shit. You're in the same exact spot talking about the same about things, making the same damn excuses, doing nothing. So comment muscles. I want to create a culture of eliminating a lot of you from comment muscles and getting into action. You know, everybody's a tough guy with this fucking name and they're two cents in a comment on YouTube and on Instagram and those places. It's a whole different thing to do something about it. And so while you're critiquing everybody's actions on the web and adding your two cents, people are going out and making three cents. You understand? So all you comment heroes, all you people with comment muscles, wake the fuck up. Nobody gives a shit. 99% of people think you're trolls so I just let you stay in my comments and I smile. I smile. Because I know how this ends up. And I win and you lose. Usually I just end it with I like my dramatic little and I know how it ends up and we cut into some fucking music. Not this night. This night I'm going to tell you what happens. What happens is you keep commenting and nothing fucking happens and I continue to do and I'm going to cry and then in 20 fucking 29 you're going to leave a comment on whatever on doodoo.com and you're like you know what fuck it. I got really handed to Gary Vee. He did do it. You're exactly right motherfucker. I did do it. Because I've already done it and I'm going to continue to do it. And you're going to leave your snarky ass comment with no fucking icons. I just feel bad. I want you to do better than that. Because I'm going to get mine. You're not bothering me for shit. I like it. Keep leaving them. Fires me the fuck up. Love it. You know me Nate. This is how I play basketball. I like it. It's the only... Nate tell them the only time I don't know if you even know this anymore because you really kind of retired from basketball but like I'm not going to feed you it but like there's no way for me to ask without feeding you it. I think I genuinely hit more baskets when somebody's hands in my face than when people leave me wide open. You like the game. I do. It's just like I'm driven by it. It's why I think I really... I remember when you hit me in the head. That was a bad moment. Why do you have to bring that up? I was on a roll. You like just killed my vibe. You killed my vibe. Do you remember how mad AJ was at me? Oh yeah. AJ got you. AJ was the most upset. I didn't know what happened. You were fine. What do you mean? Don't... Yeah. Oh yeah. What happened was you know like it was a little bit harder than it needed to be. Here's the bottom line. I like the back and forth. You're a classic 2010 basketball player. I come from the 90's when like those kind of hits were... You know what I'm talking about. Those 90's Nick's teams. Yeah, that was fine. I felt it was super appropriate. I wasn't that upset. You know what? To your credit, I don't want to put you on blast. You're right. Everybody else is more upset. Because you're a competitor too. I wrote that whole medium post about him. Link that shit up. Nate's fucking here. Nate's sitting in this car right now because he's good at volleyball. Antennas. I've never lost to Nate and Tennis. Yeah, that hurts, right? You wish you won that five. What was the best one? You had five. Five two? Five two, right? Yeah, that hurts. So what was I going to say? Oh, so the reason I think I'm very built for it. This is a good segue. So many people are like, how do you deal with the haters? So many people aren't putting out content. So many of you are not doing things right now because you're worried about people's feedback. And it drains you and it kills you. And somebody's saying you suck. You're ugly. You're fat. You're not smart. Shut the fuck up. Nobody cares. You were privileged. You had it easy. But it cripples you. Not me. I just don't know how to tell you. Not me. It feeds me. I love the love. You guys know. Even in the last episode I said compliments. I feed off compliments and I feed off hate. Now stop me. Put up Instagram. What up? What up? What up? Max? Is it ready? Tyler, people are waiting for DailyVee. Alright, we got our place for a sushi. Zero percent complaining. It's always good to see the VaynerPips in here. Nate, want to say hi to Jeff Cates? Are you guys friends? Or do you guys have a weird rivalry? No rivalry. You have zero rivalries? People in the office work for me. Yeah. Here's my take on that people. Zero rivalries means you're not doing it right. Put my coat on? You need rivalries, Nate. I have rivalries in life. Who's your biggest rival in your life? Me. You know two people back in the day who really like this. If you're watching, Andrew Agassinia and Jake Olby Essie were both my viewers. We all rivalries on the golf course. And now you guys are friends? Because they... Oh, if they're watching, you just assume everybody's watching now? Yeah. I appreciate the love. My rival Gary. Well then Jesse G here. Thank you. Alright, I'll see you later. Join us. Does he know DRock's joining us? Do you know DRock's joining us? Why DRock? Biggzonswind DRock. Bigger Nick Sloss. Yeah. Set up for the lottery. 10-11. Nick Sloss. Sushi time. It's called the transition cut.
