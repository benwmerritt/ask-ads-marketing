Um... Hey guys. I've been editing here for a while. Gary and I were talking and we figured we'd try something different. Um... Yeah, so... Here we go. Cause we're gonna be legends. Gonna get their attention. What we're doing here ain't just scary. It's about to be legendary. Here we're gonna be legends. Gonna teach you my lesson. Got this feeling in our souls we can't... What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life? How's it feel? Nah, not some shoulders. So see this thing in the back right here. This is going right into the back of his scapular stabilizers. They don't want this. They want this. Don't fucking hustle. Make something happen. Three hours of sleep and then go work out and go, oh actually not today. Seven hours. Got some sleep in Seattle but... I got some sleep in Seattle. I think that's supposed to go the other way. So, early morning here in Seattle. About to go pitch this kid. We're in the final two. It's exciting. You know, selling baseball cards and athletes on cardboard and now trying to sell them to work with me and then do baseball card and football card deals. So really amazing. You never know what your life's gonna take you. Super proud of AJ and Brian and Mooc and VaynerSports. We're having an incredible first year. Obviously you guys have seen the Jalen Leaves, Maven, Alvin Kamara, John Tote signings. These are second round pick type caliber guys. So it's a big first year coming out the gate. Exciting to document this journey when in three or four years we'll be looking back as one of the top sports agents in the world. Look at these early days. I wish we had this film on VaynerMedia when it was six of us in a conference room starting the company. That would be a real blast. So, gonna go in there. Show them the value. Like every business in my life, how do we disproportionately bring value to the other side of the table, right? And so in the wine world it was better wine than people were buying elsewhere at better prices. And now today it's showing these kids that we can help them on the field, off the field, and being a man after football. And so excited about it. Let's see what happens. Travel life. Just sitting here. Landed. Reading the comments of episode one and two. And then we're gonna go in there. And then we're gonna go in there. And then we're gonna go in there. Reading the comments of episode one, 21, and one, 20 of DailyVee. Just realizing that I always talk about comments being my oxygen. And as much as I love the love and the admiration and the daps, which are incredible. Thank you so much, guys. It's incredible how much I get value out of the insight. If you go read the comments on episode two. Right. There were people that basically said things like, I've been watching you for three years. Hearing you for three years. I didn't get how hard you actually work on it. One more time. This is gonna allow me to give away a enormous amount of free advice. Right. Whereas I could not do this. Yeah. Charge every... Do you know how many people have tomorrow I announced, I am no longer putting out contacts. Right. I am creating the Gary Vaynerchuk School Mastermind of Marketing. And it is $5,000 a month to get what you've been getting. Right. I know how much money I would make. Tens of millions of dollars. And you know, you always have those people that want to give feedback, critical feedback just for doing it as an outlier. It's not what I'm talking about because I taste that energy. I promise. Talking about the people that are just really giving insights to what they're being affected by, what they're seeing, what editing they like, which scenes they enjoy, what they're learning from the most. It's all about this. I'm so known for this. But it's all about this. This mother-fucking thing. This. Because the work I put into consuming you guys, not other videos or other people, but you, the end user, that's the secret that people haven't unlocked yet. The reason I don't consume anybody else's stuff. The reason I don't consume historical things. The reason I don't consume anything else. But you, is because more of what matters. I think the hundred really cool thing about creating content for NdiliV is that, Thank you. You too. You guys can influence all the content. Read your comments. Americans. There we go. We want your feedback. We love your feedback. Yeah, really appreciate it. It's weird. I'm an airport with a lot of people. Just finishing up NdiliV now. On your plane. I really commend Gary for putting the camera on. You're gonna be editing in the room? Yeah. Yeah.
