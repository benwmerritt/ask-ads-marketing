And most of all while I've got your attention. I love you guys. Thanks for all the love this Instagram storm over the last 10 14 days has been a whole lot of fun. It's brought a lot to me as much to me as it has for you. Oh and look I signed this shitload of books Oh What if I told you this was the last Monday morning of your life Mario Oh Alright Claire it's coming Claire One I Kyle Alex Peter. It's fun The one of the biggest reasons a lot of people a lot of people don't do things for the community like engage Or reply or make videos and reply Or do giveaways we have to sign stuff or two and three minute meetings 15 minute meetings for a peacetime or Shadow for the day Reason people don't do that is because it takes up time. I just landed from LA Got a lot of work done and which set up another five to six things that I have to take care of right now and This is gonna eat into those ten minutes that I just don't have and I need and and I I'm okay with that because I believe in it and it's what I want to do And it's how I give back to you guys for your attention and that's the value exchange and I'm cool with it, but boy Do most people not want to go there most people don't like the process They just want what's on the other side of it and especially when they make it they kind of want to Meet the benefits the thing for me is I'll never make it It's always gonna be a journey Right. I mean first and foremost I created a ridiculous journey Love how people don't really understand How all-time wealthy you have to be just to buy a football team so I put myself in a corner of trying to create one of those Situations and then I Went about it in a very tried-and-true way, which means for me by my definition that I I I'm trying to not only Goodbye the New York Jets Which would mean I'd have to become a billionaire, which is very difficult I'm doing it while I in parallel Give back Unlike a lot of executives and CEOs and entrepreneurs. They put 100% of their efforts towards their goal They Hunt everything else they do not give back to the entrepreneurial Community did not give back to the individuals In the world and through this new technology has happened. So the Titans the Mavericks She didn't have time and More importantly, she didn't have technology in 1950 to document like this 1960 document like this 1970 document like this 1980 document like this 1990 document like this Lloyd you got your book and so That's a that's what happened, right? So what I'm trying to do is really difficult in my mind and I enjoyed it or that which is giving back along the way while trying to achieve something ridiculous which is battling on two fronts, which is very difficult and And that's fine by me because truth is I wouldn't have it any other way. I don't want The New York Jets if I don't also Show the blueprint For the next guy and girl who want their New York Jets. I don't want it if I don't Give back to the game that's given me so much opportunity So I'm documenting this journey of building a honey empire of building the cleanest and best And not most passionate but truest community Of anybody online right now that's a big ambition of mine because I know I have an advantage for me That's a foregone conclusion because I want so little in return. I I know that I'm giving away a lot more than I'm asking for in return because When you're not asking for anything You're in a very very very good spot to me your attention and you picking me is more than enough I do not need to make $86 piece off of you in a ebook.
