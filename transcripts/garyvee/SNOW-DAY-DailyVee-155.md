Dude, there's so much shit going on. Macro, I'm from mom and casual, got a lot of ground like gravel, coming back around like lasso. Macro, like a vision boy, I see with clarity, I hustle like my name is Gary Vee. Sob, I've been telling you. Accounts are talking about equity, I'm trippin', they're giving the pedigree, they're meanin', I'm special, my specialty. I'm puttin' the work, tellin' them dirt and the earth, I'm movin', furniture to bev it. You feel that you can make it home. Gary, I just wanna say thank you so much for doing what you did last time when I went and it was a pleasure. Thank you very, very much. I didn't know how to thank you. My pleasure. Hand shakin' of thank you is more than enough. What you do on a slow day, you get a hit then. So what happened, you got some good... Yeah, just like five days came around. It's great. From a low, feelings, Brooklyn. Really? That's just a better view than... Really? Yeah. That's awesome. That's a sad road to get in. You're global, Manny. 435, thank that one guy, the fashion guy, and then this guy... No sugar, thanks, brother. Yeah, I'm just gonna go, yeah, I think it's good. Let's get me to the office. What, 430? 430 to like... And then just like, hand, you're team, like... Yeah. Yeah, agree. I'm gonna go to the American... So what about the flight tomorrow, am I booked on it? I'm gonna go to the American in the 3-Occintree now. How many people are at the office, you think? 4 of us, I think, are there... I would say, this is probably a portion of the flight. Good, okay. 440. I love snow days. I like when the world shuts down. Problem is, everything's global now, so... It's not really shut down. How's it going? Good? Just started? Yeah, we're gonna go to the... How many 60 followers? Better than zero. Yeah. I used to have 160 followers too. Everybody starts somewhere. Thank you. You're welcome, Manny. Good haircut always feels fresh. The beard. Should I have no money? I can't pay you, maybe. Oh, I can do credit card here, right? You don't want to pay me. Get the fuck out of here. That's no way. No way. No way. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's very nice. No. You're welcome, my friend. I think the biggest thing that we have to figure out is between MIU and... You know, are there any other friends of this? You know, like... How much can we get for free? Question. We built out the best social... I know that on the back end, if it's not tracking as well as they want... Oh, actually, you know what? Here's actually the right answer. If you're following this along, I think one of the things to keep in mind is to go a different route, which is... The fuck is best used to kind of make you guys crush it because we want to sell out, but keep this in the back of your mind as you allocate money. If it is not as successful, the things we'll learn in those two... Here we are three weeks later, and it's not selling as well as you wanted. Our paid efforts will give us indicators on what's working best, and we may be able to come back and say, look, let's spend some more money against these targets. Let's not take that for granted, and let's be like methodical. Exactly, exactly. One of the other things is I want to not only be successful in what we're doing for them, I want to be quite strategic creatively around pushing the boundaries so that maybe above and beyond actually succeeding in what the business KPI is has an opportunity to possibly be put on a pedestal by Facebook itself as best in class sports kind of video commercial of the year, which would then have impact on going forward, maybe even giving team leverage to signing a longer term deal with the clubs or things of that nature. So my ambitions for this video are extremely high because the upside is just so incredible to my business partners who own this. And so we need to really, really think in terms of innovative, not only does it have to be emotional, but much like the Sandy Hook PSA, I think it needs to shock people. We need to be smart and try to figure out how to really, really, really make an impact above and beyond. For me, really, the Holy Grail is not only does it succeed in driving awareness and sell, but that it beats out the best sports video marketing asset of the year in whatever circles to really bring the higher level as a brand. No, no, you have to dress like yourself. You own your thing. I was debating with a book coming out in January and a half to promote and just with the level of fame that I'm starting to build, that the deal was, like, I couldn't wrap my head around. I knew it wasn't a great deal, but I wanted to, but I really want to do this with him. Believing in me kind of drives me quite a bit. What I'm trying to accomplish here is to go through the process of business negotiation a little bit, but also make sure I don't make a disproportionately bad deal in case other opportunities come, but the fact of the matter is, and you know me for a long time, my energy is probably to smash the shit out of it so that is put into a position where they want to go crazy into me and that the success of it gives them the financial ability to go crazy into me going forward. That's kind of what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to get the financial ability to go crazy into me going forward. That's kind of the vibes. Cool? What does that mean in real life? Like, what are the f***ers gonna sell them for? Like, I assume small. Go ahead. Yeah, I mean everyone sort of thinks like a f***ing margin, so if they're retailing a f***ing asshole, they're not selling a f***ing... Right, but when you come out and say wholesale f***ing every retailer are gonna go at or are they gonna be the f***ing inser... I mean, what's the f***ing look like? I mean, the MSRP on Wine was 80 and bought at 40 and Wine Library sold at 41.99 because I was a f***ing savage. Let's have a proper profile on it, put up a piece of content and just keep it maintained so that we can continue to be on the offense. This is smart. This is just a good idea. Let's create, so let's do this. Let's create a framework for this conversation. Here's what I'd like to happen. I'd like to get a list of 10 to 15 things that we want the most. Feel good? Love it. The good news is I'm not too worried about it in a micro. Here's what I would say. Consumer insights that are smart insights are the gateway to the best creative. Hold on one second. What's up man? What's up man? How are you? Love your stuff. Thank you brother. My intent is that you get even more of that over time. Like brother, do you understand what the f*** is going on?
