You need water I just don't have a time I've been so you give them out. Yeah, she'll figure it's fancy It's a lot of cameras This is freaking me the fuck out Oh quiet so quiet Hey brother good to see you you well good to see you man Now you're an influence story you could say you're also a CEO you're an entrepreneur your business man How do you balance between your own personal brand and then you know being responsible to a company and employees and all that? I run my company. I'm the CEO of an 800 person 130 million dollar your business and that takes up all my time The Gary v. Thing is my side hustle. I have a team that records content in vlog form We use here who's right summer D Rock D Rock films We make a vlog in that we have 18 hours worth of content That's happening a lot of those turn into my medium posts a lot of those turn into my meme videos a lot of those turn into My my audio podcast. I don't have time to build a personal brand I don't have time I live my life as an entrepreneur and I don't win on being attractive or funny I win on being an operator and being right about things that are happening And that's just my day-to-day life and then we produce it at home, but I spend all my time Running my company and when I do public speaking that's business development for VaynerMedia It's a lot more fun to get a three million dollar scope doing a keynote at the A&A than being part of an RFP process That's just smart business Do what I did for the first 30 years of my life build a business that allows you to afford one You know like I look I think this year like I think a lot of people forget about my narrative because of my spiel in this in this genre I spent the first 15 16 years of my life building an actual wine retail business Before I even said one word to the world about my business thoughts I didn't come out the womb and say I'm an influencer I built an actual business and I talked about building businesses the thing I tell everybody in this room and people watching at home like Self-awareness is a big part of this as well You have to know what you're good at and what you're not good at the amount of people that have started video shows Because they hear video marketing is good, but they're scared to be in front of a camera and they're awkward. That's just not a good strategy It's not your normal place like you have to know yourself and so even though the mediums were there I could have been a blogger I just knew that I couldn't communicate very effectively in the writing format So I punted it kept building a business and then when short form Twitter when video for YouTube came out I'm like that I think I can do and that's what I jumped into I'm so much more old-school than they think 100% even even on stage I've got to be more simplistic than I like But you need to use their sort of crust yeah, exactly message across real nice to meet you take care So South by is going super well Just had a great client meeting Were you in the client meeting Comcast no great client meeting and Great keynote it seems like people are really enjoying it D Rock even liked it which is rare and exciting and I Didn't play super well in basketball. I didn't play well at all. That's right though I haven't been on the court for nine months gonna work on that and then um Get some Vayner Sports recruiting which was fun Can't show that Hey, Joe, how are you? I'm also a fellow New Yorker very nice Since back in the day when you were thank you brother your own good shit up on the tube. Thank you, man I actually follow you and snapchat. Thank you man. It's been crazy to see your evolution. Thank you Awesome, and I'm running late for something. I'm glad you said hello. Thanks. Good luck to you. Take care Yo What's up guys? Yes, yes, thank you real pleasure to meet you. How are you? Good no worries yo Back You guys hustling Fucking workers Like that. I love it. Yeah, let's do it He is a broke iPhone Take care yourself you too, man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Super busy, where are you Ben lair can't find you But I'm pushing practicality You know we've got eight years of a good economy like this world of ours and this is and I mean if you're here You're ambitious. You know what's going on in the new world your height You've got a lot of energy on its memorial your risk taker The problem is for when I look at this crowd There's so many young people who've never lived through the punch in the mouth. You know So after eight, you know after eight great years in our economy I just I want people to pay attention to actually making money, you know users and Engagement and followers those are you know lifetime value Cack all this stuff that people talk about in the startup and world is all nice and dandy But if your business is not making money each month and it's losing money You're not gonna be raising money when there's none out there and so I'm pushing practicality. It's boring But it's tried and true looking to acquire and something invest. What do you look at in this world in the South by world I look for the jockey over the horse So I'm looking at does she have the fire to change her business nine months in when the market changed on her So in startup land, it's hard Let me tell you guys how all to make money no joke if you're sitting on money Every person here should invest in Facebook and then when the world melts in nine months and the stocks in half And you hate me don't sell it just hold on because I promise you in nine years that investment's gonna return you a Fuckload of money. So that's the slow double or triple your money bet But that's kind of better than the fucking zero interest you get in the bank The the way to make crazy money is to only bet on the jockey because they've got a pivot They've got to adjust, you know the operator the pilot She and he is the one that's gonna dominate and win because the reality is These startups are so young and early like Facebook looks nothing like what Facebook looked like nine years ago He made a bunch of adjustments like this shit changes and you've got to be used to that spotify had to adjust Birch box has to adjust like like everybody's navigating and just raising capital or looking the part So I'm looking for somebody who can get punched in the mouth spit the blood out and move forward Again looking at the demo you have to be the architect and the plumber Right and the Mason and the garbage person like like the thing that I have a lot of pride in is I can come on and talk all High-level and then when somebody calls me to the mat like you did the reason I love you is I do a lot of shit And I just pontificate and nobody calls me to the mat We run out of time and I leave you called me to the mat I'm like, okay, and but what I'm excited about is that's my best moment because if you want to go into details I'll get so finite into that detail So to me the one thing I would pride myself in as you grow in your business as you grow The thing that I have the most pride in is VaynerMedia now has 800 employees Not one of them that works for me does as much actual social media as I do. I'm still by far And that's what but probably the biggest reason my side hustle is Gary V Is because it keeps me grounded in actually the doing of the shit that I'm doing and what happens to a lot of people as they Grow they get away from the work and they become a manager and then they don't know what the fuck they're talking about Ah How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you. Good man. Good to see you. Good man. Good man. I'm excited to do this Yeah, for sure I mean you're sitting down on the mat. Yeah, we're gonna go chill Yeah, what up, Envy? The Seema man. The Seema is always. How are you? Hard of boys. Still some trouble in Maine. Try it. Watch your head. Watch your head. He's still making some cash on the side flipping. He's doing that. He's making slime and selling slime. Yeah, slime's killing. That's killing. My sister, my daughter too. How old is he? He is 12 now. I'm just gonna correct him. All the 8 year olds. So he goes to school with this slime and he sells it. The other day he came home with $120. I had to check his back. I'm like, I'll sell him my... You're like, what are you slinging? He's like, slime, dad. Slime! I'm gonna just introduce everyone at the same time and then when I finish... Those are the ones I like, right? I haven't seen that kind of... That's not what you have. I didn't know what you liked. No, no, I didn't... It is the one I have. But it's a... It's so awesome. Real pleasure, man. Thank you. Remember, so you said, document. We did $40,000 in the next 90 days. People think I'm making up shit. You just gotta execute... All I'm saying is, it took a lot of sweat, right? My boy Vick is upstairs. Good shit's supposed to take work. I know, we gotta go. We'll talk later, bro. I just wanted to say thank you personally. That made me very happy. Thank you, brother. Thank you, guys. That one's closing. Closing? Closing? It's 2017. Let's go out and get some fucking money. Gary Vee? I fucked. That was perfect. I would say, let's go make some actual money, because shit's about to hit the fan, and making money is a very good strategy. It's a funny thing to say, but this, like, Salfi is loaded with people that are building apps and building theses, but don't know how to make money. Give it up for Gary Vee and Jared. Great job. You're gonna give it to Gary Vee. Oh, no. You can make some. I love you so much, man. Good stuff. Bye, guys. Alright. Let's go. You're welcome. What are you trying to get out of Salfi's Outlets? Why do you even show up? I show up for two core reasons. One, there's just a shitload of people here. Can I curse on for once? Nope. Okay, there's just a lot of people here. Just beep that last part. And just even having this and shaking hands and meeting people that you only get to see once a week, you only get to see once in a while. And two, a lot of my business associates congregate here. So I did 11 meetings today that would have taken me four months to schedule. And I did them all in one afternoon. So it's actually efficient for me to show up to Salfi. So people, like, sometimes confuse you being loud. I'm loud. And confident. I'm confident. With, like, being obnoxious or whatever. Yeah. So what scares Gary Vee? Like, you know, you go to sleep at night. What scares you? The health and well-being of my family. That's it. And that's what keeps you going. 100%. When it comes to business, I know that I'll end up being historically correct. I'm empathetic to somebody seeing me curse in a video like this or act too proud. And they'll be like, he's full of hot air. They're either going to be right or I'm going to be right in 20, 30 years. And I know what my intent is. I'm not trying to hurt anybody's feeling. I understand that my jerseiness might be too crass for somebody. But I'm not going to change who I am because of the way you see the world. I respect for the way you see the world. Have some for me. So you're about to share it with three other people. Okay. What do you pick? I would pick my two dead grandfathers because I never met them. And I would pick Randy the Macho Man Savage who also is dead because he's my favorite all-time wrestler. Last question. Yes. What was the last time you were humbled? Humbled every day. Humbled? Humbled. Okay. Being an entrepreneur is humbling 24, 7, 365. Don't get it twisted for all my bravado and all my ego. I live on humility because I'm losing every second. There's problems. I got 800, by the time I got off stage just now, I have 800 humbling moments in my phone right now. When you run big companies, you're humbled all the time. I love being humbled. I enjoy being humbled. That's part of the process. This week's going to be fucking insane. Why? Fucking Blizzard coming in Tuesday. You're speaking in it. You're not speaking. You're speaking in this app. Wednesday, Salt Lake City Thursday. All hands Friday. A ton of internal shit going on. He was supposed to be in Austin Tuesday. We cleared that out. So now we have a full day to work with. Yeah.
