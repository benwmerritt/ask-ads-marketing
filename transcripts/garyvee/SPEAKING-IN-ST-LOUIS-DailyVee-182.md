I'm like a business cat scan. Genuinely, I think it's the thing I do, but it's unbelievable. It's why I like Q and A. I can literally, like, it's the thing that most comes natural to me. Like, meh, meh. I'm from mom and casual. Got a lot of ground like gravel. Coming back around like lasso. Macro, like a vision boy. I see with clarity. I hustle like my name is Gary Vee. Top of motherfuckers. I've been telling you. Countdowns was talking about equity. I'm trippin' like I'm giving a pedigree. And me and I'm special, my specialty. I puttin' the work, tellin' I'm dirtin' the earth. I'm movin' furniture to travel. St. Louis, we're here. I don't have any cardinals on my fantasy team right now. That's concerning. Literally right here is where we lost one of our biggest clients. New guy came in, fired us, fucked face. No, I was on a call though. Oh well. Yeah. Good to see ya. Hi, Tyler. Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you. Thanks for workin' everything. How are you? Hey man, how are ya? You all good? See ya. Matt, it's Gary here. Pleasure to meet you man. Real pleasure. So next time you come. DRocklump's footage. Next time you come, it'll be a, it'll be a helicopter. I need to come to a Cubs Cardinals game and take Brandon. Yeah, I would love it. What? Brandon's my best friend. He runs Wine Library. Oh, he does. And he, he's a huge Cubs fan. I took him to Game 1 of the World Series last year. Because in eighth, in ninth grade, I promised him that the Cubs ever made the World Series, I'd take him to the first game. Yeah, you went. And we did it. I'm so pumped. We're gonna stop at one spot. So instead of basketball. You stayed up last year. Oh, yeah, I'm staying. I don't even take tile at all. I don't take, it's so funny. Everybody thinks like I'm a crackhead because of my energy. I don't, like, I don't, I don't even, like it's so intense. I'm so, it's so funny how I play out. Like I'm always the opposite of people. But like, I don't even take Advil. I'm used to being European old school. Like, the only things that go in my body are like tea. Coffee, I guess is the closest thing that I've got to anything. It's snow, but like, I don't take anything. No, nothing. Protein and fucking actual work. My body building up is exactly the same advice as my business building up. No shortcuts. Fucking mentally pounding through. Disciplined. Fucking eat shit. Fucking Rocky Balboa. Carry a boulder on your fucking head. In a mountain while it's snowing shit. The I passed an Uber twice. I don't know why I remembered it because I don't even watch TV. It was weird. I love it. Want to see me come back? Sure. Yeah, this is our pie chef. We got a little pie chef here. So what are you in town for? I'm giving a speech to EO and YPO. I don't know. You're on a macro kick. I got nothing. Yeah, I got nothing. I don't know. Yeah. Well, you make sure people are well taken care of. Yeah, no, we have good people everywhere. I love it. What do you guys want? Sandwiches or ribs or what do you guys want? Easy. You need the car? I have a feeling. I'm sorry, Jordan. I'm going to have to eat something. So I'll take some ribs because I'll just eat the meat. Yeah, you really fucked up the South By location. Put me directly in the ghetto. I like it though. Back to my roots. While everybody's at the Four Seasons, JW Mary, I'm fucking hilting it like a fucking boss. Where are you at it? We're staying in Hilton. It's just funny. It's just like an OG spot. There's all these great hotels now finally there. But Tyler, for some reason, doesn't use the resources around him like Phil and Nate and DeMeo. He just does shit on his own. And it's caused me a lot of pain. But it's learning. It's all learning process. No. No. I only want to answer the questions that people want to answer. Having questions that you want to ask to selfish, the key to a good speaker is to bring it to them. I think so. So no, whatever. I'll create a framework of like, that's what this talks about, right? I can talk about thematically stuff that's top of mind. But with a group like we have, it's real business talk, right? It's not like it's companies. It's good. It'll be good. Thanks a lot. Take care guys. I don't care. Can we get a picture? Of course. Uh-huh. Got it? Awesome. Thank you so much. Real pleasure. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah. Just so nice out. Yeah, I agree. Good. I didn't think I was going to eat these today. Hope we get the cross paths one day. I wish you nothing but the best, man. And that's it. So hope you have a great day. Totally get it. I agree with you. Not everybody hits everybody the same way. And I hope serendipity takes over and allows us to share beer one day. So maybe get a different perspective. Wish you nothing but health, bro. Thanks, man. Stay well. You know how to sell a t-shirt? I do, but not for a living. I just want the awareness. I'm not there for the economics. Like even the joke the guy said, do you make your money selling t-shirts? Like, swag or books or like, there's no economics in it. It's exposure. It's marketing. I mean, I don't want to lose money, and I'm thrilled to make some. But it's disproportionately not the interesting part of writing a good book. The interesting part of writing a good book is having somebody email you when something happens. Going to get good Mexican food. There's about 100 Mexican restaurants in here. So this is a very Latino-based neighborhood? Smells good. I love this smell. So this is the wood from the locker room? From the regular field. From this last year? Or two years ago? It was the wood. It was the wood in the locker room that was stopping them from winning a World Series. Yeah, we helped them. This is so cool. So there's a B2B and a B2C component? Right? Because this is the B2C stuff, consumer stuff? Yeah. Yeah, but we're like the after. This is old dugout wood from the Astros. And we turn it into, you know, probably not as much in New York, but a boot jack. Take your cowboy boots off. Not a big thing in New York, but definitely like, super smart way to like turn things into collectible utilitarian instead of just like the same old stuff everyone did. So does it take? I totally understand. It's actually very similar to my core thesis about marketing, which is buy nostalgic brands and make them modern. Take the old and make it extremely new. It's super interesting. That's cool. I'm glad we stopped by. Let's take one quick pass. What's going on with the bowling league? So I bring my guys over and we got it off in five minutes and now it's art. So this is this is all mostly storage and kind of random area. We've got our baby right here, which has helped us in a lot of unique ways is a role in UV printer. Just about anything. We can print those signs, for example, we can print like right now we're printing on leather. That turns us in really unique cool product. This part is wax, but we can even print on felt to make our own. And it's. Pretty cool. Who's the next anybody? That's what we got to build ASAP. That's what you got to do ASAP. Give that a lot of thought. That's how you'll win and that's how you'll lose. I love everything about that except that one piece. You know the best part is this exact kind of place. I'm aware. What do you think my first reaction was? I'm like a business cat scan. I'm like a business. Genuinely, I think it's the thing I do, but it's unbelievable. It's why like Q and A. I can literally like, it's just so, it's the thing that most comes natural to me. Like, I'm like, okay, this. It's pretty cool, right? I've never said that before. That's, it's so weird what just happens. What? You love this hood? So move it. That's where Boyd's from. Mike Boyd. One of my brother's best friends who works at Vayner, who's like a huge hip hop head. This is where David Lee's from. Basketball, bro. Hit up that then right now. Show him the Vayner rookies picture. Tell him to find them, interview them. That's probably, you know what? That's what we can do over the weekend. Go have them really interview them. Like get somebody charismatic to ask like, what did you know about Gary? Like get somebody to make. I have Emily interview him. Like what did you know about Gary? How did it happen? When did you see him? Did you contemplate not coming to see him? How did the interview process come? Maybe interview Andy and Alex Klein about how you gotta kiss a lot of Gary frogs to actually get a prince. Like a, you know, got it? Make a phone call, architect. Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. I'm really excited to be here. I see that there's three mics to be very frank. I have quite a bit of time up here and it's been allocated for 45 minutes of the talk and 45 minutes of Q and A. I'd like to pretty much inspire maybe even an hour of Q and A because I think the number one job of a speaker is to bring value to their audience. And I think in a world that we live in, a lot of my thoughts and thesis live online on YouTube and Facebook and you can get quite a bit of that. I see all of you have books so you get quite a bit there. I'll set a framework because I'm sure a lot of people don't know who I am or what I believe in. And hopefully to be very honest, actually how many people here are in B2B businesses? Raise your hand. Hi, please. Awesome. How about B2C startups to consumer? Raise your hands. Okay, so like I wanna really just get a sense of the audience so I can take the conversation in a certain direction. But as you can imagine, there's a lot of people that are in the audience. I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm sure you can. I'm sure you can. I'm sure you can. I'm sure you can. How many businesses in this room have an Alexa voice skill strategy for their business? I promise you, none. Yet 100 million Americans in three years will wake up and say, Alexa, give me my morning routine. And some local business is gonna be the one that gives the news, the weather, the sports scores. Why can't that be you? Why can't your sports shop be the thing that gives the local people of St. Louis their sports scores? And then every single morning, the whole goddamn town is thinking about your business. It can't be you because you wait. We're not on the offense. And so that's just three and four years away. And that's not something people don't even know what an Alexa Echo is. And the ones that do hear, their kids are using it 85% more than they are. Where do you think the world is going? There are parents in this room that are keeping their kids off of technology as if the kids are gonna live up in the caveman world. Like where do you think this is going? We're not going backwards. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let me grab this. What is one ninja trick used to vet somebody to be a Rockstar marketing employee? I believe in the, I got a good one actually, a little bit left field. I am a much bigger believer in firing than hiring. Like my whole life has been predicated on having good EQ and intuition. I think people are at their best when they're in interviews. You just can't get anywhere. They're like complete non-events, right? Like what's your biggest weakness? Oh, sometimes I just work too hard. Fuck you. So my biggest trick is actually not thinking I'm so smart in figuring it out. It's be optimistic, give trust instead of having it earned, hire them to the best of your capabilities, but then audit them aggressively always and get rid of them when they don't play either the honey or the empire part and in my world that is the kind of internal politics and HR skills and the skill of what they're supposed to do. People have so much pride. It's unbelievable how many people in this room have fake ego in how good they hire. So much so that they don't fire losers because they don't want that loss to smear their incredible hiring record. That's why most people build small businesses. And everybody, you know, let me just say something about this audience. I'm watching you. That was a really good reaction because a lot of you know that was real fucking truth right there. That was good. Guys, all of my stuff is psychotic. It's all humans. That's what we screw up everything. Like we're screwing it up. Like it's on us. You can't hire a 28, 42, 60 year old marketer and just outsource it to them when it's your business because you're never then gonna entrust them because you don't know the skill. That's why you're not doing new stuff because you don't know if she or he is right or wrong because you don't know. And instead, just go to Turks and Caicos and listen to three audio books and you're good. Like you'll have some foundation. It's crazy to me. It's crazy to me, but I love it. Like I'm so pumped a lot of you are gonna go out of business when the shit melts. No, I'm happy. Cause that's actual capitalism. That's actual meritocracy. That's how this goes. You deserve to lose. You've been complacent for 11 years. You're finished. You suck. I really focus on what I'm good at. HR, selling, strategy. And then I really leave everything else to other people cause I know maybe they won't be as good as me or as this at me, but I just know what I'm good at. And I will tell you like the reason I've been really successful at book writing is when I thought that I had to write the book, I didn't even consider it. When I reverse engineered what I was good at, which was talking my ass off and realized there were ghost writers that could help me do the other part, I got really good. You just have to be dangerous enough. I'm not a CFO driven entrepreneur, right? But I will buy the New York Jets for billions of billions of dollars. I just have to be dangerous enough to not allow my CFOs to put me out of business. So figure out what you need to be dangerous at. Check your ego at the door and quadruple down on your strengths. That is the historic nature of people that have built very large successful enterprises. Thank you for having me. Thank you. The brands have been commoditized, so they need the personal brand. Meanwhile, a lot of the umbrella companies they play within are handcuffing them on social because they're scared of regulations because they didn't read three sentences of the regulations. So that's what I think. Seaton Hall, baby. They beat Marquette. Let's go, Hall. It's the only college basketball team I've ever like. Really? The bandwagon run of 89. So fun. Small Jersey School going to the finals. 89 to like 94. Lightweight, but that 89 run was like magic. I was 14. NCAA, small Jersey School, final four. Like Crush Duke. Like, it was crazy. I'm sad to let us, let us always step forward. Start by the movies, they fed us all that all my life. I think you're crazy, baby. I think you're crazy. I will see you in the next life. Thank you.
