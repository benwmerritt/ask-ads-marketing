A little bit of a pissed off mood. I thought I could get some more things done tonight. I've been seeing signs, now I know my place. Right between the lines, reach you out of space. But now I know, but now I know. We can be 20% owners, 50% owners, or 0% owners here at the prices. And you make a lot of profit there. And then, but you have to make this $1.5 million investment for us to even consider this. What I'm saying is, if you're already massively ROI positive with the sponsorship, well then, if our product, as long as it's short term profitable, we're in a good spot. So just super excited about getting into a new genre, obviously now with the PureWow asset I'm playing in the publishing arm. And so deploying my talents on strategy and business against a huge platform, one of the largest female media sites. And I'm very confident that much like the wine business and the advertising business and the every business I touch, good things are going to happen. And so I'm really enjoying the intermingling and strategizing with Ryan, who's an incredibly accomplished CEO who took that from zero to what it is. And I'm excited for him to see the value that I'm providing in the way that I see the world and different strategies. I think a lot of times people zone in on my hustle as my differentiator. If you're deploying massive hustle against bad ideas, you lose. So I need to start, I almost downplay my strategic ability because I think that there's some natural talent in that and I want to give advice that is more controllable and I think work ethic is that. I just genuinely don't think you develop, you can get better strategically, but there's a lot of talent in it. So I don't go there, but it's a part of my equation. We didn't get here by accident. These were good ideas. It was a good idea to launch a second, it was a good idea to launch a website in 1996 instead of a second liquor store. 99% of the market launched a second liquor store. It was a good idea to take a lot of the money that was going to catalogs and direct mail and put it into Google AdWords. 99% of the market was doing catalogs. It was a good idea to start a wine show on YouTube and everybody told me I was crazy, even my inner circle, because what was the value of that? It was a good idea, idea and idea that I did that web show. I mean, I could go on forever. Have to Facebook for a series of meetings. And some biz dev. Then we're going to head down to San Francisco for a series of meetings. Catch up with some startups that I'm invested in and then head back up here and have some more meetings. Meetings, un-meetings, un-meetings. Still like the headphones? Still like. They've become one with my ears. I'm getting close to like just sleeping with them. I can't believe I'm speaking in Romania. Excited about that. I don't know if I've been to Romania. This is funny. 900 business professionals. One day. It's my mom behind this amazing hype video. They're going to let you like, I feel like a camera here, like feel so weird. You're going to have to at some point get out and get that big sign that says Facebook one hacker away. Do you see that sign? The main thing we walked in. It's so epic. I think it's very black and white. I think that I live in a world where my friends are the Warbeez and the Ubers and the Airbnb's and I wrote the first check in the Birchbox and I watched all these behaviors and it's working. It's the weirdest life. Like my calendar is so funny, right? I'll sit with a company that's gone from 0 to 130 million in revenue on the back of Facebook ads mainly or something else and then I go into another meeting and they're spending 50% of their money buying programmatic digital banners and they're like proud that they've gone digital and so we're having incremental conversations versus the actual conversation which is how in the world can we sit here in January 2017 and not understand that the behaviors that we're doing are not working when all the macro data shows that they're not working. It's not working. Space is struggling. CPG is getting... CPG, I'm just bringing it back to that. Just so you have empathy like everybody's got their own headaches. The channel conflict war of CPG and their retailers in the next 20 years is going to be insane. If nothing else, as big as your companies are, doesn't it make sense for you to do true A.B. testing and put real money behind something like whether you believe in Facebook or Twitter or whatever the hell you think. Snapchat, I don't care. Isn't it just interesting to find out if that's a truth? To me, that's been the big punchline. Like it's financially smart just to call their bluff. Nothing scares me, DRock. I'm the least scared guy you know when it comes to business. Hights, I'm scare shitless. You don't like rollercoaster? No, I hate them. Really? Yeah, I don't like them. What about a wall? I don't like a water park, though. I love water parks. I would do like roller... There's something that happens with water that doesn't scare... I'll go like are those really like wet and wild like... I'm fine, but on roller coasters, I don't like it for some reason. Maybe I feel more... I'm trying to figure out my more control. We've got like that's an important variable for me for continuation that we can like design and get things up within an hour. You know? Oh, I want my team to design. I want one of the three of us to design. Yeah, I don't know about that, but find out right away and get back to me, okay? Yes. Yeah, one of the three guys on the design team are going to do it. I'm going to have DRock text them right now. They're going to work. The design will be done within an hour. Okay. Bye. Wow, I didn't know that. You see that? Watch this. It stops it. What does? The air pods. I would take it out and I'll call the computer. I wouldn't be noticed. Got it. Got my technology. Best product since the iPhone itself. Cool. So I just want to say what's up and let you guys know that I'm about to do a 20 minute meeting giveaway with me on Instagram about to put up an important quote card, quote picture, and I'm recalling the 60 second club. So I highly recommend 2400 of you go and activate your notifications and I'm going to post in the next very short bit. I've a call in four minutes and then after that, so maybe in 19 minutes or so. What quote do you want? I don't know. I got a series. There's 20. I'm a little bit of a runner man. See you. See you. How are you? I'm a little wild. I only see you on your living your life through Instagram. John. John. Gary. Real pleasure. How are things? Too bad. Good. It's great to be here. I'm a little bit of a runner. I'm a little bit of a runner. Good. It's great to be here. Fire it up. How's it going? Good. We're hanging out there. Yeah. That's what we're going? Yeah. That's insane. He's like hit me up the other day. He's like, bro, he texted me. He's like, bro, I just put two eggs into a bowl and put it in June. Like, I don't know, the greatest dish of all time came out. Keep the magic. Yeah, let's hang the room and then we'll come back here in five minutes. Cool. See you in a second. See you later, D-Rock. Hey, guys. I'm here in June. One of the, actually, I think June was the first investment I made in the Boehner RSC fund because I made the commitment to you at South by Southwest and then I had to drag you out to actually give you the money because it took like four months longer to do my fund, my deal. You asked me for a favor. You're like, Matt, I've known you a long time. By the way, I claim, I'm the guy on Twitter, I'm Gary's iPhone, so that's my claim to fame. My life, not just in Paris. Just a life. That's my biggest claim to fame. But you were like, Matt, I've known you a long time. We are good for our commitment. I will invest. It's not going to come until like seven, eight months after it's supposed to. But I'm good for you. You know that. Please let this happen. And I did. We literally kept the rent open for you. I remember you were lost to fund and you were too at your word. It's true. So that's where I am right now. We're producing some content. It is pretty amazing and I think a lot of you will get it. Nice. Good to go. Yeah, we're all set. And AJ is obsessed with it. Like completely obsessed. I always think that you need to have a gateway product to get you into where the world's going. It's fascinating to me of how I tell some of my friends about June. I'm like, look, you need a June not just because you should be cooking your food more efficiently or you should be saving money over a one year period. But you as a human should start getting adjusted to the reality of the society. We're going to work and live within over the next three, four, five decades. And I actually genuinely believe the following just like I did about the iPhone which played out to be true. That people that work and interact with things like June or an Alexa or things of that nature are actually just going to have better lives over the next two, three decades because they're going to be faster movers into the smartification of all of our products. Yeah, no worries, mate. Love some of your work, man. Thank you, man. What's your name? I read James. James. I read, what was your book, Crush It? Crush It. Yeah, a couple of years ago. Thank you. And loved it. Thank you so much. It was real inspiration, honestly. Thank you, bro. Yeah, let's do it. And love your videos and everything. Thank you. You want somebody to take it? Yeah. Trouty's very good at taking photos. Camera, but yeah. Got a couple there. Good, good. How did the video go? Went really well. Nice. I can do the video thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your experience on that front. It's a real pleasure, man. Thanks for saying hello. I appreciate the kind words. Thank you. You're focusing manually or is the camera just not very good? The focus is really bad sometimes. Have you ever tried a Canon? Manually. Eat it, D-Wrek. I've got another one. Idea number two. And this is fucking the dick. I'm the least. I'm the least. I'm the least. I'm the least. Guys, honestly it's really big though. Yeah, you know this. Honestly. What'd you say? Oh, he's up. Guess what I came up with. Oh my god. I'm in there. One, Tyler just showed me. You'll get an email. You're approved for CS. That's all set. Number two. Cool. Same page. All right. Love you. See ya. Bye. When you learn how to turn the cliche 45 minute fucking meeting that all these fucking assholes are doing every day into, let me use the real data, into four minute phone calls, you win. But you're way worse than AJ. I remember AJ's feedback. We actually have a ranking system of every human being. We have a CRM of people pick up basketball skills. That's basically how we judge people. Like you and my phone, it says Matt Van Horne, but you know we're a company, instead it just says F minus basketball player. Airbods, the best. The single best product since the iPhone. I literally said best product 10 years. I keep repeating this to everyone. I was like, you look stupid as shit. I think I tweeted that today. Best product since the iPhone itself. I can't. It's so useful. It's been so much better than you anticipated. They nailed it. The cereal, I just saw D-Rock Snapchat. Yep. Or, and I was like, I live right here, so. It was an hour ago too, so I was like, I didn't know if I'd see you, but. I'm gonna go try and hunt down Mr. Gary Vaynerchuk. Hey Gary. This is a cereal man. I was like, I didn't know if I'd see you, but oh my God, I have to snap this too. No worries. Hell yeah. Put up Snapchat. Let's go, hi guys. Real pleasure man. Let's do this too. What's your name? Bilavu. Bilavu, real pleasure man. Thanks for the love. Thanks. I used to work at Deloitte Digital doing all kinds of emerging tech stuff. Really hot on VR. Watched a lot of your videos. I run my own small studio making money, having a good time man. Thank you so much for the inspiration. My pleasure. I can't wait to see where it goes. And I know you've been talking about it, but you kind of stopped covering it after a bit. I haven't flow. It's very much top of mind. You've also heard me say that I think VR consumer's gonna be a little bit longer than a lot of my friends think, but it's coming. It's a long play obviously. It's a long play. But it's the next big computing cloud. It is the thing that will arbitrage the internet itself. Thank you so much man. Man, continued success. Thank you. Best of luck. Take care. See you brother. We're this way. That's why I'm really trying to figure out how this all plays out, because I'm not gonna be somebody that people are excited to meet because I can hit a baseball 500 feet, or because I'm a smoke show and gorgeous. Or I get it, but I'm hoping. That's emerging a little bit. But it's because I'm doing a good, like it's different. It's different. It's different. And most people that do what I do that's different charge people for it. And so when you take the compounded, I understand distribution in today's world better than most. I'm charismatic enough and a good enough communicator to pull it off. My intent is pure as fuck. I'm not asking for anything in return. And it's predicated on something that makes your life way better. That's why I'm like, fuck, this is gonna get surreal. I think. Hey guys. We welcome everybody. Okay, April. Thank you, Sue. So then, this office space, we've got this section here, and we've got that section there. So we've got, this is the data science tech, and we've got sales and accounting. I'm Gary Vaynerchuk, I'm the disproportionate worst student here. I went to Mount Ida College. I desperately tried not to go to college, but my mom wouldn't let me pull that off. This is the biggest investment I've ever made in a company, period. So, what I've framed my company VaynerMedia, which is 700 people at this point, five offices, four offices really, is a honey empire. And I think that's where you're actually building. You're building the tool that I need to build my honey empire. A honey empire is a company that wants to destroy every single company it competes with, because it wants to be an empire, and it wants to do it by making people feel awesome, and by empowering their teammates, and by starting with honey instead of vinegar. I think HR is offense. I think 99.9% of people think of HR as defense. My greatest boo moment of speaking was when I took the stages out by Southwest, and shortly after Steve Jobs died, I said, fuck Steve Jobs, I have no aspiration to be like him, because I did not like the way he treated other people. And I feel that you can build a trillion dollar company by treating people phenomenally well, and that honey always beats vinegar. And then times like this in our world, that a lot of my friends on certain political issues are unfortunately disappointing me at a scale that I didn't expect, because they're deploying vinegar to go after vinegar, and it's honey that always wins. And so I was super passionate to be involved in this company. I have no idea if IQ wins. I really don't. I desperately hope so for all of you and me. Desperate. The company that looks like IQ in 2024 that wins is one of the biggest companies in the world. Period. Because it's tens and tens and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars that are saved, and companies are empires, and they care about that. And it's honey. It makes people feel good. The number two person in my company is our chief heart officer. We don't even call HRHR, what do we call it? Pet? People in experience. People in experience. I don't care, as long as it wasn't called HR, because everybody has it branded this way. There's no company that I'm involved with that the people go around the room and say the things that hit me in my heart. They hit me in my wallet, they hit me in my brain, they hit me in my competitive spirit, they hit me in my salesmanship, they don't hit me in my soul. This is super what it's about for me. And I've been doing this in a non-scalable way. Like in 2009, I would look at my employees' Twitter accounts and give them tickets to, unfortunately, the Cardinals in this scenario, and give them tickets to a Cardinals game. And I promise you, who still works at our company, I think if I gave them a four times financial raise versus those tickets, it wouldn't have had anywhere close to the impact. People want to be heard and cared for. That's why big data synthesized properly at scale is the ultimate. So I'm excited, cool. Okay, that's great. Take care, sir. I've been seeing signs, now I know my place. We're between the lines, reach you out of space. But now I know where you go. Jeremy's gonna buy the dress. I'm just trying to buy a Range Rover. We're in the goals, but I know that I'm touching the sky. So when I say that I'm ready, just know that I'm willing to cause a disaster. This is the launch and I'm here in the count. Well, I'm headed up like I'm an ass. I'm ready, I'm ready. I've been on the come up. I see that I'm ready to charge. But I know I gotta be careful cause I do not want to fall star. I'm ready to go to any place I haven't been already before. Got a verbal machete to show anybody heavy. If you want to go and fiddle up a heavier flow, run it steady, I know. And that's where to anybody in the world that don't see. Had a very buddy out here. I'm the only rapper that really wants to decree. I've been seeing signs. Now I know my place. Right between the lines. Reach you out of space. But now I know. But now I know. But now I know.
