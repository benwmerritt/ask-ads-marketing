I Just do I just genuinely do and especially it's easy for me because I know how this ends up Right like like if they're right like there's places to be cynical. There's things to be observing about there I don't think like people should blindly whatever but if you've got that much pain in you, you know like For me, I always feel bad for my commenters because they're gonna lose historically We're filming Biz Dev Sunday.
